                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2002), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 301.1  General provisions.

    (a) Purpose. This part sets forth the regulations of the Department 
of Commerce and the Department of the Treasury applicable to the duty-
free importation of scientific instruments and apparatus by public or 
private nonprofit institutions.
    (b) Background. (1) The Agreement on the importation of Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Materials (Florence Agreement; ``the 
Agreement'') is a multinational treaty, which seeks to further the cause 
of peace through the freer exchange of ideas and knowledge across 
national boundaries, primarily by eliminating tariffs on certain 
educational, scientific and cultural materials.
    (2) Annex D of the Agreement provides that scientific instruments 
and apparatus intended exclusively for educational purposes or pure 
scientific research use by qualified nonprofit institutions shall enjoy 
duty-free entry if instruments or apparatus of equivalent scientific 
value are not being manufactured in the country of importation.
    (3) The Annex D provisions are implemented for U.S. purposes in 
Subchapter X, Chapter 98, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTSUS).
    (c) Summary of statutory procedures and requirements. (1) U.S. Note 
1, Subchapter X, Chapter 98, HTSUS, provides, among other things, that 
articles covered by subheadings 9810.00.60 (scientific instruments and 
apparatus), 9810.00.65 (repair components therefor) and 9810.00.67 
(tools for maintaining and testing the above), HTSUS, must be 
exclusively for the use of the institutions involved and not for 
distribution, sale, or other commercial use within five years after 
entry. These articles may be transferred to another qualified nonprofit 
institution, but any commercial use within five years of entry shall 
result in the assessment of applicable duties pursuant to Sec. 301.9(c).
    (2) An institution wishing to enter an instrument or apparatus under 
tariff subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS, must file an application with the 
Secretary of the Treasury (U.S. Customs Service) in accordance with the 
regulations in this section. If the application is made in accordance 
with the regulations, notice of the application is published in the 
Federal Register to provide an opportunity for interested persons and 
government agencies to present views. The application is reviewed by the 
Secretary of Commerce (Director, Statutory Import Programs Staff) , who 
decides whether or not duty-free entry may be accorded the instrument 
and publishes the decision in the Federal Register. An appeal of the 
final decision may be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Federal Circuit, on questions of law only, within 20 days after 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (3) Repair components for instruments or apparatus admitted duty-
free

[[Page 8]]

under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS require no application and may be 
entered duty-free in accordance with the procedures prescribed in 
Sec. 301.10.
    (4) Tools specifically designed to be used for the maintenance, 
checking, gauging or repair of instruments or apparatus admitted under 
subheadings 9810.00.65 and 9810.00.67, HTSUS, require no application and 
may be entered duty-free in accordance with the procedures prescribed in 
Sec. 301.10.
    (d) Authority and delegations. The Act authorizes the Secretaries of 
Commerce and the Treasury to prescribe joint regulations to carry out 
their functions under U.S. Note 6, Subchapter X, Chapter 98, HTSUS. The 
Secretary of the Treasury has delegated authority to the Assistant 
Secretary for Enforcement, who has retained rulemaking authority and 
further delegated administration of the regulations to the Commissioner 
of the U.S. Customs Service. The authority of the Secretary of Commerce 
has been delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration 
who has retained rulemaking authority and further delegated 
administration of the regulations to the Director of the Statutory 
Import Programs Staff.

[47 FR 32517, July 28, 1982; 47 FR 34368, Aug. 9, 1982, as amended at 66 
FR 28832, May 25, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 301.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of these regulations and the forms used to 
implement them:
    (a) Director means the Director of the Statutory Import Programs 
Staff, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.
    (b) Customs means the U.S. Customs Service and the ``The 
Commissioner'' means Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, or the 
official(s) designated to act on the Commissioner's behalf.
    (c) Customs Port or the Port means the port where a particular claim 
has been or will be made for duty-free entry of a scientific instrument 
or apparatus under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.
    (d) Entry means entry of an instrument into the Customs territory of 
the United States for consumption or withdrawal of an instrument from a 
Customs bonded warehouse for consumption.
    (e) United States includes only the several States, the District of 
Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (f) Instrument means instruments and apparatus specified in U.S. 
Note 6(a), Subchapter X, Chapter 98, HTSUS. A combination of basic 
instrument or apparatus and accompanying accessories shall be treated as 
a single instrument provided that, under normal commercial practice, 
such combination is considered to be a single instrument and provided 
further that the applicant has ordered or, upon favorable action on its 
application, firmly intends to order the combination as a unit. The term 
``instrument'' also covers separable components of an instrument that 
are imported for assembly in the United States in such instrument where 
that instrument, due to its size, cannot feasibly be imported in its 
assembled state. The components, as well as the assembled instrument 
itself, must be classifiable under the tariff provisions listed in U.S. 
Note 6(a), Subchapter X, Chapter 98, HTSUS. See paragraph (k) of this 
section and Sec. 301.3(f). Unless the context indicates otherwise, 
instrument or apparatus shall mean a foreign ``instrument or apparatus'' 
for which duty-free entry is sought under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS. 
Spare parts typically ordered and delivered with an instrument are also 
considered part of an instrument for purposes of these regulations. The 
term ``instruments'' shall not include:
    (1) Materials or supplies used in the operation of instruments and 
apparatus such as paper, cards, tapes, ink, recording materials, 
expendable laboratory materials, apparatus that loses identity or is 
consumed by usage or other materials or supplies.
    (2) Ordinary equipment for use in building construction or 
maintenance; or equipment for use in supporting activities of the 
institution, such as its administrative offices, machine shops, 
libraries, centralized computer facilities, eating facilities, or 
religious facilities; or support equipment such as copying machines, 
glass working apparatus and film processors.

[[Page 9]]

    (3) General purpose equipment such as air conditioners, electric 
typewriters, electric drills, refrigerators.
    (4) General-purpose computers. Accessories to computers which are 
not eligible for duty-free treatment are also ineligible. Scientific 
instruments containing embedded computers which are to be used in a 
dedicated process or in instrument control, as opposed to general data 
processing or computation, are, however, eligible for duty-free 
consideration.
    (5) Instruments initially imported solely for testing or review 
purposes which were entered under bond under subheading 9813.00.30, 
HTSUS, subject to the provisions of U.S. Note 1(a), Subchapter XIII, 
Chapter 98, HTSUS, and must be exported or destroyed within the time 
period specified in that U.S. Note.
    (g) Domestic instrument means an instrument which is manufactured in 
the United States. A domestic instrument need not be made exclusively of 
domestic components or accessories.
    (h) Accessory has the meaning which it has under normal commercial 
usage. An accessory, whether part of an instrument or an attachment to 
an instrument, adds to the capability of an instrument. An accessory for 
which duty-free entry is sought under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS shall 
be the subject of a separate application when it is not an accompanying 
accessory. The existing instrument, for which the accessory is being 
purchased, may be domestic or, if foreign, it need not have entered duty 
free under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.
    (i) Accompanying accessory means an accessory for an instrument that 
is listed as an item in the same purchase order and that is necessary 
for accomplishment of the purposes for which the instrument is intended 
to be used.
    (j) Ancillary equipment means an instrument which may be 
functionally related to the foreign instrument but is not operationally 
linked to it. Examples of ancillary equipment are vacuum evaporators or 
ultramicrotomes, which can be used to prepare specimens for electron 
microscopy. Further, equipment which is compatible with the foreign 
instrument, but is also clearly compatible with similar domestic 
instruments, such as automatic sampling equipment sold for use with a 
variety of mass spectrometers, will be treated as ancillary equipment. A 
separate application will be required for ancillary equipment even if 
ordered with the basic instrument.
    (k) Components of an instrument means parts or assemblies of parts 
which are substantially less than the instrument to which they relate. A 
component enables an instrument to function at a specified minimum 
level, while an accessory adds to the capability of an instrument. 
Applications shall not be accepted for components of instruments that 
did not enter duty-free under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS or for 
components of instruments being manufactured or assembled by a 
commercial firm or entity in the U.S. In determining whether an item is 
a component ineligible for duty-free consideration or an accessory 
eligible for such consideration, Customs shall take into account such 
factors as the item's complexity, novelty, degree of integration and 
pertinency to the research purposes to be performed by the instrument as 
a whole. The above notwithstanding, separable components of some 
instruments may be eligible for duty-free treatment. See paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (l) Produced for stock means an instrument which is manufactured, on 
sale and available from a stock.
    (m) Produced on order means an instrument which a manufacturer lists 
in current catalog literature and is able and willing to produce and 
have available without unreasonable delay to the applicant.
    (n) Custom-made means an instrument which a manufacturer is willing 
and able to make to purchaser's specifications. Instruments resulting 
from a development effort are treated as custom-made for the purposes of 
these regulations. Also, a special-order variant of a produced on order 
instrument, with significant modifications specified by the applicant, 
may be treated as custom-made.
    (o) Same general category means the category in which an instrument 
is customarily classified in trade directories and product-source lists, 
e.g., scanning electron microscope, mass

[[Page 10]]

spectrometer, light microscope, x-ray spectrometer.
    (p) Comparable domestic instrument means a domestic instrument 
capable or potentially capable of fulfilling the applicant's technical 
requirements or intended uses, whether or not in the same general 
category as the foreign instrument.
    (q) Specifications means the particulars of the structural, 
operational and performance characteristics or capabilities of a 
scientific instrument.
    (r) Guaranteed specifications are those specifications which are an 
explicit part of the contractual agreement between the buyer and the 
seller (or which would become part of the agreement if the buyer 
accepted the seller's offer), and refer only to the minimum and 
routinely achievable performance levels of the instrument under 
specified conditions. If a capability is listed or quoted as a range 
(e.g., ``5 to 10 nanometers'') or as a minimum that may be exceeded 
(e.g., ``5 angstroms or better''), only the inferior capability may be 
considered the guaranteed specification. Evidence that specifications 
are ``guaranteed'' will normally consist of their being printed in a 
brochure or other descriptive literature of the manufacturer; being 
listed in a purchase agreement upon which the purchase is conditioned; 
or appearing in a manufacturer's formal response to a request for quote. 
If, however, no opportunity to submit a bid was afforded the domestic 
manufacturer or if, for any other reason, comparable guaranteed 
specifications of the foreign and domestic instruments do not appear on 
the record, other evidence relating to a manufacturer's ability to 
provide an instrument with comparable specifications may, at the 
discretion of the Director, be considered in the comparison of the 
foreign and domestic instruments' capabilities. Performance results on a 
test sample run at the applicant's request may be cited as evidence for 
or against a guaranteed specification.
    (s) Pertinent specifications are those specifications necessary for 
the accomplishment of the specific scientific research or science-
related educational purposes described by the applicant. Specifications 
of features (even if guaranteed) which afford greater convenience, 
satisfy personal preferences, accommodate institutional commitments or 
limitations, or assure lower costs of acquisition, installation, 
operation, servicing or maintenance are not pertinent. For example, a 
design feature, such as a small number of knobs or controls on an 
instrument primarily designed for research purposes, would be a 
convenience. The ability to fit an instrument into a small room, when 
the required operations could be performed in a larger room, would be 
either a cost consideration or a matter of convenience and not a 
pertinent specification. In addition, mere difference in design (which 
would, for example, broaden the educational experience of students but 
not provide superior scientific capability) would not be pertinent. 
Also, characteristics such as size, weight, appearance, durability, 
reliability, complexity (or simplicity), ease of operation, ease of 
maintenance, productivity, versatility, ``state of the art'' design, 
specific design and compatibility with currently owned or ordered 
equipment are not pertinent unless the applicant demonstrates that the 
characteristic is necessary for the accomplishment of its scientific 
purposes.

Sec. 301.3  Application for duty-free entry of scientific instruments.

    (a) Who may apply. An applicant for duty-free entry of an instrument 
under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS must be a public or private nonprofit 
institution which is established for educational or scientific purposes 
and which has placed a bona fide order or has a firm intention to place 
a bona fide order for a foreign instrument within 60 days following a 
favorable decision on the institution's application.
    (b) Application forms. Applications must be made on form ITA-338P 
which may be obtained from the Statutory Import Programs Staff, 
International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Washington, DC

[[Page 11]]

20230, or from the various District Offices of the U.S. Department of 
Commerce. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control 
number 0625-0037.)
    (c) Where to apply. Applications must be filed with the U.S. Customs 
Service, Department of the Treasury, at the address specified on page 1 
of the form.
    (d) Five copies of the form, including relevant supporting 
documents, must be submitted. One of these copies shall be signed in the 
original by the person in the applicant institution under whose 
direction and control the foreign instrument will be used and who is 
familiar with the intended uses of the instrument. The remaining four 
copies of the form may be copies of the original. Attachments should be 
fully identified and referenced to the question(s) on the form to which 
they relate.
    (e) A single application (in the requisite number of copies) may be 
submitted for any quantity of the same type or model of foreign 
instrument provided that the entire quantity is intended to be used for 
the same purposes and provided that all units are included on a single 
purchase order. A separate application shall be submitted for each 
different type or model or variation in the type or model of instrument 
for which duty-free entry is sought even if covered by a single purchase 
order. Orders calling for multiple deliveries of the same type or model 
of instrument over a substantial period of time may, at the discretion 
of the Director, require multiple applications.
    (f) An application for components of an instrument to be assembled 
in the United States as described in Sec. 301.2(f) may be filed provided 
that all of the components for the complete, assembled instrument are 
covered by, and fully described in, the application. See also 
Sec. 301.2(k).
    (g) Failure to answer completely all questions on the form in 
accordance with the instructions on the form or to supply the requisite 
number of copies of the form and supporting documents may result in 
delays in processing of the application while the deficiencies are 
remedied, return of the application without processing, or denial of the 
application without prejudice to resubmission. Any questions on these 
regulations or the application form should be addressed to the Director.

Sec. 301.4  Processing of applications by the Department of the Treasury (U.S. Customs Service).

    (a) Review and determination. The Commissioner shall date each 
application when received by Customs. If the application appears to be 
complete, the Commissioner shall determine:
    (1) Whether the institution is a nonprofit private or public 
institution established for research and educational purposes and 
therefore authorized to import instruments into the U.S. under 
subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS. In making this determination, the 
Commissioner may require applicants to document their eligibility under 
this paragraph;
    (2) Whether the instrument or apparatus falls within the classes of 
instruments eligible for duty-free entry consideration under subheading 
9810.00.60, HTSUS. For eligible classes, see U.S. Note 6(a), Subchapter 
X, Chapter 98, HTSUS; and
    (3) Whether the instrument or apparatus is for the exclusive use of 
the applicant institution and is not intended to be used for commercial 
purposes. For the purposes of this section, commercial uses would 
include, but not necessarily be limited to: Distribution, lease or sale 
of the instrument by the applicant institution; any use by, or for the 
primary benefit of, a commercial entity; or use of the instrument for 
demonstration purposes in return for a fee, price discount or other 
valuable consideration. Evaluation, modification or testing of the 
foreign instrument, beyond normal, routine acceptance testing and 
calibration, to enhance or expand its capabilities primarily to benefit 
the manufacturer in return for a discount or other valuable 
consideration, may be considered a commercial benefit. In making the 
above determination, the Commissioner may consider, among other things, 
whether the results of any research to be performed with the instrument 
will be fully and timely made

[[Page 12]]

available to the public. For the purposes of this section, use of an 
instrument for the treatment of patients is considered noncommercial.

If any of the Commissioner's determinations is in the negative, the 
application shall be found to be outside the scope of the Act and shall 
be returned to the applicant with a statement of the reason(s) for such 
findings.

    (b) Forwarding of applications to the Department of Commerce. If the 
Commissioner finds the application to be within the scope of the Act and 
these regulations, the Commissioner shall (1) assign a number to the 
application and (2) forward one copy to the Secretary of the Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS), and two copies, including the one 
that has been signed in the original, to the Director. The Commissioner 
shall retain one copy and return the remaining copy to the applicant 
stamped ``Accepted for Transmittal to the Department of Commerce.'' The 
applicant shall file the stamped copy of the form with the Port when 
formal entry of the article is made. If entry has already occurred under 
a claim of subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS , the applicant (directly or 
through his/her agent) shall at the earliest possible date supply the 
stamped copy to the Port. Further instructions for entering instruments 
are contained in Sec. 301.8 of the regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 301.5  Processing of applications by the Department of Commerce.

    (a) Public notice and opportunity to present views. (1) Within 5 
days of receipt of an application from the Commissioner, the Director 
shall make a copy available for public inspection during ordinary 
business hours of the Department of Commerce. Unless the Director 
determines that an application has deficiencies which preclude 
consideration on its merits (e.g., insufficient description of intended 
purposes to rule on the scientific equivalency of the foreign instrument 
and potential domestic equivalents), he shall publish in the Federal 
Register a notice of the receipt of the application to afford all 
interested persons a reasonable opportunity to present their views with 
respect to the question ``whether an instrument or apparatus of 
equivalent scientific value for the purpose for which the article is 
intended to be used is being manufactured in the United States.'' The 
notice will include the application number, the name and address of the 
applicant, a description of the instrument(s) for which duty-free entry 
is requested, the name of the foreign manufacturer and a brief summary 
of the applicant's intended purposes extracted from the applicant's 
answer to question 7 of the application. In addition, the notice shall 
specify the date the application was accepted by the Commissioner for 
transmittal to the Department of Commerce.
    (2) If the Director determines that an application is incomplete or 
is otherwise deficient, he may request the applicant to supplement the 
application, as appropriate, prior to publishing the notice of 
application in the Federal Register. Supplemental information/material 
requested under this provision shall be supplied to the Director in two 
copies within 20 days of the date of the request and shall be subject to 
the certification on the form. Failure to provide the requested 
information on time shall result in a denial of the application without 
prejudice to resubmission pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) Requirement for presentation of views (comments) by interested 
persons. Any interested person or government agency may make written 
comments to the Director with respect to the question whether an 
instrument of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which 
the foreign instrument is intended to be used, is being manufactured in 
the United States. Except for comments specified in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, comments should be in the form of supplementary answers to 
the applicable questions on the application form. Comments must be 
postmarked no later than 20 days from the date on which the notice of 
application is published in the Federal Register. In order to be 
considered, comments and related attachments must be submitted to the 
Director in duplicate; shall state the name, affiliation and address of 
the person submitting the comment; and shall

[[Page 13]]

specify the application to which the comment applies. In order to 
preserve the right to appeal the Director's decision on a particular 
application pursuant to Sec. 301.6 of these regulations, a domestic 
manufacturer or other interested person must make timely comments on the 
application. Separate comments should be supplied on each application in 
which a person has an interest. However, brochures, pamphlets, printed 
specifications and the like, included with previous comments, if 
properly identified, may be incorporated by reference in subsequent 
comments.
    (4) Comments by domestic manufacturers. Comments of domestic 
manufacturers opposing the granting of an application should:
    (i) Specify the domestic instrument considered to be scientifically 
equivalent to the foreign article for the applicant's specific intended 
purposes and include documentation of the domestic instrument's 
guaranteed specifications and date of availability.
    (ii) Show that the specifications claimed by the applicant in 
response to question 8 to be pertinent to the intended purpose can be 
equaled or exceeded by those of the listed domestic instrument(s) 
whether or not it has the same design as the foreign instrument; that 
the applicant's alleged pertinent specifications should not be 
considered pertinent within the meaning of Sec. 301.2(s) of the 
regulations for the intended purposes of the instrument described in 
response to question 7 of the application; or that the intended purposes 
for which the instrument is to be used do not qualify the instrument for 
duty-free consideration under the Act.
    (iii) Where the comments regarding paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and 
(a)(4)(ii) of this section relate to a particular accessory or optional 
device offered by a domestic manufacturer, cite the type, model or other 
catalog designation of the accessory device and include the 
specification therefor in the comments.
    (iv) Where the justification for duty-free entry is based on 
excessive delivery time, show whether:
    (A) The domestic instrument is as a general rule either produced for 
stock, produced on order, or custom-made and;
    (B) An instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value to the 
article, for the purposes described in response to question 7, could 
have been produced and delivered to the applicant within a reasonable 
time following the receipt of the order.
    (v) Indicate whether the applicant afforded the domestic 
manufacturer an opportunity to furnish an instrument or apparatus of 
equivalent scientific value to the article for the purposes described in 
response to question 7 and, if such be the case, whether the applicant 
issued an invitation to bid that included the technical requirements of 
the applicant.
    (5) Untimely comments. Comments must be made on a timely basis to 
ensure their consideration by the Director and the technical 
consultants, and to preserve the commenting person's right to appeal the 
Director's decision. The Director, at his discretion, may take into 
account factual information contained in untimely comments.
    (6) Provision of general comments. A domestic manufacturer who does 
not wish to oppose duty-free entry of a particular application, but who 
desires to inform the Director of the availability and capabilities of 
its instrument(s), may at any time supply documentation to the Director 
without reference to a particular application. Such documentation shall 
be taken into account by the Director when applications involving 
comparable foreign instruments are received. The provision of general 
comments does not preserve the provider's right to appeal the Director's 
decision.
    (b) Additions to the record. The Director may solicit from the 
applicant, from foreign or domestic manufacturers, their agents, or any 
other person or Government agency considered by the Director to have 
related competence, any additional information the Director considers 
necessary to make a decision. The Director may attach conditions and 
time limitations upon the provision of such information and may draw 
appropriate inferences from a person's failure to provide the requested 
information.
    (c) Advice from technical consultants.
    (1) The Director shall consider any written advice from the 
Secretary of

[[Page 14]]

HHS, or his delegate, on the question whether a domestic instrument of 
equivalent scientific value to the foreign instrument, for the purposes 
for which the instrument is intended to be used, is being manufactured 
in the United States.
    (2) After the comment period has ended (Sec. 301.5(a)(3)), the 
complete application and any comments received and related information 
are forwarded to appropriate technical consultants for their advice.
    (3) The technical consultants relied upon for advice include, but 
are not limited to, the National Institutes of Health (delegated the 
function by the Secretary of HHS), the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
Administration.
    (d) Criteria for the determinations of the Department of Commerce--
(1) Scientific equivalency. (i) The determination of scientific 
equivalency shall be based on a comparison of the pertinent 
specifications of the foreign instrument with similar pertinent 
specifications of comparable domestic instruments (see Sec. 301.2(s) for 
the definition of pertinent specification). Ordinarily, the Director 
will consider only those performance characteristics which are 
``guaranteed specifications'' within the meaning of Sec. 301.2(r) of 
this part. In no event, however, shall the Director consider performance 
capabilities superior to the manufacturer's guaranteed specifications or 
their equivalent. In making the comparison the Director may consider a 
reasonable combination of domestic instruments that brings together two 
or more functions into an integrated unit if the combination of domestic 
instruments is capable of accomplishing the purposes for which the 
foreign instrument is intended to be used. If the Director finds that a 
domestic instrument possesses all of the pertinent specifications of the 
foreign instrument, he shall find that there is being manufactured in 
the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific value for such 
purposes as the foreign instrument is intended to be used. If the 
Director finds that the foreign instrument possesses one or more 
pertinent specifications not possessed by the comparable domestic 
instrument, the Director shall find that there is not being manufactured 
in the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific value to the 
foreign instrument for such purposes as the foreign instrument is 
intended to be used.
    (ii) Programs that may be undertaken at some unspecified future date 
shall not be considered in the Director's comparison. In making the 
comparison, the Director shall consider only the instrument and 
accompanying accessories described in the application and determined 
eligible by the U.S. Customs Service. The Director shall not consider 
the planned purchase of additional accessories or the planned adaptation 
of the article at some unspecified future time.
    (iii) In order for the Director to make a determination with respect 
to the ``scientific equivalency'' of the foreign and domestic 
instruments, the applicant's intended purposes must include either 
scientific research or science-related educational programs. Instruments 
used exclusively for nonscientific purposes have no scientific value, 
thereby precluding the requisite finding by the Director with respect to 
``whether an instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value to 
such article, for the purposes for which the article is intended to be 
used, is being manufactured in the United States.'' In such cases the 
Director shall deny the application for the reason that the instrument 
has no scientific value for the purposes for which it is intended to be 
used. Examples of nonscientific purposes would be the use of an 
instrument in routine diagnosis or patient care and therapy (as opposed 
to clinical research); in teaching a nonscientific trade (e.g., 
printing, shoemaking, metalworking or other types of vocational 
training); in teaching nonscientific courses (e.g., music, home 
economics, journalism, drama); in presenting a variety of subjects or 
merely for presenting coursework, whether or not science related (e.g., 
video tape editors, tape recorders, projectors); and in conveying 
cultural information to the public (e.g., a planetarium in the 
Smithsonian Institution).
    (2) Manufactured in the United States. An instrument shall be 
considered as being manufactured in the United

[[Page 15]]

States if it is customarily ``produced for stock,'' ``produced on 
order'' or ``custom-made'' within the United States. In determining 
whether a U.S. manufacturer is able and willing to produce an 
instrument, and have it available without unreasonable delay, the normal 
commercial practices applicable to the production and delivery of 
instruments of the same general category shall be taken into account, as 
well as other factors which in the Director's judgment are reasonable to 
take into account under the circumstances of a particular case. For 
example, in determining whether a domestic manufacturer is able to 
produce a custom-made instrument, the Director may take into account the 
production experience of the domestic manufacturer including (i) the 
types, complexity and capabilities of instruments the manufacturer has 
produced, (ii) the extent of the technological gap between the 
instrument to which the application relates and the manufacturer's 
customary products, (iii) the manufacturer's technical skills, (iv) the 
degree of saturation of the manufacturer's production capability, and 
(v) the time required by the domestic manufacturer to produce the 
instrument to the purchaser's specification. Whether or not the domestic 
manufacturer has field tested or demonstrated the instrument will not, 
in itself, enter into the decision regarding the manufacturer's ability 
to manufacture an instrument. Similarly, in determining whether a 
domestic manufacturer is willing to produce an instrument, the Director 
may take into account the nature of the bid process, the manufacturer's 
policy toward manufacture of the product(s) in question, the minimum 
size of the manufacturer's production runs, whether the manufacturer has 
bid similar instruments in the past, etc. Also, if a domestic 
manufacturer was formally requested to bid an instrument, without 
reference to cost limitations and within a leadtime considered 
reasonable for the category of instrument involved, and the domestic 
manufacturer failed formally to respond to the request, for the purposes 
of this section the domestic manufacturer would not be considered 
willing to have supplied the instrument.
    (3) Burden of proof. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant 
to demonstrate that no instrument of equivalent scientific value for the 
purposes for which the foreign instrument is to be used is being 
manufactured in the United States. Evidence of applicant favoritism 
towards the foreign manufacturer (advantages not extended to domestic 
firms, such as additional lead time, know-how, methods, data on 
pertinent specifications or intended uses, results of research or 
development, tools, jigs, fixtures, parts, materials or test equipment) 
may be, at the Director's discretion, grounds for rejecting the 
application.
    (4) Excessive delivery time. Duty-free entry of the instrument shall 
be considered justified without regard to whether there is being 
manufactured in the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific 
value for the intended purposes if excessive delivery time for the 
domestic instrument would seriously impair the accomplishment of the 
applicant's intended purposes. For purposes of this section, (i) except 
when objective and convincing evidence is presented that, at the time of 
order, the actual delivery time would significantly exceed quoted 
delivery time, no claim of excessive delivery time may be made unless 
the applicant has afforded the domestic manufacturer an opportunity to 
quote and the delivery time for the domestic instrument exceeds that for 
the foreign instrument; and (ii) failure by the domestic manufacturer to 
quote a specific delivery time shall be considered a non-responsive bid 
(see Sec. 301.5(d)(2)). In determining whether the difference in 
delivery times cited by the applicant justifies duty-free entry on the 
basis of excessive delivery time, the Director shall take into account 
(A) the normal commercial practice applicable to the production of the 
general category of instrument involved; (B) the efforts made by the 
applicant to secure delivery of the instruments (both foreign and 
domestic) in the shortest possible time; and (C) such other factors as 
the Director finds relevant under the circumstances of a particular 
case.
    (5) Processing of applications for components. (i) The Director may 
process an application for components which

[[Page 16]]

are to be assembled in the United States into an instrument or apparatus 
which, due to its size, cannot be imported in its assembled state (see 
Sec. 301.2(k)) as if it were an application for the assembled 
instrument. A finding by the Director that no equivalent instrument is 
being manufactured in the United States shall, subject to paragraph 
(d)(5)(ii) of this section, qualify all the associated components, 
provided they are entered within the period established by the Director, 
taking into account both the scientific needs of the importing 
institution and the potential for development of related domestic 
manufacturing capacity.
    (ii) Notwithstanding a finding under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this 
section that no equivalent instrument is being manufactured in the 
United States, the Director shall disqualify a particular component for 
duty-free treatment if the Director finds that the component is being 
manufactured in the United States.
    (e) Denial without prejudice to resubmission (DWOP). The Director 
may, at any stage in the processing of an application by the Department 
of Commerce, DWOP an application if it contains any deficiency which, in 
the Director's judgment, prevents a determination on its merits. The 
Director shall state the deficiencies of the application in the DWOP 
letter to the applicant.
    (1) The applicant has 60 days from the date of the DWOP to correct 
the cited deficiencies in the application unless a request for an 
extension of time for submission of the supplemental information has 
been received by the Director prior to the expiration of the 60-day 
period and is approved.
    (2) If granted, extensions of time will generally be limited to 30 
days.
    (3) Resubmissions must reference the application number of the 
earlier submission. The resubmission may be made by letter to the 
Director. The record of a resubmitted application shall include the 
original submission on file with the Department. Any new material or 
information contained in a resubmission, which should address the 
specific deficiencies cited in the DWOP letter, should be clearly 
labeled and referenced to the applicable question on the application 
form. The resubmission must be for the instrument covered by the 
original application unless the DWOP letter specifies to the contrary. 
The resubmission shall be subject to the certification made on the 
original application.
    (4) If the applicant fails to resubmit within the applicable time 
period, the prior DWOP shall, irrespective of the merits of the case, 
result in a denial of the application.
    (5) The Director shall use the postmark date of the fully completed 
resubmission in determining whether the resubmission was made within the 
allowable time period. Certified or registered mail, or some other means 
which can unequivocally establish the date of mailing, is recommended. 
Resubmission by fax, e-mail or other electronic means is acceptable 
provided an appropriate return number or address is provided in the 
transmittal. Resubmissions must clearly indicate the date of transmittal 
to the Director.
    (6) The applicant may, at any time prior to the end of the 
resubmission period, notify the Director in writing that it does not 
intend to resubmit the application. Upon such notification, the 
application will be deemed to have been withdrawn. (See Sec. 301.5(g).)
    (7) Information provided in a resubmission that, in the judgment of 
the Director, contradicts or conflicts with information provided in a 
prior submission, or is not a reasonable extension of the information 
contained in the prior submission, shall not be considered in making the 
decision on an application that has been resubmitted. Accordingly, an 
applicant may elect to reinforce an orginal submission by elaborating in 
the resubmission on the description of the purposes contained in a prior 
submission and may supply additional examples, documentation and/or 
other clarifying detail, but the applicant shall not introduce new 
purposes or other material changes in the nature of the original 
application. The resubmission should address the specific deficiencies 
cited in the DWOP. The Director may draw appropriate inferences from the 
failure of an applicant to attempt to provide the information requested 
in the DWOP.

[[Page 17]]

    (8) In the event an applicant fails to address the noted 
deficiencies in the response to the DWOP, the Director may deny the 
application.
    (f) Decisions on applications. The Director shall prepare a written 
decision granting or denying each application. However, when he deems 
appropriate, the Director may issue a consolidated decision on two or 
more applications. The Director shall promptly forward a copy of the 
decision to each applicant institution and to the Federal Register for 
publication.
    (g) Withdrawal of applications. The Director shall discontinue 
processing an application withdrawn by the applicant and shall publish 
notice of such withdrawal in the Federal Register. If at any time while 
its application is pending before the Director, either during the 
intital application or resubmission stage, an applicant cancels an order 
for the instrument to which the application relates or ceases to have a 
firm intention to order such instrument or apparatus, the institution 
shall promptly notify the Director. Such notification shall constitute a 
withdrawal. Withdrawals shall be considered as having been finally 
denied for purposes of Sec. 301.7(c) below.
    (h) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the 
Director's discretion at any stage of processing to insert into the 
record and consider in making his decision any information in the public 
domain which he deems relevant.

Sec. 301.6  Appeals.

    (a) An appeal from a final decision made by the Director under 
Sec. 301.5(f) may be taken in accordance with U.S. Note 6(e), Subchapter 
X, Chapter 98, HTSUS, only to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit and only on questions of law, within 20 days after publication 
of the decision in the Federal Register. If at any time while its 
application is under consideration by the Court of Appeals on an appeal 
from a finding by the Director an institution cancels an order for the 
instrument to which the application relates or ceases to have a firm 
intention to order such instrument, the institution shall promptly 
notify the court.
    (b) An appeal may be taken by: (1) The institution which makes the 
application;
    (2) A person who, in the proceeding which led to the decision, 
timely represented to the Secretary of Commerce in writing that he/she 
manufactures in the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific 
value for the purposes for which the instrument to which the application 
relates is intended to be used;
    (3) The importer of the instrument, if the instrument to which the 
application relates has been entered at the time the appeal is taken; or
    (4) An agent of any of the foregoing.
    (c) Questions regarding appeal procedures should be addressed 
directly to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Clerk's 
Office, Washington, DC 20439.

Sec. 301.7  Final disposition of an application.

    (a) Disposition of an application shall be final when 20 days have 
elapsed after publication of the Director's final decision in the 
Federal Register and no appeal has been taken pursuant to Sec. 301.6 of 
these regulations, of if such appeal has been taken, when final judgment 
is made and entered by the Court.
    (b) The Director shall notify the Customs Port when disposition of 
an application becomes final. If the Director has not been advised of 
the port of entry of the instrument, or if entry has not been made when 
the decision on the application becomes final, the Director shall notify 
the Commissioner of final disposition of the application.
    (c) An instrument, the duty-free entry of which has been finally 
denied, may not be the subject of a new application from the same 
institution.

Sec. 301.8  Instructions for entering instruments through U.S. Customs under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.

    Failure to follow the procedures in this section may disqualify an 
instrument for duty-free entry notwithstanding an approval of an 
application on its merits by the Department of Commerce.
    (a) Entry procedures. (1) An applicant desiring duty-free entry of 
an instrument may make a claim at the time of entry of the instrument 
into the Customs territory of the United States (as defined in 19 CFR 
101.1) that the instrument is entitled to duty-free classification under 
subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.
    (2) If no such claim is made the instrument shall be immediately 
classified without regard to subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS , duty will be 
assessed, and the entry liquidated in the ordinary course.
    (3) If a claim is made for duty-free entry under subheading 
9810.00.60, HTSUS , the entry shall be accepted without requiring a 
deposit of estimated duties provided that a copy of the form, stamped by 
Customs as accepted for transmittal to the Department of Commerce in 
accordance with Sec. 301.4(b), is filed simultaneously with the entry.
    (4) If a claim for duty-free entry under subheading 9810.00.60, 
HTSUS is made but is not accompanied by a copy of the properly stamped 
form, a deposit of the estimated duty is required. Liquidation of the 
entry shall be suspended for a period of 180 days from the date of 
entry. On or before the end of this suspension period the applicant must 
file with the Customs Port a properly stamped copy of the form. In the 
event that the Customs Port does not receive a copy of the properly 
stamped form within 180 days the instrument shall be classified and 
liquidated in the ordinary course, without regard to subheading 
9810.00.60, HTSUS.
    (5) Entry of an instrument after the Director's approval of an 
application. Whenever an institution defers entry until after it 
receives a favorable final determination on the application for duty-
free entry of the instrument, either by delaying importation or by 
placing the instrument in a bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone, the 
importer shall file with the entry of the instrument (i) the stamped 
copy of the form, (ii) the institution's copy of the favorable final 
determination and (iii) proof that a bona fide order for the merchandise 
was placed on or before the 60th day after the favorable decision became 
final pursuant to Sec. 301.7 of these regulations. Liquidation in such 
case shall be made under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.
    (b) Normal Customs entry requirements. In addition to the entry 
requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, the normal Customs entry 
requirements must be met. In most of the cases, the value of the 
merchandise will be such that the formal Customs entry requirements, 
which generally include the filing of a Customs entry bond, must be 
complied with. (For further information, see 19 CFR 142.3 and 142.4 (TD-
221).)
    (c) Late filing. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this 
section any document, form, or statement required by regulations in this 
section to be filed in connection with the entry may be filed at any 
time before liquidation of the entry becomes final, provided that 
failure to file at the time of entry or within the period for which a 
bond was filed for its production was not due to willful negligence or 
fraudulent intent. Liquidation of any entry becomes conclusive upon all 
persons if the liquidation is not protested in writing in accordance 
with 19 CFR part 174, or the necessary document substantiating duty-free 
entry is not produced in accordance with 19 CFR 10.112, within 90 days 
after notice of liquidation. Upon notice of such final and conclusive 
liquidation, the Department of Commerce will cease the processing of any 
pending application for duty-free entry of the subject article. In all 
other respects, the provisions of this section do not apply to 
Department of Commerce responsibilities and procedures for processing 
applications pursuant to other sections of these regulations.
    (d) Payment of duties. The importer of record will be billed for 
payment of duties when Customs determines that such payment is due. If a 
refund of a deposit made pursuant to paragraph

[[Page 19]]

(a)(4) of this section is due, the importer should contact Customs 
officials at the port of entry, not the Department of Commerce.

[47 FR 32517, July 28, 1982, as amended at 66 FR 28834, May 25, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 301.9  Uses and disposition of instruments entered under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.

    (a) An instrument granted duty-free entry may be transferred from 
the applicant institution to another eligible institution provided the 
receiving institution agrees not to use the instrument for commercial 
purposes within 5 years of the date of entry of the instrument. In such 
cases title to the instrument must be transferred directly between the 
institutions involved. An institution transferring a foreign instrument 
entered under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS within 5 years of its entry 
shall so inform the Customs Port in writing and shall include the 
following information:
    (1) The name and address of the transferring institution.
    (2) The name and address of the transferee.
    (3) The date of transfer.
    (4) A detailed description of the instrument.
    (5) The serial number of the instrument and any accompanying 
accessories.
    (6) The entry number, date of entry, and port of entry of the 
instrument.
    (b) Whenever the circumstances warrant, and occasionally in any 
event, the fact of continued use for 5 years for noncommercial purposes 
by the applicant institution shall be verified by Customs.
    (c) If an instrument is transferred in a manner other than specified 
above or is used for commercial purposes within 5 years of entry, the 
institution for which such instrument was entered shall promptly notify 
the Customs officials at the Port and shall be liable for the payment of 
duty in an amount determined on the basis of its condition as imported 
and the rate applicable to it.

[47 FR 32517, July 28, 1982, as amended at 66 FR 28834, May 25, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 301.10  Importation of repair components and maintenance tools under HTSUS subheadings 9810.00.65 and 9810.00.67 for instruments previously the subject of 
          an entry liquidated under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.

    (a) An institution owning an instrument that was the subject of an 
entry liquidated duty-free under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS, that 
wishes to enter repair components or maintenance tools for that 
instrument may do so without regard to the application procedures 
required for entry under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS. The institution 
must certify to Customs officials at the port of entry that such 
components are repair components for that instrument under subheading 
9810.00.65, HTSUS, or that the tools are maintenance tools necessary for 
the repair, checking, gauging or maintenance of that instrument under 
subheading 9810.00.67, HTSUS.
    (b) Instruments entered under subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS, and 
subsequently returned to the foreign manufacturer for repair, 
replacement or modification are not covered by subheading 9810.00.65 or 
9810.00.67, HTSUS, although they may, upon return to the United States, 
be eligible for a reduced duty payment under subheading 9802.00.40 or 
9802.00.50, HTSUS (covering articles exported for repairs or 
alterations) or may be made the subject of a new application under 
subheading 9810.00.60, HTSUS.

                 Subpart A--Watches and Watch Movements


<R05>
Sec. 303.1  Purpose.

    (a) This part implements the responsibilities of the Secretaries of 
Commerce and the Interior (``the Secretaries'') under Pub. L. 97-446, 
enacted on 12 January 1983, which substantially amended Pub. L. 89-805, 
enacted 10 November 1966, amended by Pub. L. 94-88, enacted 8 August 
1975, and amended by Pub. L. 94-241, enacted 24 March 1976, and amended 
by Pub. L. 103-465, enacted 8 December 1994. The law provides for 
exemption from duty of territorial watches and watch movements without 
regard to the value of the foreign materials they contain, if they 
conform with the provisions of U.S. Legal Note 5 to Chapter 91 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``91/5''). 91/5 denies 
this benefit to articles containing any material which is the product of 
any country with respect to which Column 2 rates of duty apply; 
authorizes the Secretaries to establish the total quantity of such 
articles, provided that the quantity so established does not exceed 
10,000,000 units or one-ninth of apparent domestic consumption, 
whichever is greater, and provided also that the quantity is not 
decreased by more than ten percent nor increased by more than twenty 
percent (or to more than 7,000,000 units, whichever is greater) of the 
quantity established in the previous year.
    (b) The law directs the International Trade Commission to determine 
apparent domestic consumption for the preceding calendar year in the 
first year U.S. insular imports of watches and watch movements exceed 
9,000,000 units. 91/5 authorizes the Secretaries to establish 
territorial shares of the overall duty-exemption within specified 
limits; and provides for the annual allocation of the duty-exemption 
among insular watch producers equitably and on the basis of allocation 
criteria, including minimum assembly requirements, that will reasonably 
maximize the net amount of direct economic benefits to the insular 
possessions.
    (c) The amended law also provides for the issuance to producers of 
certificates entitling the holder (or any transferee) to obtain duty 
refunds on watches and watch movements and parts (except discrete 
watchcases) imported into the customs territory of the United States. 
The amounts of these certificates may not exceed specified percentages 
of the producers' verified creditable wages in the insular possessions 
(90% of wages paid for the production of the first 300,000 units and 
declining percentages, established by the Secretaries, of wages paid for 
incremental production up to 750,000 units by each producer) nor an 
aggregate annual amount for all certificates exceeding $5,000,000 
adjusted for growth by the ratio of the previous year's gross national 
product to the gross national product in 1982. Refund requests are 
governed by regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury. The 
Secretaries are authorized to issue regulations necessary to carry out 
their duties under Headnote 6 and may cancel or restrict the license or 
certificate of any insular manufacturer found violating the regulations.

[[Page 21]]


<R05>
Sec. 303.2  Definitions and forms.

    (a) Definitions. Unless the context indicates otherwise:
    (1) Act means Pub. L. 97-446, enacted January 12, 1983 (19 U.S.C. 
1202), 96 Stat. 2329, as amended by Pub. L. 103-465, enacted on December 
8, 1994, 108 Stat. 4991.
    (2) Secretaries means the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of 
Interior or their delegates, acting jointly.
    (3) Director means the Director of the Statutory Import Programs 
Staff, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.
    (4) Sale or tranfer of a business means the sale or transfer of 
control, whether temporary or permanent, over a firm to which a duty-
exemption has been allocated, to any other firm, corporation, 
partnership, person or other legal entity by any means whatsoever, 
including, but not limited to, merger and transfer of stock, assets or 
voting trusts.
    (5) New firm is a watch firm not affiliated through ownership or 
control with any other watch duty-refund recipient. In assessing whether 
persons or parties are affiliated, the Secretaries will consider the 
following factors, among others: stock ownership; corporate or family 
groupings; franchise or joint venture agreements; debt financing; and 
close supplier relationships. The Secretaries may not find that control 
exists on the basis of these factors unless the relationship has the 
potential to affect decisions concerning production, pricing, or cost. 
Also, no watch duty-refund recipient may own or control more than one 
jewelry duty-refund recipient. A new entrant is a new watch firm which 
has received an allocation.
    (6) Producer means a duty-exemption holder which has maintained its 
eligibility for further allocations by complying with these regulations.
    (7) Established industry means all producers, including new 
entrants, that have maintained their eligibility for further 
allocations.
    (8) Territories, territorial, and insular possessions refer to the 
insular possessions of the United States (i.e., the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
Guam, and American Samoa) and the Northern Mariana Islands.
    (9) Duty-exemption refers to the authorization of duty-free entry of 
a specified number of watches and watch movements into the Customs 
Territory of the United States.
    (10) Total annual duty-exemption refers to the entire quantity of 
watches or watch components which may enter duty-free into the customs 
territory of the United States from the territories under 91/5 in a 
calendar year, as determined by the Secretaries or by the International 
Trade Commission in accordance with the Act.
    (11) Territorial distribution refers to the apportionment by the 
Secretaries of the total annual duty-exemption among the separate 
territories; territorial share means the portion consigned to each 
territory by this apportionment.
    (12) Allocation refers to the distribution of all parts of a 
territorial share, or a portion thereof, among the several producers in 
a territory.
    (13) Creditable wages means all wages, up to an amount equal to 65% 
of the contribution and benefit base for Social Security as defined in 
the Social Security Act for the year in which the wages were earned, 
paid to permanent residents of the territories employed in a firm's 91/5 
watch and watch movement assembly operations, plus any wages paid for 
the repair of non-91/5 watches up to an amount equal to 50 percent of 
the firm's total creditable wages. Excluded, however, are wages paid to 
any outside consultants or other professional personnel, such as lawyers 
and accountants, or to those persons not involved in the day-to-day 
assembly operations or servicing and maintenance of equipment and 
fixtures necessary for the assembly or manufacturing operations or 
administrative work and security activities directly related to the 
operations of the company, such as gardeners or construction workers, 
and for the repair of non-91/5 watches and movements to the extent that 
such wages exceed the foregoing percentage. Wages paid to persons 
engaged in both creditable and non-creditable assembly and repair 
activities may be credited proportionately provided the firm maintains 
production and payroll records adequate

[[Page 22]]

for the Departments' verification of the creditable portion.
    (14) Non-91/5 watches and watch movements include, but are not 
limited to, watches and movements which are liquidated as dutiable by 
the U.S. Customs Service; contain any material which is the product of 
any country with respect to which Column 2 rates of duty apply; are 
ineligible for duty-free treatment pursuant to law or regulation; or are 
units the assembly of which the Department has determined not to involve 
substantial and meaningful work in the territory (as elsewhere defined 
in these regulations).
    (15) Discrete movements and components means screws, parts, 
components and subassemblies not assembled together with another part, 
component or subassembly at the time of importation into the territory. 
(A mainplate containing set jewels or shock devices, together with other 
parts, would be considered a single discrete component, as would a 
barrel bridge subassembly.)
    (b) Forms--(1) ITA-334P ``Application for License to Enter Watches 
and Watch Movements into the Customs Territory of the United States.'' 
This form must be completed annually by all producers desiring to 
receive an annual allocation. It is also used, with appropriate special 
instructions for its completion, by new firms applying for duty-
exemptions and by producers who wish to receive the duty refund in 
installments on a biannual basis.
    (2) ITA-333 ``License to Enter Watches and Watch Movements into the 
Customs Territory of the United States.'' This form is issued by the 
Director to producers who have received an allocation and constitutes 
authorization for issuing specific shipment permits by the territorial 
governments. It is also used to record the balance of a producer's 
remaining duty-exemptions after each shipment permit is issued.
    (3) ITA-340 ``Permit to Enter Watches and Watch Movements into the 
Customs Territory of the United States.'' This form may be obtained, by 
producers holding a valid license, from the territorial government or 
may be produced by the licensee in an approved computerized format or 
any other medium or format approved by the Departments of Commerce and 
the Interior. The completed form authorizes duty-free entry of a 
specified amount of watches or watch movements at a specified U.S. 
Customs port.
    (4) ITA-360P ``Certificate of Entitlement to Secure the Refund of 
Duties on Watches and Watch Movements.'' This document authorizes an 
insular producer to request the refund of duties on imports of watches, 
watch movements and parts therefor, with certain exceptions, up to a 
specified value. Certificates may be used to obtain duty refunds only 
when presented with a properly executed Form ITA-361P.
    (5) ITA-361P ``Request for Refund of Duties on Watches and Watch 
Movements.'' This form must be completed to obtain the refund of duties 
authorized by the Director through Form ITA-360P. After authentication 
by the Department of Commerce, it may be used for the refund of duties 
on items which were entered into the customs territory of the United 
States during a specified time period. Copies of the appropriate Customs 
entries must be provided with this form to establish a basis for issuing 
the claimed amounts. The forms may also be used to transfer all or part 
of the producer's entitlement to another party. (See Sec. 303.12.)

(The information collection requirements in paragraph (b)(1) were 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0625-0040. The information collection requirements in paragraphs (b)(4) 
through (6) were approved under control number 0625-0134)

Sec. 303.3  Determination of the total annual duty-exemption.

    (a) Procedure for determination. If, after considering the 
productive capacity of the territorial watch industry and the economic 
interests of the territories, the Secretaries determine that the amount 
of the total annual duty-exemption, or the territorial shares of the 
total amount, should be changed, they shall publish in the Federal 
Register a proposed limit on the quantity of watch units which may enter 
duty-free into the customs territory of the

[[Page 23]]

United States and proposed territorial shares thereof and, after 
considering comments, establish the limit and shares by Federal Register 
notice. If the Secretaries take no action under this section, they shall 
make the allocations in accordance with the limit and shares last 
established by this procedure.
    (b) Standards for determination. (1) Notwithstanding paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, the limit established for any year may be 
7,000,000 units if the limit established for the preceding year was a 
smaller amount.
    (2) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, the total annual duty-
exemption shall not be decreased by more than 10% of the quantity 
established for the preceding calendar year, or increased, if the 
resultant total is larger than 7,000,000, by more than 20% of the 
quantity established for the calendar year immediately preceding.
    (3) The Secretaries shall determine the limit after considering the 
interests of the territories; the domestic or international trade policy 
objectives of the United States; the need to maintain the competitive 
nature of the territorial industry; the total contribution of the 
industry to the economic well-being of the territories; and the 
territorial industry's utilization of the total duty-exemption 
established in the preceding year.
    (c) Determinations based on consumption. (1) The Secretaries shall 
notify the International Trade Commission whenever they have reason to 
believe duty-free watch imports from the territories will exceed 
9,000,000 units, or whenever they make a preliminary determination that 
the total annual duty-exemption should exceed 10,000,000 units.
    (2) In addition to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Secretaries shall not establish a limit exceeding one-ninth of 
apparent domestic consumption if such consumption, as determined by 
International Trade Commission, exceeds 90 million units.

[49 FR 17740, Apr. 25, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 7170, Feb. 21, 1985; 50 
FR 43568, Oct. 28, 1985; 53 FR 52994, Dec. 30, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 303.4  Determination of territorial distribution.

    (a) Procedure for determination. The Secretaries shall determine the 
territorial shares concurrently with their determination of the total 
annual duty exemption, and in the same manner (see Sec. 303.3, above).
    (b) Standards for determination--(1) Limitations. A territorial 
share may not be reduced by more than 500,000 units in any calendar 
year. No territorial share shall be less than 500,000 units.
    (2) Criteria for setting precise quantities. The Secretaries shall 
determine the precise quantities after considering, inter alia, the 
territorial capacity to produce and ship watch units. The Secretaries 
shall further bear in mind the aggregate benefits to the territories, 
such as creditable wages paid, creditable wages per unit exported, and 
corporate income tax payments.
    (3) Limitations on reduction of share. The Secretaries shall not 
reduce a territory's share if its producers use 85% or more of the 
quantity distributed to that territory in the immediately preceding 
year, except in the case of a major increase or decrease in the number 
of producers in a territory or if they believe that a territorial 
industry will decrease production by more than 15% from the total of the 
preceding year.
    (4) Standby redistribution authority. The Secretaries may 
redistribute territorial shares if such action is warranted by 
circumstances unforeseen at the time of the initial distributions, such 
as that a territory will use less than 80% of its total by the end of a 
calendar year, or if a redistribution is necessary to maintain the 
competitive nature of the territorial industries.

<R05>
Sec. 303.5  Application for annual allocations of duty-exemptions.

    (a) Application forms (ITA-334P) shall be furnished to producers by 
January 1, and must be completed and returned to the Director no later 
than January 31, of each calendar year.
    (b) All data supplied are subject to verification by the Secretaries 
and no allocation shall be made to producer until the Secretaries are 
satisfied that

[[Page 24]]

the data are accurate. To verify the data, representatives of the 
Secretaries shall have access to relevant company records including:
    (1) Work sheets used to answer all questions on the application 
form;
    (2) Original records from which such data are derived;
    (3) Records pertaining to ownership and control of the company and 
to the satisfaction of eligibility requirements of duty-free treatment 
of its product by the U.S. Customs Service;
    (4) Records pertaining to corporate income taxes, gross receipts 
taxes and excise taxes paid by each producer in the territories on the 
basis of which a portion of each producer's annual allocation is or may 
be predicated;
    (5) Customs, bank, payroll, and production records;
    (6) Records on purchases of components and sales of movements, 
including proof of payment; and
    (7) Any other records in the possession of the parent or affiliated 
companies outside the territory pertaining to any aspect of the 
producer's 91/5 watch assembly operation.
    (c) Data verification shall be performed in the territories, unless 
other arrangements satisfactory to the Departments are made in advance, 
by the Secretaries' representatives by the end of February of each 
calendar year. In the event a company cannot substantiate the data in 
its application before allocations must be calculated, the Secretaries 
shall determine which data will be used.
    (d) Records subject to the requirements of paragraph (b), above, 
shall be retained for a period of two years following their creation.

<R05>
Sec. 303.6  Allocation and reallocation of exemptions among producers.

    (a) Interim allocations. As soon as practicable after January 1 of 
each year the Secretaries shall make an interim allocation to each 
producer equaling 70% of the number of watch units it has entered duty-
free into the customs territory of the United States during the first 
eight months of the preceding calendar year, or any lesser amount 
requested in writing by the producer. The Secretaries may also issue a 
lesser amount if, in their judgment, the producer might otherwise 
receive an interim allocation in an amount greater than the producer's 
probable annual allocation. In calculating the interim allocations, the 
Director shall count only duty-free watches and watch movements verified 
by the U.S. Customs Service, or verified by other means satisfctory to 
the Secretaries, as having been entered on or before August 31 of the 
preceding year. Interim allocations shall not be published.
    (b) Annual allocations. (1) By March 1 of each year the Secretaries 
shall make annual allocations to the producers in accordance with the 
allocation formula based on data supplied in their annual application 
(Form ITA-334P) and verified by the Secretaries.
    (2) The excess of a producer's duty-exemption earned under the 
allocation criteria over the amount formally requested by the producer 
shall be considered to have been relinquished voluntarily (see paragraph 
(f) below). A producer's request may be modified by written 
communication received by the Secretaries by February 28, or, at the 
discretion of the Secretaries, before the annual allocations are made. 
An allocation notice shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (c) Supplemental allocations. At the request of a producer, the 
Secretaries may supplement a producer's interim allocation if the 
Secretaries determine the producer's interim allocation will be used 
before the Secretaries can issue the annual allocation. Allocations to 
supplement a producer's annual allocation shall be made under the 
reallocation provisions prescribed below.
    (d) Allocations to new entrants. In making interim and annual 
allocations to producers selected the preceding year as new entrants, 
the Secretaries shall take into account that such producers will not 
have had a full year's operation as a basis for computation of its duty-
exemption. The Secretaries may make an interim or annual allocation to a 
new entrant even if the firm did not operate during the preceding 
calendar year.

[[Page 25]]

    (e) Special allocations. A producer may request a special allocation 
if unusual circumstances kept it from making duty-free shipments at a 
level comparable with its past record. In considering such requests, the 
Secretaries shall take into account the firm's proposed assembly 
operations; its record in contributing to the territorial economy; and 
its intentions and capacity to make meaningful contributions to the 
territory. They shall also first determine that the amount of the 
special allocation requested will not significantly affect the amounts 
allocated to other producers pursuant to Sec. 303.6(b)(1).
    (f) Reallocations. Duty-exemptions may become available for 
reallocation as a result of cancellation or reduction for cause, 
voluntary relinquishment or nonplacement of duty-exemption set aside for 
new entrants. At the request of a producer, the Secretaries may 
reallocate such duty-exemptions among the remaining producers who can 
use additional quantities in a manner judged best for the economy of the 
territories. The Secretaries shall consider such factors as the wage and 
income tax contributions of the respective producers during the 
preceding year and the nature of the producer's present assembly 
operations. In addition, the Secretaries may consider other factors 
which, in their judgment, are relevant to determining that applications 
from new firms, in lieu of reallocations, should be considered for part 
or all of unused portions of the total duty exemptions. Such factors may 
include:
    (1) The ability of the established industry to use the duty-
exemption;
    (2) Whether the duty-exemption is sufficient to support new entrant 
operations;
    (3) The impact upon the established industry if new entrants are 
selected, particularly with respect to the effect on local employment, 
tax contributions to the territorial government, and the ability of the 
established industry to maintain satisfactory production levels; and
    (4) Whether additional new entrants offer the best prospect for 
adding economic benefits to the territory.
    (g) Section 303.14 of this part contains the criteria and formulae 
used by the Secretaries in calculating each watch producer's annual 
watch duty-exemption allocation, and other special rules or provisions 
the Secretaries may periodically adopt to carry out their 
responsibilities in a timely manner while taking into account changing 
circumstances. References to duty-exemptions, unless otherwise 
indicated, are to the amount available for reallocation in the current 
calendar year. Specifications of or references to data or bases used in 
the calculation of current year allocations (e.g., economic 
contributions and shipments) are, unless indicated otherwise, those 
which were generated in the previous year.
    (h) The Secretaries may propose changes to Sec. 303.14 at any time 
they consider it necessary to fulfill their responsibilities. Normally, 
such changes will be proposed towards the end of each calendar year. 
Interested parties shall be given an opportunity to submit written 
comments on proposed changes.

<R05>
Sec. 303.7  Issuance of licenses and shipment permits.

    (a) Issuance of Licenses (ITA-333). (1) Concurrently with annual 
allocations under Sec. 303.5 the Director shall issue a non-transferable 
license (Form ITA-333) to each producer. The Director shall also issue a 
replacement license if a producer's allocation is reduced pursuant to 
Sec. 303.6.
    (2) Annual duty-exemption licenses shall be for only that portion of 
a producer's annual duty-exemption not previously licensed.
    (3) If a producer's duty-exemption has been reduced, the Director 
shall not issue a replacement license for the reduced amount until the 
producer's previous license has been received for cancellation by the 
Director.
    (4) A producer's license shall be used in their entirety, except 
when they expire or are cancelled, in order of their date of issuance, 
i.e., an interim license must be completely used before shipment permits 
can be issued against an interim supplemental license.

[[Page 26]]

    (5) Outstanding licenses issued by the Director automatically expire 
at midnight, December 31, of each calendar year. No unused allocation of 
duty-exemption may be carried over into the subsequent calendar year.
    (6) The Director shall ensure that all licenses issued are 
conspicuously marked to show the type of license issued, the identity of 
the producer, and the year for which the license is valid. All licenses 
shall bear the signature of the Director.
    (7) Each producer is responsible for the security of its licenses. 
The loss of a license shall be reported immediately to the Director. 
Defacing, tampering with, and unauthorized use of a license are 
forbidden.
    (b) Shipment Permit Requirements (ITA-340). (1) Producers may obtain 
shipment permits from the territorial government officials designated by 
the Governor. Permits may also be produced in any computerized or other 
format or medium approved by the Departments. The permit is for use 
against a producer's valid duty-exemption license and a permit must be 
completed for every duty-free shipment.
    (2) Each permit must specify the license and permit number, the 
number of watches and watch movements included in the shipment, the 
unused balance remaining on the producer's license, pertinent shipping 
information and must have the certification statement signed by an 
official of the licensee's company. A copy of the completed permit must 
be sent electronically or taken to the designated territorial government 
officials, no later than the day of shipment, for confirmation that the 
producer's duty-exemption license has not been exceeded and that the 
permit is properly completed.
    (3) The permit (form ITA-340) shall be filed with Customs along with 
the other required entry documents to receive duty-free treatment unless 
the importer or its representative clears the documentation through 
Customs' automated broker interface. Entries made electronically do not 
require the submission of a permit to Customs, but the shipment data 
must be maintained as part of a producer's recordkeeping 
responsibilities for the period prescribed by Customs' recordkeeping 
regulations. U.S. Customs Service Import Specialists may request the 
documentation they deem appropriate to substantiate claims for duty-free 
treatment, allowing a reasonable amount of time for the importer to 
produce the permit.

<R05>
Sec. 303.8  Maintenance of duty-exemption entitlements.

    (a) The Secretaries may order a producer to show cause within 30 
days of receipt of the order why the duty-exemption to which the firm 
would otherwise be entitled should not be cancelled, in whole or in 
part, if:
    (1) At any time after June 30 of the calendar year:
    (i) A producer's assembly and shipment record provides a reasonable 
basis to conclude that the producer will use less than 80 percent of its 
total allocation by the end of the calendar year, and
    (ii) The producer refuses a request from the Departments to 
relinquish that portion of its allocation which they conclude will not 
be used; or
    (2) A producer fails to satisfy or fulfill any term, condition or 
representation, whether undertaken by itself or prescribed by the 
Departments, upon which receipt of allocation has been predicated or 
upon which the Departments have relied in connection with the sale or 
transfer of a business together with its allocation; or
    (3) A producer, in the judgment of the Secretaries, has failed to 
make a meaningful contribution to the territory for a period of two or 
more consecutive calendar years, when compared with the performance of 
the duty-free watch assembly industry in the territory as a whole. This 
comparison shall include the producer's quantitative use of its 
allocations, amount of direct labor employed in the assembly of watches 
and watch movements, and the net amount of corporate income taxes paid 
to the government of the territory. If the producer fails to satisfy the 
Secretaries as to why such action should not be taken, the firm's 
allocation shall be reduced or cancelled, whichever is appropriate under 
the show-cause order. The

[[Page 27]]

eligibility of a firm whose allocation has been cancelled to receive 
further allocations may also be terminated.
    (b) The Secretaries may also issue a show-cause order to reduce or 
cancel a producer's allocation or production incentive certificate (see 
Sec. 303.12, below), as appropriate, or to declare the producer 
ineligible to receive an allocation or certificate if it violates any 
regulation in this part, uses a form, license, permit, or certificate in 
an unauthorized manner, or fails to provide information or data required 
by these regulations or requested by the Secretaries or their delegates 
in the performance of their responsibilities.
    (c) If a firm's allocation is reduced or cancelled, or if a firm 
voluntarily relinquishes a part of its allocation, the Secretaries may:
    (1) Reallocate the allocation involved among the remaining producers 
in a manner best suited to contribute to the economy of the territory;
    (2) Reallocate the allocation or part thereof to a new entrant 
applicant; or
    (3) Do neither of the above if deemed in the best interest of the 
territories and the established industry.

Sec. 303.9  Restrictions on the transfer of duty-exemptions.

    (a) The sale or transfer of a duty-exemption from one firm to 
another shall not be permitted.
    (b) The sale or transfer of a business together with its duty-
exemption shall be permitted with prior written notification to the 
Departments. Such notification shall be accompanied by certifications 
and representations, as appropriate, that:
    (1) If the transferee is a subsidiary of or in any way affiliated 
with any other company engaged in the production of watch movements 
components being offered for sale to any territorial producer, the 
related company or companies will continue to offer such watch and watch 
movement components on equal terms and conditions to all willing buyers 
and shall not engage in any practice, in regard to the sale of 
components, that competitively disadvantages the non-affiliated 
territorial producers vis-a-vis the territorial subsidiary;
    (2) The sale or transfer price for the business together with its 
duty-exemption does not include the capitalization of the duty-exemption 
per se;
    (3) The transferee is neither directly or indirectly affiliated with 
any other territorial duty-exemption holder in any territory;
    (4) The transferee will not modify the watch assembly operations of 
the duty-exemption firm in a manner that will significantly diminish its 
economic contributions to the territory.
    (c) At the request of the Departments, the transferee shall permit 
representatives of the Departments to inspect whatever records are 
necessary to establish to their satisfaction that the certifications and 
representations contained in paragraph (b) of this section have been or 
are being met.
    (d) Any transferee who is either unwilling or unable to make the 
certifications and representations specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section shall secure the Departments' approval in advance of the sale or 
transfer of the business together with its duty-exemption. The request 
for approval shall specify which of the certifications specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section the firm is unable or unwilling to make, 
and give reasons why such fact should not constitute a basis for the 
Departments' disapproval of the sale or transfer.

<R05>
Sec. 303.12  Issuance and use of production incentive certificates.

    (a) Issuance of certificates. (1) The total annual amount of the 
Certificate of Entitlement, Form ITA-360, may be divided and issued on a 
biannual basis. The first portion of the total annual certificate amount 
will be based on reported duty-free shipments and creditable wages paid 
during the first six months of the calendar year, using the formula in 
Sec. 303.14(c). The Departments require the receipt of the data by July

[[Page 28]]

31 for each producer who wishes to receive an interim duty refund 
certificate. The interim duty refund certificate will be issued on or 
before August 31 of the same calendar year in which the wages were 
earned unless the Departments have unresolved questions. The process of 
determining the total annual amount of the duty refund will remain the 
same. The completed annual application (Form ITA-334P) shall be received 
by the Departments on or before January 31 and the annual verification 
of data and the calculation of each producer's total annual duty refund, 
based on the verified data, will continue to take place in February. 
Once the calculations for each producer's duty refund has been 
completed, the portion of the duty refund that has already been issued 
to each producer will be deducted from the total amount of each 
producer's annual duty refund amount. The duty refund certificate will 
continue to be issued by March 1 unless the Departments have unresolved 
questions.
    (2) Certificates shall not be issued to more than one company in the 
territories owned or controlled by the same corporate entity.
    (b) Securities and handling of certificates. (1) Certificate holders 
are responsible for the security of the certificates. The certificates 
shall be kept at the territorial address of the insular producer or at 
another location having the advance approval of the Departments.
    (2) All refund requests made pursuant to the certificates shall be 
entered on the reverse side of the certificate.
    (3) Certificates shall be returned by registered, certified or 
express carrier mail to the Departments when:
    (i) A refund is requested which exhausts the entitlement on the face 
of the certificate,
    (ii) The certificate expires, or
    (iii) The Departments request their return with good cause.
    (4) Certificate entitlements may be transferred according to the 
procedures described in (c) of this section.
    (c) The use and transfer of certificate entitlements. (1) Insular 
producers issued a certificate may request a refund by executing a Form 
ITA-361P (see Sec. 303.2(b)(5) and the instructions on the form). After 
authentication by the Department of Commerce, the Form ITA-361P may be 
used to obtain duty refunds on watch movements, watches, and parts 
therefor. Duties on watchcases not containing a movement and on articles 
containing any material which is the product of a country with respect 
to which Column 2 rates of duty apply may not be refunded. Articles for 
which duty refunds are claimed must have entered the customs territory 
of the United States during the two-year period prior to the issue date 
of the certificate or during the one-year period the certificate remains 
valid. Copies of the appropriate Customs entries must be provided with 
the refund request in order to establish a basis for issuing the claimed 
amounts. Certification regarding drawback claims and liquidated refunds 
relating to the presented entries is required from the claimant on the 
form.
    (2) Regulations issued by the U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Department 
of the Treasury, govern the refund of duties under Pub. L. 97-446, as 
amended by Public Law 103-465. If the Departments receive information 
from the Customs Service that a producer has made unauthorized use of 
any official form, they shall cancel the affected certificate.
    (3) The insular producer may transfer a portion of all of its 
certificate entitlement to another party by entering in block C of Form 
ITA-361P the name and address of the party.
    (4) After a Form ITA-361P transferring a certificate entitlement to 
a party other than the certificate holder has been authenticated by the 
Department of Commerce, the form may be exchanged for any consideration 
satisfactory to the two parties. In all cases, authenticated forms shall 
be transmitted to the certificate holder or its authorized custodian for 
disposition (see paragraph (b) above).
    (5) All disputes concerning the use of an authenticated Form ITA-
361P shall be referred to the Departments for resolution. Any party 
named on an authenticated Form ITA-361P shall be

[[Page 29]]

considered an ``interested party'' within the meaning of Sec. 303.13 of 
this part.

Sec. 303.13  Appeals.

    (a) Any official decision or action relating to the allocation of 
duty-exemptions or to the issuance or use of production incentive 
certificates may be appealed to the Secretaries by any interested party. 
Such appeals must be received within 30 days of the date on which the 
decision was made or the action taken in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Interested parties may 
petition for the issuance of a rule, or amendment or repeal of a rule 
issued by the Secretaries. Interested parties may also petition for 
relief from the application of any rule on the basis of hardship or 
extraordinary circumstances resulting in the inability of the petitioner 
to comply with the rule.
    (b) Petitions shall bear the name and post office address of the 
petitioner and the name and address of the principal attorney or 
authorized representative (if any) for the party concerned. They shall 
be addressed to the Secretaries and filed in one original and two copies 
with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Import Administration, 
International Trade Administration, Washington, D.C. 20230, Attention: 
Statutory Import Programs Staff. Petitions shall contain the following:
    (1) A reference to the decision, action or rule which is the subject 
of the petition;
    (2) A short statement of the interest of the petitioner;
    (3) A statement of the facts as seen by the petitioner;
    (4) The petitioner's argument as to the points of law, policy of 
fact. In cases where policy error is contended, the alleged error 
together with the policy the submitting party advocates as the correct 
one should be described in full;
    (5) A conclusion specifying the action that the petitioner believes 
the Secretaries should take.
    (c) The Secretaries may at their discretion schedule a hearing and 
invite the participation of other interested parties.
    (d) The Secretaries shall communicate their decision which shall be 
final, to the petitioner by registered mail.
    (e) If the outcome of any petition materially affects the amount of 
the petitioner's allocation and if the Secretaries' consideration of the 
petition continues during the calculation of the annual allocations, the 
Secretaries shall set aside a portion of the affected territorial share 
in an amount which, in their judgment, protects the petitioner's 
interest and shall allocate the remainder among the other producers.

Sec. 303.14  Allocation factors and miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) The allocation formula. (1) Except as provided in (a)(2) of this 
section, the territorial shares (excluding any amount set aside for 
possible new entrants) shall be allocated among the several producers in 
each territory in accordance with the following formula:
    (i) Fifty percent of the territorial share shall be allocated on the 
basis of the net dollar amount of economic contributions to the 
territory consisting of the dollar amount of creditable wages, up to an 
amount equal to 65% of the contribution and benefit base for Social 
Security as defined in the Social Security Act for the year in which the 
wages were earned, paid by each producer to territorial residents, plus 
the dollar amount of income taxes (excluding penalty and interest 
payments and deducting any income tax refunds and subsidies paid by the 
territorial government), and
    (ii) Fifty percent of the territorial share shall be allocated on 
the basis of the number of units of watches and watch movements 
assembled in the territory and entered by each producer duty-free into 
the customs territory of the United States.
    (2) If there is only one producer in a territory, the entire 
territorial share, excluding any amount set aside for possible new 
entrants, may be allocated

[[Page 30]]

without recourse to any distributive formula.
    (b) Minimum assembly requirements and prohibition of preferential 
supply relationship. (1) No insular watch movement or watch may be 
entered free of duty into the customs territory of the United States 
unless the producer used 30 or more discrete parts and components to 
assemble a mechanical watch movement and 33 or more discrete parts and 
components to assemble a mechanical watch.
    (2) Quartz analog watch movements must be assembled from parts 
knocked down to the maximum degree possible for the technical 
capabilities of the insular industry as a whole. The greatest degree of 
disassembly specified, for each manufacturer's brand and model, by any 
producer in any territory purchasing such brands and models shall 
constitute the disassembly required as a minimum for the industry as a 
whole.
    (3) Watch movements and watches assembled from components with a 
value of more than $35 for watch movements and $500 for watches shall 
not be eligible for duty-exemption upon entry into the U.S. Customs 
territory. Value means the value of the merchandise plus all charges and 
costs incurred up to the last point of shipment (i.e., prior to entry of 
the parts and components into the territory).
    (4) No producer shall accept from any watch parts and components 
supplier advantages and preferences which might result in a more 
favorable competitive position for itself vis-a-vis other territorial 
producers relying on the same supplier. Disputes under this paragraph 
may be resolved under the appeals procedures contained in 
Sec. 303.13(b).
    (c) Calculation of the value of production incentive certificates. 
(1) The value of each producer's certificate shall equal the producer's 
average creditable wages per unit shipped (including non-91/5 units as 
provided for in Sec. 303.2(a)(13)) multiplied by the sum of:
    (i) The number of units shipped up to 300,000 units times a factor 
of 90%; plus
    (ii) Incremental units shipped up to 450,000 units times a factor of 
85%; plus
    (iii) Incremental units shipped up to 600,000 times a factor of 80%; 
plus
    (iv) Incremental shipments up to 750,000 units times a factor of 
75%.
    (2) The Departments may make adjustments for these data in the 
manner set forth in Sec. 303.5(c).
    (d) New entrant invitations. Applications from new firms are invited 
for any unused portion of any territorial share.
    (e) Territorial shares. The shares of the total duty exemption are 
1,866,000 for the Virgin Islands, 500,000 for Guam, 500,000 for American 
Samoa, and 500,000 for the Northern Mariana Islands.

<R05>
Sec. 303.15  Purpose.

    (a) This subpart implements the responsibilities of the Secretaries 
of Commerce and the Interior (``the Secretaries'') under Pub. L. 106-36, 
enacted 25 June 1999 which substantially amended Pub. L. 97-446, enacted 
12 January 1983, amended by Pub. L. 89-805, enacted 10 November 1966, 
amended by Pub. L. 94-88, enacted 8 August 1975, amended by Pub. L. 94-
241, enacted 24 March 1976, and amended by Pub. L. 103-465, enacted 8 
December 1994.
    (b) The amended law provides for the issuance of certificates to 
insular jewelry producers who have met the requirements of the laws and 
regulations, entitling the holder (or any transferee) to obtain refunds 
of duties on watches and watch movements and parts (except discrete 
watch cases) imported into the customs territory of the United States. 
The amounts of these certificates may not exceed specified percentages 
of the producers' verified creditable wages in the insular possessions 
(90% of wages paid for the production of the first 300,000 duty-free 
units and declining percentages, established by the Secretaries, of 
wages paid for incremental production up to 750,000

[[Page 31]]

units by each producer) nor an aggregate annual amount for all 
certificates exceeding $5,000,000 adjusted for growth by the ratio of 
the previous year's gross national product to the gross national product 
in 1982. However, the law specifies that watch producer benefits are not 
to be diminished as a consequence of extending the duty refund to 
jewelry manufacturers. In the event that the amount of the calculated 
duty refunds for watches and jewelry exceeds the total aggregate annual 
amount that is available, the watch producers shall receive their 
calculated amounts and the jewelry producers would receive amounts 
proportionately reduced from the remainder. Refund requests are governed 
by regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury (see 19 CFR 
7.4).
    (c) Section 2401(a) of Pub. L. 106-36 and additional U.S. note 5 to 
chapter 91 of the HTSUS authorize the Secretaries to issue regulations 
necessary to carry out their duties. The Secretaries may cancel or 
restrict the certificate of any insular manufacturer found violating the 
regulations.

partnership, person or other legal entity by any means whatsoever, 
including, but not limited to, merger and transfer of stock, assets or 
voting trusts.
    (5) New firm means a jewelry company which has requested in writing 
to the Secretaries permission to participate in the program. In addition 
to any other information required by the Secretaries, new firm requests 
shall include a representation that the company agrees to abide by the 
laws and regulations of the program, an outline of the company's 
anticipated economic contribution to the territory (including the number 
of employees) and a statement as to whether the company is affiliated by 
ownership or control with any other watch or jewelry company in the 
insular possessions. The Secretaries will then review the request and 
make a decision based on the information provided and the economic 
contribution to the territory. A new jewelry firm may not be affiliated 
through ownership or control with any other jewelry duty-refund 
recipient. In assessing whether persons or parties are affiliated, the 
Secretaries will consider the following factors, among others: stock 
ownership; corporate or family groupings; franchise or joint venture 
agreements; debt financing; and close supplier relationships. The 
Secretaries may not find that control exists on the basis of these 
factors unless the relationship has the potential to affect decisions 
concerning production, pricing, or cost. Also, no jewelry duty-refund 
recipient may own or control more than one watch duty-refund recipient.
    (6) Jewelry producer means a company, located in one of the insular 
territories (see paragraph (a)(8) of this section), that produces 
jewelry provided for in heading 7113, HTSUS, which meets all the U.S. 
Customs Service requirements for duty-free entry set forth in General 
Note 3(a)(iv), HTSUS, and 19 CFR 7.3, and has maintained its eligibility 
for duty refund benefits by complying with these regulations.
    (7) Unit of jewelry means a single article, pair (example: earrings, 
cufflinks), subassembly or component which is contained in HTSUS heading 
7113.
    (8) Territories, territorial and insular possessions refers to the 
insular possessions of the United States (i.e., the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands).

[[Page 32]]

    (9) Creditable wages means all wages, up to an amount equal to 65% 
of the contribution and benefit base for Social Security as defined in 
the Social Security Act for the year in which the wages were earned, 
paid to permanent residents of the territories employed in the firm's 
manufacture of HTSUS heading 7113 articles of jewelry which are a 
product of the insular possessions and have met the U.S. Customs 
Service's criteria for duty-free entry into the United States, plus any 
wages paid for the repair of non-insular HTSUS heading 7113 jewelry up 
to an amount equal to 50 percent of the firm's total creditable wages. 
Excluded, however, are wages paid for outside consultants or other 
professional personnel, such as lawyers and accountants, or those 
persons not involved in the day-to-day assembly operations or servicing 
and maintenance of equipment and fixtures necessary for the assembly or 
manufacturing operations or the administrative work and security 
activities directly related to the operations of the company, such as 
gardeners or construction workers, plus any wages paid for the assembly 
of dutiable jewelry or for the repair of dutiable jewelry to the extent 
that such wages exceed the percentage set forth above. No more than two 
insular producers may have their wages credited for their portion of the 
wages paid for work on a single piece of jewelry which entered the U.S. 
free of duty under the program. Wages paid by the two producers will be 
credited proportionally provided both producers demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Secretaries that they worked on the same piece of 
jewelry, the jewelry received duty-free treatment into the U.S., and the 
producers maintained production and payroll records sufficient for the 
Departments' verification of the creditable wage portion (see 
Sec. 303.17(b)). Wages paid to persons engaged in production of jewelry 
that has entered the U.S. both duty-free and duty-paid may be credited 
proportionately provided the firm maintains production and payroll 
records adequate for the Departments' verification of the creditable 
wages portion (see Sec. 303.17(b)).
    (10) Dutiable jewelry includes jewelry which does not meet the 
requirements for duty-free entry under General Note 3(a)(iv), HTSUS, and 
19 CFR 7.3, contains any material which is the product of any country 
with respect to which Column 2 rates of duty apply or is ineligible for 
duty-free treatment pursuant to other laws or regulations.
    (b) Forms. (1) ITA--334P ``Annual Application for License to Enter 
Watches and Watch Movements into the Customs Territory of the United 
States.'' The Director shall issue instructions for jewelry 
manufacturers on the completion of the relevant portions of the form. 
The form must be completed annually by all jewelry producers desiring to 
receive a duty refund and, with special instructions for its completion, 
by producers who wish to receive the total annual amount of the duty 
refund in installments on a biannual basis.
    (2) ITA--360P ``Certificate of Entitlement to Secure the Refund of 
Duties on Watches and Watch Movements.'' This document authorizes a 
territorial jewelry producer to request the refund of duties on imports 
of watches, watch movements and parts therefor, with certain exceptions, 
up to a specified value. Certificates may be used to obtain duty refunds 
only when presented with a properly executed Form ITA-361P.
    (3) ITA--361P ``Request for Refund of Duties on Watches and Watch 
Movements.'' This form must be completed to obtain the refund of duties 
authorized by the Director through Form ITA-360P. After authentication 
by the Department of Commerce, it may be used for the refund of duties 
on items which were entered into the customs territory of the United 
States during a specified time period. Copies of the appropriate Customs 
entries must be provided with this form to establish a basis for issuing 
the claimed amounts. The forms may also be used to transfer

[[Page 33]]

all or part of the producer's entitlement to another party (see Sec. 
303.19(c)).

(The information collection requirements in paragraph (b)(1) were 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0625-0040. The information collection requirements in paragraphs (b) (2) 
and (3) were approved under control number 0625-0134)

other arrangements satisfactory to the Departments are made in advance, 
by the Secretaries' representatives by the end of February of each 
calendar year. In the event a company cannot substantiate the data in 
its application, the Secretaries shall determine which data will be 
used.
    (d) Records subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section, shall be retained for a period of two years following their 
creation.

<R05>
Sec. 303.18  Sale or transfer of business.

    (a) The sale or transfer of a business together with its duty refund 
entitlement shall be permitted with prior written notification to the 
Departments. Such notification shall be accompanied by certifications 
and representations, as appropriate, that:
    (1) The transferee is neither directly nor indirectly affiliated 
with any other territorial duty refund jewelry recipient in any 
territory;
    (2) The transferee will not modify the jewelry operations in a 
manner that will significantly diminish its economic contributions to 
the territory.
    (b) At the request of the Departments, the transferee shall permit 
representatives of the Departments to inspect whatever records are 
necessary to establish to their satisfaction that the certifications and 
representations contained in paragraph (a) of this section have been or 
are being met.
    (c) Any transferee who is either unwilling or unable to make the 
certifications and representations specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall secure the Departments' approval in advance of the sale or 
transfer of the business. The request for approval shall specify which 
of the certifications specified in paragraph (a) of this section the 
firm is unable or unwilling to make, and give reasons why such fact 
should not constitute a basis for the Departments' disapproval of the 
sale or transfer.

[[Page 34]]


<R05>
Sec. 303.19  Issuance and use of production incentive certificates.

    (a) Issuance of certificates. (1) The total annual amount of the 
Certificate of Entitlement, Form ITA-360, may be divided and issued on a 
biannual basis. The first portion of the total annual certificate amount 
will be based on reported duty-free shipments and creditable wages paid 
during the first six month of the calendar year, using the formula in 
Sec. 303.20(b). The Departments require the receipt of the data by July 
31 for each producer who wishes to receive an interim duty refund 
certificate. The interim duty refund certificate will be issued on or 
before August 31 of the same year in which the wages were earned unless 
the Departments have unresolved questions. The process of determining 
the total annual amount of the duty refund will remain the same. The 
completed annual application (Form ITA-334P) shall be received by the 
Departments on or before January 31 and the annual verification of data 
and calculation of each producer's total annual duty refund, based on 
the verified data, will continue to take place in February. Once the 
calculations for each producer's duty refund has been completed, the 
portion of the duty refund that has already been issued to each producer 
will be deducted from the total amount of each producer's annual duty 
refund amount. The duty refund certificate will continue to be issued by 
March 1 unless the Departments have unresolved questions.
    (2) Certificates shall not be issued to more than one jewelry 
company in the territories owned or controlled by the same corporate 
entity.
    (b) Security and handling of certificates. (1) Certificate holders 
are responsible for the security of the certificates. The certificates 
shall be kept at the territorial address of the producer or at another 
location having the advance approval of the Departments.
    (2) All refund requests made pursuant to the certificates shall be 
entered on the reverse side of the certificate.
    (3) Certificates shall be returned by registered, certified or 
express carrier mail to the Department of Commerce when:
    (i) A refund is requested which exhausts the entitlement on the face 
of the certificate,
    (ii) The certificate expires, or
    (iii) The Departments request their return with good cause.
    (4) Certificate entitlements may be transferred according to the 
procedures described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) The use and transfer of certificate entitlements. (1) Insular 
producers issued a certificate may request a refund by executing a Form 
ITA-361P (see Sec. 303.16(b)(3)) and the instructions on the form). 
After authentication by the Department of Commerce, Form ITA-361P may be 
used to obtain duty refunds on watch movements, watches, and parts 
therefor. Duties on watch cases not containing a movement and on 
articles containing any material which is the product of a country with 
respect to which Column 2 rates of duty apply may not be refunded. 
Articles for which duty refunds are claimed must have entered the 
customs territory of the United States during the two-year period prior 
to the issue date of the certificate or during the one-year period the 
certificate remains valid. Copies of the appropriate Customs entries 
must be provided with the refund request in order to establish a basis 
for issuing the claimed amounts. Certification regarding drawback claims 
and liquidated refunds relating to the presented entries is required 
from the claimant on the form.
    (2) Regulations issued by the U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Department 
of the Treasury, govern the refund of duties under 19 CFR 7.4. If the 
Departments receive information from the Customs Service that a producer 
has made unauthorized use of any official form, they may cancel the 
affected certificate.
    (3) The territorial producer may transfer a portion of all of its 
certificate entitlement to another party by entering in block C of Form 
ITA-361P the name and address of the party.
    (4) After a Form ITA-361P transferring a certificate entitlement to 
a party other than the certificate holder has been authenticated by the 
Department of Commerce, the form may be

[[Page 35]]

exchanged for any consideration satisfactory to the two parties. In all 
cases, authenticated forms shall be transmitted to the certificate 
holder or its authorized custodian for disposition (see paragraph (b) of 
this section).
    (5) All disputes concerning the use of an authenticated Form ITA-
361P shall be referred to the Departments for resolution. Any party 
named on an authenticated Form ITA-361P shall be considered an 
``interested party'' within the meaning of Sec. 303.21 of this part.

Sec. 303.20  Duty refund.

    (a) Territorial jewelry producers are entitled to duty refund 
certificates only for jewelry that they produce which is provided for in 
heading 7113, HTSUS, is a product of a territory and otherwise meets the 
requirements for duty-free entry under General Note 3 (a)(iv), HTSUS, 
and 19 CFR 7.3.
    (1) An article of jewelry is considered to be a product of a 
territory if:

heading 7113, HTSUS, entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption 
during the two-year period beginning August 9, 1999, that is assembled 
in a territory shall be considered a product of the insular possessions. 
At the expiration of the two-year period, only jewelry which satisfies 
either of the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
shall be considered a product of an insular possession.
    (b) Calculation of the value of production incentive certificates. 
(1) The value of each producer's certificate shall equal the producer's 
average creditable wages per unit shipped free of duty into the United 
States multiplied by the sum of:
    (i) The number of units shipped up to 300,000 units times a factor 
of 90%; plus
    (ii) Incremental units shipped up to 450,000 units times a factor of 
85%; plus
    (iii) Incremental units shipped up to 600,000 times a factor of 80%; 
plus
    (iv) Incremental shipments up to 750,000 units times a factor of 
75%.
    (2) The Departments may make adjustments for these data in the 
manner set forth in Sec. 303.17(c).


<R05>
Sec. 303.21  Appeals.

of production incentive certificates may be appealed to the Secretaries 
by any interested party. Such appeals must be received within 30 days of 
the date on which the decision was made or the action taken in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Interested parties may petition for the issuance of a rule, or 
amendment or repeal of a rule issued by the Secretaries. Interested 
parties may also petition for relief from the application of any rule on 
the basis of hardship or extraordinary circumstances resulting in the 
inability of the petitioner to comply with the rule.
    (b) Petitions shall bear the name and post office address of the

<R05>
Sec. 310.1  Background and purpose.

    The regulations in this part are issued under the authority of Pub. 
L. 91-269 (84 Stat. 271, 22 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.) which establishes an 
orderly procedure for Federal Government recognition of, and 
participation in, international expositions to be held in the United 
States. The Act provides, inter alia, that Federal recognition of an 
exposition is to be granted upon a finding by the President that such 
recognition will be in the national interest. In making this finding, 
the President is directed to consider, among other factors, a report 
from the Secretary of Commerce as to the purposes and reasons for an 
exposition and the extent of financial and other support to be provided 
by the State and local officials and business and community leaders 
where the exposition is to be held, and a report by the Secretary of 
State to determine whether the exposition is qualified for registration 
under Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) rules. The BIE is an 
international organization established by the Paris Convention of 1928 
(T.I.A.S. 6548 as amended by T.I.A.S. 6549) to regulate the conduct and 
scheduling of international expositions in which foreign nations are 
officially invited to participate. The BIE divides international 
expositions into different categories and types and requires each member 
nation to observe specified minimum time intervals in scheduling each of 
these categories and types of expositions. \1\ Under BIE rules, member 
nations may not ordinarily participate in an international exposition 
unless such exposition has been approved by the BIE. The United States 
became a member of the BIE on April 30, 1968, upon ratification of the 
Paris Convention by the U.S. Senate (114 Cong. Rec. 11012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The BIE defines a General Exposition of the First Category as an 
exposition dealing with progress achieved in a particular field applying 
to several branches of human activity at which the invited countries are 
obligated to construct national pavilions. A General Exposition of the 
Secondary Category is a similar exposition at which invited countries 
are not authorized to construct national pavilions, but occupy space 
provided by the exposition sponsors. Special Category Expositions are 
those dealing only with one particular technique, raw material, or basic 
need.
    The BIE frequency rules require that an interval of 15 years must 
elapse between General Expositions of the First Category held in one 
country. General Expositions of the Second Category require an interval 
of 10 years. An interval of 5 years must ordinarily elapse between 
Special Category Expositions of the same kind in one country or three 
months between Special Category Expositions of different kinds. These 
frequency intervals are computed from the date of the opening of the 
exposition.
    More detailed BIE classification criteria and regulations are 
contained in the Paris Convention of 1928, as amended in 1948 and 1966. 
Applicants not having a copy of the text of this convention may obtain 
one by writing the Director. (The Convention may soon be amended by a 
Protocol which has been approved by the BIE and ratified by the United 
States. This amendment would increase authorized frequencies or 
intervals for BIE approved expositions.)


Federal participation in a recognized international exposition requires 
a specific authorization by the Congress, upon a finding by the 
President that

[[Page 37]]

such participation would be in the national interest. The Act provides 
for the transmission to Congress of a participation proposal by the 
President. This proposal transmits to the Congress information regarding 
the exposition, including a statement that it has been registered by the 
BIE and a plan for Federal participation prepared by the Secretary of 
Commerce in cooperation with other interested Federal departments and 
agencies.

<R05>
Sec. 310.4  Action on application.

    (a) Upon receipt of an application, the Director will analyze the 
application and all accompanying exhibits to insure compliance with the 
provisions of Sec. 310.3 and report his findings with respect thereto to 
the Secretary.
    (b) If more than one applicant applies for Federal recognition for 
expositions to be held within three years or less of each other, the 
applications will be reviewed concurrently by the Director. The 
following standards will be considered in determining which if any of 
the competing applicants will be recommended for Federal recognition:
    (1) The order of receipt of the applications by the Director, 
complete with all exhibits required by Sec. 310.3.
    (2) The financial plans of the applications. Primary consideration 
will be given to those applications which do not require Federal 
financing for exposition development. This does not extend to funding 
for a Federal pavilion, if one is desired.
    (3) The relative merit of the applications in terms of their 
qualifications as tourism destination sites, both with respect to 
existing facilities and those facilities planned for the proposed 
exposition. If necessary, to assist in making this determination, the 
Director will appoint a panel of travel industry experts representing 
tour developers, the transportation, entertainment and hotel/motel 
industries for the purpose of studying the competing applications and 
reporting to the Director its views as to which proposed site best meets 
the above criteria. If such a panel is deemed necessary, the provisions 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (86 Stat. 770, 5 U.S.C. App. I) 
will be applicable.
    (c) In analyzing the applications, the Director may hold public 
hearings with the objective of clarifying issues that might be raised by 
the application. If desired, the Director may utilize the services of an 
examiner.
    (d) If the Director, in his discretion, decides to hold a public 
hearing, notice of such hearing shall be published in the Federal 
Register, and a copy of the notice shall be furnished to local 
newspapers. The notice shall state the subject to be considered and when 
and where the hearing will be held, specifically designating the date, 
hour, and place.
    (e) The following general procedure shall govern the conduct of 
public hearings: (1) Stenographic minutes of the proceedings shall be 
made; (2) the names and addresses of all parties present or represented 
at the hearing shall be recorded; and (3) the Director or Examiner shall 
read aloud for the record and for the benefit of the public such parts 
of the Act and of these regulations as bear on the application. He shall 
also read aloud for the record and for the benefit of the public such 
other important papers, or extracts therefrom, as may be necessary for a 
full understanding of the issues which require clarification. The 
Director or Examiner shall impress upon the parties in attendance at the 
public hearing, and shall specifically state at the commencement of the 
hearing, that the hearing is not adversary in nature and that the sole 
objective thereof is to clarify issues that might have been raised by 
the application.
    (f) Statements of interested parties may be presented orally at the 
hearing, or submitted in writing for the record.
    (g) Within six months after receipt of a fully completed application 
and/or the adjournment of the public hearing, the Director shall submit 
his report containing his findings on the application to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 310.5  Report of the Secretary on Federal recognition.

    If the Director's report recommends Federal recognition, the 
Secretary, within a reasonable time, shall submit a report to the 
President.
    (a) The Secretary's report shall include: (1) An evaluation of the 
purposes and reasons for the exposition; and (2) a determination as to 
whether guaranteed financial and other support has been secured by the 
exposition from affected State and local governments and from business 
and civic leaders of the region and others in amounts sufficient

[[Page 40]]

to assure the successful development and progress of the exposition.
    (b) Based on information from, and coordination with the Department 
of Commerce the Secretary of State shall also file a report with the 
President that the exposition qualifies for recognition by the BIE.


<R05>
Sec. 310.6  Recognition by the President.

    If the President concurs in the favorable reports from the 
Secretaries of State and Commerce, he may grant Federal recognition to 
the exposition by indicating his concurrence to the two Secretaries and 
authorizing them to seek BIE registration.


<R05>
Sec. 310.7  Statement for Federal participation.

    If Federal participation in the exposition, as well as Federal 
recognition thereof is desired, the applicant shall in a statement to 
the Director outline the nature of the Federal participation envisioned, 
including whether construction of a Federal pavilion is contemplated. 
(It should be noted, however, that before Federal participation can be 
authorized by the Congress under the Act, the exposition must have (i) 
met the criteria for Federal recognition and be so recognized, and (ii) 
been registered by the BIE. Although applicants need not submit such a 
statement until these prerequisites are satisfied, they are encouraged 
to do so.) Where the desired Federal participation includes a request 
for construction of a Federal pavilion, the statement shall be 
accompanied by the following exhibits:

    1. Exhibit No. 1. A survey drawing of the proposed Federal pavilion 
site, showing its areas and boundaries, its grade elevations, and 
surface and subsoil conditions.
    2. Exhibit No. 2. Evidence of resolutions, statutes, opinions, etc., 
as to the applicant's ability to convey by deed the real property 
comprising the proposed Federal pavilion site in fee-simple and free of 
liens and encumbrances to the Federal Government. The only consideration 
on the part of the Government for the conveyance of the property shall 
be the Government's commitment to participate in the exposition.
    3. Exhibit No. 3. A certified copy of the building code which would 
be applicable should a pavilion be constructed.
    4. Exhibit No. 4. An engineering drawing showing the accessibility 
of the proposed pavilion site to utilities (e.g., sewerage, water, gas, 
electricity, etc.).
    5. Exhibit No. 5. A statement setting forth the security and 
maintenance and arrangements which the applicant would undertake (and an 
estimate of their cost) while a pavilion is under construction.
    6. Exhibit No. 6. A study pursuant to Executive Order 11296 of 
August 10, 1966, entitled ``Evaluation of flood hazard in locating 
Federally owned or financed buildings, roads and other facilities and in 
disposing of Federal land and properties.''


<R05>
Sec. 310.8  Proposed plan for Federal participation.

    (a) Upon receipt of the statement, and the exhibits referred to in 
Sec. 310.7, the Director shall prepare a proposed plan in cooperation 
with other interested departments and agencies of the Federal Government 
for Federal participation in the exposition.
    (b) In preparing the proposed plan for Federal participation in the 
exposition, the Director shall conduct a feasibility study of Federal 
participation including cost estimates by utilizing the services within 
the Federal Government, professional consultants and private sources as 
required and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
    (c) The Director, in the proposed plan for Federal participation in 
the exposition, shall determine whether or not a Federal pavilion should 
be constructed and, if so, whether or not the Government would have need 
for a permanent structure in the area of the exposition or whether a 
temporary structure would be more appropriate.
    (d) The Director shall seek the advice of the Administrator of the 
General Services Administration to the extent necessary in carrying out 
the proposed plan for Federal participation in the exposition.
    (e) Upon completion of the proposed plan for Federal participation 
in the exposition, the Director shall submit the plan to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 310.9  Report of the Secretary on Federal participation.

    Upon receipt of the Director's proposed plan for Federal 
participation, the Secretary, within a reasonable time, shall submit a 
report to the President including: (a) Evidence that the exposition has 
met the criteria for

[[Page 41]]

Federal recognition and has been so recognized; (b) a statement that the 
exposition has been registered by the BIE; and (c) a proposed plan for 
the Federal participation referred to in Sec. 310.8.

    (14) A proposed non-confidential summary of the export conduct for 
which certification is sought. This summary may be used as the basis for 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (15) Any other information that the applicant believes will be 
necessary or helpful to a determination of whether to issue a 
certificate under the standards of the Act.
    (16) (Optional) A draft proposed certificate.
    (c) The applicant must sign the application and certify that (1) 
each member has authorized the applicant to submit the application, and 
(2) to the best of its belief the information in the application is 
true, correct, and fully responsive.

submitted unless it complies with these regulations. Applicants are 
encouraged to seek guidance and assistance from the Department of 
Commerce in preparing and documenting their applications.
    (e) Review and acceptance. The Secretary will stamp the application 
on the day that it is received in the Office of Export Trading Company 
Affairs. From that date, the Secretary will have five working days to 
decide whether the application is complete and can be deemed submitted 
under the Act. On the date on which the application is deemed submitted, 
the Secretary will stamp it with that date and notify the applicant that 
the application has been accepted for review. If the application is not 
accepted for review, the Secretary shall advise the applicant that it

    (g) Supplemental information. After an application has been deemed 
submitted, if the Secretary or the Attorney General finds that 
additional information is necessary to make a determination on the 
application, the Secretary will ask the applicant in writing to supply 
the supplemental information. The running of the time period for a 
determination on the application will be suspended from the date on 
which the request is sent until the supplemental information is received 
and is considered complete. The Secretary shall promptly decide whether 
the supplemental information is complete, and shall notify the applicant 
of his decision. If the information is being sought by the Attorney 
General, the supplemental information may be deemed complete only if the 
Attorney General concurs. If the applicant does not agree to provide the 
additional information, or supplies information which the Secretary or 
the Attorney General considers incomplete, the Secretary and the 
Attorney General will decide whether the information in their possession 
is sufficient to make a determination on the application. If either the 
Secretary or the Attorney General considers the information in their 
possession insufficient, the Secretary may make an additional request or 
shall deny the application. If they consider the information in their 
possession sufficient to make a determination on the application, the 
Secretary shall notify the applicant that the time period for a 
determination has resumed running.

    (a) Action subject to modification or revocation. The Secretary 
shall revoke a certificate, in whole or in part, or modify it, as the 
Secretary or the Attorney General considers necessary, if:
    (1) The export conduct of a person or entity protected by the 
certificate no longer complies with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 325.4(b);

[[Page 49]]

    (2) A person or entity protected by the certificate fails to comply 
with a request for information under paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (3) The certificate holder fails to file a complete annual report.
    (b) Request for information. If the Secretary or the Attorney 
General has reason to believe that the export trade, export trade 
activities, or methods of operation of a person or entity protected by a 
certificate no longer comply with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 325.4(b), the Secretary shall request any information that he or 
the Attorney General considers to be necessary to resolve the matter.
    (c) Proceedings for the revocation or modification of a 
certificate--(1) Notification letter. If, after reviewing the relevant 
information in their possession, it appears to the Secretary or the 
Attorney General that a certificate should be revoked or modified for 
any of the reasons set forth in paragraph (a) above, the Secretary shall 
so notify the certificate holder in writing. The notification shall be 
sent by registered or certified mail to the address specified in the 
certificate. The notification shall include a detailed statement of the 
facts, conduct, or circumstances which may warrant the revocation or 
modification of the certificate.
    (2) Answer. The certificate holder shall respond to the notification 
letter within thirty days after receiving it, unless the Secretary, in 
his discretion, grants a thirty day extension for good cause shown. The 
certificate holder shall respond specifically to the statement included 
with the notification letter and state in detail why the facts, conduct 
or circumstances described in the notification letter are not true, or 
if they are true, why they do not warrant the revoking or modifying of 
the certificate. If the certificate holder does not respond within the 
specified period, it will be considered an admission of the statements 
contained in the notification letter.
    (3) Resolution of factual disputes. Where material facts are in 
dispute, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall, upon request, 
meet informally with the certificate holder. The Secretary or the 
Attorney General may require the certificate holder to provide any 
documents or information that are necessary to support its contentions. 
After reviewing the statements of the certificate holder and the 
documents or information that the certificate holder has submitted, and 
upon considering other relevant documents or information in his 
possession, the Secretary shall make proposed findings of the factual 
matters in dispute. The Attorney General is not bound by the proposed 
findings.
    (4) Final determination. The Secretary and the Attorney General 
shall review the notification letter and the certificate holder's answer 
to it, the proposed factual findings made under paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, and any other relevant documents or information in their 
possession. If, after review, the Secretary or the Attorney General 
determines that the export conduct of a person or entity protected by 
the certificate no longer complies with the standards set forth in 
Sec. 325.4(b), the Secretary shall revoke or modify the certificate as 
appropriate. If the Secretary or the Attorney General determines that 
the certificate holder has failed to comply with the request for 
information under paragraph (b) of this section, or has failed to file a 
complete annual report, and that the failure to comply or file should 
result in revocation of modification, the Secretary shall revoke or 
modify the certificate as appropriate. The determination will be final 
and will be issued to the certificate holder in writing. The notice to 
the certificate holder shall include a statement of the circumstances 
underlying and the reasons in support of the determination. If the 
Secretary determines to revoke or modify the certificate, the decision 
shall specify the effective date of the revocation or modification; this 
date must be at least thirty days but not more than ninety days after 
the Secretary notifies the certificate holder of his determination. The 
Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of a revocation 
or modification or a decision not to revoke or modify.
    (d) Investigative information. In proceedings under this section, 
the Attorney General shall make available to the Secretary any 
information that has

[[Page 50]]

been obtained in response to Civil Investigative Demands issued under 
section 304(b)(3) of the Act. Unless prohibited by law, the Attorney 
General and the Secretary shall also make available to each other any 
other information which each is relying upon under these proceedings.

of the determination, bring an action in an appropriate district court 
of the United States to set aside the determination on the ground that 
it is erroneous. If a certificate is denied, the applicant may bring 
suit within thirty days after the notice of denial is published in the 
Federal Register, or, if the applicant seeks reconsideration, within 
thirty days after the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register notice 
of his determination after reconsideration.
    (b) For purposes of judicial review, determinations of the Secretary 
are final when notice is published in the Federal Register.
    (c) Record for judicial review. For purposes of judicial review, the 
record shall include all information presented to or obtained by the 
Secretary which had a bearing on the determination, the determination 
itself, the supporting statement setting forth the reasons for the 
determination, and the Attorney General's response to the Secretary 
indicating concurrence or nonconcurrence.
    (d) Limitation of judicial review. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a) of this section, no agency action taken under the Act shall be 
subject to judicial review.

certificate, neither the negative determination nor the statement of 
reasons therefor shall be admissible in evidence in any administrative 
or judicial proceeding in support of any claim under the antitrust laws.

certificate, an update of the information contained in the application 
brought current to the anniversary date, and any other information the 
Secretary considers appropriate, after consultation with the Attorney 
General.
    (b) Not later than forty-five days after each anniversary of a 
certificate's effective date, a certificate holder shall submit its 
annual report to the Secretary. The Secretary shall deliver a copy of 
the annual report to the Attorney General.
    (c) Failure to submit a complete annual report may be the basis for 
modification or revocation of a certificate.

    (a) Each Tariff Rate Quota (HTS 9902.51.11 and HTS 9902.51.12) will 
be allocated separately. Allocation will be based on an applicant's 
Worsted Wool Suit production, on a weighted average basis, and the 
proportion of imported Worsted Wool Fabric consumed in the production of 
Worsted Wool Suits.
    (b) For the purpose of calculating allocations, Worsted Wool Suit 
production will be increased by the percentage of imported fabric 
consumed in the production of Worsted Wool Suits to total fabric 
consumed in this production. For example, if an applicant uses 30 
percent imported fabric in the production of Worsted Wool Suits, that 
applicant's production level will be increased by 30 percent.
    (c) The Department will cause to be published in the Federal 
Register its determination to allocate the Tariff Rate Quotas and will 
notify applicants of their respective allocation as soon as possible. 
Promptly thereafter, the Department will issue licenses.


<R05>
Sec. 335.5  Licenses.

    (a) Each Licensee will receive a license, which will include a 
unique control number. The license is subject to the surrender and 
reallocation provisions in Sec. 335.6.
    (b) A license may be exercised only for fabric entered for 
consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during the 
Tariff Rate Quota Year specified in the license. A license will be 
debited on the basis of date of entry for consumption or withdrawal from 
warehouse for consumption.
    (c) A Licensee may import fabric certified by the importer as 
suitable for use in making suits, suit-type jackets, or trousers under 
the appropriate Tariff Rate Quota as specified in the license (i.e., 
under the Tariff Rate Quota for fabric of worsted wool with average 
fiber diameters greater than 18.5 micron or the Tariff Rate Quota for 
fabric of worsted wool with average fiber diameters of 18.5 micron or 
less) up to the quantity specified in the license subject to the Tariff 
Rate Quota duty rate. Only a Licensee or an importer authorized by a 
Licensee will be permitted to import fabric under the Tariff Rate Quotas 
and to receive the Tariff Rate Quota duty rate.
    (d) The term of a license shall be the Tariff Rate Quota Year for 
which it is issued. Fabric may be entered or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption under a license only during the term of that license. 
The license cannot be used for fabric entered or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption after December 31 of the year of the term of 
the license.
    (e) The importer of record of fabric entered or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption under a license must

[[Page 54]]

be the Licensee or an importer authorized by the Licensee to act on its 
behalf. If the importer of record is the Licensee, the importer must 
possess the license at the time of filing the entry summary or warehouse 
withdrawal for consumption (Customs Form 7501).
    (f) A Licensee may only authorize an importer to import fabric under 
the license on its behalf by making such an authorization in writing or 
by electronic notice to the importer and providing a copy of such 
authorization to the Department. A Licensee may only withdraw 
authorization from an importer by notifying the importer, in writing or 
by electronic notice, and providing a copy to the Department.
    (g) The written authorization must include the unique number of the 
license, must specifically cover the type of fabric imported, and must 
be in the possession of the importer at the time of filing the entry 
summary or warehouse withdrawal for consumption (Customs Form 7501), or 
its electronic equivalent, in order for the importer to obtain the 
applicable Tariff Rate Quota duty rate.
    (h) It is the responsibility of the Licensee to safeguard the use of 
the license issued. The Department and the U.S. Customs Service will not 
be liable for any unauthorized or improper use of the license.


<R05>
Sec. 335.6  Surrender, reallocation and license utilization requirement.

    (a) Not later than September 30 of each Tariff Rate Quota Year, a 
Licensee that will not import the full quantity granted in a license 
during the Tariff Rate Quota Year shall surrender the allocation that 
will not be used to the Department for purposes of reallocation through 
a written or electronic notice to the Department, including the license 
control number and the amount being surrendered. The surrender shall be 
final, and shall apply only to that Tariff Rate Quota Year.
    (b) For purposes of this section, ``unused allocation'' means the 
amount by which the quantity set forth in a license, including any 
additional amount received pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, 
exceeds the quantity entered under the license, excluding any amount 
surrendered pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The Department will notify Licensees of any amount surrendered 
and the application period for requests for reallocation. A Licensee 
that has imported, or intends to import, a quantity of Worsted Wool 
Fabric exceeding the quantity set forth in its license may apply to 
receive additional allocation from the amount to be reallocated. The 
application shall state the maximum amount of additional allocation the 
applicant will be able to use.
    (d) The amount surrendered will be reallocated to Licensees that 
have applied for reallocation. The entire amount surrendered will be 
reallocated pro-rata among applicants based on the applicant's share of 
the annual allocation, but will not exceed the amount set forth in the 
reallocation application as the maximum amount able to be used.
    (e) A Licensee whose unused allocation in a Tariff Rate Quota Year 
exceeds five percent of the quantity set forth in its license shall be 
subject to having its allocation reduced in the subsequent Tariff Rate 
Quota Year. The subsequent Tariff Rate Quota Year allocation will be 
reduced from the quantity such Licensee would otherwise have received by 
a quantity equal to 25 percent of its unused allocation from the prior 
year. A Licensee whose unused allocation in two consecutive Tariff Rate 
Quota Years exceeds five percent of the quantity set forth in its 
license shall have its allocation reduced in the subsequent Tariff Rate 
Quota Year by a quantity equal to 50 percent of its unused allocation 
from the prior year.
    (f) No penalty will be imposed under paragraph (e) of this section 
if the Licensee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department that 
the unused allocation resulted from breach by a carrier of its contract 
of carriage, breach by a supplier of its contract to supply the fabric, 
act of God, or force majeure.


<R05>
Sec. 335.7  Modifications of the limitation.

    In the event the limitation on the quantity of imports of Worsted 
Wool Fabric under the Tariff Rate Quotas is increased, the increase will 
be allocated on the same basis as the rest of

[[Page 55]]

the Tariff Rate Quotas. Licenses will be issued or adjusted accordingly.

    Source: 56 FR 50798, Oct. 8, 1991, unless otherwise noted.


<R04>
                    Subpart A--Scope and Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 400.1  Scope.

    (a) This part sets forth the regulations, including the rules of 
practice and procedure, of the Foreign-Trade Zones Board with regard to 
foreign-trade zones in the United States pursuant to the Foreign-Trade 
Zones Act of 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u). It includes the 
substantive and procedural rules for the authorization of zones and the 
regulation of zone activity. The purpose of zones as stated in the Act 
is to ``expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and other purposes.'' 
The regulations provide the legal framework for accomplishing this 
purpose in the context of evolving U.S. economic and trade policy, and 
economic factors relating to international competition.
    (b) Part 146 of the regulations of the United States Customs Service 
(19 CFR part 146) governs zone operations, including the admission of 
merchandise into zones, zone activity involving such merchandise, and 
the transfer of merchandise from zones.
    (c) To the extent ``activated'' under Customs procedures in 19 CFR 
part 146, and only for the purposes specified in the Act (19 U.S.C. 
81c), zones are treated for purposes of the tariff laws and Customs 
entry procedures as being outside the Customs territory of the United 
States. Under zone procedures, foreign and domestic merchandise may be 
admitted into zones for operations such as storage, exhibition, 
assembly, manufacture and processing, without being subject to formal 
Customs entry procedures and payment of duties, unless and until the 
foreign merchandise enters Customs territory for domestic consumption. 
At that time, the importer ordinarily has a choice of paying duties 
either at the rate applicable to the foreign material in its condition 
as admitted into a zone, or if used in manufacturing or processing, to 
the emerging product. Quota restrictions do not normally apply to 
foreign goods in zones. The Board can deny or limit the

[[Page 62]]

use of zone procedures in specific cases on public interest grounds. 
Merchandise moved into zones for export (zone-restricted status) may be 
considered exported for purposes such as federal excise tax rebates and 
Customs drawback. Foreign merchandise (tangible personal property) 
admitted to a zone and domestic merchandise held in a zone for 
exportation are exempt from certain state and local ad valorem taxes (19 
U.S.C. 81o(e)). Articles admitted into zones for purposes not specified 
in the Act shall be subject to the tariff laws and regular entry 
procedures, including the payment of applicable duties, taxes, and fees.

Sec. 400.28  Conditions, prohibitions and restrictions applicable to grants of authority.

    (a) In general. Grants of authority issued by the Board for the 
establishment of zones or subzones, including

[[Page 71]]

those already issued, are subject to the Act and this part and the 
following general conditions or limitations:
    (1) Approvals from the grantee and the Port Director, pursuant to 19 
CFR part 146, are required prior to the activation of any portion of an 
approved zone project; and
    (2) Approval of the Board or the Commerce Department's Assistant 
Secretary for Import Administration pursuant to subpart D of this part 
is required prior to the commencement of manufacturing beyond the scope 
of that approved as part of the application or pursuant to reviews under 
this part (e.g., new end products, significant expansions of plant 
production capacity), and of similar changes in processing activity 
which involves foreign articles subject to quantitative import controls 
(quotas) or results in articles subject to a lower (actual or effective) 
duty rate (inverted tariff) than any of their foreign components.
    (3) Sourcing changes--(i) Notification requirement. The grantee or 
operator of a zone or subzone shall notify the Executive Secretary when 
there is a change in sourcing for authorized manufacturing or processing 
activity which involves the use of new foreign articles subject to 
quotas or inverted tariffs, unless--
    (A) Entries for consumption are not to be made at the lower duty 
rate; or
    (B) The product in which the foreign articles are to be incorporated 
is being produced for exportation.
    (ii) Notification procedure. Notification shall be given prior to 
the commencement of the activity, when possible, otherwise at the time 
the new foreign articles arrive in the zone or are withdrawn from 
inventory for use in production. Requests may be made to the Executive 
Secretary for authority to submit notification of sourcing changes on a 
quarterly federal fiscal year basis covering changes in the previous 
quarter.
    (iii) Reviews. (A) Upon notification of a sourcing change under 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, within 30 days, the Executive 
Secretary will conduct a preliminary review of the changes in relation 
to the approved activity to determine whether they could have 
significant adverse effects, taking into account the factors enumerated 
in Sec. 400.31(b), and will submit a report and recommendation to the 
Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, who 
shall determine whether review is necessary. The procedures of 
Sec. 400.32(b) shall be used in these situations when appropriate.
    (B) The Board or the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for 
Import Administration may, based on public interest grounds, prohibit or 
restrict the use of zone procedures in regard to the change in sourcing, 
including requiring that items be placed in privileged foreign status 
(19 CFR 146.41) upon admission to a zone or subzone.
    (C) The Executive Secretary shall direct reviews necessary to ensure 
that activity involved in these situations continues to be in the public 
interest.
    (4) Prior to activation of a zone, the zone grantee or operator 
shall obtain all necessary permits from federal, state and local 
authorities, and except as otherwise specified in the Act or this part, 
shall comply with the requirements of those authorities.
    (5) A grant of authority for a zone or a subzone shall lapse unless 
the zone project (in case of subzones, the subzone facility) is 
activated, pursuant to 19 CFR part 146, and in operation not later than 
five years from:
    (i) A Board order (authorizing the zone or subzone) issued after 
November 7, 1991; or
    (ii) November 7, 1991.
    (6) A grant of authority approved under this subpart includes 
authority for the grantee to permit the erection of buildings necessary 
to carry out the approved zone project subject to concurrence of the 
Port Director.
    (7) Zone grantees, operators, and users shall permit federal 
government officials acting in an official capacity to have access to 
the zone project and records during normal business hours and under 
other reasonable circumstances.
    (8) A grant of authority may not be sold, conveyed, transferred, set 
over, or assigned (FTZ Act, section 17; 19 U.S.C. 81q). Private 
ownership of zone land and facilities is permitted provided the zone 
grantee retains the control necessary to implement the approved zone

[[Page 72]]

project. Should title to land or facilities be transferred after a grant 
of authority is issued, the zone grantee must retain, by agreement with 
the new owner, a level of control which allows the grantee to carry out 
its responsibilities as grantee. The sale of a zone site or facility for 
more than its fair market value without zone status could, depending on 
the circumstances, be subject to section 17 of the Act.
    (9) A grant of authority will not be construed to make the zone 
grantee automatically liable for violations by operators, users, or 
other parties.
    (b) Additional conditions, prohibitions and restrictions. Other 
requirements, conditions or restrictions under Federal, State or local 
law may apply to the zone or subzone authorized by the grant of 
authority.
    (c) Revocation of grants of authority. (1) In general. As provided 
in this section, the Board can revoke in whole or in part a grant of 
authority for a zone or subzone whenever it determines that the zone 
grantee or, in the case of subzones, the subzone operator, has violated, 
repeatedly and willfully, the provisions of the Act.
    (2) Procedure. When the Board has reason to believe that the 
conditions for revocation, as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, are met, the Board will:
    (i) Notify the zone or subzone grantee in writing stating the nature 
of the alleged violations, and provide the grantee an opportunity to 
request a hearing on the proposed revocation;
    (ii) Conduct a hearing, if requested or otherwise if appropriate;
    (iii) Make a determination on the record of the proceeding not 
earlier than 4 months after providing notice to the zone grantee under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (iv) If the Board's determination is affirmative, publish notice of 
revocation of the grant of authority in the Federal Register.
    (3) As provided in section 18 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 81r(c)), the 
zone or subzone grantee may appeal an order of the Board revoking the 
grant of authority.

FR 53535, Oct. 15, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 400.29  Application fees.

    (a) In general. This section sets forth a uniform system of charges 
in the form of fees to recover some costs incurred by the Foreign-Trade 
Zones staff of the Department of Commerce in processing the applications 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section. The legal authority for the 
fees is 31 U.S.C. 9701, which provides for the collection of user fees 
by agencies of the Federal Government.
    (b) Uniform system of user fee charges. The following graduated fee 
schedule establishes fees for certain types of applications and requests 
for authority based on their average processing time. Applications 
combining requests for more than one type of approval are subject to the 
fee for each category.

(1) Additional general-purpose zones (Sec.  400.24; Sec.          $3,200
 400.21(a)(2)).................................................
(2) Special-purpose subzones (Sec.  400.25):
  (i) Non-manufacturing/processing or less than three products.    4,000
  (ii) Manufacturing/processing--three or more products........    6,500
(3) Expansions (Sec.  400.26(b))...............................    1,600
 

    (c) Applications submitted to the Board shall include a check drawn 
on a national or state bank or trust company of the United States or 
Puerto Rico in the amount called for in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Uncertified checks must be acceptable for deposit by a Federal Reserve 
bank or branch.
    (d) Applicants shall make their checks payable to the U.S. 
Department of Commerce ITA. The checks will be deposited by ITA into the 
Treasury receipts account. If applications are found deficient under 
Sec. 400.27(b)(1), or withdrawn by applicants prior to formal filing, 
refunds will be made.


<R04>
        Subpart D--Manufacturing and Processing Activity--Reviews


<R05>
Sec. 400.31  Manufacturing and processing activity; criteria.

    (a) In general. Pursuant to section 15(c) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 
81o(c)), the Board has authority to restrict or prohibit zone activity 
``that in its judgment is detrimental to the public interest.'' When 
evaluating zone and subzone manufacturing and processing activity, 
either as proposed in an application, in a request for manufacturing/

[[Page 73]]

processing approval, or as part of a review of an ongoing operation, the 
Board shall determine whether the activity is in the public interest by 
reviewing it in relation to the evaluation criteria contained in 
paragraph (b) of this section. With regard to processing activity, this 
section shall apply only when the activity involves foreign articles 
subject to quantitative import controls (quotas) or results in articles 
subject to a lower duty rate (inverted tariff) than any of their foreign 
components. Such a review involves consideration of whether the activity 
is consistent with trade policy and programs, and whether its net 
economic effect is positive.
    (b) Evaluation criteria--(1) Threshold factors. It is the policy of 
the Board to authorize zone activity only when it is consistent with 
public policy and, in regard to activity involving foreign merchandise 
subject to quotas or inverted tariffs, when zone procedures are not the 
sole determining cause of imports. Thus, without undertaking a review of 
the economic factors enumerated in Sec. 400.31(b)(2), the Board shall 
deny or restrict authority for proposed or ongoing activity if it 
determines that:
    (i) The activity is inconsistent with U.S. trade and tariff law, or 
policy which has been formally adopted by the Executive branch;
    (ii) Board approval of the activity under review would seriously 
prejudice U.S. tariff and trade negotiations or other initiatives; or
    (iii) The activity involves items subject to quantitative import 
controls or inverted tariffs, and the use of zone procedures would be 
the direct and sole cause of imports that, but for such procedures, 
would not likely otherwise have occurred, taking into account imports 
both as individual items and as components of imported products.
    (2) Economic factors. After its review of threshold factors, if 
there is a basis for further consideration, the Board shall consider the 
following factors in determiing the net economic effect of the activity 
or proposed activity:
    (i) Overall employment impact;
    (ii) Exports and reexports;
    (iii) Retention or creation of manufacturing or processing activity;
    (iv) Extent of value-added activity;
    (v) Overall effect on import levels of relevant products, including 
import displacement;
    (vi) Extent and nature of foreign competition in relevant products;
    (vii) Impact on related domestic industry, taking into account 
market conditions; and
    (viii) Other relevant information relating to public interest and 
net economic impact considerations, including technology transfers and 
investment effects.
    (c) Methodology and evidence--(1)(i) The first phase 
(Sec. 400.31(b)) involves consideration of threshold factors. If an 
examiner or reviewer makes a negative finding on any of the factors in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the course of a review, the 
applicant shall be informed pursuant to Sec. 400.27(d)(3)(vii)(A). When 
threshold factors are the basis for a negative recommendation in a 
review of ongoing activity, the zone grantee and directly affected party 
shall be notified and given an opportunity to submit evidence pursuant 
to Sec. 400.27(d)(3)(vii)(A). If the Board determines in the negative 
any of the factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it shall deny or 
restrict authority for the proposed or ongoing activity.
    (ii) The process for paragraph (b)(2) of this section involves 
consideration of the enumerated economic factors, taking into account 
their relative weight and significance under the circumstances. Previous 
evaluations in similar cases are considered. The net effect is arrived 
at by balancing the positive and negative factors and arriving at a net 
economic effect.
    (2) Contributory effect. In assessing the significance of the 
economic effect of the zone activity as part of the consideration of 
economic factors, and in consideration of whether there is a significant 
public benefit, the Board may consider the contributory effect zone 
savings have as an incremental part of cost effectiveness programs 
adopted by companies to improve their international competitiveness.
    (3) Burden of proof. Applicants for subzones shall have the burden 
of submitting evidence establishing that the

[[Page 74]]

activity does or would result in a significant public benefit, taking 
into account the factors in paragraph (b) of this section. Applicants 
for approval of manufacturing or processing in general-purpose zones 
shall submit evidence regarding the positive economic effects that would 
result from activity within the zone and may submit evidence and 
comments as to policy considerations. Both types of applicants are 
expected to submit information in response to evidence of adverse 
economic effects during the public comment period. Parties should submit 
evidence that is probative and substantial in addressing the matter in 
issue.
    (d) Monitoring and post-approval reviews--(1) Ongoing zone activity 
may be reviewed at anytime to determine whether it is in compliance with 
the Act and regulations, as well as the authority granted by the Board. 
Reviews may also be conducted to determine whether there are changed 
circumstances that raise questions as to whether the activity is 
detrimental to the public interest, taking into account the factors 
enumerated in Sec. 400.31. The Board may prescribe special monitoring 
requirements in its decisions when appropriate.
    (2) Reviews may be initiated by the Board, the Commerce Department's 
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, or the Executive 
Secretary; or, they may be undertaken in response to requests from 
parties directly affected by the activity in question and showing good 
cause.
    (3) Upon review, if the Board finds that zone activity is no longer 
in the public interest, taking into account the provisions of 
Sec. 400.31, it may restrict the activity in question. The 
appropriateness of a delayed effective date will be considered in such 
cases.

<R05>
Sec. 400.32  Procedure for review of request for approval of manufacturing or processing.

    (a) Request as part of application for grant of authority. A request 
for approval of proposed manufacturing or processing activity may be 
submitted as part of an application under Secs. 400.24-400.26(a). The 
Board will review the request taking into account the criteria in 
Sec. 400.31(b).
    (b) Request for manufacturing/processing in approved zone or 
subzone. Prior to the commencement of manufacturing in a zone or subzone 
involving activity beyond the scope of that which has been previously 
authorized at the facility (i.e., new end products, significant 
expansions of plant production capacity), and of similar changes in 
processing activity that involves foreign articles subject to quotas or 
inverted tariffs, zone grantees or operators shall request the 
determination referred to in Sec. 400.31(a) by submitting a request in 
writing to the Executive Secretary (Sec. 400.28(a)(2)). Such requests 
shall include the information required by Secs. 400.24(d)(4)(vii) and 
400.25.
    (1) The Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for Import 
Administration may make determinations in these cases based upon a 
review by the FTZ staff and the recommendation of the Executive 
Secretary, when:
    (i) The proposed activity is the same, in terms of products 
involved, to activity recently approved by the Board and similar in 
circumstances; or
    (ii) The activity is for export only; or
    (iii) The zone benefits sought do not involve the election of non-
privileged foreign status (19 CFR 146.42) on items involving inverted 
tariffs; or
    (iv) The Port Director determines that the activity could otherwise 
be conducted under Customs bonded procedures.
    (2) When the informal procedure in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
is not appropriate--
    (i) The Executive Secretary will:
    (A) Assign a case docket number and give notice in the Federal 
Register inviting public comment;
    (B) Arrange a public hearing, if appropriate;
    (C) Appoint an examiner, if appropriate, to conduct a review and 
prepare a report with recommendations for the Board; and
    (D) Prepare and transmit a report with recommendations, or transmit 
the examiners report, to the Board for appropriate action; and

[[Page 75]]

    (ii) The Board will make a determination on the requests, and the 
Executive Secretary will notify the grantee in writing of the Board's 
determination, and will publish notice of the determination in the 
Federal Register.
    (c) Scope determinations. Determinations shall be made by the 
Executive Secretary as to whether changes in activity are within the 
scope of related activity already approved for the facility involved 
under this part. When warranted, the procedures of paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section will be followed.

[56 FR 50798, Oct. 8, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 53535, Oct. 15, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 400.33  Restrictions on manufacturing and processing activity.

    (a) In general. In approving manufacturing or processing activity 
for a zone or subzone the Board may adopt restrictions to protect the 
public interest, health, or safety. The Commerce Department's Assistant 
Secretary for Import Administration may similarly adopt restrictions in 
exercising authority under Sec. 400.32(b)(1).
    (b) Restrictions on items subject to antidumping and countervailing 
duty actions--(1) Board policy. Zone procedures shall not be used to 
circumvent antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) actions under 
19 CFR parts 353 and 355.
    (2) Admission of items subject to AD/CVD actions. Items subject to 
AD/CVD orders or items which would be otherwise subject to suspension of 
liquidation under AD/CVD procedures, if they entered U.S. Customs 
territory, shall be placed in privileged foreign status (19 CFR 146.41) 
upon admission to a zone or subzone. Upon entry for consumption, such 
items shall be subject to duties under AD/CVD orders or to suspension of 
liquidation, as appropriate, under 19 CFR parts 353 and 355.


<R04>
       Subpart E--Zone Operations and Administrative Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 400.41  Zone operations; general.

    Zones shall be operated by or under the contractual oversight of 
zone grantees, subject to the requirements of the Act and this part, as 
well as those of other federal, state and local agencies having 
jurisdiction over the site and operation. Zone grantees shall ensure 
that the reasonable zone needs of the business community are served by 
their zone projects. The Port Director represents the Board with regard 
to the zone projects in the district and is responsible for enforcement, 
including physical security and access requirements, as provided in 19 
CFR part 146.

[56 FR 50798, Oct. 8, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 53535, Oct. 15, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 400.42  Requirements for commencement of operations in a zone project.

    (a) In general. The following actions are required before operations 
in a zone may commence:
    (1) Approval by the Port Director of an application for activation 
is required as provided in 19 CFR part 146; and
    (2) The Executive Secretary will review proposed manufacturing or 
processing, pursuant to Sec. 400.32, and a zone schedule as provided in 
this section.
    (b) Zone schedule. (1) The zone grantee shall submit to the 
Executive Secretary and to the Port Director a zone schedule which sets 
forth:
    (i) Internal rules and regulations for the zone; and
    (ii) A statement of the rates and charges (fees) applicable to zone 
users.
    (2) A zone schedule shall consist of typed, loose-leaf, numbered, 
letter-sized pages, enclosed in covers, and shall contain:
    (i) A title page, with information to include:
    (A) The name of the zone grantee and operator(s);
    (B) Schedule identification;
    (C) Site description;
    (D) Date of original schedule; and
    (E) Name of the preparer;
    (ii) A table of contents;
    (iii) Administrative information;
    (iv) A statement of zone operating policy, rules and regulations, 
including uniform procedures regarding the construction of buildings and 
facilities; and
    (v) A section listing rates and charges for zones and subzones with 
information sufficient for the Board or the Executive Secretary to 
determine

[[Page 76]]

whether the rates and charges are reasonable based on other like 
operations in the port of entry area, and whether there is uniform 
treatment under like circumstances among zone users.
    (3) The Executive Secretary will review the schedule to determine 
whether it contains sufficient information for users concerning the 
operation of the facility and a statement of rates and charges as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the Executive Secretary 
determines that the schedule satisfies these requirements, the Executive 
Secretary will notify the zone grantee, unless there is a basis for 
review under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. A copy of the schedule 
shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the zone 
grantee and operator. The zone grantee shall send a copy to the Port 
Director, who may submit comments to the Executive Secretary.
    (4) Amendments to the schedule shall be prepared and submitted in 
the manner described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this 
section, and listed in the concluding section of the schedule, with 
dates.
    (5) A zone user or prospective user showing good cause may object to 
the zone or subzone fee on the basis that it is not reasonable, fair and 
uniform, by submitting to the Executive Secretary a complaint in writing 
with supporting information. The Executive Secretary will review the 
complaint and issue a report and decision, which will be final unless 
appealed to the Board within 30 days. The Board or the Executive 
Secretary may otherwise initiate a review for cause. The factors 
considered in reviewing reasonableness and fairness, will include:
    (i) The going-rates and charges for like operations in the area and 
the extra costs of operating a zone, including return on investment; and
    (ii) In the case of subzones, the value of actual services rendered 
by the zone grantee or operator, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

    (a) In general. Merchandise which has been given export status by 
Customs officials (``zone-restricted merchandise''--19 CFR 146.44) may 
be returned to the Customs Territory of the United States only when the 
Board determines that the return would be in the public interest. Such 
returns are subject to the Customs laws and the payment of applicable 
duties and excise taxes (19 U.S.C. 81c, 4th proviso).
    (b) Criteria. In making the determination described in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Board will consider:
    (1) The intent of the parties;
    (2) Why the goods cannot be exported;
    (3) The public benefit involved in allowing their return; and
    (4) The recommendation of the Port Director.
    (c) Procedure. (1) A request for authority to return ``zone-
restricted'' merchandise into Customs territory shall be made to the 
Executive Secretary in letter form by the zone grantee or operator of 
the zone in which the merchandise is located, with supporting 
information and documentation.
    (2) The Executive Secretary will investigate the request and prepare 
a report for the Board.

    (a) In general. Retail trade is prohibited in zones, except that 
sales or other commercial activity involving domestic, duty-paid, and 
duty-free goods may be conducted within an activated zone project under 
permits issued by the zone grantee and approved by the Board, with the 
further exception that no permits shall be necessary for sales involving 
domestic, duty-paid or duty-free food and non-alcoholic beverage 
products sold within the zone or subzone for consumption on premises by 
persons working therein. The Port Director will determine whether an 
activity is retail trade, subject to review by the Board when the zone 
grantee requests such a review with a good cause.
    (b) Procedure. Requests for Board approval under this section shall 
be submitted in letter form, with supporting documentation, to the Port 
Director, who is authorized to act for the Board in these cases, subject 
to the concurrence of the Executive Secretary.
    (c) Criteria. In evaluating requests under this section, the Port 
Director and the Executive Secretary will consider:

<R04>
                           Subpart A--Purpose


<R05>
Sec. 700.1  Purpose of this regulation.

    (a) Title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 
U.S.C. App. 2061, et seq.) (Defense Production Act), authorizes the 
President: to require the

[[Page 82]]

priority performance of contracts and orders necessary or appropriate to 
promote the national defense over other contracts or orders; to allocate 
materials, services, and facilities as necessary or appropriate to 
promote the national defense; and to require the allocation of, or the 
priority performance under contracts or orders relating to, supplies of 
materials, equipment, and services in order to assure domestic energy 
supplies for national defense needs.
    (b) Section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 (50 U.S.C. app. 
468) (Selective Service Act) authorizes the President to place an order 
with a supplier for any articles or materials required for the exclusive 
use of the U.S. armed forces whenever the President determines that in 
the interest of national security, prompt delivery of the articles and 
materials is required. The supplier must give precedence to the order so 
as to deliver the articles or materials in a required time period. 10 
U.S.C. 2538, and 50 U.S.C. 82, provide similar authority specifically 
for Department of Defense procurement, but only in time of war or when 
war is imminent.
    (c) Section 602(b) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5195a(b)) provides that the terms 
``national defense'' and ``defense'' as used in the Defense Production 
Act includes ``emergency preparedness activities'' conducted pursuant to 
Title VI of the Stafford Act. The definition of ``national defense'' in 
Section 702(13) of the Defense Production Act provides that this term 
includes ``emergency preparedness activities'' conducted pursuant to 
Title VI of the Stafford Act.
    (d) The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation 
implements the priorities and allocations authority of the Defense 
Production Act and as this authority pertains to Title VI of the 
Stafford Act, and the priorities authority of the Selective Service Act 
and related statutes, all with respect to industrial resources. The DPAS 
ensures the timely availability of industrial resources for approved 
programs and provides an operating system to support rapid industrial 
response to a national emergency.
    (e) To aid in understanding and using the DPAS, an overview of its 
major provisions is incorporated into this regulation as subpart B--
Overview. The full text of the DPAS is found in subparts D through L.

[49 FR 30414, July 30, 1984. Redesignated at 54 FR 601, Jan. 9, 1989, as 
amended at 63 FR 31921, June 11, 1998]


<R04>
                           Subpart B--Overview


<R05>
Sec. 700.2  Introduction.

    (a) Certain national defense and energy programs (including 
emergency preparedness activities) are approved for priorities and 
allocations support. For example, military aircraft production, 
ammunition, and certain programs which maximize domestic energy supplies 
are ``approved programs.'' A complete list of currently approved 
programs is provided at Schedule 1 to this part.
    (b) The Department of Commerce administers the DPAS to ensure the 
timely delivery of industrial items to meet approved program 
requirements.
    (c) Commerce has delegated authority to place priority ratings on 
contracts or orders necessary or appropriate to promote the national 
defense to the government agencies that issue such contracts or orders. 
Schedule I includes a list of agencies delegated this authority. Copies 
of the Delegations of Authority are provided at Appendix II. They set 
forth the authorities delegated and those retained by Commerce.

[49 FR 30414, July 30, 1984. Redesignated at 54 FR 601, Jan. 9, 1989, as 
amended at 63 FR 31921, June 11, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 700.3  Priority ratings and rated orders.

    (a) Rated orders are identified by a priority rating consisting of 
the rating--either DX or DO--and a program identification symbol. Rated 
orders take preference over all unrated orders as necessary to meet 
required delivery dates. Among rated orders, DX rated orders take 
preference over DO rated orders. Program identification symbols

[[Page 83]]

indicate which approved program is involved with the rated order. For 
example, A1 identifies defense aircraft programs and A7 signifies 
defense electronic programs. The program identification symbols, in 
themselves, do not connote any priority.
    (b) Persons receiving rated orders must give them preferential 
treatment as required by this regulation. This means a person must 
accept and fill a rated order for items that the person normally 
supplies. The existence of previously accepted unrated or lower rated 
orders is not sufficient reason for rejecting a rated order. Persons are 
required to reschedule unrated orders if they conflict with performance 
against a rated order. Similarly, persons must reschedule DO rated 
orders if they conflict with performance against a DX rated order.
    (c) All rated orders must be scheduled to the extent possible to 
ensure delivery by the required delivery date.
    (d) Persons who receive rated orders must in turn place rated orders 
with their suppliers for the items they need to fill the orders. This 
provision ensures that suppliers will give priority treatment to rated 
orders from contractor to subcontractor to suppliers throughout the 
procurement chain.
    (e) Persons may place a priority rating on orders only when they are 
in receipt of a rated order, have been explicitly authorized to do so by 
the Department of Commerce or a Delegate Agency, or are otherwise 
permitted to do so by this regulation.

[49 FR 30414, July 30, 1984. Redesignated at 54 FR 601, Jan. 9, 1989, as 
amended at 63 FR 31921, June 11, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 700.4  Priorities and allocations in a national emergency.

    (a) In the event of a national emergency, special rules may be 
established as needed to supplement this part, thus ensuring rapid 
industrial response and the timely availability of critical industrial 
items and facilities to meet the urgent national defense requirements, 
including domestic emergency preparedness requirements, of approved 
programs.
    (b) The special rules established in response to the emergency may 
include provisions for the taking of certain emergency official actions 
and the allocation of critical and scarce materials and facilities.

[63 FR 31921, June 11, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 700.5  Special priorities assistance.

    (a) The DPAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, from 
time-to-time production or delivery problems will arise. In this event, 
special priorities assistance is available from Commerce and from the 
Delegate Agencies.
    (b) Special priorities assistance is available for any reason 
consistent with this regulation. Generally, special priorities 
assistance is provided to expedite deliveries, resolve delivery 
conflicts, place rated orders, locate suppliers, or to verify 
information supplied by customers and vendors. Special priorities 
assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items not 
automatically ratable.


<R05>
Sec. 700.6  Official actions.

    When necessary, Commerce takes specific official actions to 
implement or enforce the provisions of this regulation and to provide 
special priorities assistance. Such actions may include the issuance of: 
Rating Authorizations, Directives, Letters of Understanding, Set-asides, 
and compliance documents (Administrative Subpoenas, Demands for 
Information, and Inspection Authorizations).


<R05>
Sec. 700.7  Compliance.

    (a) Compliance with the provisions of this regulation and official 
actions is required by the Defense Production Act and the Selective 
Service Act and related statutes. Violators are subject to criminal 
penalties.
    (b) Any person who places or receives a rated order should be 
thoroughly familiar with, and must comply with, the provisions of this 
regulation.

                    Subpart D--Industrial Priorities


<R05>
Sec. 700.10  Delegation of authority.

    (a) The priorities and allocations authorities of the President 
under Title I of the Defense Production Act with respect to industrial 
resources have been delegated to the Secretary of Commerce under 
Executive Order 12919 of June 3, 1994 (59 FR 29525). The priorities 
authorities of the President under the Selective Service Act and related 
statutes with respect to industrial resources have also been delegated 
to the Secretary of Commerce under Executive Order 12742 of January 8, 
1991 (56 FR 1079).
    (b) Within the Department of Commerce, these responsibilities have 
been assigned to the Office of Strategic Industries and Economic 
Security. The Department of Commerce has authorized the Delegate 
Agencies to assign priority ratings to orders for items needed for 
approved programs. Copies of these Delegations of Authority are provided 
at Appendix II. They set forth the authorities delegated and those 
retained by Commerce.

<R05>
Sec. 700.11  Priority ratings.

    (a) Levels of priority. (1) There are two levels of priority 
established by this regulation, identified by the rating symbols ``DO'' 
and ``DX''.
    (2) All DO rated orders have equal priority with each other and take 
preference over unrated orders. All DX rated orders have equal priority 
with each other and take preference over DO rated orders and unrated 
orders. (For resolution of conflicts among rated orders of equal 
priority, see Sec. 700.14(c).)
    (3) In addition, a Directive issued by Commerce takes preference 
over any DX rated order, DO rated order, or unrated order, as stipulated 
in the Directive. (For a full discussion of Directives, see 
Sec. 700.62.)
    (b) Program identification symbols. Program identification symbols 
indicate which approved program is being supported by a rated order. The 
list of approved programs and their identification symbols are listed in 
Schedule I. For example, A1 identifies defense aircraft programs and A7 
signifies defense electronic programs. Program identification symbols, 
in themselves, do not connote any priority.
    (c) Priority ratings. A priority rating consists of the rating 
symbol--DO and DX--and the program identification symbol, such as A1, 
B2, or H6. Thus, a contract for the production of an aircraft will 
contain a DO-A1 or DX-A1 priority rating. A contract for a radar set 
will contain a DO-A7 or DX-A7 priority rating.

<R05>
Sec. 700.12  Elements of a rated order.

    Each rated order must include:
    (a) The appropriate priority rating (e.g. DO-A1, DX-A4, DO-H1);
    (b) A required delivery date or dates. The words ``immediately'' or 
``as soon as possible'' do not constitute a delivery date. A 
``requirements contract'', ``basic ordering agreement'', ``prime vendor 
contract'', or similar procurement document bearing a priority rating 
may contain no specific delivery date or dates and may provide for the 
furnishing of items from time-to-time or within a stated period against 
specific purchase orders, such as ``calls'', ``requisitions'', and 
``delivery orders''. These purchase orders must specify a required 
delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date 
of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original 
procurement document;

[[Page 86]]

    (c) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital 
signature or name on an electronically placed order, of an individual 
authorized to sign rated orders for the person placing the order. The 
signature or use of the name certifies that the rated order is 
authorized under this part and that the requirements of this part are 
being followed; and
    (d) A statement that reads in substance:

    This is a rated order certified for national defense use, and you 
are required to follow all the provisions of the Defense Priorities and 
Allocations System regulation (15 CFR part 700).

[49 FR 30414, July 30, 1984. Redesignated at 54 FR 601, Jan. 9, 1989, as 
amended at 63 FR 31922, June 11, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 700.13  Acceptance and rejection of rated orders.

    (a) Mandatory acceptance. (1) Except as otherwise specified in this 
section, a person shall accept every rated order received and must fill 
such orders regardless of any other rated or unrated orders that have 
been accepted.
    (2) A person shall not discriminate against rated orders in any 
manner such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms 
and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.
    (b) Mandatory rejection. Unless otherwise directed by Commerce:
    (1) A person shall not accept a rated order for delivery on a 
specific date if unable to fill the order by that date. However, the 
person must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery 
can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date. 
Scheduling conflicts with previously accepted lower rated or unrated 
orders are not sufficient reason for rejection under this section.
    (2) A person shall not accept a DO rated order for delivery on a 
date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DO 
or DX rated orders. However, the person must offer to accept the order 
based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.
    (3) A person shall not accept a DX rated order for delivery on a 
date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DX 
rated orders, but must offer to accept the order based on the earliest 
delivery date otherwise possible.
    (4) If a person is unable to fill all the rated orders of equal 
priority status received on the same day, the person must accept, based 
upon the earliest delivery dates, only those orders which can be filled, 
and reject the other orders. For example, a person must accept order A 
requiring delivery on December 15 before accepting order B requiring 
delivery on December 31. However, the person must offer to accept the 
rejected orders based on the earliest delivery dates otherwise possible.
    (c) Optional rejection. Unless otherwise directed by Commerce, rated 
orders may be rejected in any of the following cases as long as a 
supplier does not discriminate among customers:
    (1) If the person placing the order is unwilling or unable to meet 
regularly established terms of sale or payment;
    (2) If the order is for an item not supplied or for a service not 
performed;
    (3) If the order is for an item produced, acquired, or provided only 
for the supplier's own use for which no orders have been filled for two 
years prior to the date of receipt of the rated order. If, however, a 
supplier has sold some of these items, the supplier is obligated to 
accept rated orders up to that quantity or portion of production, 
whichever is greater, sold within the past two years;
    (4) If the person placing the rated order, other than the U.S. 
Government, makes the item or performs the service being ordered;
    (5) If acceptance of a rated order or performance against a rated 
order would violate any other regulation, official action, or order of 
the Department of Commerce issued under the authority of the Defense 
Production Act or the Selective Service Act and related statutes [See 
Sec. 700.75].
    (d) Customer notification requirements. (1) A person must accept or 
reject a rated order in writing or electronically within fifteen (15) 
working days after receipt of a DO rated order and within ten (10) 
working days after receipt of a DX rated order. If the order is 
rejected, the person must give reasons in writing (not electronically) 
for the rejection.

[[Page 87]]

    (2) If a person has accepted a rated order and subsequently finds 
that shipment or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the 
customer immediately, give the reasons for the delay, and advise of a 
new shipment or performance date. If notification is given verbally, 
written or electronic confirmation must be provided within five (5) 
working days.

(The information collection requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) 
are approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control 
number 0694-0053.)

[49 FR 30414, July 30, 1984. Redesignated at 54 FR 601, Jan. 9, 1989, as 
amended at 63 FR 31922, June 11, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 700.14  Preferential scheduling.

    (a) A person must schedule operations, including the acquisition of 
all needed production items, in a timely manner to satisfy the delivery 
requirements of each rated order. Modifying production or delivery 
schedules is necessary only when required delivery dates for rated 
orders cannot otherwise be met.
    (b) DO rated orders must be given production preference over unrated 
orders, if necessary to meet required delivery dates, even if this 
requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery 
against unrated orders. Similarly, DX rated orders must be given 
preference over DO rated orders and unrated orders.

    Examples: If a person receives a DO rated order with a delivery date 
of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or 
delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be 
delayed. If a DX rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 
and a person has a DO rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and 
operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to 
alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX 
rated order.

    (c) Conflicting rated orders. (1) If a person finds that delivery or 
performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the 
delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal 
priority status, the person shall give preference to the conflicting 
orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed 
(not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting rated orders are 
scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person shall 
give preference to those orders which have the earliest receipt dates.
    (2) If a person is unable to resolve rated order delivery or 
performance conflicts under this section, the person should promptly 
seek special priorities assistance as provided in Secs. 700.50 through 
700.54. If the person's customer objects to the rescheduling of delivery 
or performance of a rated order, the customer should promptly seek 
special priorities assistance as provided in Secs. 700.50 through 
700.54. For any rated order against which delivery or performance will 
be delayed, the person must notify the customer as provided in 
Sec. 700.13(d)(2).
    (d) If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in 
time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person 
must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A 
person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace 
those items with the use of a rated order as provided in Sec. 700.17(b).

[49 FR 30414, July 30, 1984. Redesignated at 54 FR 601, Jan. 9, 1989, as 
amended at 63 FR 31922, June 11, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 700.15  Extension of priority ratings.

    (a) A person must use rated orders with suppliers to obtain items 
needed to fill a rated order. The person must use the priority rating 
indicated on the customer's rated order, except as otherwise provided in 
this regulation or as directed by the Department of Commerce.

    For example, if a person is in receipt of a DO-A3 rated order for a 
navigation system and needs to purchase semiconductors for its 
manufacture, that person must use a DO-A3 rated order to obtain the 
needed semiconductors.

    (b) The priority rating must be included on each successive order 
placed to obtain items needed to fill a customer's rated order. This 
continues from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the 
entire procurement chain.


<R05>
Sec. 700.16  Changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders.

    (a) The priority rating on a rated order may be changed or cancelled 
by:

[[Page 88]]

    (1) An official action of the Department of Commerce; or
    (2) Written notification from the person who placed the rated order 
(including a Delegate Agency).
    (b) If an unrated order is amended so as to make it a rated order, 
or a DO, rating is changed to a DX rating, the supplier must give the 
appropriate preferential treatment to the order as of the date the 
change is received by the supplier.
    (c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a 
supplier's original production or delivery schedule shall constitute a 
new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept 
or reject the amended order according to the provisions of Sec. 700.13.
    (d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order: a 
change in shipping destination; a reduction in the total amount of the 
order; an increase in the total amount of the order which has negligible 
impact upon deliveries; a minor variation in size or design; or a change 
which is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.
    (e) If a person no longer needs items to fill a rated order, any 
rated orders placed with suppliers for the items, or the priority rating 
on those orders, must be cancelled.
    (f) When a priority rating is added to an unrated order, or is 
changed or cancelled, all suppliers must be promptly notified in 
writing.


<R05>
Sec. 700.17  Use of rated orders.

    (a) A person must use rated orders to obtain:
    (1) Items which will be physically incorporated into other items to 
fill rated orders, including that portion of such items normally 
consumed, or converted into scrap or by-products, in the course of 
processing;
    (2) Containers or other packaging materials required to make 
delivery of the finished items against rated orders;
    (3) Services, other than contracts of employment, needed to fill 
rated orders; and
    (4) MRO needed to produce the finished items to fill rated orders. 
However, for MRO, the priority rating used must contain the program 
identification symbol H7 along with the rating symbol contained on the 
customer's rated order. For example, a person in receipt of a DO-A3 
rated order, who needs MRO, would place a DO-H7 rated order with the 
person's supplier.
    (b) A person may use a rated order to replace inventoried items 
(including finished items) if such items were used to fill rated orders, 
as follows:
    (1) The order must be placed within 90 days of the date of use of 
the inventory.
    (2) A DO rating symbol and the program identification symbol 
indicated on the customer's rated order must be used on the order. A DX 
rating symbol may not be used even if the inventory was used to fill a 
DX rated order.
    (3) If the priority ratings on rated orders from one customer or 
several customers contain different program identification symbols, the 
rated orders may be combined. In this case, the program identification 
symbol H1 must be used (i.e., DO-H1).
    (c) A person may combine DX and DO rated orders from one customer or 
several customers if the items covered by each level of priority are 
identified separately and clearly. If different program identification 
symbols are indicated on those rated orders of equal priority, the 
person must use the program identification symbol H1 (i.e., DO-H1 or DX-
H1).
    (d) Combining rated and unrated orders. (1) A person may combine 
rated and unrated order quantities on one purchase order provided that:
    (i) The rated quantities are separately and clearly identified; and
    (ii) The four elements of a rated order, as required by Sec. 700.12, 
are included on the order with the statement required in Sec. 700.12(d) 
modified to read in substance:

    This purchase order contains rated order quantities certified for 
national defense use, and you are required to follow all the provisions 
of the Defense Priorities and Allocations System regulation (15 CFR part 
700) only as it pertains to the rated quantities.

    (2) A supplier must accept or reject the rated portion of the 
purchase order as provided in Sec. 700.13 and give preferential 
treatment only to the rated quantities as required by this part.

[[Page 89]]

This part may not be used to give preferential treatment to the unrated 
portion of the order.
    (3) Any supplier who believes that rated and unrated orders are 
being combined in a manner contrary to the intent of this regulation or 
in a fashion that causes undue or exceptional hardship may submit a 
request for adjustment or exception under Sec. 700.80.
    (e) A person may place a rated order for the minimum commercially 
procurable quantity even if the quantity needed to fill a rated order is 
less than that minimum. However, a person must combine rated orders as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if possible, to obtain 
minimum procurable quantities.
    (f) A person is not required to place a priority rating on an order 
for less than $50,000, or one half of the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
(FAR) Simplified Acquisition Threshold (see FAR 2.101), whichever amount 
is larger, provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion 
without the use of the priority rating.

<R05>
Sec. 700.18  Limitations on placing rated orders.

    (a) General limitations. (1) A person may not place a DO or DX rated 
order unless entitled to do so under this regulation.
    (2) Rated orders may not be used to obtain:
    (i) Delivery on a date earlier than needed;
    (ii) A greater quantity of the item than needed, except to obtain a 
minimum procurable quantity. Separate rated orders may not be placed 
solely for the purpose of obtaining minimum procurable quantities on 
each order;
    (iii) Items in advance of the receipt of a rated order, except as 
specifically authorized by Commerce (see Sec. 700.51(c) for information 
on obtaining authorization for a priority rating in advance of a rated 
order); or
    (iv) Any of the following items unless specific priority rating 
authority has been obtained from a Delegate Agency or Commerce:
    (A) Items for plant improvement, expansion or construction, unless 
they will be physically incorporated into a construction project covered 
by a rated order; and
    (B) Production or construction equipment or items to be used for the 
manufacture of production equipment. [For information on requesting 
priority rating authority, see Sec. 700.53.]
    (v) Any items related to the development of chemical or biological 
warfare capabilities or the production of chemical or biological 
weapons, unless such development or production has been authorized by 
the President or the Secretary of Defense.
    (b) Jurisdictional limitations. (1) The priorities and allocations 
authority for certain items has been delegated under Executive Orders 
12919 and 12742, other executive order, or Interagency Memoranda of 
Understanding to other agencies. Unless otherwise agreed to by the 
concerned agencies, the provisions of this part are not applicable to 
these items which include:
    (i) Food resources, food resource facilities, and the domestic 
distribution of farm equipment and commercial fertilizer (Department of 
Agriculture--see Attachment A to DPAS Delegation 1 in Appendix II to 
part 700 concerning combat rations);
    (ii) All forms of energy, including radioisotopes, stable isotopes, 
source material, and special nuclear material produced in Government-
owned plants or facilities operated by or for the Department of Energy 
(Department of Energy);
    (iii) Health resources (Department of Health and Human Services);
    (iv) All forms of civil transportation (Department of 
Transportation);
    (v) Water resources (Department of Defense/U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers);
    (vi) Communications services (National Communications System under 
Executive Order 12472 of April 3, 1984); and
    (vii) Mineral resources and mineral processing facilities 
(Department of the Interior/U.S. Geological Survey--see Memorandum of 
Understanding Between Interior and Commerce in DPAS Appendix III to part 
700).

[[Page 90]]

    (2) The jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce and the 
Departments of Energy, Agriculture, and the Interior over certain 
specific items included in the categories listed above has been 
clarified by Interagency Memoranda of Understanding. Copies of these 
Memoranda are provided for information at appendix III.
    (3) The following items under the jurisdiction of Commerce are 
currently excluded from the rating provisions of this regulation; 
however, these items are subject to Commerce Directives. These excluded 
items are:

Copper raw materials
Crushed stone
Gravel
Sand
Scrap
Slag
Steam heat, central
Waste paper

          Subpart E--Industrial Priorities for Energy Programs


<R05>
Sec. 700.20  Use of priority ratings.

    (a) Section 101(c) of the Defense Production Act authorizes the use 
of priority ratings for projects which maximize domestic energy 
supplies.
    (b) Projects which maximize domestic energy supplies include those 
which maintain or further domestic energy exploration, production, 
refining, and transportation; maintain or further the conservation of 
energy; or are involved in the construction or maintenance of energy 
facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 700.21  Application for priority rating authority.

    (a) For projects believed to maximize domestic energy supplies, a 
person may request priority rating authority for scarce, critical, and 
essential supplies of materials, equipment, and services (related to the 
production of materials or equipment, or the installation, repair, or 
maintenance of equipment) by submitting DOE Form PR 437 to the 
Department of Energy. Blank applications and further information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Clearance and 
Support, Field/Headquarters Support Division, Forrestal Building, 1000 
Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585; Attn.: PR-132.
    (b) On receipt of the application, the Department of Energy will:
    (1) Determine if the project maximizes domestic energy supplies; and
    (2) Find whether the materials, equipment, or services involved in 
the application are critical and essential to the project.
    (c) If the Department of Energy notifies Commerce that the project 
maximizes domestic energy supplies and that the materials, equipment, or 
services are critical and essential, Commerce must find whether the 
items in question are scarce and whether there is a need to use the 
priorities and allocations authorities.
    (1) Scarcity implies an unusual difficulty in obtaining the 
materials, equipment, or services in a timeframe consistent with the 
timely completion of the energy project. Among the factors to be used in 
making the scarcity finding will be the following:
    (i) Value and volume of material or equipment shipments;
    (ii) Consumption of material and equipment;
    (iii) Volume and market trends of imports and exports;
    (iv) Domestic and foreign sources of supply;
    (v) Normal levels of inventories;
    (vi) Rates of capacity utilization;
    (vii) Volume of new orders; and
    (viii) Lead times for new orders.
    (2) In finding whether there is a need to use the priorities and 
allocations authorities, Commerce will consider alternative supply 
solutions and other measures.
    (d) If Commerce does not find that the items of materials, 
equipment, or services are scarce, it will not proceed to analyze the 
need to use the priorities and allocations authorities.
    (e) Commerce will inform the Department of Energy of the results of 
its analysis. If Commerce has made the two required findings, it will 
authorize the Department of Energy to grant the use of a priority rating 
to the applicant.

[[Page 91]]

    (f) Schedule I includes a list of approved programs to support the 
maximization of domestic energy supplies. A Department of Energy 
regulation setting forth the procedures and criteria used by the 
Department of Energy in making its determination and findings is 
published in 10 CFR part 216.

      Subpart F--National Emergency Preparedness and Critical Items

    Source: 63 FR 31923, June 11, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 700.30  Priorities and allocations in a national emergency.

    (a) In the event of a national emergency, special rules may be 
established as needed to supplement this part, thus ensuring rapid 
industrial response and the timely availability of critical industrial 
items and facilities to meet the urgent national defense requirements, 
including domestic emergency preparedness requirements, of approved 
programs.
    (1) Emergency official actions. (i) As needed, this part may be 
supplemented to include additional definitions to cover civilian 
emergency preparedness industrial items, support for essential civilian 
programs, and provisions for the taking of certain emergency official 
actions under sections Secs. 700.60 through 700.63.
    (ii) Emergency official actions may include:
    (A) Controlling inventories of critical and scarce defense and/or 
emergency preparedness items;
    (B) Restricting the purchase, use, or distribution of critical and 
scarce defense and/or emergency preparedness items, or the use of 
production or distribution facilities, for non-essential purposes; and
    (C) Converting the production or distribution of non-essential items 
to the production or distribution of critical and scarce defense and/or 
emergency preparedness items.
    (2) Allocation of critical and scarce items and facilities. (i) As 
needed, this part may be supplemented to establish special rules for the 
allocation of scarce and critical items and facilities to ensure the 
timely availability of these items and facilities for approved programs, 
and to provide for an equitable and orderly distribution of requirements 
for such items among all suppliers of the items. These rules may provide 
for the allocation of individual items or they may be broad enough to 
direct general industrial activity as required in support of emergency 
requirements.
    (ii) Allocation rules (i.e., controlled materials programs) were 
established in response to previous periods of national security 
emergency such as World War II and the Korean Conflict. The basic 
elements of the controlled materials programs were the set-aside (the 
amount of an item for which a producer or supplier must reserve order 
book space in anticipation of the receipt of rated orders), the 
production directive (requires a producer to supply a specific quantity, 
size, shape, and type of an item within a specific time period), and the 
allotment (the maximum quantity of an item authorized for use in a 
specific program or application). These elements can be used to assure 
the availability of any scarce and critical item for approved programs. 
Currently, a set-aside applies only to metalworking machines (see 
Sec. 700.31).
    (3) In the event that certain critical items become scarce, and 
approved program requirements for these items cannot be met without 
creating a significant dislocation in the civilian market place so as to 
create appreciable hardship, Commerce may establish special rules under 
section 101(b) of the Defense Production Act to control the general 
distribution of such items in the civilian market.
    (b) Regional Emergency Coordinators. (1) If due to a catastrophic 
national security emergency event, communications with Commerce 
headquarters in Washington, D.C. are severed, DPAS Emergency Delegation 
1 will provide authority to the Regional Emergency Coordinators (REC) 
located in the Standard Federal Region Council cities (Boston, New York, 
Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, Chicago, Denver, San 
Francisco, and Seattle) to represent the Secretary of Commerce,

[[Page 92]]

and as necessary, act for the Secretary to carry out the emergency 
industrial production and distribution control functions of Commerce as 
set forth in this part, in any supplement thereto, or other applicable 
authority. See DPAS Emergency Delegation 1 for further information about 
the authority and duties of the RECs, and the effective date of the 
Delegation.
    (2) If DPAS Emergency Delegation 1 is implemented due to a 
catastrophic national security emergency event, requests for special 
priorities assistance under Secs. 700.50 through 700.55 should be filed 
with the nearest Regional Emergency Coordinator located in one of the

<R04>
                Subpart H--Special Priorities Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 700.50  General provisions.

    (a) The DPAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, it 
is anticipated that from time-to-time problems will occur. In this 
event, a person should immediately contact the appropriate contract 
administration officer for guidance or assistance. If additional formal 
aid is needed, special priorities assistance should be sought from the 
Delegate Agency through the contract administration officer. If the 
Delegate Agency is unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use 
of a priority rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, 
the Delegate Agency may forward the request to the Department of 
Commerce for action. Special priorities assistance is a service provided 
to alleviate problems that do arise.
    (b) Special priorities assistance can be provided for any reason in 
support of this regulation, such as assisting in obtaining timely 
deliveries of items needed to satisfy rated orders or authorizing the 
use of priority ratings on orders to obtain items not automatically 
ratable under this regulation.
    (c) A request for special priorities assistance or priority rating 
authority must be submitted on Form BXA-999 (OMB control number 0694-
0057) to the local contract administration representative. Form BXA-999 
may be obtained from the Delegate Agency representative or from the 
Department of

[[Page 93]]

Commerce. A sample Form BXA-999 is attached at Appendix I.

[49 FR 30414, July 30, 1984; 49 FR 50171, Dec. 27, 1984. Redesignated at 
54 FR 601, Jan. 9, 1989, as amended at 63 FR 31924, June 11, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 700.51  Requests for priority rating authority.

    (a) If a rated order is likely to be delayed because a person is 
unable to obtain items not normally rated under this regulation, the 
person may request the authority to use a priority rating in ordering 
the needed items. Examples of items for which priority ratings can be 
authorized include:
    (1) Production or construction equipment;
    (2) Computers when not used as production items; and
    (3) Expansion, rebuilding or replacing plant facilities.
    (b) Rating authority for production or construction equipment. (1) A 
request for priority rating authority for production or construction 
equipment must be submitted to the appropriate Delegate Agency. The 
Delegate Agency may establish particular forms to be used for these 
requests (e.g., Department of Defense Form DD 691.)
    (2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the 
procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may 
be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the 
latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in 
the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease 
rather than sell.
    (c) Rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract. (1) In 
certain cases and upon specific request, Commerce, in order to promote 
the national defense, may authorize a person to place a priority rating 
on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime 
contract. In these instances, the person requesting advance rating 
authority must obtain sponsorship of the request from the appropriate 
Delegate Agency. The person shall also assume any business risk 
associated with the placing of rated orders if these orders have to be 
cancelled in the event the rated prime contract is not issued.
    (2) The person must state the following in the request:

    It is understood that the authorization of a priority rating in 
advance of our receiving a rated prime contract from a Delegate Agency 
and our use of that priority rating with our suppliers in no way commits 
the Delegate Agency, the Department of Commerce or any other government 
agency to enter into a contract or order or to expend funds. Further, we 
understand that the Federal Government shall not be liable for any 
cancellation charges, termination costs, or other damages that may 
accrue if a rated prime contract is not eventually placed and, as a 
result, we must subsequently cancel orders placed with the use of the 
priority rating authorized as a result of this request.

    (3) In reviewing requests for rating authority in advance of a rated 
prime contract, Commerce will consider, among other things, the 
following criteria:
    (i) The probability that the prime contract will be awarded;
    (ii) The impact of the resulting rated orders on suppliers and on 
other authorized programs;
    (iii) Whether the contractor is the sole source;
    (iv) Whether the item being produced has a long lead time;
    (v) The political sensitivity of the project; and
    (vi) The time period for which the rating is being requested.
    (4) Commerce may require periodic reports on the use of the rating 
authority granted under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (5) If a rated prime contract is not issued, the person shall 
promptly notify all suppliers who have received rated orders pursuant to 
the advanced rating authority that the priority rating on those orders 
is cancelled.


<R05>
Sec. 700.52  Examples of assistance.

    (a) While special priorities assistance may be provided for any 
reason in support of this regulation, it is usually provided in 
situations where:
    (1) A person is experiencing difficulty in obtaining delivery 
against a rated order by the required delivery date; or
    (2) A person cannot locate a supplier for an item needed to fill a 
rated order.
    (b) Other examples of special priorities assistance include:

[[Page 94]]

    (1) Ensuring that rated orders receive preferential treatment by 
suppliers;
    (2) Resolving production or delivery conflicts between various rated 
orders;
    (3) Assisting in placing rated orders with suppliers;
    (4) Verifying the urgency of rated orders; and
    (5) Determining the validity of rated orders.


<R05>
Sec. 700.53  Criteria for assistance.

    Requests for special priorities assistance should be timely, i.e., 
the request has been submitted promptly and enough time exists for the 
Delegate Agency or Commerce to effect a meaningful resolution to the 
problem, and must establish that:
    (a) There is an urgent need for the item; and
    (b) The applicant has made a reasonable effort to resolve the 
problem.


<R05>
Sec. 700.54  Instances where assistance will not be provided.

    Special priorities assistance is provided at the discretion of the 
Delegate Agencies and Commerce when it is determined that such 
assistance is warranted to meet the objectives of this regulation. 
Examples where assistance may not be provided include situations when a 
person is attempting to:
    (a) Secure a price advantage;
    (b) Obtain delivery prior to the time required to fill a rated 
order;
    (c) Gain competitive advantage;
    (d) Disrupt an industry apportionment program in a manner designed 
to provide a person with an unwarranted share of scarce items; or
    (e) Overcome a supplier's regularly established terms of sale or 
conditions of doing business.

amended at 63 FR 31924, June 11, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 700.55  Assistance programs with Canada and other nations.

    (a) To promote military assistance to foreign nations, this section 
provides for authorizing priority ratings to persons in Canada and in 
other foreign nations to obtain items in the United States in support of 
approved programs. Although priority ratings have no legal authority 
outside of the United States, this section also provides information on 
how persons in the United States may obtain informal assistance in 
Canada.
    (b) Canada. (1) The joint U.S.-Canadian military arrangements for 
the defense of North America and the integrated nature of their defense 
industries as set forth in the U.S.-Canadian Statement of Principles for 
Economic Cooperation (October 26, 1950) require close coordination and 
the establishment of a means to provide mutual assistance to the defense 
industries located in both countries.
    (2) The Department of Commerce coordinates with the Canadian Public 
Works and Government Services Canada on all matters of mutual concern 
relating to the administration of this regulation. A copy of the 
Memorandum of Understanding between the two departments is provided at 
appendix IV.
    (3) Any person in the United States ordering defense items in Canada 
should inform the Canadian supplier that the items being ordered are to 
be used to fill a rated order. The Canadian supplier should be informed 
that if production materials are needed from the United States by the 
supplier or the supplier's vendor to fill the order, they should contact 
the Canadian Public Works and Government Services Canada for authority 
to place rated orders in the United States.
    (4) Any person in Canada producing defense items for the Canadian 
government may also obtain priority rating authority for items to be 
purchased in the United States by applying to the Canadian Public Works 
and Government Services Canada in accordance with procedures specified 
by that Department.
    (5) Persons in Canada needing special priorities assistance in 
obtaining defense items in the United States may apply for such 
assistance to the Canadian Public Works and Government Services Canada. 
Public Works and Government Services Canada will forward appropriate 
requests to Commerce.
    (6) Any person in the United States requiring assistance in 
obtaining items in Canada must submit a request through the Delegate 
Agency to Commerce on Form BXA-999. Commerce

[[Page 95]]

will forward appropriate requests to the Canadian Public Works and 
Government Services Canada.
    (c) Foreign nations. (1) Any person in a foreign nation other than 
Canada requiring assistance in obtaining defense items in the United 
States or priority rating authority for defense items to be purchased in 
the United States, should apply for such assistance or rating authority 
to the U.S. Department of Defense. The request must be sponsored by the 
government of the foreign nation prior to its submission.
    (2) If the Department of Defense endorses the request, it will be 
forwarded to Commerce for appropriate action.

                       Subpart I--Official Actions


<R05>
Sec. 700.60  General provisions.

    (a) Commerce may, from time-to-time, take specific official actions 
to implement or enforce the provisions of this regulation.
    (b) Several of these official actions (Rating Authorizations, 
Directives, and Letters of Understanding) are discussed in this subpart. 
Other official actions which pertain to compliance (Administrative 
Subpoenas, Demands for Information, and Inspection Authorizations) are 
discussed in Sec. 700.71(b).


<R05>
Sec. 700.61  Rating Authorizations.

    (a) A Rating Authorization is an official action granting specific 
priority rating authority that:
    (1) Permits a person to place a priority rating on an order for an 
item not normally ratable under this regulation; or
    (2) Authorizes a person to modify a priority rating on a specific 
order or series of contracts or orders.
    (b) To request priority rating authority, see Sec. 700.51.


<R05>
Sec. 700.62  Directives.

    (a) A Directive is an official action which requires a person to 
take or refrain from taking certain actions in accordance with its 
provisions.
    (b) A person must comply with each Directive issued. However, a 
person may not use or extend a Directive to obtain any items from a 
supplier, unless expressly authorized to do so in the Directive.
    (c) Directives take precedence over all DX rated orders, DO rated 
orders, and unrated orders previously or subsequently received, unless a 
contrary instruction appears in the Directive.


<R05>
Sec. 700.63  Letters of Understanding.

    (a) A Letter of Understanding is an official action which may be 
issued in resolving special priorities assistance cases to reflect an 
agreement reached by all parties (Commerce, the Delegate Agency, the 
supplier, and the customer).
    (b) A Letter of Understanding is not used to alter scheduling 
between rated orders, to authorize the use of priority ratings, to 
impose restrictions under this regulation, or to take other official 
actions. Rather, Letters of Understanding are used to confirm production 
or shipping schedules which do not require modifications to other rated 
orders.


<R04>
                          Subpart J--Compliance


<R05>
Sec. 700.70  General provisions.

investigations, or other inquiries.
    (b) Any person who places or receives a rated order should be 
thoroughly familiar with, and must comply with, the provisions of this 
regulation.
    (c) Willful violation of any of the provisions of Title I or section

[49 FR 30414, July 30, 1984. Redesignated at 54 FR 601, Jan. 9, 1989, as 
amended at 63 FR 31924, June 11, 1998]

[[Page 96]]


<R05>
Sec. 700.71  Audits and investigations.

    (a) Audits and investigations are official examinations of books, 
records, documents, other writings and information to ensure that the 
provisions of the Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act and 
related statutes, this regulation, and official actions have been 
properly followed. An audit or investigation may also include interviews 
and a systems evaluation to detect problems or failures in the 
implementation of this regulation.
    (b) When undertaking an audit, investigation, or other inquiry, the 
Department of Commerce shall:
    (1) Define the scope and purpose in the official action given to the 
person under investigation, and
    (2) Have ascertained that the information sought or other adequate 
and authoritative data are not available from any Federal or other 
responsible agency.
    (c) In administering this regulation, Commerce may issue the 
following documents which constitute official actions:
    (1) Administrative Subpoenas. An Administrative Subpoena requires a 
person to appear as a witness before an official designated by the 
Department of Commerce to testify under oath on matters of which that 
person has knowledge relating to the enforcement or the administration 
of the Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act and related 
statutes, this regulation, or official actions. An Administrative 
Subpoena may also require the production of books, papers, records, 
documents and physical objects or property.
    (2) Demand for Information. A Demand for Information requires a 
person to furnish to a duly authorized representative of the Department 
of Commerce any information necessary or appropriate to the enforcement 
or the administration of the Defense Production Act, the Selective 
Service Act and related statutes, this regulation, or official actions.
    (3) Inspection Authorizations. An Inspection Authorization requires 
a person to permit a duly authorized representative of Commerce to 
interview the person's employees or agents, to inspect books, records, 
documents, other writings and information in the person's possession or 
control at the place where that person usually keeps them, and to 
inspect a person's property when such interviews and inspections are 
necessary or appropriate to the enforcement or the administration of the 
Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act and related statutes, 
this regulation, or official actions.
    (d) The production of books, records, documents, other writings and 
information will not be required at any place other than where they are 
usually kept if, prior to the return date specified in the 
Administrative Subpoena or Demand for Information, a duly authorized 
official of Commerce is furnished with copies of such material that are 
certified under oath to be true copies. As an alternative, a person may 
enter into a stipulation with a duly authorized official of Commerce as 
to the content of the material.
    (e) An Administrative Subpoena, Demand for Information, or 
Inspection Authorization, shall include the name, title or official 
position of the person to be served, the evidence sought to be adduced, 
and its general relevance to the scope and purpose of the audit, 
investigation, or other inquiry. If employees or agents are to be 
interviewed; if books, records, documents, other writings, or 
information are to be produced; or if property is to be inspected; the 
Administrative Subpoena, Demand for Information, or Inspection 
Authorization will describe them with particularity.
    (f) Service of documents shall be made in the following manner:
    (1) Service of a Demand for Information or Inspection Authorization 
shall be made personally, or by Certified Mail--Return Receipt Requested 
at the person's last known address. Service of an Administrative 
Subpoena shall be made personally. Personal service may also be made by 
leaving a copy of the document with someone of suitable age and 
discretion at the person's last known dwelling or place of business.
    (2) Service upon other than an individual may be made by serving a 
partner, corporate officer, or a managing or general agent authorized by 
appointment or by law to accept service of process. If an agent is 
served, a copy of

[[Page 97]]

the document shall be mailed to the person named in the document.
    (3) Any individual 18 years of age or over may serve an 
Administrative Subpoena, Demand for Information, or Inspection 
Authorization. When personal service is made, the individual making the 
service shall prepare an affidavit as to the manner in which service was 
made and the identity of the person served, and return the affidavit, 
and in the case of subpoenas, the original document, to the issuing 
officer. In case of failure to make service, the reasons for the failure 
shall be stated on the original document.

Sec. 700.72  Compulsory process.

    (a) If a person refuses to permit a duly authorized representative 
of Commerce to have access to any premises or source of information 
necessary to the administration or the enforcement of the Defense 
Production Act, the Selective Service Act and related statutes, this 
regulation, or official actions, the Commerce representative may seek 
compulsory process. Compulsory process means the institution of 
appropriate legal action, including ex parte application for an 
inspection warrant or its equivalent, in any forum of appropriate 
jurisdiction.
    (b) Compulsory process may be sought in advance of an audit, 
investigation, or other inquiry, if, in the judgment of the Director of 
the Office of Industrial Resource Administration, U.S. Department of 
Commerce, in consultation with the Chief Counsel for Export 
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, there is reason to believe 
that a person will refuse to permit an audit, investigation, or other 
inquiry, or that other circumstances exist which make such process 
desirable or necessary.

<R05>
Sec. 700.73  Notification of failure to comply.

    (a) At the conclusion of an audit, investigation, or other inquiry, 
or at any other time, Commerce may inform the person in writing where 
compliance with the requirements of the Defense Production Act, the 
Selective Service Act and related statutes, this regulation, or an 
official action were not met.
    (b) In cases where Commerce determines that failure to comply with 
the provisions of the Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act 
and related statutes, this regulation, or an official action was 
inadvertent, the person may be informed in writing of the particulars 
involved and the corrective action to be taken. Failure to take 
corrective action may then be construed as a willfull violation of the 
Defense Production Act, this regulation, or an official action.

action, is a crime and upon conviction, a person may be punished by fine 
or imprisonment, or both. The maximum penalty provided by the Defense 
Production Act is a $10,000 fine, or one year in prison, or both. The 
maximum penalty provided by the Selective Service Act and related 
statutes is a $50,000 fine, or three years in prison, or both.
    (b) The government may also seek an injunction from a court of 
appropriate jurisdiction to prohibit the continuance of any violation 
of, or to enforce compliance with, the Defense Production Act, this 
regulation, or an official action.
    (c) In order to secure the effective enforcement of the Defense 
Production Act, this regulation, and official actions, the following are 
prohibited (see section 704 of the Defense Production Act; see also, for 
example, sections 2 and 371 of Title 18, United States Code):
    (1) No person may solicit, influence or permit another person to 
perform any act prohibited by, or to omit any act required by, the 
Defense Production Act, this regulation, or an official action.

[[Page 98]]

    (2) No person may conspire or act in concert with any other person 
to perform any act prohibited by, or to omit any act required by, the 
Defense Production Act, this regulation, or an official action.
    (3) No person shall deliver any item if the person knows or has 
reason to believe that the item will be accepted, redelivered, held, or 
used in violation of the Defense Production Act, this regulation, or an 
official action. In such instances, the person must immediately notify 
the Department of Commerce that, in accordance with this provision, 
delivery has not been made.

<R05>
Sec. 700.75  Compliance conflicts.

    If compliance with any provision of the Defense Production Act, the 
Selective Service Act and related statutes, this regulation, or an 
official action would prevent a person from filling a rated order or

this regulation, or an official action, the person must immediately 
notify the Department of Commerce for resolution of the conflict.

Sec.
701.1  Purpose.
701.2  Definitions.
701.3  Applicability and scope.
701.4  Procedures.
701.5  Confidentiality.

    Authority: Title I, sec. 124, Pub. L 102-558, 106 Stat. 4207 (50 
U.S.C App. 2099).

    Source: 59 FR 61796, Dec. 2, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 701.1  Purpose.

    The Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 require the Secretary 
of Commerce to promulgate regulations for U.S. firms entering into 
contracts for the sale of defense articles or defense services to 
foreign countries or foreign firms that are subject to offset agreements 
exceeding $5,000,000 in value to furnish information regarding such 
agreements. The Secretary of Commerce has designated the Bureau of 
Export Administration as the organization responsible for implementing 
this provision. The information provided by U.S. firms will be 
aggregated and used to determine the impact of offset transactions on 
the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and 
trade of the United States. Summary reports will be submitted annually 
to the Congress pursuant Section 309 of the Defense Production Act of 
1950, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 701.2  Definitions.

    (a) Offsets--Compensation practices required as a condition of 
purchase in either government-to-government or commercial sales of 
defense articles and/or defense services as defined by the Arms Export 
Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
    (b) Military Export Sales--Exports that are either Foreign Military 
Sales (FMS) or commercial (direct) sales of defense articles and/or 
defense services as defined by the Arms Export Control Act and 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
    (c) Prime Contractor--A firm that has a sales contract with a 
foreign entity or with the U.S. Government for military export sales.
    (d) United States--Includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories.
    (e) Offset Agreement--Any offset as defined above that the U.S. firm 
agrees to in order to conclude a military export sales contract. This 
includes all offsets, whether they are ``best effort'' agreements or are 
subject to penalty clauses.
    (f) Offset Transaction--Any activity for which the U.S. firm claims 
credit for full or partial fulfillment of the offset agreement. 
Activities to implement offset agreements may include, but are not 
limited to, coproduction, licensed production, subcontractor production, 
overseas investment, technology transfer countertrade, barter, 
counterpurchase, and buy back.
    (g) Direct Offset--Contractual arrangements that involve defense 
articles and services referenced in the sales agreement for military 
exports.
    (h) Indirect Offset--Contractual arrangements that involve defense 
goods and services unrelated to the exports referenced in the sales 
agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 701.3  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This rule applies to U.S. firms entering contracts for the sale 
of defense articles or defense services (as defined in the Arms Export 
Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations) to a foreign 
country or foreign firm for which the contract is subject to an offset 
agreement exceeding $5,000,000 in value.
    (b) This rule applies to all offset transactions completed in 
performance of existing offset commitments since January 1, 1993 for 
which offset credit of $250,000 or more has been claimed from the 
foreign representative, and new offset agreements entered into since 
that time.


<R05>
Sec. 701.4  Procedures.

    (a) To avoid double counting, firms should report only offset 
transactions for which they are directly responsible for reporting to 
the foreign customer (i.e., prime contractors should report

[[Page 107]]

for their subcontractors if the subcontractors are not a direct party to 
the offset agreement).
    (b) Reports should be delivered to the Offsets Program Manager, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, Office of Strategic Industries and Economic 
Security, Bureau of Export Administration, Room 3878, 14th Street and 
Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington DC 20230. The first industry 
reports should be submitted to the Bureau of Export Administration not 
later than March 15, 1995 and should cover offset transactions completed 
during the calendar year 1993, as well as information regarding 
unfulfilled offset agreements. After this initial submission, companies 
should provide information once yearly not later than June 15 covering 
the preceding calendar year. All submissions should include a point of 
contact (name and telephone number) and should be by a company official 
authorized to provide such information.
    (c) Companies may submit this information in computerized 
spreadsheet/database format (e.g., Lotus 1-2-3, Quattro Pro, dbase IV) 
using a 3.5 inch 1.44 megabyte diskette, accompanied by a printed copy.
    (d) Offset Transaction Reporting. (1) Reports should include an 
itemized list of offset transactions completed during the reporting 
period, including the following data elements (Estimates are acceptable 
when actual figures are unavailable; estimated figures should be 
followed by the letter ``E''):
    (i) Name of Country--Country of entity purchasing the weapon system, 
defense item or service subject to offset.
    (ii) Name or Description of Weapon system, Defense Item, or Service 
Subject to Offset.
    (iii) Name of Offset Fulfilling Entity--Entity fulfilling offset 
transaction (including first tier subcontractors).
    (iv) Name of Offset Receiving Entity--Entity receiving benefits from 
offset transaction.
    (v) Offset Credit Value--Dollar value credits claimed by fulfilling 
entity including any intangible factors/multipliers.
    (vi) Actual Offset Value--Dollar value of the offset transaction 
without multipliers/intangible factors.
    (vii) Description of Offset Product/Service--Short description of 
the type of offset (e.g., coproduction, technology transfer, subcontract 
activity, training, purchase, cash payment, etc.).
    (viii) Broad Industry Category--Broad classification of the industry 
in which the offset transaction was fulfilled (e.g., aerospace, 
electronics, chemicals, industrial machinery, textiles, etc.). Firms may 
request a list of the Standard Industry Classification (SIC) codes to 
assist in identifying an appropriate industry category. Forward such 
requests to the Offsets Program Manager, U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security, Bureau of Export 
Administration, Room 3878, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20230 or Fax 202-482-5650.
    (ix) Direct or Indirect Offset--Specify whether the offset 
transaction was direct or indirect offset.
    (x) Name of Country in Which Offset was Fulfilled--United States, 
purchasing country, or third country.
    (2) Offset transactions of the same type (same fulfilling entity, 
receiving entity, and offset product/service) completed during the same 
reporting period may be combined.
    (3) Any necessary comments or explanations relating to the above 
information should be footnoted and supplied on separate sheets attached 
to the report.
    (e) Reporting on Offset Agreements Entered Into. (1) In addition to 
the itemized list of offset transactions completed during the year as 
specified above, U.S. firms should provide information regarding new 
offset agreements entered into during the year, including the following 
elements:
    (i) Name of Country--Country of entity purchasing the weapon system, 
defense item, or service subject to offset;
    (ii) Name or Description of Weapon System, Defense Item, or Service 
Subject to Offset;
    (iii) Names/Titles of Signatories to the Offset Agreement;
    (iv) Value of Export Sale Subject to Offset (approximate);

defense requirements and the supplies and services including the 
investment, exploration and development necessary to assure such growth; 
and
    (5) Any other relevant factors.
    (b) In recognition of the close relation between the strength of our 
national economy and the capacity of the United States to meet national 
security requirements, the Department shall also, with regard for the 
quantity, availability, character and uses of the imported article under 
investigation, consider the following:
    (1) The impact of foreign competition on the economic welfare of any 
domestic industry essential to our national security;

State is the Director of the USNA.
    Unscheduled chemical. Means a chemical that is not contained in 
Schedule 1, Schedule 2, or Schedule 3 (see Supplements No. 1 to parts 
712 through 714 of this subchapter).
    Unscheduled Discrete Organic Chemical (UDOC). Means any ``discrete 
organic chemical'' that is not contained in the Schedules of Chemicals 
(see Supplements No. 1 to parts 712 through 714 of this subchapter) and 
subject to the declaration requirements of part 715 of this subchapter. 
Unscheduled discrete organic chemicals subject to declaration under this 
subchapter are those produced by synthesis that are isolated for use or 
sale as a specific end-product.
    You. The term ``you'' or ``your'' means any person (see also 
definition of ``person''). With regard to the declaration and reporting 
requirements of the CWCR, ``you'' refers to persons that have an 
obligation to report certain activities under the provisions of the 
CWCR.


<R05>
Sec. 710.2  Scope of the CWCR.

    The Chemical Weapons Convention Regulations (parts 710 through 722 
of this subchapter), or CWCR, implement certain obligations of the 
United States under the Convention on the Prohibition of the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on 
Their Destruction, known as the CWC or Convention.
    (a) Persons and facilities subject to the CWCR. (1) The CWCR 
declaration, reporting, and inspection requirements apply to all persons 
and facilities located in the United States, except U.S. Government 
facilities as follows:
    (i) Department of Defense facilities;
    (ii) Department of Energy facilities; and
    (iii) Facilities of other U.S. Government agencies that notify the 
USNA of their decision to be excluded from the CWCR.
    (2) For purposes of this subchapter, ``United States Government 
facilities'' are those facilities owned and operated by a U.S. 
Government agency (including those operated by contractors to the 
agency), and those facilities leased to and operated by a U.S. 
Government agency (including those operated by contractors to the 
agency). ``United States Government facilities'' does not include 
facilities owned by a U.S. Government agency and leased to a private

[[Page 117]]

company or other entity such that the private company or entity may 
independently decide for what purposes to use the facilities.
    (b) Activities subject to the CWCR. The CWCR compel data 
declarations and reports from facilities subject to the CWCR (parts 710 
through 722 of this subchapter) on activities, including production, 
processing, consumption, exports and imports, involving chemicals 
further described in parts 712 through 715 of this subchapter. These 
regulations do not apply to activities involving inorganic chemicals 
other than those listed in the Schedules of Chemicals or to other 
specifically exempted unscheduled discrete organic chemicals. In 
addition, these regulations set forth procedures for routine inspections 
of ``declared'' facilities by teams of international inspectors in part 
716 of this subchapter, and set forth clarification procedures and 
procedures for challenge inspections (see part 717) that could be 
requested at any facility or location in the United States subject to 
the CWCR. Finally, the CWCR restrict certain imports of Schedule 1 and 2 
chemicals into the United States from non-States Parties and prohibit 
imports of Schedule 1 chemicals except for research, medical, 
pharmaceutical, or protective purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 710.3  Purposes of the Convention and CWCR.

    (a) Purposes of the Convention. (1) The Convention imposes upon the 
United States, as a State Party, certain declaration, inspection, and 
other obligations. In addition, the United States and other States 
Parties to the Convention undertake never under any circumstances to:
    (i) Develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile, or retain 
chemical weapons, or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons 
to anyone;
    (ii) Use chemical weapons;
    (iii) Engage in any military preparations to use chemical weapons; 
or
    (iv) Assist, encourage or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in 
any activity prohibited by the Convention.
    (2) One objective of the Convention is to assure States Parties that 
lawful activities of chemical producers and users are not converted to 
unlawful activities related to chemical weapons. To achieve this 
objective and to give States Parties a mechanism to verify compliance, 
the Convention requires the United States and all other States Parties 
to submit declarations concerning chemical production, consumption, 
processing and other activities, and to permit international inspections 
within their borders.
    (b) Purposes of the Chemical Weapons Convention Regulations. To 
fulfill the United States' obligations under the Convention, the CWCR 
(parts 710 through 722 of this subchapter) prohibit certain activities, 
and compel the submission of information from all facilities in the 
United States, except for Department of Defense and Department of Energy 
facilities and facilities of other U.S. Government agencies that notify 
the USNA of their decision to be excluded from the CWCR on activities, 
including exports and imports of scheduled chemicals and certain 
information regarding unscheduled discrete organic chemicals as 
described in parts 712 through 715 of this subchapter. U.S. Government 
facilities are those owned by or leased to the U.S Government, including 
facilities that are contractor-operated. The CWCR also require access 
for on-site inspections and monitoring by the OPCW, as described in 
parts 716 and 717 of this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 710.4  Overview of scheduled chemicals and examples of affected industries.

    The following provides examples of the types of industries that may 
be affected by the CWCR (parts 710 through 722 of this subchapter). 
These examples are not exhaustive, and you should refer to parts 712 
through 715 of this subchapter to determine your obligations.
    (a) Schedule 1 chemicals are listed in Supplement No. 1 to part 712 
of this subchapter. Schedule 1 chemicals have little or no use in 
industrial and agricultural industries, but may have limited use for 
research, pharmaceutical, medical, public health, or protective 
purposes.
    (b) Schedule 2 chemicals are listed in Supplement No. 1 to part 713 
of this

[[Page 118]]

subchapter. Although Schedule 2 chemicals may be useful in the 
production of chemical weapons, they also have legitimate uses in areas 
such as:
    (1) Flame retardant additives and research;
    (2) Dye and photographic industries (e.g., printing ink, ball point 
pen fluids, copy mediums, paints, etc.);
    (3) Medical and pharmaceutical preparation (e.g., anticholinergics, 
arsenicals, tranquilizer preparations);
    (4) Metal plating preparations;
    (5) Epoxy resins; and
    (6) Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, defoliants, and 
rodenticides.
    (c) Schedule 3 chemicals are listed in Supplement No. 1 to part 714 
of this subchapter. Although Schedule 3 chemicals may be useful in the 
production of chemical weapons, they also have legitimate uses in areas 
such as:
    (1) The production of:
    (i) Resins;
    (ii) Plastics;
    (iii) Pharmaceuticals;
    (iv) Pesticides;
    (v) Batteries;
    (vi) Cyanic acid;
    (vii) Toiletries, including perfumes and scents;
    (viii) Organic phosphate esters (e.g., hydraulic fluids, flame 
retardants, surfactants, and sequestering agents); and
    (2) Leather tannery and finishing supplies.
    (d) Unscheduled discrete organic chemicals are used in a wide 
variety of commercial industries, and include acetone, benzoyl peroxide 
and propylene glycol.


<R05>
Sec. 710.5  Authority.

    The CWCR (parts 710 through 722 of this subchapter) implement 
certain provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention under the 
authority of the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 
(Act), the National Emergencies Act, the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), as amended, and the Export Administration 
Act of 1979, as amended, by extending verification and trade restriction 
requirements under Article VI and related parts of the Verification 
Annex of the Convention to U.S. persons. In Executive Order 13128 of 
June 25, 1999, the President delegated authority to the Department of 
Commerce to promulgate regulations to implement the Act, and consistent 
with the Act, to carry out appropriate functions not otherwise assigned 
in the Act but necessary to implement certain reporting, monitoring and 
inspection requirements of the Convention and the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 710.6  Relationship between the Chemical Weapons Convention Regulations and the Export Administration Regulations.

    Certain obligations of the U.S. government under the CWC pertain to 
exports. These obligations are implemented in the Export Administration 
Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR parts 730 through 799) and the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130). See 
in particular Sec. 742.18 and part 745 of the EAR, and Export Control 
Classification Numbers 1C350, 1C351 and 1C355 of the Commerce Control

<R05>
Sec. 711.4  Declaration and reporting of activities occurring prior to December 30, 1999.

    (a) Facilities subject to the CWCR are required to prepare and 
submit declarations and reports, to the extent that the necessary 
information and records are available, on activities occurring prior to 
December 30, 1999. Willful failure or refusal to submit such 
declarations and reports constitutes a violation under part 719 of this 
subchapter. Declarations and reports are not required if records and 
information necessary to prepare them are not available for one or more 
of the following reasons:
    (1) The necessary information was not collected, or the necessary 
records were not kept, because no regulatory requirement to do so was in 
effect prior to December 30, 1999 and at the time of the activity;
    (2) The information, though collected at the time of the activity, 
was discarded prior to December 30, 1999 in accordance with normal 
business practices; or
    (3) The current custodian of the records or information is no longer 
affiliated with a facility subject to the CWCR due to changes in 
ownership or control of that facility which took place prior to December 
30, 1999.
    (b) If partial information is available, facilities are required to 
provide whatever information is available, on the appropriate forms, 
with a notation on Form A indicating that complete information is not 
available.
    (c) This Sec. 711.4 applies only to initial declarations and 
reports, and to annual declarations and reports for calendar years 1997, 
1998, and 1999.


<R05>
Sec. 711.5  Numerical precision of submitted data.

    Numerical information submitted in declarations and reports is to be 
provided per applicable rounding rules in each part (i.e., parts 712 
through 715 of this subchapter) with a precision equal to that which can 
be reasonably provided using existing documentation, equipment, and 
measurement techniques.


<R05>
Sec. 711.6  Where to obtain forms.

jurisdiction of the Department of State.


<R05>
Sec. 712.3  Initial and annual declaration requirements for facilities engaged in the production of Schedule 1 chemicals for purposes not prohibited by the CWC.

    (a) Declaration requirements. (1) Initial declaration. You must 
complete the forms specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
providing a current technical description of your facility or its 
relevant parts, if you produced Schedule 1 chemicals at your facility in 
excess of 100 grams aggregate in any one of the calendar years 1997, 
1998, or 1999. Note: Do not include production data in your initial 
declaration. Such information should be included in your annual 
declaration on past activities. See paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) Annual declaration on past activities. You must complete the 
forms specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if you produced at 
your facility in excess of 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals 
in the previous calendar year, beginning with calendar year 1997. As a 
declared Schedule 1 facility, in addition to declaring the production of 
each Schedule 1 chemical that comprises your aggregate production of 
Schedule 1 chemicals, you must also declare the total amount of each 
Schedule 1 chemical used (consumed) and stored at your facility, and 
domestically transferred from your facility during the previous calendar 
year, whether or not you produced that Schedule 1 chemical at your 
facility.
    (3) Annual declaration on anticipated activities. You must complete 
the forms specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section if you 
anticipate that you will produce at your facility more than 100 grams 
aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals in the next calendar year. If you are 
not already a declared facility, you must complete an initial 
declaration (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section) 200 calendar days 
before commencing operations or increasing production which will result 
in production of more than 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals 
(see Sec. 712.4).
    (b) Declaration forms to be used. (1) Initial declaration. (i) You 
must complete the Certification Form, Form 1-1 and Form A if you 
produced at your facility in excess of 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 
chemicals in calendar year

[[Page 123]]

1997, 1998, or 1999. You must provide a detailed current technical 
description of your facility or its relevant parts including a narrative 
statement, a detailed diagram of the declared areas in the facility, and 
an inventory of equipment in the declared area.
    (ii) If you plan to change the technical description of your 
facility from your initial declaration completed and submitted pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and Sec. 712.6, you must notify BXA 
200 calendar days prior to the change. Such notifications must be made 
through an amended declaration by completing a Certification Form, Form 
1-1 and Form A, including the new description of the facility. See 
Sec. 712.7 for additional instructions on amending Schedule 1 
declarations.
    (2) Annual declaration on past activities. If you are subject to the 
declaration requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you must 
complete the Certification Form and Forms 1-1, 1-2, 1-2A, 1-2B, and Form 
A if your facility was involved in the production of Schedule 1 
chemicals in the previous calendar year, beginning with calendar year 
1997. Form B is optional.
    (3) Annual declaration on anticipated activities. If you anticipate 
that you will produce at your facility in excess of 100 grams aggregate 
of Schedule 1 chemicals in the next calendar year you must complete the 
Certification Form and Forms 1-1, 1-4, and Form A. Form B is optional.
    (c) Quantities to be declared. If you produced in excess of 100 
grams aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals in the previous calendar year, 
you must declare the entire quantity of such production, rounded to the 
nearest gram. You must also declare the quantity of any Schedule 1, 
Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 precursor chemical used to produce the declared 
Schedule 1 chemical, rounded to the nearest gram. You must further 
declare the quantity of each Schedule 1 chemical consumed or stored by, 
or domestically transferred from, your facility, whether or not the 
Schedule 1 chemical was produced by your facility, rounded to the 
nearest gram. In calculating the amount of Schedule 1 chemical you 
produced, consumed or stored, count only the amount of the Schedule 1 
chemical(s) in a mixture, not the total weight of the mixture (i.e., do 
not count the weight of the solution, solvent, or container).

    Note to Sec. 712.3(c):
    Schedule 1 reaction intermediates which exist or might exist during 
the course of synthesis to produce non-scheduled chemicals and which 
cannot be isolated using available technology should not be declared if 
the reaction is allowed to go to completion, completely consuming the 
real or hypothetical intermediates.

    (d) ``Declared'' Schedule 1 facilities and routine inspections. Only 
facilities that produced in excess of 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 
chemicals in calendar year 1997 or 1998, or during the previous calendar 
year, or that anticipate producing in excess of 100 grams aggregate of 
Schedule 1 chemicals during the next calendar year are considered 
``declared'' Schedule 1 facilities for the years declared. A 
``declared'' Schedule 1 facility is subject to initial and routine 
inspection by the OPCW (see part 716 of this subchapter).
    (e) Approval of declared Schedule 1 production facilities. 
Facilities that submit declarations pursuant to this section are 
considered approved Schedule 1 production facilities for purposes of the 
CWC, unless otherwise notified by BXA within 30 days of receipt by BXA 
of an annual declaration on past activities or annual declaration on 
anticipated activities (see paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this 
section). If your facility does not produce more than 100 grams 
aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals, no approval by BXA is required.


<R05>
Sec. 712.4  New Schedule 1 production facility.

    (a) Establishment of a new Schedule 1 production facility. (1) If 
your facility was not declared under Sec. 712.3 in a previous calendar 
year, and you intend to begin production of Schedule 1 chemicals at your 
facility in quantities greater than 100 grams aggregate per year for 
research, medical, or pharmaceutical purposes, you must provide an 
initial declaration (a current detailed technical description of your 
facility) to BXA at least 200 calendar days in advance of commencing 
such production. Such facilities are considered ``new Schedule 1 
production facilities''

[[Page 124]]

and are subject to an initial inspection within 200 calendar days of 
submitting an initial declaration.
    (2) New Schedule 1 production facilities that submit an initial 
declaration pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section are considered 
approved Schedule 1 production facilities for purposes of the CWC, 
unless otherwise notified by BXA within 30 days of receipt by BXA of 
that initial declaration.
    (b) Types of declaration forms required. If your new Schedule 1 
production facility will produce in excess of 100 grams aggregate of 
Schedule 1 chemicals, you must complete the Certification Form, Form 1-1 
and Form A. You must also provide a detailed technical description of 
the new facility or its relevant parts, including a detailed diagram of 
the declared areas in the facility, and an inventory of equipment in the 
declared areas.
    (c) Two hundred days after a new Schedule 1 production facility 
submits its initial declaration, it is subject to the annual declaration 
requirements of Sec. 712.3(a)(2) and (a)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 712.5  Advance notification and annual report of all exports <SUP>1</SUP> and imports of Schedule 1 chemicals to, or from, other States Parties.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Effective May 18, 1999, these advance notification and annual 
report requirements for exports are set forth in parts 742 and 745 of 
the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR parts 742 and 745).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to the Convention, the United States is required to notify 
the OPCW not less than 30 days in advance of every export or import of a 
Schedule 1 chemical, in any quantity, to or from another State Party. In 
addition, the United States is required to provide a report of all 
exports and imports of Schedule 1 chemicals to or from other States 
Parties during each calendar year. If you plan to export or import any 
quantity of a Schedule 1 chemical from or to your declared facility, 
undeclared facility or trading company, you must notify BXA in advance 
of the export or import and complete an annual report of exports and 
imports that actually occurred during the previous calendar year. The 
United States will transmit to the OPCW the advance notifications and a 
detailed annual declaration of each actual export or import of a 
Schedule 1 chemical from/to the United States. Note that the 
notification and annual report requirements of this section do not 
relieve you of any requirement to obtain a license from the Department 
of Commerce for the export of Schedule 1 chemicals subject to the Export 
Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799) or from the 
Department of State for the export of Schedule 1 chemicals subject to 
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 
130). Only facilities that produce in excess of 100 grams aggregate of 
Schedule 1 chemicals annually are ``declared'' facilities and are 
subject to routine inspections pursuant to part 716 of this subchapter.
    (a) Advance notification of exports and imports. (1) You must notify 
BXA at least 45 calendar days prior to exporting or importing any 
quantity of a Schedule 1 chemical listed in Supplement No. 1 to this 
part to or from another State Party. Note that notifications for exports 
may be sent to BXA prior to or after submission of a license application 
to BXA for Schedule 1 chemicals subject to the EAR and controlled under 
ECCNs 1C350 or 1C351 or to the Department of State for Schedule 1 
chemicals controlled under the ITAR. Such notices must be submitted 
separately from license applications.
    (i) Notifications should be on company letterhead or must clearly 
identify the reporting entity by name of company, complete address, name 
of contact person and telephone and fax numbers, along with the 
following information:
    (A) Chemical name;
    (B) Structural formula of the chemical;
    (C) Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Number;
    (D) Quantity involved in grams;
    (E) Planned date of export or import;
    (F) Purpose (end-use) of export or import (i.e., research, medical, 
pharmaceutical, or protective purpose);
    (G) Name(s) of exporter and importer;
    (H) Complete street address(es) of exporter and importer;
    (I) U.S. export license or control number, if known; and

[[Page 125]]

    (J) Company identification number, once assigned by BXA.
    (ii) Send the notification by fax to (703) 235-1481 or to the 
following address for mail and courier deliveries:
    Information Technology Team, Bureau of Export Administration, 
Department of Commerce, 1555 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 710, Arlington, VA 
22209-2405, Attn: ``Advance Notification of Schedule 1 Chemical [Export] 
[Import].''
    (iii) Upon receipt of the notification, BXA will inform the exporter 
of the earliest date the shipment may occur under the notification 
procedure. To export the Schedule 1 chemical subject to an export 
license requirement either under the EAR or the ITAR, the exporter must 
have applied for and been granted a license (see Secs. 742.2 and 742.18 
of the EAR, or the ITAR at 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).
    (b) Annual report requirements for exports and imports of Schedule 1 
chemicals. Any person subject to the CWCR that exported or imported any 
quantity of Schedule 1 chemical to or from another State Party during 
the previous calendar year, beginning with calendar year 1997, has a 
reporting requirement under this section.
    (1) Annual report on exports and imports. Declared and undeclared 
facilities, trading companies, and any other person subject to the CWCR 
that exported or imported any quantity of a Schedule 1 chemical to or 
from another State Party in a previous calendar year, beginning with 
calendar year 1997, must submit an annual report on exports and imports.

    Note to paragraph (b)(1):
    The U.S. Government will not submit to the OPCW company-specific 
information relating to the export or import of Schedule 1 chemicals 
contained in reports. The U.S. Government will add all export and import 
information contained in reports to establish the U.S. national 
aggregate declaration on exports and imports.

    (2) Report forms to submit. (i) Declared Schedule 1 facilities. (A) 
If your facility declared production of a Schedule 1 chemical and you 
also exported or imported any amount of that same Schedule 1 chemical, 
you may report the export or import by:
    (1) Submitting, along with your declaration, Form 1-3 for that same 
Schedule 1 chemical to be reported. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form 
B is optional; or
    (2) Submitting, separately from your declaration, a Certification, 
Form 1-1, and a Form 1-3 for each Schedule 1 chemical to be reported. 
Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (B) If your facility declared production of a Schedule 1 chemical 
and exported or imported any amount of a different Schedule 1 chemical, 
you may report the export or import by:
    (1) Submitting, along with your declaration, a Form 1-3 for each 
Schedule 1 chemical to be reported. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form 
B is optional; or
    (2) Submitting, separately from your declaration, a Certification 
Form, Form 1-1, and a Form 1-3 for each Schedule 1 chemical to be 
reported. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (ii) If you are an undeclared facility, trading company, or any 
other person subject to the CWCR, and you exported or imported any 
amount of a Schedule 1 chemical, you must submit a Certification Form, 
Form 1-1, and a Form 1-3 for each Schedule 1 chemical to be reported. 
Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (c) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the activities 
and persons set forth in Sec. 712.2(b).

Sec. 713.1  Prohibition on imports of Schedule 2 chemicals from non-States Parties.

    (a) See Sec. 711.6 of this subchapter for information on obtaining 
the forms you will need to declare and report activities involving 
Schedule 2 chemicals. You may not import any Schedule 2 chemical (see 
Supplement No. 1 to this part) on or after April 29, 2000, from any 
destination other than a State Party to the Convention. See Supplement 
No. 1 to part 710 of this subchapter for a list of States that are party 
to the Convention.

    Note to paragraph (a).
    See Sec. 742.18 of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR 
part 742) for prohibitions that apply to exports of Schedule 2 chemicals 
on or after April 29, 2000 to non-States Parties and for End-Use 
Certificate requirements for exports of Schedule 2 chemicals prior to 
April 29, 2000 to such destinations.

    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to:

[[Page 128]]

    (1) The transfer or receipt of a Schedule 2 chemical from a non-
State Party by a department, agency, or other entity of the United 
States, or by any person, including a member of the Armed Forces of the 
United States, who is authorized by law, or by an appropriate officer of 
the United States to transfer or receive the Schedule 2 chemical; or
    (2) Mixtures containing Schedule 2 chemicals, if the concentration 
of each Schedule 2 chemical in the mixture is 10% or less by weight. 
Note, however, that such mixtures may be subject to regulatory 
requirements of other federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 713.2  Declaration on past production of Schedule 2 chemicals for chemical weapons purposes.

    You must complete the Certification Form and Forms 2-1, 2-2, 2-4, 
Form A, if you produced at your plant site any quantity of a Schedule 2 
chemical at any time since January 1, 1946, for chemical weapons 
purposes. Form B is optional. You must declare the total quantity of 
such a chemical produced, rounded to the nearest kilogram. Note that you 
are not subject to routine inspection unless you are a declared facility 
pursuant to Sec. 713.3.


<R05>
Sec. 713.3  Initial and annual declaration requirements for plant sites that produce, process or consume Schedule 2 chemicals in excess of specified thresholds.

    (a) Declaration of production, processing or consumption of Schedule 
2 chemicals for purposes not prohibited by the CWC.
    (1) Quantities of production, processing or consumption that trigger 
declaration requirements. You must complete the forms specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section if you have been or will be involved in 
the following activities:
    (i) Initial declaration. You produced, processed or consumed at one 
or more plants on your plant site during any of the calendar years 1994, 
1995, or 1996, a Schedule 2 chemical in excess of the following 
declaration threshold quantities:
    (A) 1 kilogram of chemical BZ: 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (see 
Schedule 2, paragraph A.3 included in Supplement No. 1 to this part);
    (B) 100 kilograms of chemical PFIB: 1,1,3,3,3-Pentafluoro-
2(trifluoromethyl)-1-propene or 100 kilograms of chemical Amiton: 0,0-
Diethyl S-[2-(diethylamino) ethyl] phosphorothiolate and corresponding 
alkylated or protonated salts (see Schedule 2, paragraphs A.1 and A.2 
included in Supplement No. 1 to this part); or
    (C) 1 metric ton of any chemical listed in Schedule 2, Part B (see 
Supplement No. 1 to this part).

    Note to paragraph (a)(1)(i).
    To determine whether you have an initial declaration requirement for 
Schedule 2 activities, you must determine whether you produced, 
processed or consumed a Schedule 2 chemical above the applicable 
threshold quantity at one or more plants on your plant site in calendar 
years 1994, 1995, or 1996. For example, if you determine that one plant 
on your plant site produced greater than 1 kilogram of the chemical BZ 
in calendar year 1995, and no plants on your plant site produced, 
processed or consumed any Schedule 2 chemical above the applicable 
threshold quantity in calendar years 1994 or 1996, you have an initial 
declaration requirement under this paragraph. You must submit three 
Forms 2-3--one for each of the calendar years 1994, 1995, and 1996--and 
complete question 2-3.1 on each of the forms to declare production data 
on BZ for calendar years 1994, 1995 and 1996. For calendar year 1995, 
you would declare the quantity of BZ actually produced. For calendar 
years 1994 and 1996, you would declare ``0'' production quantity. Since 
the plant site did not engage in any other declarable activity (i.e., 
consumption, processing), you would leave blank questions 2-3.2 and 2-
3.3 on Form 2-3 for calendar years 1994, 1995, and 1996. Note that 
declaring a ``0'' quantity for production in 1994 and 1996, as opposed 
to leaving the question blank, permits BXA to distinguish the activity 
that triggered the initial declaration requirement for each year from 
activities that were not declarable during that period.

    (ii) Annual declaration on past activities. You produced, processed 
or consumed at one or more plants on your plant site during any of the 
previous three calendar years, a Schedule 2 chemical in excess of the 
applicable declaration threshold quantity specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1)(ii).
    To determine whether you have an annual declaration on past 
activities requirement for Schedule 2 chemicals, you must determine 
whether you

[[Page 129]]

produced, processed or consumed a Schedule 2 chemical above the 
applicable threshold quantity at one or more plants on your plant site 
in any one of the three previous calendar years. For example, for the 
1997 declaration period, if you determine that one plant on your plant 
site produced greater than 1 kilogram of the chemical BZ in calendar 
year 1995, and no plants on your plant site produced, processed or 
consumed any Schedule 2 chemical above the applicable threshold quantity 
in calendar years 1996 or 1997, you still have a declaration requirement 
under this paragraph for the previous calendar year (1997). However, you 
must only declare on Form 2-3 (question 2-3.1), production data for 
calendar year 1997. You would declare ``0'' production quantity because 
you did not produce BZ above the applicable threshold quantity in 
calendar year 1997. Since the plant site did not engage in any other 
declarable activity (i.e., consumption, processing) in the 1995-1997 
declaration period, you would leave blank questions 2-3.2 and 2-3.3 on 
Form 2-3. Note that declaring a ``0'' production quantity for 1997, as 
opposed to leaving the question blank, permits BXA to distinguish the 
activity that triggered the declaration requirement from activities that 
were not declarable during that period.

    (iii) Annual declaration on anticipated activities. You anticipate 
that you will produce, process or consume at one or more plants on your 
plant site during the next calendar year, starting with activities 
anticipated for calendar year 2001, a Schedule 2 chemical in excess of 
the applicable declaration threshold quantity set forth in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.
    (2) Mixtures containing a Schedule 2 chemical. (i)The quantity of a 
Schedule 2 chemical contained in a mixture must be counted when 
determining the total quantity of a Schedule 2 chemical produced, 
processed, or consumed at your plant only if the concentration of the 
Schedule 2 chemical in the mixture is 30% or more by volume or by 
weight, whichever yields the lesser percent.
    (ii) Counting the amount of the Schedule 2 chemical in a mixture. If 
your mixture contains 30% or more concentration of a Schedule 2 
chemical, you must count only the amount (weight) of the Schedule 2 
chemical in the mixture, not the total weight of the mixture.
    (iii) Determining declaration requirements for production, 
processing and consumption. You must include the amount (weight) of a 
Schedule 2 chemical in a mixture when determining the total production, 
total processing, or total consumption of that Schedule 2 chemical at a 
plant on your plant site. If the total amount of the produced, processed 
or consumed Schedule 2 chemical exceeds the applicable declaration 
threshold set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this 
section, you have a declaration requirement. For example, if during 
calendar year 1997, a plant on your plant site produced a mixture 
containing 300 kilograms of thiodiglycol in a concentration of 32% and 
also produced 800 kilograms of thiodiglycol, that plant produced 1100 
kilograms and exceeded the declaration threshold of 1 metric ton for 
that Schedule 2 chemical. You must declare past production of 
thiodiglycol at that plant site for calendar year 1997. If, on the other 
hand, a plant on your plant site processed a mixture containing 300 
kilograms of thiodiglycol in a concentration of 25% and also processed 
800 kilograms of thiodiglycol in other than mixture form, the total 
amount of thiodiglycol processed at that plant for CWCR purposes would 
be 800 kilograms and would not trigger a declaration requirement. This 
is because the concentration of thiodiglycol in the mixture is less than 
30% and therefore did not have to be ``counted'' and added to the other 
800 kilograms of processed thiodiglycol at that plant.
    (b) Types of declaration forms to be used. (1) Initial declaration. 
You must complete the Certification Form and Forms 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-3A, 
and Form A if you produced, processed or consumed at one or more plants 
on your plant site a Schedule 2 chemical in excess of the applicable 
declaration threshold quantity specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) 
through (C) of this section during any of the three calendar years 1994, 
1995, or 1996. Form B is optional. If you are subject to initial 
declaration requirements, you must include data for each of the calendar 
years 1994, 1995, and 1996.
    (2) Annual declaration on past activities. You must complete the 
Certification Form and Forms 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-3A, and Form A if one or 
more plants on your plant site produced, processed or consumed more than 
the applicable

[[Page 130]]

threshold quantity of a Schedule 2 chemical described in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section in any of the three previous 
calendar years. Form B is optional. If you are subject to annual 
declaration requirements, you must include data for the previous 
calendar year only.
    (3) Annual declaration on anticipated activities. You must complete 
the Certification Form and Forms 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-3A, 2-3C, and Form A 
if you plan to produce, process, or consume at any plant on your plant 
site a Schedule 2 chemical above the applicable threshold quantity set 
forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section during the 
following calendar year, beginning with activities planned for calendar 
year 2001. Form B is optional.
    (c) Quantities to be declared. (1) Production, processing and 
consumption of a Schedule 2 chemical above the declaration threshold--
(i) Initial declaration. If you are required to complete forms pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, you must declare the aggregate 
quantity resulting from each type of activity (production, processing or 
consumption) from each plant on your plant site that exceeds the 
applicable threshold quantity for that Schedule 2 chemical for each of 
the calendar years 1994, 1995, and 1996. Do not aggregate amounts of 
production, processing or consumption from plants on the plant site that 
did not individually produce, process or consume a Schedule 2 chemical 
in amounts greater than the applicable threshold levels. For those years 
in which you produced, processed or consumed the declared chemical below 
the declaration threshold, you declare ``0'' only for the declared 
activities.
    (ii) Annual declaration on past activities. If you are required to 
complete forms pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, you 
must declare the aggregate quantity resulting from each type of activity 
(production, processing or consumption) from each plant on your plant 
site that exceeds the applicable threshold quantity for that Schedule 2 
chemical. Do not aggregate amounts of production, processing or 
consumption from plants on the plant site that did not individually 
produce, process or consume a Schedule 2 chemical in amounts greater 
than the applicable threshold levels. If in the previous calendar year 
you produced, processed or consumed below the declaration threshold, but 
your declaration requirement is triggered because of activities 
occurring in an earlier year, you declare ``0'' only for the declared 
activities.
    (2) Rounding. For the chemical BZ, report quantities to the nearest 
hundredth of a kilogram (10 grams). For PFIB and the Amiton family, 
report quantities to the nearest 1 kilogram. For all other Schedule 2 
chemicals, report quantities to the nearest 10 kilograms.
    (d) ``Declared'' Schedule 2 plant sites. A plant site that comprises 
at least one plant that produced, processed or consumed a Schedule 2 
chemical above the applicable threshold quantity set forth in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section during any of the previous 
three calendar years or is anticipated to produce, process or consume a 
Schedule 2 chemical above the applicable threshold quantity in the next 
calendar year is a ``declared'' plant site. A plant site that submitted 
an initial declaration for activities that occurred in 1994, 1995, or 
1996 is a ``declared'' Schedule 2 plant site for those years.
    (e) Declared Schedule 2 plant sites subject to routine inspections. 
A ``declared'' Schedule 2 plant site is subject to initial and routine 
inspection by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 
if it produced, processed or consumed in any of the three previous 
calendar years, or is anticipated to produce, process or consume in the 
next calendar year, in excess of ten times the applicable declaration 
threshold quantity set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of 
this section (see part 716 of this subchapter). A plant site that 
submitted an initial declaration for calendar years 1994, 1995, and 
1996, and exceeded the applicable inspection threshold is also subject 
to an initial inspection.

Sec. 713.4  Initial and annual declaration and reporting requirements for exports and imports of Schedule 2 chemicals.

    (a) Declarations and reports of exports and imports of Schedule 2 
chemicals.

[[Page 131]]

    (1) Declarations. A Schedule 2 plant site that is declared because 
it produced, processed or consumed a Schedule 2 chemical above the 
applicable threshold quantity, and also exported from or imported to the 
plant site that same Schedule 2 chemical above the applicable threshold 
quantity, must submit export and import information as part of its 
declaration.

    Note to paragraph (a)(1):
    A declared Schedule 2 plant site may need to declare exports or 
imports of Schedule 2 chemicals that it produced, processed or consumed 
above the applicable threshold quantity and also report exports or 
imports of different Schedule 2 chemicals that it did not produce, 
process or consume above the applicable threshold quantities.

    (2) Reports. A declared plant site that does not meet the 
description of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and an undeclared plant 
site or a trading company or any other person subject to the CWCR must 
submit a report if it exported or imported a Schedule 2 chemical above 
the applicable threshold quantity.

    Note to paragraph (a)(2):
    The U.S. Government will not submit to the OPCW company-specific 
information relating to the export or import of Schedule 2 chemicals 
contained in reports. The U.S. Government will add all export and import 
information contained in reports to export and import information 
contained in declarations to establish the U.S. national aggregate 
declaration on exports and imports.
    Note to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2):
    Declared and undeclared plant sites must count, for declaration or 
report purposes, all exports from and imports to the entire plant site, 
not only from or to individual plants on the plant site.

    (b) Quantities of exports or imports that trigger a declaration or 
report requirement. (1) You have a declaration or report requirement and 
must complete the forms specified in paragraph (d) of this section if 
you exported or imported a Schedule 2 chemical in excess of the 
following threshold quantities:
    (i) 1 kilogram of chemical BZ: 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (See 
Schedule 2, paragraph A.3 included in Supplement No. 1 to this part);
    (ii) 100 kilograms of chemical PFIB: 1,1,3,3,3-Pentafluoro-
2(trifluoromethyl)-1-propene or 100 kilograms of Amiton : O,O Diethyl S-
[2(diethylamino)ethyl] phosphorothiolate and corresponding alkylated or 
protonated salts (see Schedule 2, paragraphs A.1 and A.2 included in 
Supplement No.1 to this part);
    (iii) 1 metric ton of any chemical listed in Schedule 2, Part B (see 
Supplement No.1 to this part).
    (2) Mixtures containing a Schedule 2 chemical. The quantity of a 
Schedule 2 chemical contained in a mixture must be counted for the 
declaration or reporting of an export or import only if the 
concentration of the Schedule 2 chemical in the mixture is 30% or more 
by volume or by weight, whichever yields the lesser percent.

    Note 1 to paragraph (b)(2).
    See Sec. 713.3(a)(2)(ii) for information on counting amounts of 
Schedule 2 chemicals contained in mixtures and determining declaration 
and report requirements.
    Note 2 to paragraph (b)(2).
    The ``30% and above'' mixtures rule applies only for declaration and 
report purposes. This rule does not apply for purposes of determining 
whether the export of your mixture to a non-State Party requires an End-
Use Certificate or for determining whether you need an export license 
from the Department of Commerce (see Secs. 742.2, 742.18 and 745.2 of 
the Export Administration Regulations) or from the Department of State 
(see the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 
through 130).

    (c) Declaration and report requirements. (1) Initial declaration. A 
plant site described in paragrpah (a)(1) of this section that has an 
initial declaration requirement for production, processing, or 
consumption of a Schedule 2 chemical must also declare the export or 
import of that same Schedule 2 chemical if the amount exported or 
imported in 1994, 1995 or 1996 exceeded the applicable threshold 
quantity set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. 
For the initial declaration, the plant site must only declare the export 
or import information for any of the calendar years (1994, 1995 and/or 
1996) in which the export or import exceeded the applicable threshold 
quantity.
    (2) Initial report on exports and imports. Declared plant sites 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, undeclared plant sites, 
trading companies or any other person subject to the CWCR that exported 
or imported a Schedule 2

[[Page 132]]

chemical in 1996 in excess of the applicable threshold quantity set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section, must submit an initial report on 
exports or imports for calendar year 1996.
    (3) Annual declaration on past activities. A plant site described in 
paragraph (a)(1) that has an annual declaration requirement for 
production, processing, or consumption of a Schedule 2 chemical for the 
previous calendar year, beginning in 1997, must also declare the export 
and/or import of that same Schedule 2 chemical if the amount exceeded 
the applicable threshold quantity set forth in paragraph (b). The plant 
site must declare the export or import information for that same 
Schedule 2 chemical as part of its annual declaration of past 
activities.
    (4) Annual report on exports and imports. Declared plant sites 
described in paragraph (a)(2), and undeclared plant sites, trading 
companies or any other person subject to the CWCR that exported or 
imported a Schedule 2 chemical in a previous calendar year, beginning in 
1997, in excess of the applicable threshold quantity set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (iii) must submit an annual report on 
exports or imports.
    (d) Types of declaration and report forms to be used. (1) Initial 
declaration. If you are a declared Schedule 2 plant site as described in 
paragraph (a)(1), you must complete Form 2-3B in addition to the forms 
required by Sec. 713.3(b)(1). You must complete the forms for each 
declared Schedule 2 chemical and for each of the calendar years 1994, 
1995, and 1996, in which the export or import exceeded the applicable 
threshold quantity.
    (2) Initial report on exports and imports. (i) If you are a declared 
plant site as described in paragraph (a)(2), you may fulfill your 
reporting requirements by:
    (A) Submitting, along with your initial declaration, a Form 2-3B for 
each Schedule 2 chemical you exported or imported above the applicable 
threshold quantity. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (B) Submitting, separately from your initial declaration, a 
Certification Form, Form 2-1, and Form 2-3B for each Schedule 2 chemical 
you exported or imported above the applicable threshold quantity. Attach 
Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (ii) If you are an undeclared plant site or trading company, you 
must complete the Certification Form, Form 2-1, and Form 2-3B for each 
Schedule 2 chemical you exported or imported above the applicable 
threshold quantity. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (3) Annual declaration on past activities. If you are a declared 
Schedule 2 plant site as described in paragraph (a)(1), you must 
complete Form 2-3B, in addition to the forms required by 
Sec. 713.3(b)(2), for each declared Schedule 2 chemical exported or 
imported above the applicable threshold quantity in the previous 
calendar year.
    (4) Annual report on exports and imports. (i) If you are a declared 
plant site as described in paragraph (a)(2), you may fulfill your annual 
reporting requirements by:
    (A) Submitting, along with your annual declaration on past 
activities, a Form 2-3B for each Schedule 2 chemical you exported or 
imported above the applicable threshold quantity. Attach Form A, as 
appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (B) Submitting, separately from your annual declaration on past 
activities, a Certification Form, Form 2-1, and Form 2-3B for each 
Schedule 2 chemical you exported or imported above the applicable 
threshold quantity. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (ii) If you are an undeclared plant site, trading company or any 
other person subject to the CWCR, you must complete the Certification 
Form, Form 2-1, and Form 2-3B for each Schedule 2 chemical you exported 
or imported above the applicable threshold quantity. Attach Form A, as 
appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (e) Quantities to be declared. (1) Calculations. If you exported 
from or imported to your plant site, trading company, or other location 
more than the applicable threshold quantity of a Schedule 2 chemical, 
you must declare or report all exports and imports by destination, and 
indicate the total amount exported to or imported from each destination. 
Only indicate the total annual quantity exported to or

[[Page 133]]

imported from a specific destination if the total annual quantity to or 
from that destination is more than 1% of the applicable threshold (i.e., 
more than 10 grams of BZ, 1 kilogram of PFIB and Amiton and 
corresponding alkylated or protonated salts, or 10 kilograms of all 
other Schedule 2 chemicals). However, in determining whether your total 
exports and imports worldwide for the year in question trigger a 
declaration or report requirement, you must include all exports and 
imports, including exports and imports falling within the 1% exemption 
in your calculation.
    (2) Rounding. For purposes of declaring or reporting exports and 
imports of a Schedule 2 chemical, you must total all exports and imports 
per calendar year per recipient or source destination and then round as 
follows: for the chemical BZ, the total quantity for each destination 
should be reported to the nearest hundredth of a kilogram (10 grams); 
for PFIB and Amiton and corresponding alkylated or protonated salts, the 
quantity for each destination should be reported to the nearest 1 
kilogram; and for all other Schedule 2 chemicals, the total quantity for 
each destination should be reported to the nearest 10 kilograms.


<R05>
Sec. 713.5  Advance declaration requirements for additionally planned production, processing, or consumption of Schedule 2 chemicals.

    (a) Declaration requirements for additionally planned activities. 
(1) You must declare additionally planned production, processing, or 
consumption of Schedule 2 chemicals after the annual declaration on 
anticipated activities for the next calendar year has been delivered to 
BXA if:
    (i) You plan that a previously undeclared plant on your plant site 
under Sec. 713.3(a)(1)(iii) will produce, process, or consume a Schedule 
2 chemical above the applicable declaration threshold;
    (ii) You plan to produce, process, or consume at a plant declared 
under Sec. 713.3(a)(1)(iii) an additional Schedule 2 chemical above the 
applicable declaration threshold;
    (iii) You plan an additional activity (production, processing, or 
consumption) at your declared plant above the applicable declaration 
threshold for a chemical declared under Sec. 713.3(a)(1)(iii);
    (iv) You plan to increase the production, processing, or consumption 
of a Schedule 2 chemical by a plant declared under Sec. 713.3(a)(1)(iii) 
from the amount exceeding the applicable declaration threshold to an 
amount exceeding the applicable inspection threshold (see 
Sec. 716.1(b)(2));
    (v) You plan to change the starting or ending date of anticipated 
production, processing, or consumption declared under 
Sec. 713.3(a)(1)(iii) by more than three months; or
    (vi) You plan to increase your production, processing, or 
consumption of a Schedule 2 chemical by a declared plant site by 20 
percent or more above that declared under Sec. 713.3(a)(1)(iii).
    (2) If you must submit a declaration on additionally planned 
activities because you plan to engage in any of the activities listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (vi) of this section, you should also 
declare changes to your declaration relating to the following 
activities. You do not have to submit an additionally planned 
declaration if you are only changing the following non-quantitative 
activities:
    (i) Changes to the plant's production capacity;
    (ii) Changes or additions to the product group codes for the plant 
site or the plant(s);
    (iii) Changes to the plant's activity status (i.e., dedicated, 
multipurpose, or other status);
    (iv) Changes to the plant's multipurpose activities;
    (v) Changes to the plant site's status relating to domestic transfer 
of the chemical;
    (vi) Changes to the plant site's purposes for which the chemical 
will be produced, processed or consumed; or
    (vii) Changes to plant site's status relating to exports of the 
chemical or the addition of new countries for export (not to exceed 10 
countries).
    (b) Declaration forms to be used. If you are required to declare 
additionally planned activities pursuant to paragraph (a) of this part, 
you must complete the Certification Form and Forms 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, and 2-
3C as appropriate. Such forms are due to BXA at

[[Page 134]]

least 15 days prior to beginning the additional activity.


<R05>

Sec. 713.7  Amended declaration or report.

    (a) You must submit an amended declaration or report for changes to 
previously submitted information on chemicals, activities and end-use 
purposes or the addition of new chemicals, activities and end-use 
purposes.
    (b) For declared plant sites subject to inspection, changes that may 
affect verification activities, such as changes of owner or operator, 
company name, address, or inspection point of contact require an amended 
declaration.
    (c) For declared plant sites not subject to inspection, undeclared 
plant sites, trading companies, and other persons, changes that do not 
directly affect the purpose of the Convention, such as changes to a 
company name, address, declaration point of contact, or non-substantive 
typographical errors, do not require submission of an amended 
declaration or report and may be corrected in subsequent declarations or 
reports.

[[Page 135]]

    (d) If you are required to submit an amended declaration or report 
pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you must complete and 
submit a new Certification Form and the specific form(s) being amended

<R05>
Sec. 714.1  Declaration on past production of Schedule 3 chemicals for chemical weapons purposes.

    (a) See Sec. 711.6 of this subchapter for information on obtaining 
the forms you will need to declare and report activities involving 
Schedule 3 chemicals.
    (b) You must complete the Certification Form, Forms 3-1, 3-2, 3-4, 
Form A if you produced at one or more plants on your plant site any 
quantity of a Schedule 3 chemical at any time since January 1, 1946, for 
chemical weapons purposes. Form B is optional. You must declare the 
total quantity of such chemical produced, rounded to the nearest tenth 
of a metric ton (or 100 kilograms). You are not subject to routine 
inspection unless you are a declared facility pursuant to Sec. 714.2.


<R05>
Sec. 714.2  Initial and annual declaration requirements for plant sites that produce a Schedule 3 chemical in excess of 30 metric tons.

    (a) Declaration of production of Schedule 3 chemicals for purposes 
not prohibited by the CWC. (1) Production quantities that trigger the 
declaration requirement. You must complete the appropriate forms 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section if you have produced or 
anticipate producing a Schedule 3 chemical as follows:
    (i) Initial declaration. You produced at one or more plants on your 
plant site in excess of 30 metric tons of any single

[[Page 136]]

Schedule 3 chemical during calendar year 1996.
    (ii) Annual declaration on past activities. You produced at one or 
more plants on your plant site in excess of 30 metric tons of any single 
Schedule 3 chemical during the previous calendar year, beginning with 
1997.
    (iii) Annual declaration on anticipated activities. You anticipate 
that you will produce at one or more plants on your plant site in excess 
of 30 metric tons of any single Schedule 3 chemical in the next calendar 
year.
    (2) Mixtures containing a Schedule 3 chemical. (i) The quantity of a 
Schedule 3 chemical contained in a mixture must be counted for 
declaration purposes only if the concentration of the Schedule 3 
chemical in the mixture is 80% or more by volume or by weight, whichever 
yields the lesser percent.
    (ii) Counting the amount of the Schedule 3 chemical in a mixture. If 
your mixture contains 80% or more concentration of a Schedule 3 
chemical, you must count only the amount (weight) of the Schedule 3 
chemical in the mixture, not the total weight of the mixture.
    (b) Types of declaration forms to be used. (1) Initial declaration. 
You must complete the Certification Form and Forms 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, and 
Form A if you produced at one or more plants on your plant site in 
excess of 30 metric tons of any single Schedule 3 chemical during 
calendar year 1996. Form B is optional.
    (2) Annual declaration on past activities. You must complete the 
Certification Form and Forms 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, and Form A if one or more 
plants on your plant site produced in excess of 30 metric tons of any 
single Schedule 3 chemical during the previous calendar year, beginning 
with production during calendar year 1997. Form B is optional.
    (3) Annual declaration on anticipated activities. You must complete 
the Certification Form, and Forms 3-1 and 3-3 if you anticipate that you 
will produce at one or more plants on your plant site in excess of 30 
metric tons of any single Schedule 3 chemical in the next calendar year.
    (c) Quantities to be declared. (1) Production of a Schedule 3 
chemical in excess of 30 metric tons. If your plant site is subject to 
the declaration requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, you must 
declare the range within which the production at your plant site falls 
(30 to 200 metric tons, 200 to 1,000 metric tons, etc.) as specified on 
Form 3-3. When specifying the range of production for your plant site, 
you must aggregate the production quantities of all plants on the plant 
site that produced the Schedule 3 chemical in amounts greater than 30 
metric tons. You must complete a separate Form 3-3 for each Schedule 3 
chemical for which production at your plant site exceeds 30 metric tons.
    (2) Rounding. To determine the production range into which your 
plant site falls, add all the production of the declared Schedule 3 
chemical during the calendar year from all plants on your plant site 
that produced the Schedule 3 chemical in amounts exceeding 30 metric 
tons, and round to the nearest ten metric tons.
    (d) ``Declared'' Schedule 3 plant sites. A plant site that comprises 
at least one plant that produced in excess of 30 metric tons of a 
Schedule 3 chemical during the previous calendar year, or that you 
anticipate will produce more than 30 metric tons of a Schedule 3 
chemical in the next calendar year, is a ``declared'' Schedule 3 plant 
site. A plant site that submitted an initial declaration for 1996 and/or 
annual declaration on past activities for 1997 or 1998 is a ``declared'' 
Schedule 3 plant site for the years declared.
    (e) Routine inspections of declared Schedule 3 plant sites. A 
``declared'' Schedule 3 plant site is subject to routine inspection by 
the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (see part 716 
of this subchapter) if the declared plants on your plant site produced 
during the previous calendar year or you anticipate they will produce 
during the next calendar year in excess of 200 metric tons aggregate of 
any Schedule 3 chemical. A plant site that submitted an initial 
declaration for 1996 and/or an annual declaration on past activities for 
1997 or 1998, and exceeded the inspection threshold, is also subject to 
a routine inspection.

<R05>
Sec. 714.3  Initial and annual report requirements for exports and imports of Schedule 3 chemicals.

    (a) Any person subject to the CWCR that exported from or imported to 
the United States a Schedule 3 chemical in excess of 30 metric tons in 
any calendar year, beginning with calendar year 1996, has a reporting 
requirement under this section.
    (1) Initial report on exports and imports. Declared plant sites, 
undeclared plant sites, trading companies, and any other person subject 
to the CWCR that exported from or imported to the United States in 
excess of 30 metric tons of a Schedule 3 chemical in calendar year 1996 
must submit an initial report on exports and imports.
    (2) Annual report on exports and imports. Declared plant sites, 
undeclared plant sites, trading companies, and any other person subject 
to the CWCR that exported from or imported to the United States in 
excess of 30 metric tons of a Schedule 3 chemical in a previous calendar 
year, beginning with calendar year 1997, must submit an annual report on 
exports and imports.

    Note 1 to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2).
    Declared and undeclared plant sites must count, for report purposes, 
all exports from and imports to the entire plant site, not only from or 
to individual plants on the plant site.
    Note 2 to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2):
    The U.S. Government will not submit to the OPCW company-specific 
information relating to the export or import of Schedule 3 chemicals 
contained in reports. The U.S. Government will add all export and import 
information contained in reports to establish the U.S. national 
aggregate declaration on exports and imports.

    (3) Mixtures containing a Schedule 3 chemical. The quantity of a 
Schedule 3 chemical contained in a mixture must be counted for reporting 
an export or import only if the concentration of the Schedule 3 chemical 
in the mixture is 80% or more by volume or by weight, whichever yields 
the lesser percent. For reporting purposes, only count the weight of the 
Schedule 3 chemical in the mixture, not the entire weight of the 
mixture.

    Note to paragraph (a)(3).
    The ``80% and above'' mixtures rule applies only for report 
purposes. This rule does not apply for purposes of determining whether 
the export of your mixture to a non-State Party requires an End-Use 
Certificate or for determining whether you need an export license from 
the Department of Commerce (see Secs. 742.2, 742.18 and 745.2 of the 
Export Administration Regulations) or from the Department of State (see 
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 C.F.R. 120 through 
130)).

    (b) Types of forms to be used. (1) Declared Schedule 3 plant sites. 
(i) If your plant site is declared for production of a Schedule 3 
chemical (and has completed questions 3-3.1 and 3-3.2 on Form 3-3) and 
you also exported or imported that same Schedule 3 chemical in excess of 
30 metric tons, you may report the export or import by:
    (A) Completing question 3-3.3 on Form 3-3 on your declaration for 
that same Schedule 3 chemical to be reported; or
    (B) Submitting, separately from your declaration, a Certification 
Form, Form 3-1, and a Form 3-3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be 
reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; 
Form B is optional.
    (ii) If your plant site declared production of a Schedule 3 chemical 
and exported or imported a different Schedule 3 chemical in excess of 30 
metric tons, you may report the export or import by:
    (A) Submitting, along with your declaration, a Form 3-3 for each 
Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, completing only question 3-3.3. 
Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional; or
    (B) Submitting, separately from your declaration, a Certification 
Form, Form 3-1 and a Form 3.3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be 
reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; 
Form B is optional.
    (2) If you are an undeclared plant site or trading company, or any 
other person subject to the CWCR, you must submit a Certification Form, 
Form 3-1, and a Form 3-3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, 
completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is 
optional.
    (c) Quantities to be reported. (1) Calculations. If you exported 
from or imported to your plant site or trading company more than 30 
metric tons of a Schedule 3 chemical in the previous

[[Page 138]]

calendar year, you must report all exports and imports of that chemical 
by destination, and indicate the total amount exported to or imported 
from each destination. Only indicate the total annual quantity exported 
to or imported from a specific destination if the total annual quantity 
to or from that destination is more than 1% of the applicable threshold 
(i.e., more than 0.3 metric tons). However, in determining whether your 
total exports and imports worldwide for the year in question trigger a 
report requirement, you must include all exports and imports, including 
exports and imports falling within the 1% exemption in your calculation.
    (2) Rounding. For purposes of reporting exports and imports of a 
Schedule 3 chemical, you must total all exports and imports per calendar 
year per recipient or source destination and then round to the nearest 
0.1 metric tons.

    Note to Sec. 714.3: Under the Convention, the United States is 
obligated to provide the OPCW a national aggregate annual declaration of 
the quantities of each Schedule 3 chemical exported and imported. The 
U.S. Government will not submit your company-specific information 
relating to the export or import of a Schedule 3 chemical reported under 
this Sec. 714.3. The U.S. Government will add all export and import 
information submitted by various facilities under this section to 
produce a national aggregate annual declaration of destination-by-
destination trade for each Schedule 3 chemical.


<R05>
Sec. 714.4  Advance declaration requirements for additionally planned production of Schedule 3 chemicals.

    (a) Declaration requirements. (1) You must declare additionally 
planned production of Schedule 3 chemicals after the annual declaration 
on anticipated activities for the next calendar year has been delivered 
to BXA if:
    (i) You plan that a previously undeclared plant on your plant site 
under Sec. 714.2(a)(1)(iii) will produce a Schedule 3 chemical above the 
declaration threshold;
    (ii) You plan to produce at a plant declared under 
Sec. 714.2(a)(1)(iii) an additional Schedule 3 chemical above the 
declaration threshold;
    (iii) You plan to increase the production of a Schedule 3 chemical 
by declared plants on your plant site from the amount exceeding the 
applicable declaration threshold to an amount exceeding the applicable 
inspection threshold (see Sec. 716.1(b)(3)); or
    (iv) You plan to increase the aggregate production of a Schedule 3 
chemical at a declared plant site to an amount above the upper limit of 
the range previously declared under Sec. 714.2(a)(1)(iii).
    (2) If you must submit a declaration on additionally planned 
activities because you plan to engage in any of the activities listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, you should also 
declare any changes to the anticipated purposes of production or product 
group codes. You do not have to submit a declaration on additionally 
planned activities if you are only changing your purposes of production 
or product group codes.
    (b) Declaration forms to be used. If you are required to declare 
additionally planned activities pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, you must complete the Certification Form and Forms 3-1, 3-2, 
and 3-3 as appropriate. Such forms are due to BXA at least 15 days in 
advance of the beginning of the additional or new activity.


<R05>

specified in paragraph (b) of this section if your plant site produced 
by synthesis:
    (i) In excess of 200 metric tons aggregate of all UDOCs (including 
all UDOCs containing the elements phosphorus, sulfur or fluorine, 
referred to as ``PSF-chemicals'') in calendar year 1996 (for the initial 
declaration) or the previous calendar year beginning with 1997 (for an 
annual declaration); or
    (ii) In excess of 30 metric tons of an individual PSF-chemical at 
one or more plants in calendar year 1996 (for the initial declaration) 
or in the previous calendar year beginning with 1997 (for an annual 
declaration).
    (2) UDOCs subject to declaration requirements under this part. (i) 
UDOCs subject to declaration requirements under this part are those 
produced by synthesis that have been isolated for:
    (A) Use; or
    (B) Sale as a specific end product.
    (ii) Exemptions. (A) Polymers and oligomers consisting of two or 
more repeating units which are formed by the chemical reaction of 
monomeric or polymeric substances;
    (B) Chemicals and chemical mixtures produced through a biological or 
biomediated process;
    (C) Products from the refining of crude oil, including sulfur-
containing crude oil;
    (D) Metal carbides (i.e., chemicals consisting only of metal and 
carbon); and
    (E) UDOCs produced by synthesis that are ingredients or by-products 
in foods designed for consumption by humans and/or animals.

    Note to Paragraph (a)(2):
    See Supplement No. 2 to this part for examples of UDOCs subject to 
the declaration requirements of this part, and for examples of 
activities that are not considered production by synthesis.

    (3) Exemptions for UDOC plant sites. UDOC plant sites that 
exclusively produced hydrocarbons or explosives are exempt from UDOC 
declaration requirements. For the purposes of this part, the following 
definitions apply for hydrocarbons and explosives:
    (i) Hydrocarbon means any organic compound that contains only carbon 
and hydrogen; and
    (ii) Explosive means a chemical (or a mixture of chemicals) that is 
included in Class 1 of the United Nations Organization hazard 
classification system.

    (2) Annual declaration on past activities. You must complete the 
Certification Form and Form UDOC (consisting of two pages). Attach Form 
A as appropriate; Form B is optional.
    (c) ``Declared'' UDOC plant sites. A plant site that produced by 
synthesis in excess of 200 metric tons aggregate of all UDOCs (including 
all PSF-chemicals), or that comprises at least one plant that produced 
by synthesis in excess of 30 metric tons of an individual PSF-chemical 
during the previous year, is a ``declared'' UDOC plant site. A plant 
site that submitted an initial declaration for 1996 and/or annual 
declaration on past activities for 1997 or 1998 is a ``declared'' UDOC 
plant site for the years declared.
    (d) Routine inspections of declared UDOC plant sites. A ``declared'' 
UDOC plant site is subject to routine inspection by the Organization for 
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (see part 716 of this subchapter) if 
it produced by synthesis during the previous calendar year more than 200 
metric tons aggregate of UDOCs. A plant site that submitted an initial 
declaration for 1996 and/or annual declaration on past activities for 
1997 or 1998, and exceeded the inspection threshold, is also subject to 
a routine inspection.

<R05>
Sec. 715.3  Amended declaration.

    (a) Amended declarations are required to correct certain 
inaccuracies in a previously submitted declaration. These amended 
declarations are necessary to change a production range above the amount 
originally declared, or the production of a PSF-chemical above 30 metric 
tons by a plant not previously counted as a PSF-plant.
    (b) Changes that do not directly affect the purpose of the 
Convention, such as changes to a company name, address, point of 
contact, or non-substantive typographical errors, do not require 
submission of an amended declaration and may be corrected in subsequent 
declarations.
    (c) If you are required to submit an amended declaration pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, you must complete and submit a new 
Certification Form and the specific form(s) being amended (e.g., annual 
declaration on past activities). Only complete that portion of each form 
that amends the previously submitted information.

  Supplement No. 1 to Part 715--Definition of an Unscheduled Discrete 
                            Organic Chemical

    Unscheduled discrete organic chemical means any chemical: (1) 
belonging to the class of chemical compounds consisting of all compounds 
of carbon except for its oxides, sulfides and metal carbonates 
identifiable by chemical name, by structural formula, if known, and by 
Chemical Abstract Service registry number, if assigned; and (2) that is 
not contained in the Schedules of Chemicals (see Supplements No. 1 to 
parts 712 through 714 of this subchapter). Unscheduled discrete organic 
chemicals subject to declaration under this part are those produced by 
synthesis that are isolated for use or sale as a specific end-product.

    Note: Carbon oxides consist of chemical compounds that contain only 
the elements

[[Page 142]]

carbon and oxygen and have the chemical formula 
C<INF>x</INF>O<INF>y</INF>, where x and y denote integers. The two most 
common carbon oxides are carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide 
(CO<INF>2</INF>). Carbon sulfides consist of chemical compounds that 
contain only the elements carbon and sulfur, and have the chemical 
formula C<INF>a</INF>S<INF>b</INF>, where a and b denote integers. The 
most common carbon sulfide is carbon disulfide (CS<INF>2</INF>). Metal 
carbonates consist of chemical compounds that contain a metal (i.e., the 
Group I Alkalis, Groups II Alkaline Earths, the Transition Metals, or 
the elements aluminum, gallium, indium, thallium, tin, lead, bismuth or 
polonium), and the elements carbon and oxygen. Metal carbonates have the 
chemical formula M<INF>d</INF>(CO<INF>3</INF>)<INF>e</INF>, where d and 
e denote integers and M represents a metal. Common metal carbonates are 
sodium carbonate (Na<INF>2</INF>CO<INF>3</INF>) and calcium carbonate 
(CaCO<INF>3</INF>). In addition, metal carbides or other compounds 
consisting of only a metal, as described above, and carbon (e.g., 
calcium carbide (CaC<INF>2</INF>)), are exempt from declaration 
requirements (see Sec. 715.1(a)(2)(ii)(D) of this part).

 Supplement No. 2 to Part 715--Examples of Unscheduled Discrete Organic 
                  Chemicals (UDOCs) and UDOC Production

    (1) Examples of UDOCs not subject to declaration include:
    (i) UDOCs produced coincidentally as by-products that are not 
isolated for use or sale as a specific end product, and are routed to, 
or escape from, the waste stream of a stack, incinerator, or waste 
treatment system or any other waste stream;
    (ii) UDOCs, contained in mixtures, which are produced coincidentally 
and not isolated for use or sale as a specific end-product;
    (iii) UDOCs produced by recycling (i.e., involving one of the 
processes listed in paragraph (3) of this supplement) of previously 
declared UDOCs;
    (iv) UDOCs produced by the mixing (i.e., the process of combining or 
blending into one mass) of previously declared UDOCs; and
    (v) Intermediate UDOCs used in a single or multi-step process to 
produce another declared UDOC.
    (2) Examples of UDOCs that you must declare under part 715 include, 
but are not limited to, the following, unless they are not isolated for 
use or sale as a specific end product:
    (i) Acetophenone (CAS  98-86-2);
    (ii) 6-Chloro-2-methyl aniline (CAS  87-63-8);
    (iii) 2-Amino-3-hydroxybenzoic acid (CAS  548-93-6); and
    (iv) Acetone (CAS  67-64-1).
    (3) Examples of activities that are not considered production by 
synthesis under part 715 and, thus, the end products resulting from such 
activities would not be declared under part 715, are as follows:
    (i) Fermentation;
    (ii) Extraction;
    (iii) Purification;
    (iv) Distillation; and
    (v) Filtration.

Sec. 716.1  General information on the conduct of initial and routine inspections.

    This part provides general information about the conduct of initial 
and routine inspections of declared facilities subject to inspection 
under CWC Verification Annex Part VI (E), Part VII(B), Part VIII(B) and 
Part IX(B). See part 717 of this subchapter for provisions concerning 
challenge inspections.
    (a) Overview. Each State Party to the CWC, including the United 
States, has agreed to allow certain inspections of declared facilities 
by inspectors employed by the Organization for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ensure that activities are consistent with 
obligations under the Convention.

[[Page 143]]

The Department of Commerce is responsible for leading, hosting and 
escorting inspections of all facilities subject to the provisions of 
this subchapter (see Sec. 710.2 of this subchapter).
    (b) Declared facilities subject to initial and routine inspections. 
(1) Schedule 1 facilities. (i) Your declared facility is subject to 
inspection if it produced in excess of 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 
chemicals in the previous calendar year or anticipates producing in 
excess of 100 grams aggregate of Schedule 1 chemicals during the next 
calendar year.
    (ii) If you are a new Schedule 1 production facility pursuant to 
Sec. 712.4 of this subchapter, your facility is subject to an initial 
inspection within 200 days of submitting an initial declaration.
    (iii) If your declared facility submitted an annual declaration on 
past activities for calendar year 1997 or 1998, you are subject to an 
initial inspection.

    Note to paragraph (b)(1):
    All Schedule 1 facilities submitting a declaration are subject to 
inspection.

    (2) Schedule 2 plant sites. (i) Your declared plant site is subject 
to inspection if at least one plant on your plant site produced, 
processed or consumed, in any of the three previous calendar years, or 
you anticipate that at least one plant on your plant site will produce, 
process or consume in the next calendar year, any Schedule 2 chemical in 
excess of the following:
    (A) 10 kg of chemical BZ: 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (see Schedule 2, 
Part A, paragraph 3 in Supplement No. 1 to part 713 of this subchapter);
    (B) 1 metric ton of chemical PFIB: 1,1,3,3,3-Pentafluoro-
2(trifluoromethyl)-1-propene or any chemical belonging to the Amiton 
family (see Schedule 2, Part A, paragraphs 1 and 2 in Supplement No. 1 
to part 713 of this subchapter); or
    (C) 10 metric tons of any chemical listed in Schedule 2, Part B (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 713 of this subchapter).
    (ii) If your declared plant site submitted an initial declaration 
for calendar years 1994, 1995 and 1996, and at least one plant on your 
plant site produced a Schedule 2 chemical during any one of those three 
years in excess of the applicable inspection threshold quantity set 
forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, you are 
subject to an initial inspection.

    Note to paragraph (b)(2):
    The applicable inspection threshold quantity for Schedule 2 plant 
sites is ten times higher than the applicable declaration threshold 
quantity. Only declared plant sites, comprising at least one declared 
plant that exceeds the applicable inspection threshold quantity, are 
subject to inspection.

    (3) Schedule 3 plant sites. (i) Your declared plant site is subject 
to inspection if the declared plants on your plant site produced during 
the previous calendar year, or you anticipate will produce in the next 
calendar year, in excess of 200 metric tons aggregate of any Schedule 3 
chemical (see Supplement No. 1 to part 714 of this subchapter).
    (ii) If your declared plant site submitted an initial declaration 
for calendar year 1996 and/or annual declaration on past activities for 
calendar year 1997 or 1998, and exceeded the inspection threshold set 
forth in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, you are subject to a 
routine inspection.

    Note to paragraph (b)(3):
    The methodology for determining a declarable and inspectable plant 
site is different. A Schedule 3 plant site that submits a declaration is 
subject to inspection only if the aggregate production of a Schedule 3 
chemical at all declared plants on the plant site exceeds 200 metric 
tons.

    (4) Unscheduled discrete organic chemical plant sites. (i) Your 
declared plant site is subject to inspection if it produced by synthesis 
more than 200 metric tons aggregate of unscheduled discrete organic 
chemicals during the previous calendar year.
    (ii) If your declared plant site submitted an initial declaration 
for calendar year 1996 and/or annual declaration on past activities for 
calendar year 1997 or 1998, and exceeded the inspection threshold set 
forth in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, you are subject to a 
routine inspection.

    Note 1 to paragraph (b)(4):
    You must include amounts of unscheduled discrete organic chemicals 
containing phosphorus, sulfur or fluorine in the calculation of your 
plant site's aggregate production of unscheduled discrete organic 
chemicals.

[[Page 144]]

    Note 2 to paragraph (b)(4):
    All UDOC plant sites that submit a declaration based on 
Sec. 715.1(a)(i) of this subchapter are subject to a routine inspection.

    (c) Responsibilities of the Department of Commerce. As the host and 
escort for the international Inspection Team for all inspections of 
facilities subject to the provisions of this subchapter under this part, 
the Department of Commerce will: lead on-site inspections; provide Host 
Team notification to the facility of an impending inspection; take 
appropriate action to obtain an administrative warrant in the event the 
facility does not consent to the inspection; dispatch an advance team to 
the vicinity of the site to provide administrative and logistical 
support for the impending inspection and, upon request, to assist the 
facility with inspection preparation; escort the Inspection Team on-site 
throughout the inspection process; assist the Inspection Team with 
verification activities; negotiate the development of a site-specific 
facility agreement, if appropriate, during an initial inspection of a 
facility (see Sec. 716.6); and ensure that an inspection adheres to the 
Convention, the Act and any warrant issued thereunder, and a site-
specific facility agreement, if concluded.


<R05>
Sec. 716.2  Purposes and types of inspections of declared facilities.

    (a) Schedule 1 facilities. (1) Purposes of inspections. The aim of 
inspections of Schedule 1 facilities is to verify that:
    (i) The facility is not used to produce any Schedule 1 chemical, 
except for the declared Schedule 1 chemicals;
    (ii) The quantities of Schedule 1 chemicals produced, processed or 
consumed are correctly declared and consistent with needs for the 
declared purpose; and
    (iii) The Schedule 1 chemical is not diverted or used for purposes 
other than those declared.
    (2) Types of inspections. (i) Initial inspections. During initial 
inspections of declared Schedule 1 facilities, in addition to the 
verification activities listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the 
Host Team and the Inspection Team will draft site-specific facility 
agreements (see Sec. 716.6) for the conduct of routine inspections.
    (ii) Routine inspections. During routine inspections of declared 
Schedule 1 facilities, the verification activities listed in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section will be carried out pursuant to site-specific 
facility agreements (Sec. 716.6) developed during the initial 
inspections and concluded between the U.S. Government and the OPCW 
pursuant to the Convention.
    (b) Schedule 2 plant sites. (1) Purposes of inspections. (i) The 
general aim of inspections of declared Schedule 2 plant sites is to 
verify that activities are in accordance with obligations under the 
Convention and consistent with the information provided in declarations. 
Particular aims of inspections of declared Schedule 2 plant sites are to 
verify:
    (A) The absence of any Schedule 1 chemical, especially its 
production, except if in accordance with the provisions of the 
Convention;
    (B) Consistency with declarations of levels of production, 
processing or consumption of Schedule 2 chemicals; and
    (C) That Schedule 2 chemicals are not diverted to activities 
prohibited under the Convention.
    (ii) During initial inspections, inspectors shall collect 
information to determine the frequency and intensity of subsequent 
inspections by assessing the risk to the object and purpose of the 
Convention posed by the relevant chemicals, the characteristics of the 
plant site and the nature of the activities carried out there. The 
inspectors will take the following criteria into account, inter alia:
    (A) The toxicity of the scheduled chemicals and of the end-products 
produced with them, if any;
    (B) The quantity of the scheduled chemicals typically stored at the 
inspected site;
    (C) The quantity of feedstock chemicals for the scheduled chemicals 
typically stored at the inspected site;
    (D) The production capacity of the Schedule 2 plants; and
    (E) The capability and convertibility for initiating production, 
storage and filling of toxic chemicals at the inspected site.
    (2) Types of inspections. (i) Initial inspections. During initial 
inspections of

[[Page 145]]

declared Schedule 2 plant sites, in addition to the verification 
activities listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Host Team and 
the Inspection Team will generally draft site-specific facility 
agreements for the conduct of routine inspections (see Sec. 716.6).
    (ii) Routine inspections. During routine inspections of declared 
Schedule 2 plant sites, the verification activities listed in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section will be carried out pursuant to any appropriate 
site-specific facility agreements developed during the initial 
inspections (see Sec. 716.6), and concluded between the U.S. Government 
and the OPCW pursuant to the Convention and the Act.
    (c) Schedule 3 plant sites. (1) Purposes of inspections. The general 
aim of inspections of declared Schedule 3 plant sites is to verify that 
activities are consistent with the information provided in declarations. 
The particular aim of inspections is to verify the absence of any 
Schedule 1 chemical, especially its production, except in accordance 
with the Convention.
    (2) Routine inspections. During routine inspections of declared 
Schedule 3 plant sites, in addition to the verification activities 
listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Host Team and the 
Inspection Team may draft site-specific facility agreements for the 
conduct of subsequent routine inspections (see Sec. 716.6). Although the 
Convention does not require facility agreements for declared Schedule 3 
plant sites, the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a plant 
site may request one. The Host Team will not seek a facility agreement 
if the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of the plant site 
does not request one. Subsequent routine inspections will be carried out 
pursuant to site-specific facility agreements, if applicable.
    (d) Unscheduled Discrete Organic Chemicals plant sites. Declared 
unscheduled discrete organic chemical (UDOC) plant sites will be subject 
to inspection beginning April 29, 2000.
    (1) Purposes of inspections. The general aim of inspections of 
declared UDOC plant sites is to verify that activities are consistent 
with the information provided in declarations. The particular aim of 
inspections is to verify the absence of any Schedule 1 chemical, 
especially its production, except in accordance with the Convention.
    (2) Routine inspections. During routine inspections of declared UDOC 
plant sites, in addition to the verification activities listed in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Host Team and the Inspection Team 
may develop draft site-specific facility agreements for the conduct of 
subsequent routine inspections (see Sec. 716.6). Although the Convention 
does not require facility agreements for declared UDOC plant sites, the 
owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a plant site may request 
one. The Host Team will not seek a facility agreement if the owner, 
operator, occupant or agent in charge of the plant site does not request 
one. Subsequent routine inspections will be carried out pursuant to 
site-specific facility agreements, if applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 716.3  Consent to inspections; warrants for inspections.

    (a) The owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a facility 
may consent to an initial or routine inspection. The individual giving 
consent on behalf of the facility represents that he or she has the 
authority to make this decision for the facility.
    (b) In instances where consent is not provided by the owner, 
operator, occupant or agent in charge for an initial or routine 
inspection, the Department of Commerce intends to seek administrative 
warrants as provided by the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 716.4  Scope and conduct of inspections.

    (a) General. Each inspection shall be limited to the purposes 
described in Sec. 716.2 and shall be conducted in the least intrusive 
manner, consistent with the effective and timely accomplishment of its 
purpose as provided in the Convention.
    (b) Scope. (1) Description of inspections. During inspections, 
inspectors will receive a pre-inspection briefing from facility 
representatives; visually inspect the facilities or plants producing 
scheduled chemicals or UDOCs, which may include storage areas, feed 
lines, reaction vessels and ancillary

[[Page 146]]

equipment, control equipment, associated laboratories, first aid or 
medical sections, and waste and effluent handling areas, as necessary to 
accomplish their inspection; examine relevant records; and may take 
samples as provided by the Convention, the Act and consistent with the 
requirements set forth by the Director of the United States National 
Authority (USNA) at 22 CFR part 103, and the facility agreement, if 
applicable.
    (2) Scope of consent. When an owner, operator, occupant, or agent in 
charge of a facility consents to an initial or routine inspection, he or 
she is consenting to provide access to the Inspection Team and Host Team 
to any area of the facility, any item located on the facility, 
interviews with facility personnel, and any records necessary for the 
Inspection Team to complete its mission. When consent is granted for an 
inspection, the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge agrees to 
provide the same degree of access provided for under section 305 of the 
Act. The determination of whether the Inspection Team's request to 
inspect any area, building, item or record is reasonable is the 
responsibility of the Host Team Leader.
    (c) Pre-inspection briefing. Upon arrival at the inspection site and 
before commencement of the inspection, facility representatives will 
provide to the Inspection Team and Host Team a pre-inspection briefing 
on the facility, the activities carried out there, safety measures, and 
administrative and logistical arrangements necessary for the inspection, 
which may be aided with the use of maps and other documentation as 
deemed appropriate by the facility. The time spent for the briefing will 
be limited to the minimum necessary and may not exceed three hours.
    (1) The pre-inspection briefing will address:
    (i) Plant site safety and alarms;
    (ii) Activities, business and manufacturing operations;
    (iii) Physical layout;
    (iv) Delimitation of declared facility;
    (v) Scheduled chemicals/chemistries (declared and undeclared);
    (vi) Process flow;
    (vii) Units specific to declared operations; and
    (viii) Administrative and logistic information.
    (2) The pre-inspection briefing may also address, inter alia:
    (i) Introduction of key facility personnel;
    (ii) Management, organization and history;
    (iii) Confidential business information concerns;
    (iv) Types and location of records/documents;
    (v) Data declaration updates/revisions;
    (vi) Draft facility agreement, if applicable; and
    (vii) Proposed inspection plan.
    (d) Visual plant inspection. The Inspection Team may visually 
inspect the declared plant or facility and other areas of the plant site 
or facility as agreed by the Host Team Leader after consulting with the 
facility representative.
    (e) Records review. The facility must have available for the 
Inspection Team to review, on the inspection site, access to all 
supporting materials and documentation used by the facility to prepare 
declarations and to comply with the CWCR (see Secs. 721.1 and 721.2 of 
this subchapter). Such access may be to paper copies or via electronic 
remote access by computer during the inspection period or as otherwise 
agreed upon by the Inspection Team and Host Team Leader.
    (f) Effect of facility agreements. Routine inspections at facilities 
for which the United States has concluded a facility agreement with the 
OPCW will be conducted in accordance with the facility agreement. The 
existence of a facility agreement does not in any way limit the right of 
the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the facility to 
withhold consent to an inspection request.
    (g) Hours of inspections. Consistent with the provisions of the 
Convention, the Host Team will ensure, to the extent possible, that each 
inspection is commenced, conducted, and concluded during ordinary 
working hours, but no

[[Page 147]]

inspection shall be prohibited or otherwise disrupted from commencing, 
continuing or concluding during other hours.
    (h) Health and safety regulations and requirements. In carrying out 
their activities, the Inspection Team and Host Team shall observe 
federal, state, and local health and safety regulations and health and 
safety requirements established at the inspection site, including those 
for the protection of controlled environments within a facility and for 
personal safety. Such health and safety regulations and requirements 
will be set forth in, but will not necessarily be limited to, the 
facility agreement, if applicable.
    (i) Preliminary factual findings. Upon completion of an inspection, 
the Inspection Team will meet with the Host Team and facility personnel 
to review the written preliminary findings of the Inspection Team and to 
clarify ambiguities. The Host Team will discuss the preliminary findings 
with the facility, and the Host Team Leader will take into consideration 
the facility's input when providing official comment on the preliminary 
findings to the Inspection Team. This meeting will be completed not

Sec. 716.5  Notification, duration and frequency of inspections.

    (a) Notification. (1)(i) Content of notice. Inspections of 
facilities may be made only upon issuance of written notice by the 
United States National Authority (USNA) to the owner and to the 
operator, occupant or agent in charge of the premises to be inspected. 
The Department of Commerce will also provide a separate Host Team 
notification to the inspection point of contact identified in 
declarations submitted by the facility. If the United States is unable 
to provide actual written notice to the owner, operator, or agent in 
charge, the Department of Commerce, or if the Department of Commerce is 
unable, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, may post notice prominently 
at the facility to be inspected. The notice shall include all 
appropriate information provided by the OPCW to the USNA concerning:
    (A) The type of inspection;
    (B) The basis for the selection of the facility or location for the 
type of inspection sought;
    (C) The time and date that the inspection will begin and the period 
covered by the inspection; and
    (D) The names and titles of the inspectors.
    (ii) In addition to appropriate information provided by the OPCW in 
its notification to the USNA, the Department of Commerce's Host Team 
notification will request that the facility indicate whether it will 
consent to an inspection, and will state whether an advance team is 
available to assist the site in preparation for the inspection. If an 
advance team is available, facilities that request advance team 
assistance are not required to reimburse the U.S. Government for costs 
associated with these activities. If a facility does not agree to 
provide consent to an inspection within four hours of receipt of the 
Host Team notification, BXA intends to seek an administrative warrant.
    (iii) The following table sets forth the notification procedures for 
inspection:

<R05>
Sec. 716.6  Facility agreements.

    (a) Description and requirements. A facility agreement is a site-
specific agreement between the U.S. Government and the OPCW. Its purpose 
is to define procedures for inspections of a specific declared facility 
that is subject to inspection because of the type or amount of chemicals 
it produces, processes or consumes.
    (1) Schedule 1 facilities. The Convention requires that facility 
agreements be concluded between the United States and the OPCW for all 
declared Schedule 1 facilities.
    (2) Schedule 2 plant sites. The USNA will ensure that such facility 
agreements are concluded with the OPCW unless the owner, operator, 
occupant or agent in charge of the plant site and the OPCW Technical 
Secretariat agree that such a facility agreement is not necessary.
    (3) Schedule 3 and unscheduled discrete organic chemical plant 
sites. If the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a declared 
Schedule 3 or unscheduled discrete organic chemical plant site requests 
a facility agreement, the USNA will ensure that a facility agreement for 
such a plant site is concluded with the OPCW.
    (b) Notification; negotiation of draft and final facility 
agreements; and conclusion of facility agreements. Prior to the 
development of a facility agreement, the Department of Commerce shall 
notify the owner, operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the 
facility, and if the owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge so 
requests, the notified person may participate in preparations with 
Department of Commerce representatives for the negotiation of such an 
agreement. During the initial inspection of a declared facility, the 
Inspection Team and the Host Team will negotiate a draft facility 
agreement. To the maximum extent practicable consistent with the 
Convention, the owner and the operator, occupant or agent in charge of 
the facility may observe facility agreement negotiations between the 
U.S. Government and OPCW. As a general rule, BXA will consult with the 
affected facility on the contents of the agreements and take facility 
comments into consideration during negotiations. The Department

[[Page 150]]

of Commerce will participate in the negotiation of, and approve, all 
final facility agreements with the OPCW. Facilities will be notified of 
and have the right to observe final facility agreement negotiations 
between the United States and OPCW to the maximum extent practicable, 
consistent with the Convention. Prior to the conclusion of a final 
facility agreement, the affected facility will have an opportunity to 
comment on the facility agreement. BXA will give consideration to such 
comments prior to approving final facility agreements with the OPCW. The 
United States National Authority shall ensure that facility agreements 
for Schedule 1, Schedule 2, Schedule 3 and unscheduled discrete organic 
chemical facilities are concluded, as appropriate, with the OPCW in 
coordination with the Department of Commerce.
    (c) Format and content. Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 model facility 
agreements are included in Supplement No. 2 and Supplement No. 3 to this 
part. These model facility agreements implement the general provisions 
of the Convention pertaining to inspections, including health and safety 
procedures, confidentiality of information, media and public relations, 
information about the facility, inspection equipment, pre-inspection 
activities, conduct of the inspection (including access to and 
inspection of areas, buildings and structures, access to and inspection 
of records and documentation, arrangements for interviews of facility 
personnel, photographs, sampling, and measurements), and logistical 
arrangements for the inspectors, such as communications and lodging. 
Attachments to the facility agreements will provide site-specific 
information such as working hours, special safety and health procedures, 
as well as site-specific agreements as to documents and records to be 
provided, specific areas of a facility to be inspected, site diagrams, 
sampling, photography, interview procedures, use of inspection 
equipment, procedures for protection of confidential business 
information, and administrative arrangements.
    (d) Further information. For further information about facility 
agreements, please write or call: Inspection Management Team, Bureau of 
Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and 
Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 6087B, Washington, D.C. 20230-0001, 
Telephone: (202) 482-6114.


<R05>
Sec. 716.7  Samples.

    The owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of a facility must 
provide a sample as provided for in the Convention and consistent with 
requirements set forth by the Director of the United States National 
Authority in 22 CFR part 103.


<R05>
Sec. 716.8  On-site monitoring of Schedule 1 facilities.

    Declared Schedule 1 facilities are subject to verification by 
monitoring with on-site instruments as provided by the Convention. For 
facilities subject to the CWCR, however, such monitoring is not 
anticipated. The U.S. Government will ensure that any monitoring that 
may be requested by the OPCW is carried out pursuant to the Convention 
and U.S. law.


<R05>
Sec. 716.9  Report of inspection-related costs.

    Pursuant to section 309(b)(5) of the Act, any facility that has 
undergone any inspections pursuant to this subchapter during a given 
calendar year must report to BXA within 90 days of an inspection on its 
total costs related to that inspection. Although not required, such 
reports should identify categories of costs separately if possible, such 
as personnel costs (production-line, administrative, legal), costs of 
producing records, and costs associated with shutting down chemical 
production or processing during inspections, if applicable. This 
information should be reported to BXA on company letterhead at the 
address given in Sec. 716.6(d), with the following notation: ``Attn: 
Report of inspection-related costs.''

PART 717--CLARIFICATION OF POSSIBLE NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONVENTION; CHALLENGE INSPECTION PROCEDURES--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
717.1  Clarification procedures; challenge inspection requests pursuant 
          to Article IX of the Convention.
717.2  Challenge inspections.
717.3  Samples.
717.4  Report of inspection-related costs.

    Authority: 22 U.S.C. 6701 et seq., 2681; E.O. 13128, 64 FR 36703.

    Source: 64 FR 73801, Dec. 30, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 717.1  Clarification procedures; challenge inspection requests pursuant to Article IX of the Convention.

    (a) Article IX of the Convention sets forth procedures for 
clarification, between States Parties, of issues about compliance with 
the Convention. If States Parties are unable to resolve such issues 
through consultation between themselves or through the Organization for 
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a State Party may request 
the OPCW to conduct an on-site challenge inspection of any facility or 
location in the territory or in any other place under the jurisdiction 
or control of any other State Party. Such an on-site challenge 
inspection request shall be for the sole purpose of clarifying and 
resolving any questions concerning possible non-compliance with the 
Convention.
    (b) Any person or facility subject to the CWCR (parts 710 through 
722 of this subchapter) must, within five working days, provide 
information required by the Department of Commerce pursuant to an 
Article IX clarification request from another State Party, or the OPCW, 
concerning possible non-compliance with the reporting, declaration, 
notification, or inspection requirements set forth in parts 712 through 
716 of this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 717.2  Challenge inspections.

    Any person or facility subject to the CWCR (see Sec. 710.2 of this 
subchapter), whether or not required to submit declarations or reports, 
may be subject to

[[Page 176]]

a challenge inspection by the OPCW concerning possible non-compliance 
with the requirements of the Convention. The Department of Commerce will 
host and escort the international Inspection Team for all challenge 
inspections of persons or facilities subject to the CWCR concerning 
possible non-compliance with the requirements set forth in parts 712 
through 716 of this subchapter.
    (a) Warrants. In instances where consent is not provided by the 
owner, operator, occupant or agent in charge of the facility or 
location, the Department of Commerce will assist the Department of 
Justice in seeking a criminal warrant as provided by the Act. The 
existence of a facility agreement does not in any way limit the right of 
the operator of the facility to withhold consent to a challenge 
inspection request.
    (b) Notification of challenge inspection. Challenge inspections may 
be made only upon issuance of written notice by the United States 
National Authority (USNA) to the owner and to the operator, occupant or 
agent in charge of the premises. The Department of Commerce will provide 
Host Team notification to the inspection point of contact if such 
notification is deemed appropriate. If the United States is unable to 
provide actual written notice to the owner, operator, or agent in 
charge, the Department of Commerce, or if the Department of Commerce is 
unable, another appropriate agency, may post notice prominently at the 
plant, plant site or other facility or location to be inspected.
    (1) Timing. The OPCW will notify the USNA of a challenge inspection 
not less than 12 hours before the planned arrival of the Inspection Team 
at the U.S. point of entry. Written notice will be provided to the owner 
and to the operator, occupant, or agent in charge of the premises at any 
appropriate time determined by the USNA after receipt of notification 
from the OPCW Technical Secretariat.
    (2)(i) Content of notice. The notice shall include all appropriate 
information provided by the OPCW to the United States National Authority 
concerning:
    (A) The type of inspection;
    (B) The basis for the selection of the facility or locations for the 
type of inspection sought;
    (C) The time and date that the inspection will begin and the period 
covered by the inspection;
    (D) The names and titles of the inspectors; and
    (E) All appropriate evidence or reasons provided by the requesting 
State Party for seeking the inspection.
    (ii) In addition to appropriate information provided by the OPCW in 
its notification to the USNA, the Department of Commerce's Host Team 
notification to the facility or plant site will state whether an advance 
team is available to assist the site in preparation for the inspection. 
If an advance team is available, facilities that request advance team 
assistance are not required to reimburse the U.S. Government for costs 
associated with these activities.
    (c) Period of inspection. Challenge inspections will not exceed 84 
hours, unless extended by agreement between the Inspection Team and the 
Host Team Leader.
    (d) Scope and conduct of inspections. (1) General. Each inspection 
shall be limited to the purposes described in this section and conducted 
in the least intrusive manner, consistent with the effective and timely 
accomplishment of its purpose as provided in the Convention.
    (2) Scope of inspections. If an owner, operator, occupant, or agent 
in charge of a facility or location consents to a challenge inspection, 
the inspection will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of 
Article IX and applicable provisions of the Verification Annex of the 
Convention. If consent is not granted, the inspection will be conducted 
in accordance with a criminal warrant, as provided by the Act, and in 
accordance with the provisions of Article IX and applicable provisions 
of the Verification Annex of the Convention. A challenge inspection will 
also be conducted in accordance with a facility agreement, if a facility 
agreement has been concluded for the subject facility, to the extent the 
terms of the facility agreement are relevant to the challenge inspection 
request.

[[Page 177]]

    (3) Hours of inspections. Consistent with the provisions of the 
Convention, the Host Team will ensure, to the extent possible, that each 
inspection is commenced, conducted, and concluded during ordinary 
working hours, but no inspection shall be prohibited or otherwise 
disrupted from commencing, continuing or concluding during other hours.
    (4) Health and safety regulations and requirements. In carrying out 
their activities, the Inspection Team and Host Team shall observe 
federal, state, and local health and safety regulations and health and 
safety requirements established at the inspection site, including those 
for the protection of controlled environments within a facility and for 
personal safety.

<R05>
Sec. 717.4  Report of inspection-related costs.

    Pursuant to section 309(b)(5) of the Act, any facility that has 
undergone any inspections pursuant to this subchapter during a given 
calendar year must report to BXA within 90 days of an inspection on its 
total costs related to that inspection. Although not required, such 
reports should identify categories of costs separately if possible, such 
as personnel costs (production-line, administrative, legal), costs of 
producing records, and costs associated with shutting down chemical 
production or processing during inspections, if applicable. This 
information should be reported to BXA on company letterhead at the 
address given in Sec. 716.6(d) of this subchapter, with the following 
notation:

<R05>
Sec. 718.2  Identification of confidential business information.

    (a) General. Certain confidential business information submitted to 
BXA in declarations and reports does not need to be specifically 
identified and marked by the submitter, as described in paragraph (b) of 
this section. Other confidential business information submitted to BXA 
in declarations and reports and confidential business information 
provided to the Host Team during inspections must be identified by the 
inspected facility so that the Host Team can arrange appropriate marking 
and handling.
    (b) Confidential business information contained in declarations and 
reports. (1) BXA has identified those data fields on the declaration and 
report forms that request ``confidential business information'' as 
defined by the Act. These data fields are identified in the table 
provided in Supplement No. 1 to this part.
    (2) You must specifically identify in a cover letter submitted with 
your declaration or report any additional information on a declaration 
or report form (i.e., information not provided in one of the data fields 
listed in the table included in Supplement No. 1 to this part), 
including information provided in attachments to Form A or Form B, that 
you believe is confidential business information, as defined by the Act, 
and must describe how disclosure would likely result in competitive 
harm.

    Note to paragraph (b):
    BXA has also determined that descriptions of Schedule 1 facilities 
submitted with Initial Declarations as attachments to Form A contain 
confidential business information, as defined by the Act.

    (c) Confidential business information contained in notifications. 
Information contained in advance notifications of exports and imports of 
Schedule 1 chemicals is not subject to the confidential business 
information provisions of the Act. You must identify information in your 
notifications of Schedule 1 imports that you consider to be privileged 
and confidential, and describe how disclosure would likely result in 
competitive harm. See Sec. 718.3(b) for provisions on disclosure to the 
public of such information by the U.S. Government.
    (d) Confidential business information related to inspections 
disclosed to, reported to, or otherwise acquired by, the U.S. 
Government. (1) During inspections, certain confidential business 
information, as defined by the Act, may be disclosed to the Host Team. 
Facilities being inspected are responsible for identifying confidential 
business information to the Host Team, so that if it is disclosed to the 
Inspection Team, appropriate marking and handling can be arranged, in 
accordance with the provisions of the Convention (see 
Sec. 718.3(c)(1)(ii)). Confidential business information not related to 
the purpose of an inspection or not necessary for the accomplishment of 
an inspection, as determined by the Host Team, may be removed from 
sight, shrouded, or otherwise not disclosed.
    (2) Before or after inspections, confidential business information 
related to an inspection that is contained in any documents or that is 
reported to, or otherwise acquired by, the U.S. Government, such as 
facility information for pre-inspection briefings, facility agreements, 
and inspection reports, must be identified by the facility so that it 
may be appropriately marked and handled. If the U.S. Government creates 
derivative documents from such documents or reported information, they 
will also be marked and handled as confidential business information.


<R05>
Sec. 718.3  Disclosure of confidential business information.

    (a) General. Confidentiality of information will be maintained by 
BXA consistent with the non-disclosure provisions of the Act, the Export 
Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799), the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 
130), and applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act, as 
appropriate.
    (b) Disclosure of confidential business information contained in 
notifications. Information contained in advance notifications of exports 
and imports of Schedule 1 chemicals is not subject to the confidential 
business information provisions of the Act. Disclosure of such 
information will be in accordance with the provisions of the relevant

[[Page 179]]

statutory and regulatory authorities as follows:
    (1) Exports of Schedule 1 chemicals. Confidentiality of all 
information contained in these notifications will be maintained 
consistent with the non-disclosure provisions of the Export 
Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799), the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 
130), and applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act, as 
appropriate; and
    (2) Imports of Schedule 1 chemicals. Confidentiality of information 
contained in these notifications will be maintained pursuant to 
applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act.
    (c) Disclosure of confidential business information pursuant to 
Sec. 404(b) of the Act. (1) Disclosure to the Organization for the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). (i) As provided by Section 
404(b)(1) of the Act, the U.S. Government will disclose or otherwise 
provide confidential business information to the Technical Secretariat 
of the OPCW or to other States Parties to the Convention, in accordance 
with provisions of the Convention, particularly with the provisions of 
the Annex on the Protection of Confidential Information (Confidentiality 
Annex).
    (ii) Convention provisions. (A) The Convention provides that States 
Parties may designate information submitted to the Technical Secretariat 
as confidential, and requires the OPCW to limit access to, and prevent 
disclosure of, information so designated, except that the OPCW may 
disclose certain confidential information submitted in declarations to 
other States Parties if requested. The OPCW has developed a 
classification system whereby States Parties may designate the 
information they submit in their declarations as ``restricted,'' 
``protected,'' or ``highly protected,'' depending on the sensitivity of 
the information. Other States Parties are obligated, under the 
Convention, to store and restrict access to information which they 
receive from the OPCW in accordance with the level of confidentiality 
established for that information.
    (B) OPCW inspectors are prohibited, under the terms of their 
employment contracts and pursuant to the Confidentiality Annex of the 
Convention, from disclosing to any unauthorized persons, for five years 
after termination of their employment, any confidential information 
coming to their knowledge or into their possession in the performance of 
their official duties.
    (iii) U.S. Government designation of information to the Technical 
Secretariat. It is the policy of the U.S. Government to designate all 
facility information it provides to the Technical Secretariat in 
declarations, reports and Schedule 1 notifications as ``protected.'' It 
is the policy of the U.S. Government to designate confidential business 
information that it discloses to Inspection Teams during inspections as 
``protected'' or ``highly protected,'' depending on the sensitivity of 
the information. The Technical Secretariat is responsible for storing 
and limiting access to any confidential business information contained 
in a document according to its established procedures.
    (2) Disclosure to Congress. Section 404(b)(2) of the Act provides 
that the U.S. Government must disclose confidential business information 
to any committee or subcommittee of Congress with appropriate 
jurisdiction upon the written request of the chairman or ranking 
minority member of such committee or subcommittee. No such committee or 
subcommittee, and no member and no staff member of such committee or 
subcommittee, may disclose such information or material except as 
otherwise required or authorized by law.
    (3) Disclosure to other Federal agencies for law enforcement actions 
and disclosure in enforcement proceedings under the Act. Section 
404(b)(3) of the Act provides that the U.S. Government must disclose 
confidential business information to other Federal agencies for 
enforcement of the Act or any other law, and must disclose such 
information when relevant in any proceeding under the Act. Disclosure 
will be made in such manner as to preserve confidentiality to the extent 
practicable without impairing the proceeding. Section 719.14(b) of this 
subchapter provides that all hearings will be closed, unless the 
Administrative Law Judge for good cause shown determines otherwise.

[[Page 180]]

Section 719.20 of this subchapter provides that parties may request that 
the administrative law judge segregate and restrict access to 
confidential business information contained in material in the record of 
an enforcement proceeding.
    (4) Disclosure to the public; national interest determination. 
Section 404(c) of the Act provides that confidential business 
information, as defined by the Act, that is in the possession of the 
U.S. Government, is exempt from public disclosure in response to a 
Freedom of Information Act request, except when such disclosure is 
determined to be in the national interest.
    (i) National interest determination. The United States National 
Authority (USNA), in coordination with the CWC interagency group, shall 
determine on a case-by-case basis if disclosure of confidential business 
information in response to a Freedom of Information Act request is in 
the national interest.
    (ii) Notification of intent to disclose pursuant to a national 
interest determination. The Act provides for notification to the 
affected person of intent to disclose confidential business information 
based on the national interest, unless such notification of intent to 
disclose is contrary to national security or law enforcement needs. If, 
after coordination with the agencies that constitute the CWC interagency 
group, the USNA does not determine that such notification of intent to 
disclose is contrary to national security or law enforcement needs, the 
USNA will notify the person that submitted the information and the 
person to whom the information pertains of the intent to disclose the 
information.

    (a) Scope. This part 719 describes the various sanctions that apply 
to violations of the Act and this subchapter. It also establishes 
detailed administrative procedures for certain violations of the Act. 
The three categories of violations are as follows:
    (1) Violations of the Act subject to administrative and criminal 
enforcement proceedings. This CWCR sets forth in Sec. 719.2 violations 
for which the statutory basis is the Act. The Department of Commerce 
investigates these violations and, for administrative proceedings, 
prepares charges, provides legal representation to the U.S. Government, 
negotiates settlements, and makes recommendations to officials of the 
Department of State with respect to the initiation and resolution of 
proceedings. The administrative procedures applicable to these 
violations are found in Secs. 719.5 through 719.22 of this part. The 
Department of State gives notice of initiation of administrative 
proceedings and issues orders imposing penalties pursuant to 22 CFR part 
103, subpart C.
    (2) Violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
(IEEPA) subject to judicial enforcement proceedings. Section 719.3 sets 
forth violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention for which the 
statutory basis is the IEEPA. The Department of Commerce refers these 
violations to the Department of Justice for civil or criminal judicial 
enforcement.
    (3) Violations and sanctions under the Act not subject to 
proceedings under this subchapter. Section 719.4 sets forth violations 
and sanctions under the Act that are not violations of this subchapter 
and that are not subject to proceedings under this subchapter. This 
section is included solely for informational purposes. The Department of 
Commerce may assist in investigations of these violations, but has no 
authority to initiate any enforcement action under this subchapter.

    Note to paragraph (a):
    This part 719 does not apply to violations of the export 
requirements imposed pursuant to the Chemical Weapons Convention and set 
forth in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR parts 730 
through 799) and in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) 
(22 CFR parts 120 through 130).

    (b) Definitions. The following are definitions of terms as used only 
in parts 719 and 720. For definitions of terms applicable to parts 710 
through 722 of this subchapter, see part 710 of this subchapter.
    The Act. The Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 
(22 U.S.C. 6701-6777).
    Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement. The Assistant Secretary 
for Export Enforcement, Bureau of Export Administration, United States 
Department of Commerce.
    Final decision. A decision or order assessing a civil penalty, or 
otherwise disposing of or dismissing a case, which is not subject to 
further administrative review, but which may be subject to collection 
proceedings or judicial review in an appropriate Federal court as 
authorized by law.

(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706).
    Office of Chief Counsel. The Office of Chief Counsel for Export 
Administration, United States Department of Commerce.
    Report. For purposes of parts 719 and 720 of this subchapter, the 
term ``report'' means any declaration, report, or notification required 
under parts 712 through 715 of this subchapter.
    Respondent. Any person named as the subject of a letter of intent to 
charge, or a Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA) and proposed 
order.

Secretary of State will initiate an administrative enforcement 
proceeding by issuing a NOVA. The Office of Chief Counsel shall serve 
the NOVA as directed by the Secretary of State.
    (b) Letter of intent to charge. The Director of the Office of Export 
Enforcement, Bureau of Export Administration, may notify a respondent by 
letter of the intent to charge. This letter of intent to charge will 
advise a respondent that the Department of Commerce has conducted an 
investigation and intends to recommend that the Secretary of State issue 
a NOVA. The letter of intent to charge will be accompanied by a draft 
NOVA and proposed order, and will give the respondent a specified period 
of time to contact BXA to discuss settlement of the allegations set 
forth in the draft NOVA. An administrative enforcement proceeding is not 
initiated by a letter of intent to charge. If the respondent does not 
contact BXA within the specified time, or if the respondent requests it, 
BXA will make its request for initiation of an administrative 
enforcement proceeding to the

[[Page 184]]

Secretary of State in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Content of NOVA. The NOVA shall constitute a formal complaint, 
and will set forth the basis for the issuance of the proposed order. It 
will set forth the alleged violation(s) and the essential facts with 
respect to the alleged violation(s), reference the relevant statutory, 
regulatory or other provisions, and state the amount of the civil 
penalty to be assessed. The NOVA will inform the respondent of the right 
to request a hearing pursuant to Sec. 719.6, inform the respondent that 
failure to request such a hearing shall result in the proposed order 
becoming final and unappealable on signature of the Secretary of State, 
and provide payment instructions. A copy of the regulations that govern 
the administrative proceedings will accompany the NOVA.
    (d) Proposed order. A proposed order shall accompany every NOVA, 
letter of intent to charge, and draft NOVA. It will briefly set forth 
the substance of the alleged violation(s) and the statutory, regulatory 
or other provisions violated. It will state the amount of the civil 
penalty to be assessed.
    (e) Notice. Notice of the intent to charge or of the initiation of 
formal proceedings shall be given to the respondent (or respondent's 
agent for service of process, or attorney) by sending relevant 
documents, via first class mail, facsimile, or by personal delivery.


<R05>
Sec. 719.6  Request for hearing and answer.

    (a) Time to answer. If the respondent wishes to contest the NOVA and 
proposed order issued by the Secretary of State, the respondent must 
request a hearing in writing within 15 days from the date of the NOVA. 
If the respondent requests a hearing, the respondent must answer the 
NOVA within 30 days from the date of the request for hearing. The 
request for hearing and answer must be filed with the Administrative Law 
Judge (ALJ), along with a copy of the NOVA and proposed order, and 
served on the Office of Chief Counsel, and any other address(es) 
specified in the NOVA, in accordance with Sec. 719.8.
    (b) Content of answer. The respondent's answer must be responsive to 
the NOVA and proposed order, and must fully set forth the nature of the 
respondent's defense(s). The answer must specifically admit or deny each 
separate allegation in the NOVA; if the respondent is without knowledge, 
the answer will so state and will operate as a denial. Failure to deny 
or controvert a particular allegation will be deemed an admission of 
that allegation. The answer must also set forth any additional or new 
matter the respondent believes supports a defense or claim of 
mitigation. Any defense or partial defense not specifically set forth in 
the answer shall be deemed waived, and evidence thereon may be refused, 
except for good cause shown.
    (c) English required. The request for hearing, answer, and all other 
papers and documentary evidence must be submitted in English.
    (d) Waiver. The failure of the respondent to file a request for a 
hearing and an answer within the times provided constitutes a waiver of 
the respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations set forth 
in the NOVA and proposed order. If no hearing is requested and no answer 
is provided, the proposed order will be signed and become final and 
unappealable.


<R05>
Sec. 719.7  Representation.

    A respondent individual may appear and participate in person, a 
corporation by a duly authorized officer or employee, and a partnership 
by a partner. If a respondent is represented by counsel, counsel shall 
be a member in good standing of the bar of any State, Commonwealth or 
Territory of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, or be 
licensed to practice law in the country in which counsel resides, if not 
the United States. The U.S. Government will be represented by the Office 
of Chief Counsel. A respondent personally, or through counsel or other 
representative who has the power of attorney to represent the 
respondent, shall file a notice of appearance with the ALJ, or, in cases 
where settlement negotiations occur before any filing with the ALJ, with 
the Office of Chief Counsel.

[[Page 185]]


<R05>
Sec. 719.8  Filing and service of papers other than the NOVA.

    (a) Filing. All papers to be filed with the ALJ shall be addressed 
to ``CWC Administrative Enforcement Proceedings'' at the address set 
forth in the NOVA, or such other place as the ALJ may designate. Filing 
by United States mail (first class postage prepaid), by express or 
equivalent parcel delivery service, via facsimile, or by hand delivery, 
is acceptable. Filing from a foreign country shall be by airmail or via 
facsimile. A copy of each paper filed shall be simultaneously served on 
all parties.
    (b) Service. Service shall be made by United States mail (first 
class postage prepaid), by express or equivalent parcel delivery 
service, via facsimile, or by hand delivery of one copy of each paper to 
each party in the proceeding. The Department of State is a party to 
cases under this subchapter, but will be represented by the Office of 
Chief Counsel. Therefore, service on the government party in all 
proceedings shall be addressed to Office of Chief Counsel for Export 
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and 
Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room H-3839, Washington, D.C. 20230, or faxed 
to (202) 482-0085. Service on a respondent shall be to the address to 
which the NOVA and proposed order was sent, or to such other address as 
the respondent may provide. When a party has appeared by counsel or 
other representative, service on counsel or other representative shall 
constitute service on that party.
    (c) Date. The date of filing or service is the day when the papers 
are deposited in the mail or are delivered in person, by delivery 
service, or by facsimile. Refusal by the person to be served, or by the 
person's agent or attorney, of service of a document or other paper will 
be considered effective service of the document or other paper as of the 
date of such refusal.
    (d) Certificate of service. A certificate of service signed by the 
party making service, stating the date and manner of service, shall 
accompany every paper, other than the NOVA and proposed order, filed and 
served on the parties.
    (e) Computation of time. In computing any period of time prescribed 
or allowed by this part, the day of the act, event, or default from 
which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. 
The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a 
Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure), in which case the period runs until 
the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a 
legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are 
excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or 
allowed is 7 days or less.


<R05>
Sec. 719.9  Summary decision.

    The ALJ may render a summary decision disposing of all or part of a 
proceeding on the motion of any party to the proceeding, provided that 
there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the party is 
entitled to summary decision as a matter of law.


<R05>
Sec. 719.10  Discovery.

    (a) General. The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary 
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the 
subject matter of the pending proceeding. The provisions of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure relating to discovery apply to the extent 
consistent with this part and except as otherwise provided by the ALJ or 
by waiver or agreement of the parties. The ALJ may make any order which 
justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. These orders may 
include limitations on the scope, method, time and place of discovery, 
and provisions for protecting the confidentiality of classified or 
otherwise sensitive information, including Confidential Business 
Information (CBI) as defined by the Act.
    (b) Interrogatories and requests for admission or production of 
documents. A party may serve on any party interrogatories, requests for 
admission, or requests for production of documents for inspection and 
copying, and a party concerned may apply to the ALJ for such enforcement 
or protective order as that party deems warranted with respect to such 
discovery. The service of

[[Page 186]]

a discovery request shall be made at least 20 days before the scheduled 
date of the hearing unless the ALJ specifies a shorter time period. 
Copies of interrogatories, requests for admission and requests for 
production of documents and responses thereto shall be served on all 
parties and a copy of the certificate of service shall be filed with the 
ALJ. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested shall be 
deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at 
least 10 days after service, or within such additional time as the ALJ 
may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the 
requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the 
matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the 
reasons why the party to whom the request is directed cannot truthfully 
either admit or deny such matters.
    (c) Depositions. Upon application of a party and for good cause 
shown, the ALJ may order the taking of the testimony of any person by 
deposition and the production of specified documents or materials by the 
person at the deposition. The application shall state the purpose of the 
deposition and set forth the facts sought to be established through the 
deposition.
    (d) Enforcement. The ALJ may order a party to answer designated 
questions, to produce specified documents or things or to take any other 
action in response to a proper discovery request. If a party does not 
comply with such an order, the ALJ may make a determination or enter any 
order in the proceeding as the ALJ deems reasonable and appropriate. The 
ALJ may strike related charges or defenses in whole or in part or may 
take particular facts relating to the discovery request to which the 
party failed or refused to respond as being established for purposes of 
the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking 
discovery. In addition, enforcement by any district court of the United 
States in which venue is proper may be sought as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 719.11  Subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. Upon the application of any party, supported by a 
satisfactory showing that there is substantial reason to believe that 
the evidence would not otherwise be available, the ALJ may issue 
subpoenas to any person requiring the attendance and testimony of 
witnesses and the production of such books, records or other documentary 
or physical evidence for the purpose of the hearing, as the ALJ deems 
relevant and material to the proceedings, and reasonable in scope. 
Witnesses shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to 
witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of contempt, 
challenge or refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person pursuant 
to this paragraph, any district court of the United States, in which 
venue is proper, has jurisdiction to issue an order requiring any such 
person to comply with such subpoena. Any failure to obey such order of 
the court is punishable by the court as a contempt thereof.
    (b) Service. Subpoenas issued by the ALJ may be served by any of the 
methods set forth in Sec. 719.8(b).
    (c) Timing. Applications for subpoenas must be submitted at least 10 
days before the scheduled hearing or deposition, unless the ALJ 
determines, for good cause shown, that extraordinary circumstances 
warrant a shorter time.


<R05>
Sec. 719.12  Matters protected against disclosure.

    (a) Protective measures. The ALJ may limit discovery or introduction 
of evidence or issue such protective or other orders as in the ALJ's 
judgment may be needed to prevent undue disclosure of classified or 
sensitive documents or information, including Confidential Business 
Information as defined by the Act. Where the ALJ determines that 
documents containing classified or sensitive matter must be made 
available to a party in order to avoid prejudice, the ALJ may direct the 
other party to prepare an unclassified and nonsensitive summary or 
extract of the documents. The ALJ may compare the extract or summary 
with the original to ensure that it is supported by the source document 
and that it omits only so much as must remain undisclosed. The summary 
or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.

[[Page 187]]

    (b) Arrangements for access. If the ALJ determines that the summary 
procedure outlined in paragraph (a) of this section is unsatisfactory, 
and that classified or otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the 
record in order to avoid prejudice to a party, the ALJ may provide the 
parties opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a 
representative to have access to such matter without compromising 
sensitive information. Such arrangements may include obtaining security 
clearances or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive information 
and documents subject to assurances against further disclosure, 
including a protective order, if necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 719.13  Prehearing conference.

    (a) On the ALJ's own motion, or on request of a party, the ALJ may 
direct the parties to participate in a prehearing conference, either in 
person or by telephone, to consider:
    (1) Simplification of issues;
    (2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;
    (3) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid 
unnecessary proof; or (4) Such other matters as may expedite the 
disposition of the proceedings.
    (b) The ALJ may order the conference proceedings to be recorded 
electronically or taken by a reporter, transcribed and filed with the 
ALJ.
    (c) If a prehearing conference is impracticable, the ALJ may direct 
the parties to correspond with the ALJ to achieve the purposes of such a 
conference.
    (d) The ALJ will prepare a summary of any actions agreed on or taken 
pursuant to this section. The summary will include any written 
stipulations or agreements made by the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 719.14  Hearings.

    (a) Scheduling. Upon receipt of a written and dated request for a 
hearing, the ALJ shall, by agreement with all the parties or upon notice 
to all parties of at least 30 days, schedule a hearing. All hearings 
will be held in Washington, D.C., unless the ALJ determines, for good 
cause shown, that another location would better serve the interest of 
justice.
    (b) Hearing procedure. Hearings will be conducted in a fair and 
impartial manner by the ALJ. All hearings will be closed, unless the ALJ 
for good cause shown determines otherwise. The rules of evidence 
prevailing in courts of law do not apply, and all evidentiary material 
deemed by the ALJ to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not 
unduly repetitious will be received and given appropriate weight, except 
that any evidence of settlement which would be excluded under Rule 408 
of the Federal Rules of Evidence is not admissible. Witnesses will 
testify under oath or affirmation, and shall be subject to cross-
examination.
    (c) Testimony and record. (1) A verbatim record of the hearing and 
of any other oral proceedings will be taken by reporter or by electronic 
recording, and filed with the ALJ. If any party wishes to obtain a 
written copy of the transcript, that party shall pay the costs of 
transcription. The parties may share the costs if both wish a 
transcript.
    (2) Upon such terms as the ALJ deems just, the ALJ may direct that 
the testimony of any person be taken by deposition and may admit an 
affidavit or declaration as evidence, provided that any affidavits or 
declarations have been filed and served on the parties sufficiently in 
advance of the hearing to permit a party to file and serve an objection 
thereto on the grounds that it is necessary that the affiant or 
declarant testify at the hearing and be subject to cross-examination.
    (d) Failure to appear. If a party fails to appear in person or by 
counsel at a scheduled hearing, the hearing may nevertheless proceed. 
The party's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the 
hearing or any proceeding or action taken thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 719.15  Procedural stipulations.

    Unless otherwise ordered and subject to Sec. 719.16, a written 
stipulation agreed to by all parties and filed with the ALJ will modify 
the procedures established by this part.


<R05>
Sec. 719.16  Extension of time.

    The parties may extend any applicable time limitation by stipulation 
filed

[[Page 188]]

with the ALJ before the time limitation expires, or the ALJ may, on the 
ALJ's own initiative or upon application by any party, either before or 
after the expiration of any applicable time limitation, extend the time, 
except that the requirement that a hearing be demanded within 15 days, 
and the requirement that a final agency decision be made within 30 days, 
may not be modified.


<R05>
Sec. 719.17  Post-hearing submissions.

    All parties shall have the opportunity to file post-hearing 
submissions that may include findings of fact and conclusions of law, 
supporting evidence and legal arguments, exceptions to the ALJ's rulings 
or to the admissibility of evidence, and proposed orders and 
settlements.


<R05>
Sec. 719.18  Decisions.

    (a) Initial decision. After considering the entire record in the 
case, the ALJ will issue an initial decision based on a preponderance of 
the evidence. The decision will include findings of fact, conclusions of 
law, and a decision based thereon as to whether the respondent has 
violated the Act If the ALJ finds that the evidence of record is 
insufficient to sustain a finding that a violation has occurred with 
respect to one or more allegations, the ALJ shall order dismissal of the 
allegation(s) in whole or in part, as appropriate. If the ALJ finds that 
one or more violations have been committed, the ALJ shall issue an order 
imposing administrative sanctions.
    (b) Factors considered in assessing penalties. In determining the 
amount of a civil penalty, the ALJ shall take into account the nature, 
circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation(s), and, with respect 
to the respondent, the respondent's ability to pay the penalty, the 
effect of a civil penalty on the respondent's ability to continue to do 
business, the respondent's history of prior violations, the respondent's 
degree of culpability, the existence of an internal compliance program, 
and such other matters as justice may require.
    (c) Certification of initial decision. The ALJ shall immediately 
certify the initial decision and order to the Executive Director of the 
Office of Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street, N.W., 
Room 5519, Washington, D.C. 20520, to the Office of Chief Counsel at the 
address in Sec. 719.8, and to the respondent, by personal delivery or 
overnight mail.
    (d) Review of initial decision. The initial decision shall become 
the final agency decision and order unless, within 30 days, the 
Secretary of State modifies or vacates it, with or without conditions, 
in accordance with 22 CFR 103.8.


<R05>
Sec. 719.19  Settlement.

    (a) Settlements before issuance of a NOVA. When the parties have 
agreed to a settlement of the case, the Director of the Office of Export 
Enforcement will recommend the settlement to the Secretary of State, 
forwarding a proposed settlement agreement and order, which, in 
accordance with 22 CFR 103.9(a), the Secretary of State will sign if the 
recommended settlement is in accordance with applicable law.
    (b) Settlements following issuance of a NOVA. The parties may enter 
into settlement negotiations at any time during the time a case is 
pending before the ALJ. If necessary, the parties may extend applicable 
time limitations or otherwise request that the ALJ stay the proceedings 
while settlement negotiations continue. When the parties have agreed to 
a settlement of the case, the Office of Chief Counsel will recommend the 
settlement to the Secretary of State, forwarding a proposed settlement 
agreement and order, which, in accordance with 22 CFR 103.9(b), the 
Assistant Secretary will sign if the recommended settlement is in 
accordance with applicable law.
    (c) Settlement scope. Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing 
any administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving 
the claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought under 
this part. This reflects the fact that the government officials involved 
have neither the authority nor the responsibility for initiating, 
conducting, settling, or otherwise disposing of criminal proceedings. 
That authority and responsibility are vested in the Attorney General and 
the Department of Justice.

[[Page 189]]

    (d) Finality. Cases that are settled may not be reopened or 
appealed.


<R05>
Sec. 719.20  Record for decision.

    (a) The record. The transcript of hearings, exhibits, rulings, 
orders, all papers and requests filed in the proceedings, and, for 
purposes of any appeal under Sec. 719.18 or under 22 CFR 103.8, the 
decision of the ALJ and such submissions as are provided for under 
Sec. 719.18 or 22 CFR 103.8 will constitute the record and the exclusive 
basis for decision. When a case is settled, the record will consist of 
any and all of the foregoing, as well as the NOVA or draft NOVA, 
settlement agreement, and order.
    (b) Restricted access. On the ALJ's own motion, or on the motion of 
any party, the ALJ may direct that there be a restricted access portion 
of the record for any material in the record to which public access is 
restricted by law or by the terms of a protective order entered in the 
proceedings. A party seeking to restrict access to any portion of the 
record is responsible, prior to the close of the proceeding, for 
submitting a version of the document(s) proposed for public availability 
that reflects the requested deletion. The restricted access portion of 
the record will be placed in a separate file and the file will be 
clearly marked to avoid improper disclosure and to identify it as a 
portion of the official record in the proceedings. The ALJ may act at 
any time to permit material that becomes declassified or unrestricted 
through passage of time to be transferred to the unrestricted access 
portion of the record.
    (c) Availability of documents. (1) Scope. All NOVAs and draft NOVAs, 
answers, settlement agreements, decisions and orders disposing of a case 
will be made available for public inspection in the BXA Freedom of 
Information Records Inspection Facility, U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Room H-6624, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20230. The complete record for decision, as defined in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section will be made available on request.
    (2) Timing. The record for decision will be available only after the 
final administrative disposition of a case. Parties may seek to restrict 
access to any portion of the record under paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 719.21  Payment of final assessment.

    (a) Time for payment. Full payment of the civil penalty must be made 
within 30 days of the date upon which the final order becomes effective, 
or within the time specified in the order. Payment shall be made in the 
manner specified in the NOVA.
    (b) Enforcement of order. The government party may, through the 
Attorney General, file suit in an appropriate district court if 
necessary to enforce compliance with a final order issued under these 
CWCR (this subchapter). This suit will include a claim for interest at 
current prevailing rates from the date payment was due or ordered.
    (c) Offsets. The amount of any civil penalty imposed by a final 
order may be deducted from any sum(s) owed by the United States to a 
respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 719.22  Reporting a violation.

    If a person learns that a violation of the Convention, the Act, or 
this subchapter has occurred or may occur, that person may notify: 
Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room 
H-4520, Washington, D.C. 20230; Tel: (202) 482-1208; Facsimile: (202)

<R05>
Sec. 720.1  Denial of export privileges for convictions under 18 U.S.C. 229.

    Any person in the United States or any U.S. national may be denied 
export privileges after notice and opportunity

[[Page 190]]

for hearing if that person has been convicted under Title 18, Section 
229 of the United States Code of knowingly:
    (a) Developing, producing, otherwise acquiring, transferring 
directly or indirectly, receiving, stockpiling, retaining, owning, 
possessing, or using, or threatening to use, a chemical weapon; or
    (b) Assisting or inducing, in any way, any person to violate 
paragraph (a) of this section, or attempting or conspiring to violate 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 720.2  Initiation of administrative action denying export privileges.

    (a) Notice. BXA will notify any person convicted of Section 229, 
Title 18, United States Code, of BXA's intent to deny that person's 
export privileges. The notification letter shall reference the person's 
conviction, specify the number of years for which BXA intends to deny 
export privileges, set forth the statutory and regulatory authority for 
the action, state whether the denial order will be standard or non-
standard pursuant to Supplement No. 1 to Part 764 of the Export 
Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799), and provide 
that the person may request a hearing before the Administrative Law 
Judge within 30 days from the date of the notification letter.
    (b) Waiver. The failure of the notified person to file a request for 
a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the person's 
right to contest the denial of export privileges that BXA intends to 
impose.
    (c) order of Assistant Secretary. If no hearing is requested, the 
Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement will order that export 
privileges be denied as indicated in the notification letter.


<R05>
Sec. 720.3  Final decision on administrative action denying export privileges.

    (a) Hearing. Any hearing that is granted by the ALJ shall be 
conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 719.14 of 
this subchapter.
    (b) Initial decision and order. After considering the entire record 
in the proceeding, the ALJ will issue an initial decision and order, 
based on a preponderance of the evidence. The ALJ may consider factors 
such as the seriousness of the criminal offense that is the basis for 
conviction, the nature and duration of the criminal sanctions imposed, 
and whether the person has undertaken any corrective measures. The ALJ 
may dismiss the proceeding if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a 
denial of export privileges, or may issue an order imposing a denial of 
export privileges for the length of time the ALJ deems appropriate. An 
order denying export privileges may be standard or non-standard, as 
provided in Supplement No. 1 to part 764 of the Export Administration 
Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799). The initial decision and 
order will be served on each party, and will be published in the Federal 
Register as the final decision of the Department of Commerce 30 days 
after service, unless an appeal is filed in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (c) Grounds for appeal. (1) A party may, within 30 days of the ALJ's 
initial decision and order, petition the Under Secretary for Export 
Administration for review of the initial decision and order. A petition 
for review must be filed with the Office of Under Secretary for Export 
Administration, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution 
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, and shall be served on the Office 
of Chief Counsel for Export Administration or on the respondent. 
Petitions for review may be filed only on one or more of the following 
grounds:
    (i) That a necessary finding of fact is omitted, erroneous or 
unsupported by substantial evidence of record;
    (ii) That a necessary legal conclusion or finding is contrary to 
law;
    (iii) That prejudicial procedural error occurred; or
    (iv) That the decision or the extent of sanctions is arbitrary, 
capricious or an abuse of discretion.
    (2) The appeal must specify the grounds on which the appeal is based 
and the provisions of the order from which the appeal was taken.
    (d) Appeal procedure. The Under Secretary for Export Administration 
normally will not hold hearings or entertain oral arguments on appeals. 
A full

[[Page 191]]

written statement in support of the appeal must be filed with the appeal 
and be simultaneously served on all parties, who shall have 30 days from 
service to file a reply. At his/her discretion, the Under Secretary may 
accept new submissions, but will not ordinarily accept those submissions 
filed more than 30 days after the filing of the reply to the appellant's 
first submission.
    (e) Decisions. The Under Secretary's decision will be in writing and 
will be accompanied by an order signed by the Under Secretary for Export 
Administration giving effect to the decision. The order may either 
dispose of the case by affirming, modifying or reversing the order of 
the ALJ, or may refer the case back to the ALJ for further proceedings. 
Any order that imposes a denial of export privileges will be published 
in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 720.4  Effect of denial.

    Any person denied export privileges pursuant to this part shall be 
considered a ``person denied export privileges'' for purposes of the 
Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799). The 
name and address of the denied person will be published on the Denied 
Persons List found in Supplement 2 to part 764 of the Export 
Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 799).

Sec.
721.1  Inspection of records.
721.2  Recordkeeping.
721.3  Destruction or disposal of records.

    Authority: 22 U.S.C. 6701 et seq.; E.O. 13128, 64 FR 36703.

    Source: 64 FR 73810, Dec. 30, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 721.1  Inspection of records.

    Upon request by the Department of Commerce or any other agency of 
competent jurisdiction, you must permit access to and copying of any 
record relating to compliance with the requirements of this subchapter. 
This requires that you make available the equipment and, if necessary, 
knowledgeable personnel for locating, reading, and reproducing any 
record.


<R05>
Sec. 721.2  Recordkeeping.

    (a) General. Each facility required to submit a declaration, report 
or notification under parts 712 through 715 of this subchapter must 
retain all supporting materials and documentation used by a unit, plant, 
facility and plant site to prepare such declaration, report or 
notification to determine production, processing, consumption, export or 
import of chemicals.
    (b) Five year retention period. All supporting materials and 
documentation required to be kept under paragraph (a) of this section 
must be retained for five years from the due date of the applicable 
declaration, report, or notification, or for five years from the date of 
submission of the applicable declaration, report or notification, 
whichever is later. Due dates for declarations, reports and 
notifications are provided in parts 712 through 715 of this subchapter.
    (c) Location of records. If a facility is subject to inspection 
under part 716 of this subchapter, records retained under this section 
must be maintained at the facility or must be accessible electronically 
at the facility for purposes of inspection of the facility by Inspection 
Teams. If a facility is not subject to inspection under part 716 of this 
subchapter, records retained under this section may be maintained either 
at the facility subject to a declaration, report, or notification 
requirement, or at a remote location, but all records must be accessible 
to any authorized agent, official or employee of the U.S. Government 
under Sec. 721.1.
    (d) Reproduction of original records. (1) You may maintain 
reproductions instead of the original records provided all of the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are met.
    (2) If you must maintain records under this part, you may use any 
photostatic, miniature photographic, micrographic, automated archival 
storage, or other process that completely, accurately, legibly and 
durably reproduces the original records (whether on paper, microfilm, or 
through electronic digital storage techniques). The process must meet 
all of the following requirements, which are applicable to all systems:

[[Page 192]]

    (i) The system must be capable of reproducing all records on paper.
    (ii) The system must record and be able to reproduce all marks, 
information, and other characteristics of the original record, including 
both obverse and reverse sides (unless blank) of paper documents in 
legible form.
    (iii) When displayed on a viewer, monitor, or reproduced on paper, 
the records must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability. 
For purposes of this section, legible and legibility mean the quality of 
a letter or numeral that enable the observer to identify it positively 
and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readable 
and readability mean the quality of a group of letters or numerals being 
recognized as complete words or numbers.
    (iv) The system must preserve the initial image (including both 
obverse and reverse sides, unless blank, of paper documents) and record 
all changes, who made them and when they were made. This information 
must be stored in such a manner that none of it may be altered once it 
is initially recorded.
    (v) You must establish written procedures to identify the 
individuals who are responsible for the operation, use and maintenance 
of the system.
    (vi) You must keep a record of where, when, by whom, and on what 
equipment the records and other information were entered into the 
system.
    (3) Requirements applicable to a system based on digital images. For 
systems based on the storage of digital images, the system must provide 
accessibility to any digital image in the system. The system must be 
able to locate and reproduce all records according to the same criteria 
that would have been used to organize the records had they been 
maintained in original form.
    (4) Requirements applicable to a system based on photographic 
processes. For systems based on photographic, photostatic, or miniature 
photographic processes, the records must be maintained according to an 
index of all records in the system following the same criteria that 
would have been used to organize the records had they been maintained in 
original form.


<R05>
Sec. 721.3  Destruction or disposal of records.

    If the Department of Commerce or other authorized U.S. government 
agency makes a formal or informal request for a certain record or 
records, such record or records may not be destroyed or disposed of 
without the written authorization of the requesting entity.

<R05>
Sec. 730.1  What these regulations cover.

    In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The EAR are 
issued by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export 
Administration (BXA) under laws relating to the control of certain 
exports, reexports, and activities. In addition, the EAR implement 
antiboycott law provisions requiring regulations to prohibit specified 
conduct by United States persons that has the effect of furthering or 
supporting boycotts fostered or imposed by a country against a country 
friendly to United States. Supplement No. 1 to part 730 lists the 
control numbers assigned to information collection requirements under 
the EAR by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995.


<R05>
Sec. 730.2  Statutory authority.

    The EAR have been designed primarily to implement the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended, 50 U.S.C. app. 2401-2420 (EAA). 
There are numerous other legal authorities underlying the EAR. These are 
listed in the Federal Register documents promulgating the EAR and at the 
beginning of each part of the EAR in the Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR). From time to time, the President has exercised authority under 
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act with respect to the EAR 
(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706 (IEEPA)). The EAA is not permanent legislation, and 
when it has lapsed, Presidential executive orders under IEEPA have 
directed and authorized the continuation in force of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 730.3  Dual use exports.

    The convenient term dual use is sometimes used to distinguish the 
types of items covered by the EAR from those that are covered by the 
regulations of certain other U.S. government departments and agencies 
with export licensing responsibilities. In general, the term dual use 
serves to distinguish EAR-controlled items that can be used both in 
military and other strategic uses (e.g., nuclear) and commercial 
applications. In general, the term dual use serves to distinguish EAR-
controlled items that can be used both in military and other strategic 
uses and in civil applications from

[[Page 194]]

those that are weapons and military related use or design and subject to 
the controls of the Department of State or subject to the nuclear 
related controls of the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. Note, however, that although the short-hand term dual use 
may be employed to refer to the entire scope of the EAR, the EAR also 
apply to some items that have solely civil uses.


<R05>
Sec. 730.4  Other control agencies and departments.

    In addition to the departments and agencies mentioned in Sec. 730.3 
of this part, other departments and agencies have jurisdiction over 
certain narrower classes of exports and reexports. These include the 
Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which 
administers controls against certain countries that are the object of 
sanctions affecting not only exports and reexports, but also imports and 
financial dealings. For your convenience, Supplement No. 3 to part 730 
identifies other departments and agencies with regulatory jurisdiction 
over certain types of exports and reexports. This is not a comprehensive 
list, and the brief descriptions are only generally indicative of the 
types of controls administered and/or enforced by each agency.


<R05>
Sec. 730.5  Coverage of more than exports.

    The core of the export control provisions of the EAR concerns 
exports from the United States. You will find, however, that some 
provisions give broad meaning to the term ``export'', apply to 
transactions outside of the United States, or apply to activities other 
than exports.
    (a) Reexports. Commodities, software, and technology that have been 
exported from the United States are generally subject to the EAR with 
respect to reexport. Many such reexports, however, may go to many 
destinations without a license or will qualify for an exception from 
licensing requirements.
    (b) Foreign products. In some cases, authorization to export 
technology from the United States will be subject to assurances that 
items produced abroad that are the direct product of that technology 
will not be exported to certain destinations without authorization from 
BXA.
    (c) Scope of ``exports''. Certain actions that you might not regard 
as an ``export'' in other contexts do constitute an export subject to 
the EAR. The release of technology to a foreign national in the United 
States through such means as demonstration or oral briefing is deemed an 
export. Other examples of exports under the EAR include the return of 
foreign equipment to its country of origin after repair in the United 
States, shipments from a U.S. foreign trade zone, and the electronic 
transmission of non-public data that will be received abroad.
    (d) U.S. person activities. To counter the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction, the EAR restrict the involvement of ``United States 
persons'' anywhere in the world in exports of foreign-origin items, or 
in providing services or support, that may contribute to such 
proliferation. The EAR also restrict technical assistance by U.S. 
persons with respect to encryption commodities or software.

[61 FR 12734, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68577, Dec. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 730.6  Control purposes.

    The export control provisions of the EAR are intended to serve the 
national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation, and short supply 
interests of the United States and, in some cases, to carry out its 
international obligations. Some controls are designed to restrict access 
to dual use items by countries or persons that might apply such items to 
uses inimical to U.S. interests. These include controls designed to stem 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and controls designed 
to limit the military and terrorism support capability of certain 
countries. The effectiveness of many of the controls under the EAR is 
enhanced by their being maintained as part of multilateral control 
arrangements. Multilateral export control cooperation is sought through 
arrangements such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, 
and the Missile Technology Control Regime. The EAR also include some 
export controls to protect

[[Page 195]]

the United States from the adverse impact of the unrestricted export of 
commodities in short supply.


<R05>
Sec. 730.7  License requirements and exceptions.

    A relatively small percentage of exports and reexports subject to 
the EAR require an application to BXA for a license. Many items are not 
on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to Sec. 774.1 of 
the EAR), or, if on the CCL, require a license to only a limited number 
of countries. Other transactions may be covered by one or more of the 
License Exceptions in the EAR. In such cases no application need be made 
to BXA.


<R05>
Sec. 730.8  How to proceed and where to get help.

    (a) How the EAR are organized. The Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) are structured in a logical manner. In dealing with the EAR you 
may find it helpful to be aware of the overall organization of these 
regulations. In order to determine what the rules are and what you need 
to do, review the titles and the introductory sections of the parts of 
the EAR.
    (1) How do you go about determining your obligations under the EAR? 
Part 732 of the EAR provides steps you may follow to determine your 
obligations under the EAR. You will find guidance to enable you to tell 
whether or not your transaction is subject to the EAR and, if it is, 
whether it qualifies for a License Exception or must be authorized 
through issuance of a license.
    (2) Are your items or activities subject to the EAR at all? Part 734 
of the EAR defines the items and activities that are subject to the EAR. 
Note that the definition of ``items subject to the EAR'' includes, but 
is not limited to, items listed on the Commerce Control List in part 774 
of the EAR.
    (3) If subject to the EAR, what do the EAR require? Part 736 of the 
EAR lists all the prohibitions that are contained in the EAR. Note that 
certain prohibitions (General Prohibitions One through Three) apply to 
items as indicated on the CCL, and others (General Prohibitions Four 
through Ten) prohibit certain activities and apply to all items subject 
to the EAR unless otherwise indicated.
    (4) Do you need a license for your item or activity? What policies 
will BXA apply if you do need to submit license application? The EAR 
have four principal ways of describing license requirements:
    (i) The EAR may require a license to a country if your item is 
listed on the CCL and the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR tells 
that a license is required to that country. Virtually all Export Control 
Classification Numbers (ECCN) on the CCL are covered by the Country 
Chart in part 738 of the EAR. That part identifies the limited number of 
entries that are not included on the Chart. These ECCNs will state the 
specific countries that require a license or refer you to a self-
contained section, i.e., Short Supply in part 754 of the EAR, or 
Embargoes in part 746 of the EAR. If a license is required, you should 
consult part 740 of the EAR which describes the License Exception that 
may be available for items on the CCL. Part 742 of the EAR describes the 
licensing policies that BXA will apply in reviewing an application you 
file. Note that part 754 of the EAR on short supply controls and part 
746 on embargoes are self-contained parts that include the available 
exceptions and licensing policy.
    (ii) A license requirement may be based on the end-use or end-user 
in a transaction, primarily for proliferation reasons. Part 744 of the 
EAR describes such requirements and relevant licensing policies and 
includes both restrictions on items and restrictions on the activities 
of U.S. persons.
    (iii) A license is required for virtually all exports to embargoed 
destinations, such as Cuba. Part 746 of the EAR describes all the 
licensing requirements, license review policies and License Exceptions 
that apply to such destinations. If your transaction involves one of 
these countries, you should first look at this part. This part also 
describes controls that may be maintained under the EAR to implement UN 
sanctions.
    (iv) In addition, under Secs. 736.2(b)(9) and (10) of the EAR, you 
may not engage in a transaction knowing a violation is about to occur or 
violate any orders, terms, and conditions under the

[[Page 196]]

EAR. Part 764 of the EAR describes prohibited transactions with a person 
denied export privileges or activity that violates the terms or 
conditions of a denial order.
    (5) How do you file a license application and what will happen to 
the application once you do file it? What if you need authorization for 
multiple transactions? Parts 748 and 750 of the EAR provide information 
on license submission and processing. Part 752 of the EAR provides for a 
Special Comprehensive License that authorizes multiple transactions. If 
your application is denied, part 756 of the EAR provides rules for 
filing appeals.
    (6) How do you clear shipments with the U.S. Customs Service? Part 
758 of the EAR describes the requirements for clearance of exports.
    (7) Where do you find the rules on restrictive trade practices and 
boycotts? Part 760 of the EAR deals with restrictive trade practices and 
boycotts.
    (8) Where are the rules on recordkeeping and enforcement? Part 762 
of the EAR sets out your recordkeeping requirements, and parts 764 and 
766 of the EAR deal with violations and enforcement proceedings.
    (9) What is the effect of foreign availability? Part 768 of the EAR 
provides rules for determining foreign availability of items subject to 
controls.
    (10) Do the EAR provide definitions and interpretations? Part 770 of 
the EAR contains interpretations and part 772 of the EAR lists 
definitions used.
    (b) Why the EAR are so detailed. Some people will find the great 
length of the EAR and their extensive use of technical terms 
intimidating. BXA believes, however, that such detail and precision can 
and does serve the interests of the public. The detailed listing of 
technical parameters in the CCL establishes precise, objective criteria. 
This should, in most cases, enable you to ascertain the appropriate 
control status. Broader, more subjective criteria would leave exporters 
and reexporters more dependent upon interpretations and rulings by BXA 
officials. Moreover, much of the detail in the CCL is derived from 
multilaterally adopted lists, and the specificity serves to enhance the 
uniformity and effectiveness of international control practices and to 
promote a ``level playing field''. The detailed presentation of such 
elements as licensing and export clearance procedures enables you to 
find in one place what you need to know to comply with pertinent 
requirements. Of special importance is the detailed listing of License 
Exception criteria, as these will enable you to determine quickly, and 
with confidence, that you may proceed with a transaction without delay. 
Finally, some of the detail results from the need to draft the EAR with 
care in order to avoid loop-holes and to permit effective enforcement.
    (c) Where to get help. Throughout the EAR you will find information 
on offices you can contact for various purposes and types of 
information. General information including; assistance in understanding 
the EAR, information on how to obtain forms, electronic services, 
publications, and information on training programs offered by BXA, is 
available from the Office of Exporter Services at the following 
locations:

Exporter Counselling Division, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and

<R05>
Sec. 730.9  How the Bureau of Export Administration is organized.

    Functionally, the Bureau of Export Administration is divided into 
two branches, Export Administration and Export Enforcement. Also, BXA 
manages a number of Technical Advisory Committees consisting of industry 
and government representatives which advise and assist BXA and other 
agencies with respect to actions designed to implement the EAR.
    (a) Export Administration. Export Administration implements and 
administers the export controls reflected in

[[Page 197]]

the EAR. Export Administration consists of five offices located in 
Washington D.C. and two field offices in California under the 
supervision of the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration:
    (1) The Office of Nuclear and Missile Technology Controls is 
responsible for policy and technical issues and license applications 
related to the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology 
Control Regime. This office has responsibility for items associated with 
those regimes, and missile and nuclear related exports and reexports 
subject to the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative.
    (2) The Office Chemical/Biological Controls and Treaty Compliance is 
responsible for implementing multilateral export controls under the 
Australia Group. This office has licensing responsibility for items 
associated with the Australia Group and related exports and reexports 
subject to the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative.
    (3) The Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls is 
responsible for implementing multilateral export controls dealing with 
conventional arms and related dual use items. This office is also 
responsible for computer export control policies, and implements U.S. 
foreign policy controls (e.g., crime control, anti-terrorism, and 
regional stability). It also has licensing responsibility for items 
controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons.
    (4) The Office of Exporter Services is responsible for the Special 
Comprehensive License, processing and routing all license applications, 
and preparing responses to requests for advisory opinions and commodity 
classifications. This office also provides counselling to exporters and 
reexporters, conducts educational seminars for the business community, 
maintains the Export Administration Regulations, and coordinates the 
operations of two field offices listed in Sec. 730.8(c) of this part.
    (5) The Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security 
implements programs to ensure the continued health of the U.S. defense 
industrial base, facilitating diversification of U.S. defense related 
industries into civilian markets, and promoting the conversion of 
military enterprises. This office is also responsible for analyzing the 
economic impact of U.S. export controls on industrial competitiveness.
    (b) Export Enforcement. Export Enforcement implements the 
enforcement provisions of the EAR, including part 760 of the EAR 
(Restrictive Trade Practices and Boycotts). This office also conducts 
outreach programs to assist members of the public in understanding their 
obligation under EAR. The Office of Export Enforcement is organized into 
three offices under the supervision of the Assistant Secretary for 
Export Enforcement.
    (1) The Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) is comprised of an office 
in Washington, D.C. and eight field offices. OEE is staffed with 
criminal investigators and analysts. This office investigates 
allegations of violations and supports administrative and criminal 
enforcement proceedings. The addresses and telephone numbers of the 
eight field offices are listed in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of the EAR.
    (2) The Office of Enforcement Support (OES) is located in 
Washington, D.C. OES supports BXA's preventive enforcement efforts, 
including conducting pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications. 
OES also provides administrative and analytical support for OEE.
    (3) The Office of Antiboycott Compliance administers and enforces 
the provisions of part 760 of the EAR (Restrictive Trade Practices and 
Boycotts). It investigates and prepares cases on alleged violations of 
this part.
    (c) Technical Advisory Committees. (1) The Technical Advisory 
Committees (TACs) provide advice and assistance to BXA from U.S. 
industry regarding the creation and implementation of export controls. 
For further information regarding establishment of TACs and other 
information, see Supplement No. 2 to part 730. Existing TACs include the 
following:
    (i) The Information Systems TAC;
    (ii) The Materials TAC;
    (iii) The Materials Processing Equipment TAC;
    (iv) The Regulations and Procedures TAC;

[[Page 198]]

    (v) The Sensors and Instrumentation TAC; and
    (vi) The Transportation and Related Equipment TAC.
    (2) For more information. For information on attending a TAC meeting

       Supplement No. 2 to Part 730--Technical Advisory Committees

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this supplement is to describe the 
procedures and criteria for the establishment and operation of Technical 
Advisory Committees.
    (b) Technical advisory committees. Any producer of articles, 
materials, or supplies, including technology, software, and other 
information, that are subject to export controls, or are being 
considered for such controls because of their significance to the 
national security of the United States, may request the Secretary of 
Commerce to establish a technical advisory committee, under the 
provisions of section 5(h) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as 
amended (EAA) to advise and assist the Department of

[[Page 199]]

Commerce and other appropriate U.S. Government agencies or officials 
with respect to questions involving technical matters; worldwide 
availability and actual utilization of production technology; licensing 
procedures that affect the level of export controls applicable to a 
clearly defined grouping of articles, materials, or supplies, including 
technology, software, or other information; and exports and reexports 
subject to all controls that the United States maintains including 
proposed revisions of any such controls. If producers of articles, 
materials, or supplies, including technology, software, and other 
information, that are subject to export controls because of their 
significance to the national security of the United States, wish a trade 
association or other representative to submit a written request on their 
behalf for the appointment to a TAC, such request shall be submitted in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this supplement.
    (1) Form and substance of requests. Each request for the appointment 
of a TAC shall be submitted in writing to: Assistant Secretary for 
Export Administration, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
    The request shall include:
    (i) A description of the articles, materials, or supplies including 
technology and software, in terms of a clear, cohesive grouping (citing 
the applicable Export Control Classification Numbers where practical);
    (ii) A statement of the reasons for requesting the appointment of a 
TAC; and
    (iii) Any information in support of any contention that may be made 
that the request meets the criteria described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this supplement.
    (2) Consideration of request for establishment of a TAC. The 
Department of Commerce will review all requests for the establishment of 
a TAC to determine if the following criteria are met:
    (i) That a substantial segment of the industry producing the 
specified articles, materials, or supplies including technology desires 
such a committee; and
    (ii) That the evaluation of such articles, materials, or supplies 
including technology and software for export control purposes is 
difficult because of questions involving technical matters, worldwide 
availability and actual utilization of production and software 
technology, or licensing procedures.
    (3) Requests by a substantial segment of an industry. In determining 
whether or not a substantial segment of any industry has requested the 
appointment of a TAC, the Department of Commerce will consider:
    (i) The number of persons or firms requesting the establishment of a 
TAC for a particular grouping of commodities, software and technology in 
relation to the total number of U.S. producers of such items; and
    (ii) The volume of annual production by such persons or firms of 
each item in the grouping in relation to the total U.S. production. 
Generally, a substantial segment of an industry (for purposes of this 
supplement) shall consist of:
    (A) Not less than 30 percent of the total number of U.S. producers 
of the items concerned; or
    (B) Three or more U.S. producers who produce a combined total of not 
less than 30 percent of the total U.S. annual production, by dollar 
value of the items concerned; or
    (C) Not less than 20 percent of the total number of U.S. producers 
of the items concerned, provided that the total of their annual 
production thereof is not less than 20 percent of the total U.S. annual 
production, by dollar value.
    (iii) If it is determined that a substantial segment of the industry 
concerned has requested the establishment of a TAC concerning a specific 
grouping of items that the Department of Commerce determines difficult 
to evaluate for export control purposes, BXA will establish and use the 
TAC requested.
    (4) Requests from trade associations or other representatives. 
Requests from trade associations or other representatives of U.S. 
producers for the establishment of a TAC must comply with the provisions 
of paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this supplement. In addition, in 
order to assist BXA in determining whether the criteria described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this supplement have been met, a trade association 
or other representative submitting a request for the establishment of a 
TAC should include the following information:
    (i) The total number of firms in the particular industry;
    (ii) The total number of firms in the industry that have authorized 
the trade association or other representative to act in their behalf in 
this matter;
    (iii) The approximate amount of total U.S. annual production by 
dollar value of the items concerned produced by those firms that have 
authorized the trade association or other representative to act in their 
behalf; and
    (iv) A description of the method by which authorization to act on 
behalf of these producers was obtained.
    (5) Nominations for membership on TACs. When the Department of 
Commerce determines that the establishment of a TAC is warranted, it 
will request nominations for membership on the committee among the 
producers of the items and from any other sources that may be able to 
suggest well-qualified nominees.
    (6) Selection of industry members of committee. Industry members of 
a TAC will be selected by the Department of Commerce from a list of the 
nominees who have indicated

[[Page 200]]

their availability for service on the committee. To the extent feasible, 
the Department of Commerce will select a committee balanced to represent 
all significant facets of the industry involved, taking into 
consideration such factors as the size of the firms, their geographical 
distribution, and their product lines. No industry representative shall 
serve on a TAC for more than four consecutive years. The membership of a 
member who is absent from four consecutive meetings shall be terminated.
    (7) Government members. Government members of a TAC will be selected 
by the Department of Commerce from the agencies having an interest in 
the subject matter concerned.
    (8) Invitation to serve on committee. Invitations to serve on a TAC 
will be sent by letter to the selected nominees.
    (9) Election of Chair. The Chair of each TAC shall be elected by a 
vote of the majority of the members of the committee present and voting.
    (c) Charter. (1) No TAC established pursuant to this supplement 
shall meet or take any action until an advisory committee charter has 
been filed with the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration of the 
Department of Commerce and with the standing committees of the Senate 
and of the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over 
the Department. Such charter shall contain the following information:
    (i) The committee's official designation;
    (ii) The committee's objectives and the scope of its activities;
    (iii) The period of time necessary for the committee to carry out 
its purposes;
    (iv) The agency or official to whom the committee reports;
    (v) The agency responsible for providing the necessary support for 
the committee;
    (vi) A description of the duties for which the committee is 
responsible, and, if such duties are not solely advisory, a 
specification of the authority for such functions;
    (vii) The estimated annual operating costs in dollars and years for 
such committee;
    (viii) The estimated number and frequency of committee meetings;
    (ix) The committee's termination date, if less than two years from 
the date of the committee's establishment; and
    (x) The date the charter is filed.
    (d) Meetings. (1) Each TAC established under the provisions of the 
EAA and paragraph (b) of this supplement shall meet at least once every 
three months at the call of its Chair unless it is specifically 
determined by the Chair, in consultation with other members of the 
committee, that a particular meeting is not necessary.
    (2) No TAC may meet except at the call of its Chair.
    (3) Each meeting of a TAC shall be conducted in accordance with an 
agenda approved by a designated Federal government employee.
    (4) No TAC shall conduct a meeting in the absence of a designated 
Federal government employee who shall be authorized to adjourn any 
advisory committee meeting, whenever the Federal government employee 
determines adjournment to be in the public interest.
    (e) Public notice. Notice to the public of each meeting of a TAC 
will be issued at least 20 days in advance and will be published in the 
Federal Register. The notice will include the time and place of the 
meeting and the agenda.
    (f) Public attendance and participation. (1) Any member of the 
public who wishes to do so may file a written statement with any TAC 
before or after any meeting of a committee.
    (2) A request for an opportunity to deliver an oral statement 
relevant to matters on the agenda of a meeting of a TAC will be granted 
to the extent that the time available for the meeting permits. A 
committee may establish procedures requiring such persons to obtain 
advance approval for such participation.
    (3) Attendance at meetings of TACs will be open to the public unless 
it is determined pursuant to section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act to be necessary to close all, or some portion, of the 
meeting to the public. A determination that a meeting or portion thereof 
be closed to the public may be made if all or a specific portion of a 
meeting of a TAC is concerned with matters described in section 552(b) 
of Title 5, U.S.C.
    (4) Participation by members of the public in open TAC meetings or 
questioning of committee members or other participants shall not be 
permitted except in accordance with procedures established by the 
committee.
    (5) Every effort will be made to accommodate all members of the 
public who wish to attend.
    (g) Minutes. (1) Detailed minutes of each meeting of each TAC will 
be kept and will contain a record of the persons present, a complete and 
accurate description of the matters discussed and conclusions reached, 
and copies of all reports received, issued, or approved by the TAC.
    (2) The accuracy of all the minutes will be certified to by the TAC 
Chair.
    (h) Records. (1) Subject to section 552 of Title 5, U.S.C. and 
Department of Commerce Administrative Order 205-12, ``Public 
Information,'' and ``Public Information'' regulations issued by the 
Department of Commerce that are contained in 15 CFR part 4, Subtitle A, 
the records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendices, working papers, 
draft, studies, agenda, or other documents that were made available to 
or prepared for or by each TAC will be available for public inspection 
and copying.

[[Page 201]]

    (2) Each TAC will prepare once each year a report describing its 
membership, functions, activities, and such related matters as would be 
informative to the public consistent with the policy of section 552(b) 
of Title 5, U.S.C.
    (3)(i) Requests for records should be addressed to: Bureau of Export 
Administration, Freedom of Information, Records Inspection Facility, 
U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 4513, Washington, DC 20230, Telephone 
(202) 482-2593.
    (ii) Rules concerning the use of the Records Inspection Facility are 
contained in 15 CFR part 4, Subtitle A, or may be obtained from this

    (i) Compensation. If the Department of Commerce deems it 
appropriate, a member of a TAC may be reimbursed for travel, 
subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred in connection with 
the member's duties.
    (j) Scope of advisory committee functions. All TACs are limited to 
the functions described in their charters.
    (k) Duration of committees. Each TAC will terminate at the end of 
two years from the date the committee was established or two years from 
the effective date of its most recent extension, whichever is later. 
Committees may be continued only for successive two-year periods by 
appropriate action taken by the authorized officer of the Department of 
Commerce prior to the date on which such advisory committee would 
otherwise terminate. TACs may be extended or terminated only after 
consultation with the committee.
    (l) Miscellaneous. (1) TACs established in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this supplement must conform to the provisions of the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-63 (Revision of March 1974), ``Advisory Committee 
Management,'' Department of Commerce Administrative Order 205-12, 
``Public Information,'' the applicable provisions of the EAA, and any 
other applicable Department of Commerce regulations or procedures 
affecting the establishment or operation of advisory committees.
    (2) Whenever the Department of Commerce desires the advice or 
assistance of a particular segment of an industry with respect to any 
export control problem for which the service of a TAC, as described in 
paragraph (b) of this supplement is either unavailable or impracticable, 
an advisory committee may be established pursuant to the provisions of 
section 9 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Such committees will be 
subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, OMB 
Circular A-63 (Revision of March 1974), ``Advisory Committee 
Management,'' Department of Commerce Administrative Order 205-12, 
``Public Information,'' and any other applicable Department of Commerce 
regulations or procedures affecting the establishment or operation of 
advisory committees.
    (3) Nothing in the provisions of this supplement shall be construed 
to restrict in any manner the right of any person or firm to discuss any 
export control matter with the Department of Commerce or to offer advice 
or information on export control matters. Similarly, nothing in these 
provisions shall be construed to restrict the Department of Commerce in 
consulting any person or firm relative to any export control matter.

Sec. 732.1  Steps overview.

    (a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are 
references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part is intended to 
help you determine your obligations under the EAR by listing logical 
steps in Sec. 732.2 through Sec. 732.5 of this part that you can take in 
reviewing these regulations. A flow chart describing these steps is 
contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 732. By cross-references to the 
relevant provisions of the EAR, this part describes the suggested steps 
for you to determine applicability of the following:
    (i) The scope of the EAR (part 734 of the EAR);
    (ii) Each of the general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR);
    (iii) The License Exceptions (part 740 of the EAR); and
    (iv) Other requirements such as clearing your export with the U.S. 
Customs Service, keeping records, and completing and documenting license 
applications.
    (2) These steps describe the organization of the EAR, the 
relationship among the provisions of the EAR, and the appropriate order 
for you to consider the various provisions of the EAR.
    (b) Facts about your transaction. The following five types of facts 
determine your obligations under the EAR and will be of help to you in 
reviewing these steps:
    (1) What is it? What an item is, for export control purposes, 
depends on its classification, which is its place on the Commerce 
Control List (see part 774 of the EAR).
    (2) Where is it going? The country of ultimate destination for an 
export or reexport also determines licensing requirements (see parts 738 
and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country Chart and the Commerce Control 
List).
    (3) Who will receive it? The ultimate end-user of your item cannot 
be a bad end-user. See General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) in 
Sec. 736.2(b)(4) and parts

[[Page 203]]

744 and 764 of the EAR for a reference to the list of persons you may 
not deal with.
    (4) What will they do with it? The ultimate end-use of your item 
cannot be a bad end-use. See General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User) 
in Sec. 736.2(b)(5) and part 744 of the EAR for general end-use and end-
user restrictions.
    (5) What else do they do? Conduct such as contracting, financing, 
and freight forwarding in support of a proliferation project (as 
described in Sec. 744.6 of the EAR) may prevent you from dealing with 
someone.
    (c) Are your items and activities subject to the EAR? You should 
first determine whether your commodity, software, or technology is 
subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR concerning scope), and Steps 
1 through 6 help you do that. For exports from the United States, only 
Steps 1 and 2 are relevant. If you already know that your item or 
activity is subject to the EAR, you should go on to consider the ten 
general prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR. If your item or activity is 
not subject to the EAR, you have no obligations under the EAR and may 
skip the remaining steps.
    (d) Does your item or activity require a license under one or more 
of the ten general prohibitions? (1) Brief summary of the ten general 
prohibitions. The general prohibitions are found in part 736 of the EAR 
and referred to in these steps. They consist, very briefly, of the 
following:
    (i) General Prohibition One (Exports and Reexports): Export and 
reexport of controlled items to listed countries.
    (ii) General Prohibition Two (Parts and Components Reexports): 
Reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating more 
than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content.
    (iii) General Prohibition Three (Foreign-produced Direct Product 
Reexports): Reexport and export from abroad of the foreign-produced 
direct product of U.S. technology and software.
    (iv) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders): Engaging in actions 
prohibited by a denial order.
    (v) General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User): Export or reexport 
to prohibited end-user or end-users.
    (vi) General Prohibition Six (Embargo): Export or reexport to 
embargoed destinations.
    (vii) General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person Proliferation 
Activity): Support of proliferation activities.
    (viii) General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit): In-transit shipments 
and items to be unladen from vessels and aircraft.
    (ix) General Prohibition Nine (Orders, Terms and Conditions): 
Violation of any orders, terms, or conditions.
    (x) General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur): 
Proceeding with transactions with knowledge that a violation has 
occurred or is about to occur.
    (2) Controls on items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). If your 
item or activity is subject to the EAR, you should determine whether any 
one or more of the ten general prohibitions require a license for your 
export, reexport, or activity. Steps 7 through 11 refer to 
classification of your item on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (part 774 
of the EAR) and how to use the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) to determine whether a license is required based upon 
the classification of your item. These steps refer to General 
Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components 
Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) for 
all countries except: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and Libya. For these countries, 
you may skip Steps 7 through 11 and go directly to Step 12.
    (3) Controls on activities. Steps 12 through 18 refer to General 
Prohibitions Four through Ten. Those general prohibitions apply to all 
items subject to the EAR, not merely those items listed on the CCL in 
part 774 of the EAR. For example, they refer to the general prohibitions 
for persons denied export privileges, prohibited end-uses and end-users, 
embargoed countries (e.g., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and Libya), prohibited 
activities of U.S. persons in support of proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction, prohibited unlading of shipments, compliance with 
orders,

[[Page 204]]

terms and conditions, and activities when a violation has occurred or is 
about to occur.
    (4) General prohibitions. If none of the ten general prohibitions 
applies, you should skip the steps concerning License Exceptions and for 
exports from the United States, review Steps 27 through 29 concerning 
Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S. Customs Service, 
Destination Control Statements for export control documents, and 
recordkeeping requirements.
    (e) Is a License Exception available to overcome the license 
requirement? If you decide by reviewing the CCL in combination with the 
Country Chart that a license is required for your destination, you 
should determine whether a License Exception will except you from that 
requirement. Steps 20 through 24 help you determine whether a License 
Exception is available. Note that generally License Exceptions are not 
available to overcome General Prohibitions Four through Ten. However, 
selected License Exceptions for embargoed destinations are specified in 
part 746 of the EAR and License Exceptions for short supply controls are 
specified in part 754 of the EAR. If a License Exception is available 
and the export is from the United States, you should review Steps 26 
through 28 concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the 
U.S. Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export control 
documents and recordkeeping requirements. If a License Exception is not 
available, go on to Steps 25 through 29.
    (f) How do you apply for a license? If you must file a license 
application, you should review the requirements of part 748 of the EAR 
as suggested by Step 26. Then you should review Steps 27 through 29 
concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S. 
Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export control 
documents, and recordkeeping requirements.

Sec. 732.2  Steps regarding scope of the EAR.

    Steps 1 though 6 are designed to aid you in determining the scope of 
the EAR. A flow chart describing these steps is contained in Supplement 
No. 2 to part 732.
    (a) Step 1: Items subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another 
Federal agency. This step is relevant for both exports and reexports. 
Determine whether your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of 
another Federal Agency as provided in Sec. 734.3 of the EAR.
    (1) If your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another 
Federal agency, comply with the regulations of that agency. You need not 
comply with the EAR and may skip the remaining steps.
    (2) If your item is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of 
another federal agency, then proceed to Step 2 in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Step 2: Publicly available technology and software. This step is 
relevant for both exports and reexports. Determine if your technology or 
software is publicly available as defined and explained at part 734 of 
the EAR. Supplement No. 1 to part 734 of the EAR contains several 
practical examples describing publicly available technology and software 
that is outside the scope of the EAR. The examples are illustrative, not 
comprehensive. Note that encryption software controlled for EI reasons 
under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List (refer to Supplement No.1 
to part 774 of the EAR) shall be subject to the EAR even if publicly 
available. Accordingly, the provisions of the EAR concerning the public 
availability of items are not applicable to encryption items controlled 
for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5D002.
    (1) If your technology or software is publicly available, and 
therefore outside the scope of the EAR, you may proceed with the export 
or reexport if you are not a U.S. person subject to General Prohibition 
Seven. If you are a U.S. person, go to Step 15 at Sec. 732.3(j) of this 
part. If you are a U.S. person and General Prohibition Seven concerning 
proliferation activity of U.S. persons does not apply, then you may 
proceed with the export or reexport of your

[[Page 205]]

publicly available technology or software. Note that all U.S. persons 
are subject to the provisions of General Prohibition Seven.
    (2) If your technology or software is not publicly available and you 
are exporting from the United States, skip to Step 7 in Sec. 732.3(b) of 
this part concerning the general prohibitions.
    (3) If you are exporting items from a foreign country, you should 
then proceed to Step 3 in paragraph (c) of this section and the other 
steps concerning the scope of the EAR.
    (c) Step 3: Reexport of U.S.-origin items. This step is appropriate 
only for reexporters. For an item in a foreign country, you should 
determine whether the item is of U.S. origin. If it is of U.S.-origin, 
skip to Step 7 in Sec. 732.3(b) of this part. If it is not of U.S. 
origin, then proceed to Step 4 in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Step 4: Foreign-made items incorporating less than the de 
minimis level of U.S. parts, components, and materials. This step is 
appropriate only for items that are made outside the United States and 
not currently in the United States. Note that encryption items 
controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002 or 5E002 on the 
Commerce Control List (refer to Supplement No.1 to Part 774 of the EAR) 
are subject to the EAR even if they incorporate less than the de minimis 
level of U.S. content. However, exporters may, as part of a 
classification request, ask that certain 5A002 and 5D002 parts, 
components and software also be made eligible for de minimis treatment 
(see Sec. 734.4(b) of the EAR). The review of de minimis eligibility 
will take into account national security interests.
    (1) For an item made in a foreign country, you should determine 
whether controlled U.S.-origin parts, components, or materials are 
incorporated as provided in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR. Also, determine the 
value of the U.S.-origin controlled content as provided in Supplement 
No. 2 to part 734 of the EAR.
    (2) To determine the value of the U.S.-origin controlled content, 
you should classify the U.S.-origin content on the CCL, determine those 
items that would require a license from BXA for reexport to the ultimate 
destination of the foreign-made product if such parts, components, or 
materials were reexported to that destination in the form received, and 
divide the total value of the controlled U.S. parts, components, and 
materials incorporated into the foreign-made item by the sale price of 
the foreign-made item.
    (3) If no U.S. parts, components, or materials are incorporated or 
if the incorporated U.S. parts, components, and materials are below the 
de minimis level described in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR, then the foreign-
made item is not subject to the EAR by reason of the parts and 
components rule, the classification of a foreign-made item is irrelevant 
in determining the scope of the EAR, and you should skip Step 4 and go 
on to consider Step 6 regarding the foreign-produced direct product 
rule.
    (4) If controlled parts, components, or materials are incorporated 
and are above the de minimis level, then you should go on to Step 5.
    (e) Step 5: Foreign-made items incorporating more than the de 
minimis level of U.S. parts, components, or materials. This step is 
appropriate only for foreign-made items incorporating certain U.S. 
parts. If the incorporated U.S. parts exceed the relevant de minimis 
level, then your export from abroad is subject to the EAR. You then 
should skip to Step 7 at Sec. 732.3 of this part and consider the steps 
regarding all other general prohibitions, License Exceptions, and other 
requirements.
    (f) Step 6: Foreign-made items produced with certain U.S. technology 
for export to specified destinations. This step is appropriate for 
foreign-made items in foreign countries.
    (1) If your foreign-produced item is described in an entry on the 
CCL and the Country Chart requires a license to your export or reexport 
destination for national security reasons, you should determine whether 
your item is subject to General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced 
Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR). Your item is 
subject to the EAR if it is captured by General Prohibition Three 
(Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), and that prohibition 
applies if your transaction meets each of the following conditions:
    (i) Country scope of prohibition. Your export or reexport 
destination for the

[[Page 206]]

direct product is Cuba, Libya, or a destination in Country Group D:1 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) (reexports of foreign-
produced direct products exported to other destinations are not subject 
to General Prohibition Three);
    (ii) Scope of technology or software used to create direct products 
subject to the prohibition. Technology or software that was used to 
create the foreign-produced direct product, and such technology or 
software that was subject to the EAR and required a written assurance as 
a supporting document for a license or as a precondition for the use of 
License Exception TSR in Sec. 740.6 of the EAR (reexports of foreign-
produced direct products created with other technology and software are 
not subject to General Prohibition Three); and
    (iii) Scope of direct products subject to the prohibition. The 
foreign-produced direct products are subject to national security 
controls as designated on the proper ECCN of the Commerce Control List 
in part 774 of the EAR (reexports of foreign-produced direct products 
not subject to national security controls are not subject to General 
Prohibition Three).
    (2) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described in part 740 
of the EAR overcomes this General Prohibition Three if all terms and 
conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or 
reexporter.
    (3) Subject to the EAR. If your item is captured by the foreign-
produced direct product control at General Prohibition Three, then your 
export from abroad is subject to the EAR. You should next consider the 
steps regarding all other general prohibitions, License Exceptions, and 
other requirements. If your item is not captured by General Prohibition 
Three, then your export from abroad is not subject to the EAR. You have 
completed the steps necessary to determine whether your transaction is 
subject to the EAR, and you may skip the remaining steps. Note that in 
summary, items in foreign countries are subject to the EAR when they 
are:
    (i) U.S.-origin commodities, software and technology unless 
controlled for export exclusively by another Federal agency or unless 
publicly available;
    (ii) Foreign-origin commodities, software, and technology that are 
within the scope of General Prohibition Two (Parts and Components 
Reexports), or General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced Direct 
Product Reexports). (However, such foreign-made items are also outside 
the scope of the EAR if they are controlled for export exclusively by 
another Federal agency or publicly available.)

<R05>
Sec. 732.3  Steps regarding the ten general prohibitions.

    (a) Introduction. If your item or activity is subject to the scope 
of the EAR, you should then consider each of the ten general 
prohibitions listed in part 736 of the EAR. General Prohibitions One 
((Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and 
Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b) (1), 
(2), and (3) of the EAR) are product controls that are shaped and 
limited by parameters specified on the CCL and Country Chart. General 
Prohibitions Four through Ten are prohibitions on certain activities 
that are not allowed without authorization from BXA, and these 
prohibitions apply to all items subject to the EAR unless otherwise 
specified (Sec. 736.2(b) (4) through (10) of the EAR).
    (b) Step 7: Classification. (1) You should classify your items in 
the relevant entry on the CCL, and you may do so on your own without the 
assistance of BXA. You are responsible for doing so correctly, and your 
failure to correctly classify your items does not relieve you of the 
obligation to obtain a license when one is required by the EAR.
    (2) You have a right to request the applicable classification of 
your item from BXA, and BXA has a duty to provide that classification to 
you. For further information on how to obtain classification assistance 
from BXA, see part 748 of the EAR.
    (3) For items subject to the EAR but not listed on the CCL, the 
proper classification is EAR99. This number is a

[[Page 207]]

``basket'' for items not specified under any CCL entry and appears at 
the end of each Category on the CCL.
    (c) Step 8: Country of ultimate destination. You should determine 
the country of ultimate destination. The country of destination 
determines the applicability of several general prohibitions, License 
Exceptions, and other requirements. Note that part 754 of the EAR 
concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the only 
location in the EAR that contains both the prohibitions and exceptions 
applicable to short supply controls.
    (d) Step 9: Reason for control and the Country Chart. (1) Reason for 
control and column identifier within the Export Control Classification 
Number (ECCN). Once you have determined that your item is controlled by 
a specific ECCN, you must use information contained in the ``License 
Requirements'' section of that ECCN in combination with the Country 
Chart to decide whether a license is required under General Prohibitions 
One, Two, or Three to a particular destination. The CCL and the Country 
Chart are taken together to define these license requirements. The 
applicable ECCN will indicate the reason or reasons for control for 
items within that ECCN. For example, ECCN 6A007 is controlled for 
national security, missile technology, and anti-terrorism reasons.
    (2) Reason for control within the Country Chart. With each of the 
applicable Country Chart column identifiers noted in the correct ECCN, 
turn to the Country Chart. Locate the correct Country Chart column 
identifier on the horizontal axis, and determine whether an ``X'' is 
marked in the cell next to the destination in question. Consult 
Sec. 738.4 of the EAR for comprehensive instructions on using the 
Country Chart and a detailed example.
    (i) An ``X'' in the cell or cells for the relevant country and 
reason(s) for control column indicates that a license is required for 
General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received), 
Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct 
Product Reexports). (See Sec. 736.2 (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the 
EAR).
    (ii) If one or more cells have an ``X'' in the relevant column, a 
license is required unless you qualify for a License Exception described 
in part 740 of the EAR. If a cell does not contain an ``X'' for your 
destination in one or more relevant columns, a license is not required 
under the CCL and the Country Chart.
    (iii) Additional controls may apply to your export. You must go on 
to steps 12 through 18 described in paragraphs (g) to (m) of this 
section to determine whether additional limits described in General 
Prohibition Two (Parts and Components Reexports) and General Prohibition 
Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports ) apply to your 
proposed transaction. If you are exporting an item from the United 
States, you should skip Step 10 and Step 11. Proceed directly to Step 12 
in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) License requirements not on the Country Chart. There are two 
instances where the Country Chart cannot be used to determine if a 
license is required. Items controlled for short supply reasons are not 
governed by the Country Chart. Part 754 of the EAR contains license 
requirements and License Exceptions for items subject to short supply 
controls. A limited number of ECCNs contained on the CCL do not identify 
a Country Chart column identifier. In these instances, the ECCN states 
whether a license is required and for which destinations. See 
Sec. 738.3(a) of the EAR for a list of the ECCNs for which you do not 
need to consult the Country Chart to determine licensing requirements.
    (4) Destinations subject to embargo provisions. The Country Chart 
does not apply to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and Libya; and for those countries 
you should review the embargo provisions at part 746 of the EAR and may 
skip this step concerning the Country Chart. For Angola, Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Croatia, Rwanda, and Serbia and Montenegro the Country 
Chart provides for certain license requirements, and part 746 of the EAR 
provides additional requirements.
    (5) Items subject to the EAR but not on the CCL. Items subject to 
the EAR that are not on the CCL are properly classified EAR99. For such 
items, you may

[[Page 208]]

skip this step and proceed directly with Step 12 in paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (e) Step 10: Foreign-made items incorporating U.S.-origin items and 
the de minimis rule. (1) Parts and components rule. The following 
considerations are appropriate for items abroad and are the same steps 
necessary to determine whether a foreign-made item incorporating U.S. 
parts, components, or materials is subject to the EAR. If your foreign-
made item is described in an entry on the CCL and the Country Chart 
requires a license to your export or reexport destination, you should 
determine whether the controlled U.S.-origin commodities, software, or 
technology incorporated into the foreign-made item exceeds the de 
minimis level applicable to the ultimate destination of the foreign-made 
item, as follows:
    (i) A 10% de minimis level to embargoed and terrorist-supporting 
countries; or
    (ii) A 25% de minimis level to all other countries.
    (2) Guidance for calculations. For guidance on how to calculate the 
U.S.-controlled content, refer to Supplement No. 2 to part 734 of the 
EAR. Note that certain rules issued by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control, certain exports from abroad by U.S.-owned or controlled 
entities may be prohibited notwithstanding the de minimis provisions of 
the EAR. In addition, the de minimis exclusions from the parts and 
components rule do not relieve U.S. persons of the obligation to refrain 
from supporting the proliferation of weapons of mass-destruction and 
missiles as provided in General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person 
Proliferation Activity) described in Sec. 736.2(b)(7) of the EAR. Note 
that encryption items controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002 
or 5E002 on the Commerce Control List (refer to Supplement No.1 to Part 
774 of the EAR) are subject to the EAR even if they incorporate less 
than the de minimis level of U.S. content. However, exporters may, as 
part of a classification request, ask that certain 5A002 and 5D002 
parts, components and software also be made eligible for de minimis 
treatment (see Sec. 734.4(b) of the EAR).
    (f) Step 11: Foreign-produced direct product. The following 
considerations are appropriate for items abroad and are the same 
considerations necessary to determine whether a foreign-produced direct 
product is subject to the EAR under Step 6 in Sec. 732.2(f) of this 
part.
    (1) If your foreign-produced item is described in an entry on the 
CCL and the Country Chart requires a license to your export or reexport 
destination for national security reasons, you must determine whether 
your item is subject to General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced 
Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR). Your item is 
subject to this general prohibition if your transaction meets each of 
the following conditions:
    (i) Country scope of prohibition. Your export or reexport 
destination for the direct product is Cuba, Libya, or a destination in 
Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) 
(reexports of foreign-produced direct products exported to other 
destinations are not subject to General Prohibition Three described in 
Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR);
    (ii) Scope of technology or software used to create direct products 
subject to the prohibition. Technology or software that was used to 
create the foreign-produced direct product, and such technology or 
software that was subject to the EAR and required a written assurance as 
a supporting document for a license or as a precondition for the use of 
License Exception TSR in Sec. 740.6 of the EAR (reexports of foreign-
produced direct products created with other technology and software are 
not subject to General Prohibition Three); and
    (iii) Scope of direct products subject to the prohibition. The 
foreign-produced direct products are controlled for national security 
reasons indicated in an ECCN on the CCL (reexports of foreign-produced 
direct products not subject to national security controls are not 
subject to General Prohibition Three).
    (2) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described in part 740 
of the EAR overcomes General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced Direct 
Product Reexports) if all terms and conditions of a given License 
Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
    (g) Step 12: Persons denied export privileges. (1) Determine whether 
your

[[Page 209]]

transferee, ultimate end-user, any intermediate consignee, or any other 
party to a transaction is a person denied export privileges. (See part 
764 of the EAR). While it is not a violation of General Prohibition Four 
(Denial Orders) (Sec. 736.2(b)(4) of the EAR) to fail to check the 
Denied Persons List prior to a transfer, it is nonetheless a violation 
of the EAR to engage in any activity that violates the terms or 
conditions of a denial order. General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) 
applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and 
within EAR99.
    (2) There are no License Exceptions to General Prohibition Four 
(Denial Orders). The prohibition concerning persons denied export 
privileges may be overcome only by a specific authorization from BXA, 
something that is rarely granted.
    (h) STEP 13: Prohibited end-uses and end-users. (1) Review the end-
uses and end-users prohibited under General Prohibition Five (End-Use 
and End-User) (Sec. 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) described in part 744 of the 
EAR. Part 744 of the EAR contains all the end-use and end-user license 
requirements, and those are in addition to the license requirements 
under General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and 
Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-produced Direct Product 
Reexports). Unless otherwise indicated, the license requirements of 
General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User) described in part 744 of 
the EAR apply to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the 
CCL and within EAR99. Moreover, the requirements of General Prohibition 
Five (End-Use and End-User) are in addition to various end-use and end-
user limitations placed on certain License Exceptions.
    (2) Under License Exception TSU (Sec. 740.13 of the EAR), 
operational technology and software (OTS), sales technology (STS), and 
software updates (SUD) overcome General Prohibition Five (End-Use and 
End-User) (Sec. 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) if all terms and conditions of 
these provisions are met by the exporter or reexporter.
    (i) Step 14: Embargoed countries and special destinations. If your 
destination for any item is Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Cuba, Iran, 
Iraq, Libya, Rwanda, or Serbia and Montenegro, you must consider the 
requirements of part 746 of the EAR. Unless otherwise indicated, General 
Prohibition Six (Embargo) applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. 
both items on the CCL and within EAR99. You may not make an export or 
reexport contrary to the provisions of part 746 of the EAR without a 
license unless:
    (1) You are exporting or reexporting only publicly available 
technology or software or other items outside the scope of the EAR, or
    (2) You qualify for a License Exception referenced in part 746 of 
the EAR concerning embargoed destinations. You may not use a License 
Exception described in part 740 of the EAR to overcome General 
Prohibition Six (Embargo) (Sec. 736.2(b)(6) of the EAR) unless it is 
specifically authorized in part 746 of the EAR. Note that part 754 of 
the EAR concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the 
only location in the EAR for both the prohibitions and exceptions 
applicable to short supply controls.
    (j) Step 15: Proliferation activity of U.S. persons unrelated to 
exports and reexports. (1) Review the scope of activity prohibited by 
General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person Proliferation Activity) 
(Sec. 736.2(b)(7) of the EAR) as that activity is described in 
Sec. 744.6 of the EAR. Keep in mind that such activity is not limited to 
exports and reexports and is not limited to items subject to General 
Prohibition One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components 
Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports). 
Moreover, such activity extends to services and dealing in wholly 
foreign-origin items in support of the specified proliferation activity 
and is not limited to items listed on the CCL or included in EAR99.
    (2) Review the definition of U.S. Person in part 744 of the EAR.
    (k) Step 16: In-transit. Shippers and operators of vessels or 
aircraft should review General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit) to 
determine the countries in which you may not unladen or ship certain 
items in-transit. General Prohibition Eight applies to all items subject 
to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99.

[[Page 210]]

    (l) Step 17: Review orders, terms, and conditions. Review the 
orders, terms, and conditions applicable to your transaction. General 
Prohibition Nine (Orders, Terms, and Conditions) prohibits the violation 
of any orders, terms, and conditions imposed under the EAR. Terms and 
conditions are frequently contained in licenses. In addition, the ten 
general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR) and the License Exceptions 
(part 740 of the EAR) impose terms and conditions or limitations on your 
proposed transactions and use of License Exceptions. A given license or 
License Exception may not be used unless each relevant term or condition 
is met.
    (m) Step 18: Review the ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance and General 
Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur). License requirements 
under the EAR are determined solely by the classification, end-use, end-
user, ultimate destination, and conduct of U.S. persons. Supplement No. 
1 to part 732 of the EAR is intended to provide helpful guidance 
regarding the process for the evaluation of information about customers, 
end-uses, and end-users. General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to 
Occur) prohibits anyone from proceeding with a transaction with 
knowledge that a violation of the EAR has occurred or is about to occur. 
It also prohibits related shipping, financing, and other services. 
General Prohibition Ten applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. 
both items on the CCL and within EAR99.
    (n) Step 19: Complete the review of the general prohibitions. After 
completion of Steps described in this section and review of all ten 
general prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR, including cross-referenced 
regulations in the EAR, you will know which, if any, of the ten general 
prohibitions of the EAR apply to you and your contemplated transaction 
or activity.
    (1) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your 
export from the United States, no license from BXA is required, you do 
not need to qualify for a License Exception under part 740 of the EAR. 
You should skip the Steps in Sec. 732.4 of this part regarding License 
Exceptions and proceed directly to the Steps in Sec. 732.5 of this part 
regarding recordkeeping, clearing the U.S. Customs Service with the 
appropriate Shipper's Export Declaration, and using the required 
Destination Control Statement.
    (2) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your 
reexport or export from abroad, no license is required and you should 
skip all remaining Steps.
    (3) If one or more of the ten general prohibitions are applicable, 
continue with the remaining steps.

<R05>
Sec. 732.4  Steps regarding License Exceptions.

    (a) Introduction to Steps for License Exceptions. If your export or 
reexport is subject to the EAR and is subject to General Prohibitions 
One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), or 
Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), consider the steps 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section. If your export or reexport is 
subject to General Prohibitions Four (Denial Orders), Seven (U.S. Person 
Proliferation Activity), Eight (In-Transit), Nine (Orders, Terms, and 
Conditions), or Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur), there are no License 
Exceptions available for your export or reexport. If your export is 
subject to General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User), consult part 744 
of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition 
Six (Embargo), consult part 746 of the EAR for applicable License 
Exceptions.
    (b) Steps for License Exceptions. (1) Step 20: Applicability of 
General Prohibitions. Determine whether any one or more of the general 
prohibitions described in Sec. 736.2(b) of the EAR apply to your export 
or reexport. If no general prohibition applies to your export or 
reexport, then you may proceed with your export or reexport and need not 
review part 740 of the EAR regarding License Exceptions. You are 
reminded of your recordkeeping obligations related to the clearance of 
the U.S. Customs Service provided in parts 762 and 758 of the EAR.

[[Page 211]]

    (2) Step 21: Applicability of restrictions on all License 
Exceptions. Determine whether any one or more of the restrictions in 
Sec. 740.2 of the EAR applies to your export or reexport. If any one or 
more of these restrictions apply, there are no License Exceptions 
available to you, and you must either obtain a license or refrain from 
the export or reexport.
    (3) Step 22: Terms and conditions of the License Exceptions. (i) If 
none of the restrictions in Sec. 740.2 of the EAR applies, then review 
each of the License Exceptions to determine whether any one of them 
authorizes your export or reexport. Eligibility for License Exceptions 
is based on the item, the country of ultimate destination, the end-use, 
and the end-user, along with any special conditions imposed within a 
specific License Exception.
    (ii) You may meet the conditions for more than one License 
Exception. Moreover, although you may not qualify for some License 
Exceptions you may qualify for others. Review the broadest License 
Exceptions first, and use any License Exception available to you. You 
are not required to use the most restrictive applicable License 
Exception. If you fail to qualify for the License Exception that you 
first consider, you may consider any other License Exception until you 
have determined that no License Exception is available.
    (iii) License Exceptions TMP, RPL, BAG, AVS, GOV, and TSU authorize 
exports notwithstanding the provisions of the CCL. List-based License 
Exceptions (LVS, GBS, CIV, TSR, and CTP) are available only to the 
extent specified on the CCL. Part 740 of the EAR provides authorization 
for reexports only to the extent each License Exception expressly 
authorizes reexports. License Exception APR authorizes reexports only.
    (iv) If you are exporting under License Exceptions GBS, CIV, LVS, 
CTP, TSR, or GOV, you should review Sec. 743.1 of the EAR to determine 
the applicability of certain reporting requirements.
    (4) Step 23: Scope of License Exceptions. Some License Exceptions 
are limited by country or by type of item.
    (i) Countries are arranged in country groups for ease of reference. 
For a listing of country groups, please refer to Supplement No. 1 to 
part 740 of the EAR. Unless otherwise indicated in a License Exception, 
License Exceptions do not apply to any exports or reexports to embargoed 
destinations. If your export or reexport is subject to General 
Prohibition Six (Embargo) for embargoed destinations, License Exceptions 
are only available to the extent specifically provided in part 746 of 
the EAR concerning embargoed destinations.
    (ii) Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. No 
License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR may be used for 
items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons. License 
Exceptions for short supply items are found in part 754 of the EAR.
    (5) Step 24: Compliance with all terms and conditions. If a License 
Exception is available, you may proceed with your export or reexport. 
However, you must meet all the terms and conditions required by the 
License Exception that you determined authorized your export or 
reexport. You must also consult part 758 and 762 of the EAR to determine 
your recordkeeping and documentation requirements.
    (6) Step 25: License requirements. If no License Exception is 
available, then you must either obtain a license before proceeding with 
your export or reexport or you must refrain from the proposed export or 
reexport.
    (7) Step 26: License applications. If you are going to file a 
license application with BXA, you should first review the requirements 
at part 748 of the EAR. Exporters, reexporters, and exporters from 
abroad should review the instructions concerning applications and 
required support documents prior to submitting an application for a 
license.

Sec. 732.5  Steps regarding Shipper's Export Declaration, Destination Control Statements, and recordkeeping.

    (a) Step 27: Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) or Automated Export 
System

[[Page 212]]

(AES) record. Exporters or agents authorized to complete the Shipper's 
Export Declaration (SED), or to file SED information electronically 
using the Automated Export System (AES), should review Sec. 758.1 of the 
EAR to determine when an SED is required and what export control 
information should be entered on the SED or AES record. More detailed 
information about how to complete an SED or file the SED information 
electronically using AES may be found in the Bureau of Census Foreign 
Trade Statistics Regulations (FTSR) at 15 CFR part 30. Reexporters and 
firms exporting from abroad may skip Steps 27 through 29 and proceed 
directly to Sec. 732.6.
    (1) Entering license authority. You must enter the correct license 
authority for your export on the SED or AES record (License number, 
License Exception symbol, or No License Required designator ``NLR'') as 
appropriate. See Sec. 758.1(g) of the EAR and 15 CFR 30.7(m) of the 
FTSR.
    (i) License number and expiration date. If you are exporting under 
the authority of a license, you must enter the license number on the SED 
or AES record. The expiration date must be entered on paper versions of 
the SED only.
    (ii) License Exception. If you are exporting under the authority of 
a License Exception, you must enter the correct License Exception symbol 
(e.g., LVS, GBS, CIV) on the SED or AES record. See Sec. 740.1 and 
Sec. 740.2 of the EAR.
    (iii) NLR. If you are exporting items for which no license is 
required, you must enter the designator NLR. You should use the NLR 
designator in two circumstances: first, when the items to be exported 
are subject to the EAR but not listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL) 
(i.e., items that are classified as EAR99), and second, when the items 
to be exported are listed on the CCL but do not require a license. Use 
of the NLR designator is also a representation that no license is 
required under any of the General Prohibitions set forth in part 736 of 
the EAR.
    (2) Item description. You must enter an item description identical 
to the item description on the license when a license is required, or 
enter an item description sufficient in detail to permit review by the 
U.S. Government and verification of the Schedule B Number (or Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule number) for License Exception shipments or shipments for 
which No License is Required (NLR). See Sec. 758.1(g) of the EAR; and 15 
CFR 30.7(l) of the FTSR.
    (3) Entering the ECCN. You must enter the correct Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) on the SED or AES record for all licensed 
and License Exception shipments, and ``No License Required'' (NLR) 
shipments of items having a reason for control other than anti-terrorism 
(AT). The only exception to this requirement would be the return of 
unwanted foreign origin items, meeting the provisions of License 
Exception TMP, under Sec. 740.9(b)(3). See Sec. 758.1(g) of the EAR.
    (b) Step 28: Destination Control Statement. The Destination Control 
Statement (DCS) must be entered on the invoice and on the bill of 
lading, air waybill, or other export control document that accompanies 
the shipment from its point of origin in the United States to the 
ultimate consignee or end-user abroad. The person responsible for 
preparation of those documents is responsible for entry of the DCS. The 
DCS is required for all exports from the United States of items on the 
Commerce Control List and is not required for items classified as EAR99, 
unless the export may be made under License Exception BAG or GFT (see 
part 740 of the EAR). Reexporters should review Sec. 752.15 of the EAR 
for DCS requirements when using a Special Comprehensive License; 
otherwise, DCS requirements do not apply to reexports. See Sec. 758.6 of 
the EAR.
    (c) Step 29: Recordkeeping. Records of transactions subject to the 
EAR must be maintained for five years in accordance with the 
recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR.

Sec. 732.6  Steps for other requirements.

    Sections 732.1 through 732.4 of this part are useful in determining 
the license requirements that apply to you. Other portions of the EAR 
impose other obligations and requirements. Some of them are:

[[Page 213]]

    (a) Requirements relating to the use of a license in Sec. 758.4 of 
the EAR.
    (b) Obligations of carriers, forwarders, exporters and others to 
take specific steps and prepare and deliver certain documents to assure 
that items subject to the EAR are delivered to the destination to which 
they are licensed or authorized by a License Exception or some other 
provision of the regulations in Sec. 758.1 through Sec. 758.6 of the 
EAR.
    (c) Duty of carriers to return or unload shipments at the direction 
of U.S. Government officials (see Sec. 758.8 of the EAR).
    (d) Specific obligations imposed on parties to Special Comprehensive 
licenses in part 752 of the EAR.
    (e) Recordkeeping requirements imposed in part 762 of the EAR.
    (f) Requirements of part 764 of the EAR to disclose facts that may 
come to your attention after you file a license application or make 
other statements to the government concerning a transaction or proposed 
transaction that is subject to the EAR.
    (g) Certain obligations imposed by part 760 of the EAR on parties 
who receive requests to take actions related to foreign boycotts and 
prohibits certain actions relating to those boycotts.

Supplement No. 3 to Part 732--BXA's ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance and 
                                Red Flags

                     ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance

    Various requirements of the EAR are dependent upon a person's 
knowledge of the end-use, end-user, ultimate destination, or other facts 
relating to a transaction or activity. These provisions include the 
nonproliferation-related ``catch-all'' sections and the prohibition 
against proceeding with a transaction with knowledge that a violation of 
the EAR has occurred or is about to occur.
    (a) BXA provides the following guidance on how individuals and firms 
should act under this knowledge standard. This guidance does not change 
or interpret the EAR.
    (1) Decide whether there are ``red flags''. Take into account any 
abnormal circumstances in a transaction that indicate that the export 
may be destined for an inappropriate end-use, end-user, or destination. 
Such circumstances are referred to as ``red flags''. Included among 
examples of red flags are orders for items that are inconsistent with 
the needs of the purchaser, a customer declining installation and 
testing when included in the sales price or when normally requested, or 
requests for equipment configurations that are incompatible with the 
stated destination (e.g., 120 volts in a country with 220 volts). 
Commerce has developed lists of such red flags that are not all-
inclusive but are intended to illustrate the types of circumstances that 
should cause reasonable suspicion that a transaction will violate the 
EAR.
    (2) If there are ``red flags'', inquire. If there are no ``red 
flags'' in the information that comes to your firm, you should be able 
to proceed with a transaction in reliance on information you have 
received. That is, absent ``red flags'' (or an express requirement in 
the EAR), there is no affirmative duty upon exporters to inquire, 
verify, or otherwise ``go behind'' the customer's representations. 
However, when ``red flags'' are raised in information that comes to your 
firm, you have a duty to check out the suspicious circumstances and 
inquire about the end-use, end-user, or ultimate country of destination. 
The duty to check out ``red flags'' is not confined to the use of 
License Exceptions affected by the ``know'' or ``reason to know'' 
language in the EAR. Applicants for licenses are required by part 748 of 
the EAR to obtain documentary evidence concerning the transaction, and 
misrepresentation or concealment of material facts is prohibited, both 
in the licensing process and in all export control documents. You can 
rely upon representations from your customer and repeat them in the 
documents you file unless red flags oblige you to take verification 
steps.
    (3) Do not self-blind. Do not cut off the flow of information that 
comes to your firm in the normal course of business. For example, do not 
instruct the sales force to tell potential customers to refrain from 
discussing the actual end-use, end-user, and ultimate country of 
destination for the product your firm is seeking to sell. Do not put on 
blinders that prevent the learning of relevant information. An 
affirmative policy of steps to avoid ``bad'' information would not 
insulate a company from liability, and it would usually be considered an 
aggravating factor in an enforcement proceeding.
    (4) Employees need to know how to handle ``red flags''. Knowledge 
possessed by an employee of a company can be imputed to a firm so as to 
make it liable for a violation. This makes it important for firms to 
establish clear policies and effective compliance procedures to ensure 
that such knowledge about transactions can be evaluated by responsible 
senior officials. Failure to do so could be regarded as a form of self-
blinding.
    (5) Reevaluate all the information after the inquiry. The purpose of 
this inquiry and reevaluation is to determine whether the ``red flags'' 
can be explained or justified. If they can, you may proceed with the 
transaction. If the ``red flags'' cannot be explained or justified and 
you proceed, you run the risk of having had ``knowledge'' that would 
make your action a violation of the EAR.
    (6) Refrain from the transaction or advise BXA and wait. If you 
continue to have reasons for concern after your inquiry, then you should 
either refrain from the transaction or submit all the relevant 
information to BXA in the form of an application for a license or in 
such other form as BXA may specify.
    (b) Industry has an important role to play in preventing exports and 
reexports contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests 
of the United States. BXA will continue to work in partnership with 
industry to make this front line of defense effective, while minimizing 
the regulatory burden on exporters. If you have any question about 
whether you have encountered a ``red flag'', you may contact the Office 
of Export Enforcement at 1-800-424-2980 or the Office of Exporter 
Services at (202) 482-4532.

                                Red Flags

    Possible indicators that an unlawful diversion might be planned by 
your customer include the following:
    1. The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant to offer 
information about the end-use of a product.
    2. The product's capabilities do not fit the buyer's line of 
business; for example, a small bakery places an order for several 
sophisticated lasers.
    3. The product ordered is incompatible with the technical level of 
the country to

[[Page 217]]

which the product is being shipped. For example, semiconductor 
manufacturing equipment would be of little use in a country without an 
electronics industry.
    4. The customer has little or no business background.
    5. The customer is willing to pay cash for a very expensive item 
when the terms of the sale call for financing.
    6. The customer is unfamiliar with the product's performance 
characteristics but still wants the product.
    7. Routine installation, training or maintenance services are 
declined by the customer.
    8. Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are planned for out-of-
the-way destinations.
    9. A freight forwarding firm is listed as the product's final 
destination.
    10. The shipping route is abnormal for the product and destination.
    11. Packaging is inconsistent with the stated method of shipment or 
destination.
    12. When questioned, the buyer is evasive or unclear about whether 
the purchased product is for domestic use, export or reexport.

<R05>
Sec. 734.1  Introduction.

    (a) In this part, references to the Export Administration 
Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. 
This part describes the scope of the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) and explains certain key terms and principles used in the EAR. 
This part provides the rules you need to use to determine whether items 
and activities are subject to the EAR. This part is the first step in 
determining your obligations under the EAR. If your item or activity is 
not subject to the EAR, then you do not have any obligations under the 
EAR and you do not need to review other parts of the EAR. If you already 
know that your item or activity is subject to the EAR, you do not need 
to review this part and you can go on to review other parts of the EAR 
to determine your obligations. This part also describes certain key 
terms and principles used in the EAR. Specifically, it includes the 
following terms: ``subject to the EAR,'' ``items subject to the EAR,'' 
``export,'' and ``reexport.'' These and other terms are also included in 
part 772 of the EAR, Definitions of Terms, and you should consult part 
772 of the EAR for the meaning of terms used in the EAR. Finally, this 
part makes clear that compliance with the EAR does not relieve any 
obligations imposed under foreign laws.
    (b) This part does not address any of the provisions set forth in 
part 760 of the EAR, Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts.
    (c) This part does not define the scope of legal authority to 
regulate exports, including reexports, or activities found in the Export 
Administration Act and other statutes. What this part does do is set 
forth the extent to which such legal authority has been exercised 
through the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 734.2  Important EAR terms and principles.

    (a) Subject to the EAR--Definition. (1) ``Subject to the EAR'' is a 
term used in the EAR to describe those items and activities over which 
BXA exercises regulatory jurisdiction under the EAR.

[[Page 218]]

Conversely, items and activities that are not subject to the EAR are 
outside the regulatory jurisdiction of the EAR and are not affected by 
these regulations. The items and activities subject to the EAR are 
described in Sec. 734.2 through Sec. 734.5 of this part. You should 
review the Commerce Control List (CCL) and any applicable parts of the 
EAR to determine whether an item or activity is subject to the EAR. 
However, if you need help in determining whether an item or activity is 
subject to the EAR, see Sec. 734.6 of this part. Publicly available 
technology and software not subject to the EAR are described in 
Sec. 734.7 through Sec. 734.11 and Supplement No. 1 to this part.
    (2) Items and activities subject to the EAR may also be controlled 
under export-related programs administered by other agencies. Items and 
activities subject to the EAR are not necessarily exempted from the 
control programs of other agencies. Although BXA and other agencies that 
maintain controls for national security and foreign policy reasons try 
to minimize overlapping jurisdiction, you should be aware that in some 
instances you may have to comply with more than one regulatory program.
    (3) The term ``subject to the EAR'' should not be confused with 
licensing or other requirements imposed in other parts of the EAR. Just 
because an item or activity is subject to the EAR does not mean that a 
license or other requirement automatically applies. A license or other 
requirement applies only in those cases where other parts of the EAR 
impose a licensing or other requirement on such items or activities.
    (b) Export and reexport--(1) Definition of export. ``Export'' means 
an actual shipment or transmission of items subject to the EAR out of 
the United States, or release of technology or software subject to the 
EAR to a foreign national in the United States, as described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. See paragraph (b)(9) of this 
section for the definition that applies to exports of encryption source 
code and object code software subject to the EAR.
    (2) Export of technology or software. (See paragraph (b)(9) for 
provisions that apply to encryption source code and object code 
software.) ``Export'' of technology or software, excluding encryption 
software subject to ``EI'' controls, includes:
    (i) Any release of technology or software subject to the EAR in a 
foreign country; or
    (ii) Any release of technology or source code subject to the EAR to 
a foreign national. Such release is deemed to be an export to the home 
country or countries of the foreign national. This deemed export rule 
does not apply to persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence in 
the United States and does not apply to persons who are protected 
individuals under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 
1324b(a)(3)). Note that the release of any item to any party with 
knowledge a violation is about to occur is prohibited by 
Sec. 736.2(b)(10) of the EAR.
    (3) Definition of ``release'' of technology or software. Technology 
or software is ``released'' for export through:
    (i) Visual inspection by foreign nationals of U.S.-origin equipment 
and facilities;
    (ii) Oral exchanges of information in the United States or abroad; 
or
    (iii) The application to situations abroad of personal knowledge or 
technical experience acquired in the United States.
    (4) Definition of reexport. ``Reexport'' means an actual shipment or 
transmission of items subject to the EAR from one foreign country to 
another foreign country; or release of technology or software subject to 
the EAR to a foreign national outside the United States, as described in 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (5) Reexport of technology or software. Any release of technology or 
source code subject to the EAR to a foreign national of another country 
is a deemed reexport to the home country or countries of the foreign 
national. However, this deemed reexport definition does not apply to 
persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The term ``release'' 
is defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Note that the release of 
any item to any party with

[[Page 219]]

knowledge or reason to know a violation is about to occur is prohibited 
by Sec. 736.2(b)(10) of the EAR.
    (6) For purposes of the EAR, the export or reexport of items subject 
to the EAR that will transit through a country or countries or be 
transshipped in a country or countries to a new country or are intended 
for reexport to the new country, are deemed to be exports to the new 
country.
    (7) If a territory, possession, or department of a foreign country 
is not listed on the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of 
the EAR, the export or reexport of items subject to the EAR to such 
destination is deemed under the EAR to be an export to the foreign 
country. For example, a shipment to the Cayman Islands, a dependent 
territory of the United Kingdom, is deemed to be a shipment to the 
United Kingdom.
    (8) Export or reexport of items subject to the EAR does not include 
shipments among any of the states of the United States, the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or 
any territory, dependency, or possession of the United States. These 
destinations are listed in Schedules C & E, Classification of Country 
and Territory Designations for U.S. Export Statistics, issued by the 
Bureau of the Census.
    (9) Export of encryption source code and object code software. (i) 
For purposes of the EAR, the export of encryption source code and object 
code software means:
    (A) An actual shipment, transfer, or transmission out of the United 
States (see also paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section); or
    (B) A transfer of such software in the United States to an embassy 
or affiliate of a foreign country.
    (ii) The export of encryption source code and object code software 
controlled for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control 
List (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR), except for source 
code eligible for export under Secs. 740.13(e) and 740.17(a)(5)(i), 
includes downloading, or causing the downloading of, such software to 
locations (including electronic bulletin boards, Internet file transfer 
protocol, and World Wide Web sites) outside the U.S., or making such 
software available for transfer outside the United States, over wire, 
cable, radio, electromagnetic, photo optical, photoelectric or other 
comparable communications facilities accessible to persons outside the 
United States, including transfers from electronic bulletin boards, 
Internet file transfer protocol and World Wide Web sites, unless the 
person making the software available takes precautions adequate to 
prevent unauthorized transfer of such code.
    (iii) Subject to the General Prohibitions described in part 736 of 
the EAR, such precautions for Internet transfers of products eligible 
for export under Secs. 740.17(a)(2) (encryption software products), 
(a)(5)(ii) (certain encryption source code) and (a)(5)(iii) (encryption 
toolkits) shall include such measures as:
    (A) The access control system, either through automated means or 
human intervention, checks the address of every system outside of the 
U.S. or Canada requesting or receiving a transfer and verifies such 
systems do not have a domain name or Internet address of a foreign 
government end-user (e.g., ``.gov,'' ``.gouv,'' ``.mil'' or similar 
addresses);
    (B) The access control system provides every requesting or receiving 
party with notice that the transfer includes or would include 
cryptographic software subject to export controls under the Export 
Administration Regulations, and anyone receiving such a transfer cannot 
export the software without a license or other authorization; and
    (C) Every party requesting or receiving a transfer of such software 
must acknowledge affirmatively that the software is not intended for use 
by a government end-user, as defined in part 772, and he or she 
understands the cryptographic software is subject to export controls 
under the Export Administration Regulations and anyone receiving the 
transfer cannot export the software without a license or other 
authorization. BXA will consider acknowledgments in electronic form 
provided they

[[Page 220]]

are adequate to assure legal undertakings similar to written 
acknowledgments.

Sec. 734.3  Items subject to the EAR.

    (a) Except for items excluded in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
following items are subject to the EAR:
    (1) All items in the United States, including in a U.S. Foreign 
Trade Zone or moving intransit through the United States from one 
foreign country to another;
    (2) All U.S. origin items wherever located;
    (3) U.S. origin parts, components, materials or other commodities 
incorporated abroad into foreign-made products, U.S. origin software 
commingled with foreign software, and U.S. origin technology commingled 
with foreign technology, in quantities exceeding de minimis levels as 
described in Sec. 734.4 and Supplement No. 2 of this part;
    (4) Certain foreign-made direct products of U.S. origin technology 
or software, as described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR. The term 
``direct product'' means the immediate product (including processes and 
services) produced directly by the use of technology or software; and
    (5) Certain commodities produced by any plant or major component of 
a plant located outside the United States that is a direct product of 
U.S.-origin technology or software, as described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of 
the EAR.
    (b) The following items are not subject to the EAR:
    (1) Items that are exclusively controlled for export or reexport by 
the following departments and agencies of the U.S. Government which 
regulate exports or reexports for national security or foreign policy 
purposes:
    (i) Department of State. The International Traffic in Arms 
Regulations (22 CFR part 121) administered by the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls relate to defense articles and defense services on the 
U.S. Munitions List. Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 
U.S.C. 2778).
    (ii) Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). 
Regulations administered by OFAC implement broad controls and embargo 
transactions with certain foreign countries. These regulations include 
controls on exports and reexports to certain countries (31 CFR chapter 
V). Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. app. section 1 et seq.), and 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.)
    (iii) U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Regulations 
administered by NRC control the export and reexport of commodities 
related to nuclear reactor vessels (10 CFR part 110). Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. part 2011 et seq.).
    (iv) Department of Energy (DOE). Regulations administered by DOE 
control the export and reexport of technology related to the production 
of special nuclear materials (10 CFR part 810). Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. section 2011 et seq.).
    (v) Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Regulations administered by 
PTO provide for the export to a foreign country of unclassified 
technology in the form of a patent application or an amendment, 
modification, or supplement thereto or division thereof (37 CFR part 5). 
BXA has delegated authority under the Export Administration Act to the 
PTO to approve exports and reexports of such technology which is subject 
to the EAR. Exports and reexports of such technology not approved under 
PTO regulations must comply with the EAR.
    (2) Prerecorded phonograph records reproducing in whole or in part, 
the content of printed books, pamphlets, and miscellaneous publications, 
including newspapers and periodicals; printed books, pamphlets, and 
miscellaneous publications including bound newspapers and periodicals; 
children's picture and painting books; newspaper and periodicals, 
unbound, excluding waste; music books; sheet music; calendars and 
calendar blocks, paper; maps, hydrographical charts, atlases, 
gazetteers, globe covers, and globes (terrestrial and celestial); 
exposed and developed microfilm reproducing, in whole or in part, the 
content of any of the above; exposed and developed motion picture film 
and soundtrack; and

[[Page 221]]

advertising printed matter exclusively related thereto.
    (3) Publicly available technology and software, except software 
controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List, 
that:
    (i) Are already published or will be published as described in 
Sec. 734.7 of this part;
    (ii) Arise during, or result from, fundamental research, as 
described in Sec. 734.8 of this part;
    (iii) Are educational, as described in Sec. 734.9 of this part;
    (iv) Are included in certain patent applications, as described in 
Sec. 734.10 of this part.

    Note to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section:
    A printed book or other printed material setting forth encryption 
source code is not itself subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). 
However, notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2), encryption source code in 
electronic form or media (e.g., computer diskette or CD ROM) remains 
subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(3)).

    (4) Foreign made items that have greater than the de minimis U.S. 
content based on the principles described in Sec. 734.4 of this part.
    (c) ``Items subject to the EAR'' consist of the items listed on the 
Commerce Control List (CCL) in part 774 of the EAR and all other items 
which meet the definition of that term. For ease of reference and 
classification purposes, items subject to the EAR which are not listed 
on the CCL are designated as ``EAR99.''

[61 FR 12746, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 65464, Dec. 13, 1996; 
61 FR 68578, Dec. 30, 1996; 62 FR 25456, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 734.4  De minimis U.S. content.

    (a) There is no de minimis level for the export from a foreign 
country of a foreign-made computer exceeding 28,000 MTOPS containing 
U.S.-origin controlled semiconductors (other than memory circuits) 
classified under ECCN 3A001 or high speed interconnect devices (ECCN 
4A003.g) to Computer Tier 3 and 4 countries described in Sec. 742.12 of 
the EAR.
    (b) There is no de minimis level for items controlled for EI reasons 
under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002 and 5E002 absent written authorization from 
BXA. Exporters may, as part of a classification request, ask that 
software controlled under ECCN 5D002 and eligible for export under the 
``retail'' or ``source code'' provisions of license exception ENC, and 
parts and components controlled under ECCN 5A002, be made eligible for 
de minimis treatment. The review of de minimis eligibility will take 
into account national security interests.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section for 
certain computers and items controlled for EI reasons, the following 
reexports are not subject to the EAR when made to either an embargoed 
country listed in part 746 of the EAR or to a terrorist-supporting 
country listed in Country Group E:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of 
the EAR):
    (1) Reexports of a foreign-made commodity incorporating controlled 
U.S.-origin commodities valued at 10% or less of the total value of the 
foreign-made commodity;
    (2) Reexports of foreign-made software incorporating controlled 
U.S.-origin software valued at 10% or less of the total value of the 
foreign-made software; or
    (3) Reexports of foreign technology commingled with or drawn from 
controlled U.S.-origin technology valued at 10% or less of the total 
value of the foreign technology.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section for certain 
computers, for all other countries not included in paragraph (b) of this 
section the following reexports are not subject to the EAR:
    (1) Reexports of a foreign-made commodity incorporating controlled 
U.S.-origin commodities valued at 25% or less of the total value of the 
foreign-made commodity;
    (2) Reexports of foreign-made software incorporating controlled 
U.S.-origin software valued at 25% or less of the total value of the 
foreign-made software; or
    (3) Reexports of foreign technology commingled with or drawn from 
controlled U.S.-origin technology valued at 25% or less of the total 
value of the foreign technology.
    (e) For purposes of determining de minimis levels, technology and 
source code used to design or produce foreign-

[[Page 222]]

made commodities or software are not considered to be incorporated into 
such foreign-made commodities or software. Commodities subject only to 
short supply controls are not included in calculating U.S. content.
    (f) You are responsible for making the necessary calculations to 
determine whether the de minimis provisions apply to your situation. See 
Supplement No. 2 to part 734 for guidance regarding calculation of U.S. 
controlled content.
    (g) See Sec. 770.3 of the EAR for principles that apply to 
commingled U.S.-origin technology and software.
    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, U.S.-origin technology controlled by ECCN 9E003a.1 through 
a.12, and .f, and related controls, and encryption software controlled 
for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5D002 or encryption technology controlled 
for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5E002 do not lose their U.S.-origin when 
redrawn, used, consulted, or otherwise commingled abroad in any respect 
with other software or technology of any other origin. Therefore, any 
subsequent or similar software or technology prepared or engineered 
abroad for the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of any 
plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is based on or uses any such 
U.S.-origin software or technology is subject to the EAR.

Sec. 734.5  Activities of U.S. and foreign persons subject to the EAR.

    The following kinds of activities are subject to the EAR:
    (a) Certain activities of U.S. persons related to the proliferation 
of nuclear explosive devices, chemical or biological weapons, missile 
technology as described in Sec. 744.6 of the EAR, and the proliferation 
of chemical weapons as described in part 745 of the EAR.
    (b) Activities of U.S. or foreign persons prohibited by any order 
issued under the EAR, including a Denial Order issued pursuant to part 
766 of the EAR.
    (c) Technical assistance by U.S. persons with respect to encryption 
commodities or software as described in Sec. 744.9 of the EAR.

<R05>
Sec. 734.6  Assistance available from BXA for determining licensing and other requirements.

    (a) If you are not sure whether a commodity, software, technology, 
or activity is subject to the EAR, or is subject to licensing or other 
requirements under the EAR, you may ask BXA for an advisory opinion, 
classification, or a determination whether a particular item or activity 
is subject to the EAR. In many instances, including those where the item 
is specially designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for 
military application, the item may fall under the licensing jurisdiction 
of the Department of State and may be subject to the controls of the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) 
(ITAR). In order to determine if the Department of State has licensing 
jurisdiction over an item, you should submit a request for a commodity 
jurisdiction determination to the Department of State, Office of Defense 
Trade Controls. Exporters should note that in a very limited number of 
cases, the categories of items may be subject to both the ITAR and the 
EAR. The relevant departments are working to eliminate any unnecessary 
overlaps that may exist.
    (b) As the agency responsible for administering the EAR, BXA is the 
only agency that has the responsibility for determining whether an item 
or activity is subject to the EAR and, if so, what licensing or other 
requirements apply under the EAR. Such a determination only affects EAR 
requirements, and does not affect the applicability of any other 
regulatory programs.
    (c) If you need help in determining BXA licensing or other 
requirements you may ask BXA for help by following the procedures 
described in Sec. 748.3 of the EAR.

<R05>
Sec. 734.7  Published information and software.

    (a) Information is ``published'' when it becomes generally 
accessible to the interested public in any form, including:
    (1) Publication in periodicals, books, print, electronic, or any 
other media available for general distribution to any member of the 
public or to a community of persons interested in the subject matter, 
such as those in a scientific or engineering discipline, either free or 
at a price that does not exceed the cost of reproduction and 
distribution (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions A(1) through 
A(6));
    (2) Ready availability at libraries open to the public or at 
university libraries (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question A(6));
    (3) Patents and open (published) patent applications available at 
any patent office; and
    (4) Release at an open conference, meeting, seminar, trade show, or 
other open gathering.
    (i) A conference or gathering is ``open'' if all technically 
qualified members of the public are eligible to attend and attendees are 
permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record (not 
necessarily a recording) of the proceedings and presentations.
    (ii) All technically qualified members of the public may be 
considered eligible to attend a conference or other gathering 
notwithstanding a registration fee reasonably related to cost and 
reflecting an intention that all interested and technically qualified 
persons be able to attend, or a limitation on actual attendance, as long 
as attendees either are the first who have applied or are selected on 
the basis of relevant scientific or technical competence, experience, or 
responsibility (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions B(1) 
through B(6)).
    (iii) ``Publication'' includes submission of papers to domestic or 
foreign editors or reviewers of journals, or to organizers of open 
conferences or other open gatherings, with the understanding that the 
papers will be made publicly available if favorably received. (See 
Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions A(1) and A(3)).
    (b) Software and information is published when it is available for 
general distribution either for free or at a price that does not exceed 
the cost of reproduction and distribution. See Supplement No. 1 to this 
part, Questions G(1) through G(3).
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, note 
that encryption software controlled under ECCN 5D002 for ``EI'' reasons 
on the Commerce Control List (refer to Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of 
the EAR) remains subject to the EAR (refer to Secs. 740.13(e) and 
740.17(a)(5)(i) of the EAR for release under license exception).

Sec. 734.8  Information resulting from fundamental research.

    (a) Fundamental research. Paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section 
and Sec. 734.11 of this part provide specific rules that will be used to 
determine whether research in particular institutional contexts 
qualifies as ``fundamental research''. The intent behind these rules is 
to identify as ``fundamental research'' basic and applied research in 
science and engineering, where the resulting information is ordinarily 
published and shared broadly within the scientific community. Such 
research can be distinguished from proprietary research and from 
industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the 
results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary reasons or 
specific national security reasons as defined in Sec. 734.11(b) of this 
part. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question D(8)). Note that the 
provisions of this section do not apply to encryption software 
controlled under ECCN 5D002 for ``EI'' reasons on the Commerce Control 
List (refer to Secs. 740.13(e) and 740.17(a)(5)(i) of the EAR for 
release under license exception).
    (b) University based research. (1) Research conducted by scientists, 
engineers, or students at a university normally will be considered 
fundamental research, as described in paragraphs (b) (2) through (6) of 
this section. (``University'' means any accredited institution of higher 
education located in the United States.)

[[Page 224]]

    (2) Prepublication review by a sponsor of university research solely 
to insure that the publication would not inadvertently divulge 
proprietary information that the sponsor has furnished to the 
researchers does not change the status of the research as fundamental 
research. However, release of information from a corporate sponsor to 
university researchers where the research results are subject to 
prepublication review, is subject to the EAR. (See Supplement No. 1 to 
this part, Questions D(7), D(9), and D(10).)
    (3) Prepublication review by a sponsor of university research solely 
to ensure that publication would not compromise patent rights does not 
change the status of fundamental research, so long as the review causes 
no more than a temporary delay in publication of the research results.
    (4) The initial transfer of information from an industry sponsor to 
university researchers is subject to the EAR where the parties have 
agreed that the sponsor may withhold from publication some or all of the 
information so provided. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question 
D(2).)
    (5) University based research is not considered ``fundamental 
research'' if the university or its researchers accept (at the request, 
for example, of an industrial sponsor) other restrictions on publication 
of scientific and technical information resulting from the project or 
activity. Scientific and technical information resulting from the 
research will nonetheless qualify as fundamental research once all such 
restrictions have expired or have been removed. (See Supplement No. 1 to 
this part, Question D(7) and D(9).)
    (6) The provisions of Sec. 734.11 of this part will apply if a 
university or its researchers accept specific national security controls 
(as defined in Sec. 734.11 of this part) on a research project or 
activity sponsored by the U.S. Government. (See Supplement No. 1 to this 
part, Questions E(1) and E(2).)
    (c) Research based at Federal agencies or FFRDCs. Research conducted 
by scientists or engineers working for a Federal agency or a Federally 
Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) may be designated as 
``fundamental research'' within any appropriate system devised by the 
agency or the FFRDC to control the release of information by such 
scientists and engineers. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions 
D(8) and D(11).)
    (d) Corporate research. (1) Research conducted by scientists or 
engineers working for a business entity will be considered ``fundamental 
research'' at such time and to the extent that the researchers are free 
to make scientific and technical information resulting from the research 
publicly available without restriction or delay based on proprietary 
concerns or specific national security controls as defined in 
Sec. 734.11(b) of this part.
    (2) Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that the 
publication would compromise no proprietary information provided by the 
company to the researchers is not considered to be a proprietary 
restriction under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. However, paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section does not authorize the release of information to 
university researchers where the research results are subject to 
prepublication review. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions 
D(8), D(9), and D(10).)
    (3) Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that 
prepublication would compromise no patent rights will not be considered 
a proprietary restriction for this purpose, so long as the review causes 
no more than a temporary delay in publication of the research results.
    (4) However, the initial transfer of information from a business 
entity to researchers is not authorized under the ``fundamental 
research'' provision where the parties have agreed that the business 
entity may withhold from publication some or all of the information so 
provided.
    (e) Research based elsewhere. Research conducted by scientists or 
engineers who are not working for any of the institutions described in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section will be treated as corporate 
research, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. (See Supplement 
No. 1 to this part, Question D(8).)

Sec. 734.9  Educational information.

    ``Educational information'' referred to in Sec. 734.3(b)(3)(iii) of 
this part is not subject to the EAR if it is released by instruction in 
catalog courses and associated teaching laboratories of academic 
institutions. Dissertation research is discussed in Sec. 734.8(b) of 
this part. (Refer to Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question C(1) 
through C(6)). Note that the provisions of this section do not apply to 
encryption software controlled under ECCN 5D002 for ``EI'' reasons on 
the Commerce Control List (refer to Secs. 740.13(e) and 740.17(a)(5)(i) 
of the EAR for release under license exception).

<R05>
Sec. 734.10  Patent applications.

    The information referred to in Sec. 734.3(b)(3)(iv) of this part is:
    (a) Information contained in a patent application prepared wholly 
from foreign-origin technical data where the application is being sent 
to the foreign inventor to be executed and returned to the United States 
for subsequent filing in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office;
    (b) Information contained in a patent application, or an amendment, 
modification, supplement or division of an application, and authorized 
for filing in a foreign country in accordance with the regulations of 
the Patent and Trademark Office, 37 CFR part 5; <SUP>1</SUP> or
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Regulations issued by the Patent and Trademark Office in 37 CFR 
part 5 provide for the export to a foreign country of unclassified 
technical data in the form of a patent application or an amendment, 
modification, or supplement thereto or division thereof.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Information contained in a patent application when sent to a 
foreign country before or within six months after the filing of a United 
States patent application for the purpose of obtaining the signature of 
an inventor who was in the United States when the invention was made or 
who is a co-inventor with a person residing in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 734.11  Government-sponsored research covered by contract controls.

    (a) If research is funded by the U.S. Government, and specific 
national security controls are agreed on to protect information 
resulting from the research, Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of this part will not 
apply to any export or reexport of such information in violation of such 
controls. However, any export or reexport of information resulting from 
the research that is consistent with the specific controls may 
nonetheless be made under this provision.
    (b) Examples of ``specific national security controls'' include 
requirements for prepublication review by the Government, with right to 
withhold permission for publication; restrictions on prepublication 
dissemination of information to non-U.S. citizens or other categories of 
persons; or restrictions on participation of non-U.S. citizens or other 
categories of persons in the research. A general reference to one or 
more export control laws or regulations or a general reminder that the 
Government retains the right to classify is not a ``specific national 
security control''. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions E(1) 
and E(2).)


<R05>
Sec. 734.12  Effect on foreign laws and regulations.

    Any person who complies with any of the license or other 
requirements of the EAR is not relieved of the responsibility of 
complying with applicable foreign laws and regulations. Conversely, any 
person who complies with the license or other requirements of a foreign 
law or regulation is not relieved of the responsibility of complying 
with U.S. laws and regulations, including the EAR.

  Supplement No. 1 to Part 734--Questions and Answers--Technology and 
                       Software Subject to the EAR

    This Supplement No. 1 contains explanatory questions and answers 
relating to technology and software that is subject to the EAR. It is 
intended to give the public guidance in understanding how BXA interprets 
this part, but is only illustrative, not comprehensive. In addition, 
facts or circumstances that differ in any material way

[[Page 226]]

from those set forth in the questions or answers will be considered 
under the applicable provisions of the EAR. Exporters should note that 
the provisions of this supplement do not apply to encryption software 
(including source code) transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the 
Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 
(61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date. 
See Sec. 742.15 of the EAR. This supplement is divided into nine 
sections according to topic as follows:
    Section A: Publication of technology and exports and reexports of 
technology that has been or will be published.
    Section B: Release of technology at conferences.
    Section C: Educational instruction.
    Section D: Research, correspondence, and informal scientific 
exchanges.
    Section E: Federal contract controls.
    Section F: Commercial consulting.
    Section G: Software.
    Section H: Availability in a public library.
    Section I: Miscellaneous.

                         Section A: Publication

    Question A(1): I plan to publish in a foreign journal a scientific 
paper describing the results of my research, which is in an area listed 
in the EAR as requiring a license to all countries except Canada. Do I 
need a license to send a copy to my publisher abroad?
    Answer: No. This export transaction is not subject to the EAR. The 
EAR do not cover technology that is already publicly available, as well 
as technology that is made public by the transaction in question 
(Secs. 734.3 and 734.7 of this part). Your research results would be 
made public by the planned publication. You would not need a license.
    Question A(2): Would the answer differ depending on where I work or 
where I performed the research?
    Answer: No. Of course, the result would be different if your 
employer or another sponsor of your research imposed restrictions on its 
publication (Sec. 734.8 of this part).
    Question (A)3: Would I need a license to send the paper to the 
editors of a foreign journal for review to determine whether it will be 
accepted for publication?
    Answer: No. This export transaction is not subject to the EAR 
because you are submitting the paper to the editors with the intention 
that the paper will be published if favorably received 
(Sec. 734.7(a)(4)(iii) of this part).
    Question A(4): The research on which I will be reporting in my paper 
is supported by a grant from the Department of Energy (DOE). The grant 
requires prepublication clearance by DOE. Does that make any difference 
under the Export Administration Regulations?
    Answer: No, the transaction is not subject to the EAR. But if you 
published in violation of any Department of Energy controls you have 
accepted in the grant, you may be subject to appropriate administrative, 
civil, or criminal sanctions under other laws.
    Question A(5): We provide consulting services on the design, layout, 
and construction of integrated circuit plants and production lines. A 
major part of our business is the publication for sale to clients of 
detailed handbooks and reference manuals on key aspects on the design 
and manufacturing processes. A typical cost of publishing such a 
handbook and manual might be $500; the typical sales price is about 
$15,000. Is the publication and sale of such handbooks or manuals 
subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Yes. The price is above the cost of reproduction and 
distribution (Sec. 734.7(a)(1) of this part). Thus, you would need to 
obtain a license or qualify for a License Exception before you could 
export or reexport any of these handbooks or manuals.
    Question A(6): My Ph.D. thesis is on technology, listed in the EAR 
as requiring a license to all destinations except Canada, which has 
never been published for general distribution. However, the thesis is 
available at the institution from which I took the degree. Do I need a 
license to send another copy to a colleague overseas?
    Answer: That may depend on where in the institution it is available. 
If it is not readily available in the university library (e.g., by 
filing in open stacks with a reference in the catalog), it is not 
``publicly available'' and the export or reexport would be subject to 
the EAR on that ground. The export or reexport would not be subject to 
the EAR if your Ph.D. research qualified as ``fundamental research'' 
under Sec. 734.8 of this part. If not, however, you will need to obtain 
a license or qualify for a License Exception before you can send a copy 
out of the country.
    Question A(7): We sell electronically recorded information, 
including software and databases, at wholesale and retail. Our products 
are available by mail order to any member of the public, though intended 
for specialists in various fields. They are priced to maximize sales to 
persons in those fields. Do we need a license to sell our products to 
foreign customers?
    Answer: You would not need a license for otherwise controlled 
technology or software if the technology and software are made publicly 
available at a price that does not exceed the cost of production and 
distribution to the technical community. Even if priced at a higher 
level, the export or reexport of the technology or software source code 
in a library accessible to the public is not subject to the EAR 
(Sec. 734.7(a) of this part).

[[Page 227]]

                         Section B: Conferences

    Question B(1): I have been invited to give a paper at a prestigious 
international scientific conference on a subject listed as requiring a 
license under the EAR to all countries, except Canada. Scientists in the 
field are given an opportunity to submit applications to attend. 
Invitations are given to those judged to be the leading researchers in 
the field, and attendance is by invitation only. Attendees will be free 
to take notes, but not make electronic or verbatim recordings of the 
presentations or discussions. Some of the attendees will be foreigners. 
Do I need a license to give my paper?
    Answer: No. Release of information at an open conference and 
information that has been released at an open conference is not subject 
to the EAR. The conference you describe fits the definition of an open 
conference (Sec. 734.7(a) of this part).
    Question B(2): Would it make any difference if there were a 
prohibition on making any notes or other personal record of what 
transpires at the conference?
    Answer: Yes. To qualify as an ``open'' conference, attendees must be 
permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record (although 
not necessarily a recording). If note taking or the making of personal 
records is altogether prohibited, the conference would not be considered 
``open''.
    Question B(3): Would it make any difference if there were also a 
registration fee?
    Answer: That would depend on whether the fee is reasonably related 
to costs and reflects an intention that all interested and technically 
qualified persons should be able to attend (Sec. 734.7(a)(4)(ii) of this 
part).
    Question B(4): Would it make any difference if the conference were 
to take place in another country?
    Answer: No.
    Question B(5): Must I have a license to send the paper I propose to 
present at such a foreign conference to the conference organizer for 
review?
    Answer: No. A license is not required under the EAR to submit papers 
to foreign organizers of open conferences or other open gatherings with 
the intention that the papers will be delivered at the conference, and 
so made publicly available, if favorably received. The submission of the 
papers is not subject to the EAR (Sec. 734.7(a)(4)(iii) of this part).
    Question B(6): Would the answers to any of the foregoing questions 
be different if my work were supported by the Federal Government?
    Answer: No. You may export and reexport the papers, even if the 
release of the paper violates any agreements you have made with your 
government sponsor. However, nothing in the EAR relieves you of 
responsibility for conforming to any controls you have agreed to in your 
Federal grant or contract.

                   Section C: Educational Instruction

    Question C(1): I teach a university graduate course on design and 
manufacture of very high-speed integrated circuitry. Many of the 
students are foreigners. Do I need a license to teach this course?
    Answer: No. Release of information by instruction in catalog courses 
and associated teaching laboratories of academic institutions is not 
subject to the EAR (Sec. 734.9 of this part).
    Question C(2): Would it make any difference if some of the students 
were from countries to which export licenses are required?
    Answer: No.
    Question C(3): Would it make any difference if I talk about recent 
and as yet unpublished results from my laboratory research?
    Answer: No.
    Question C(4): Even if that research is funded by the Government?
    Answer: Even then, but you would not be released from any separate 
obligations you have accepted in your grant or contract.
    Question C(5): Would it make any difference if I were teaching at a 
foreign university?
    Answer: No.
    Question C(6): We teach proprietary courses on design and 
manufacture of high-performance machine tools. Is the instruction in our 
classes subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Yes. That instruction would not qualify as ``release of 
educational information'' under Sec. 734.9 of this part because your 
proprietary business does not qualify as an ``academic institution'' 
within the meaning of Sec. 734.9 of this part. Conceivably, however, the 
instruction might qualify as ``release at an open * * * seminar, * * * 
or other open gathering'' under Sec. 734.7(a) of this part. The 
conditions for qualification of such a seminar or gathering as ``open'', 
including a fee ``reasonably related to costs (of the conference, not of 
producing the data) and reflecting an intention that all interested and 
technically qualified persons be able to attend,'' would have to be 
satisfied.

 Section D: Research, Correspondence, and Informal Scientific Exchanges

    Question D(1): Do I need a license in order for a foreign graduate 
student to work in my laboratory?
    Answer: Not if the research on which the foreign student is working 
qualifies as ``fundamental research'' under Sec. 734.8 of this part. In 
that case, the research is not subject to the EAR.
    Question D(2): Our company has entered into a cooperative research 
arrangement

[[Page 228]]

with a research group at a university. One of the researchers in that 
group is a PRC national. We would like to share some of our proprietary 
information with the university research group. We have no way of 
guaranteeing that this information will not get into the hands of the 
PRC scientist. Do we need to obtain a license to protect against that 
possibility?
    Answer: No. The EAR do not cover the disclosure of information to 
any scientists, engineers, or students at a U.S. university in the 
course of industry-university research collaboration under specific 
arrangements between the firm and the university, provided these 
arrangements do not permit the sponsor to withhold from publication any 
of the information that he provides to the researchers. However, if your 
company and the researchers have agreed to a prohibition on publication, 
then you must obtain a license or qualify for a License Exception before 
transferring the information to the university. It is important that you 
as the corporate sponsor and the university get together to discuss 
whether foreign nationals will have access to the information, so that 
you may obtain any necessary authorization prior to transferring the 
information to the research team.
    Question D(3): My university will host a prominent scientist from 
the PRC who is an expert on research in engineered ceramics and 
composite materials. Do I require a license before telling our visitor 
about my latest, as yet unpublished, research results in those fields?
    Answer: Probably not. If you performed your research at the 
university, and you were subject to no contract controls on release of 
the research, your research would qualify as ``fundamental research'' 
(Sec. 734.8(a) of this part). Information arising during or resulting 
from such research is not subject to the EAR (Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of this 
part).
    You should probably assume, however, that your visitor will be 
debriefed later about anything of potential military value he learns 
from you. If you are concerned that giving such information to him, even 
though permitted, could jeopardize U.S. security interests, the Commerce 
Department can put you in touch with appropriate Government scientists 
who can advise you. Write to Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export 
Administration, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
    Question D(4): Would it make any difference if I were proposing to 
talk with a PRC expert in China?
    Answer: No, if the information in question arose during or resulted 
from the same ``fundamental research.''
    Question D(5): Could I properly do some work with him in his 
research laboratory inside China?
    Answer: Application abroad of personal knowledge or technical 
experience acquired in the United States constitutes an export of that 
knowledge and experience, and such an export may be subject to the EAR. 
If any of the knowledge or experience you export in this way requires a 
license under the EAR, you must obtain such a license or qualify for a 
License Exception.
    Question D(6): I would like to correspond and share research results 
with an Iranian expert in my field, which deals with technology that 
requires a license to all destinations except Canada. Do I need a 
license to do so?
    Answer: Not as long as we are still talking about information that 
arose during or resulted from research that qualifies as ``fundamental'' 
under the rules spelled out in Sec. 734.8(a) of this part.
    Question D(7): Suppose the research in question were funded by a 
corporate sponsor and I had agreed to prepublication review of any paper 
arising from the research?
    Answer: Whether your research would still qualify as ``fundamental'' 
would depend on the nature and purpose of the prepublication review. If 
the review is intended solely to ensure that your publications will 
neither compromise patent rights nor inadvertently divulge proprietary 
information that the sponsor has furnished to you, the research could 
still qualify as ``fundamental.'' But if the sponsor will consider as 
part of its prepublication review whether it wants to hold your new 
research results as trade secrets or otherwise proprietary information 
(even if your voluntary cooperation would be needed for it to do so), 
your research would no longer qualify as ``fundamental.'' As used in 
these regulations it is the actual and intended openness of research 
results that primarily determines whether the research counts as 
``fundamental'' and so is not subject to the EAR.
    Question D(8): In determining whether research is thus open and 
therefore counts as ``fundamental,'' does it matter where or in what 
sort of institution the research is performed?
    Answer: In principle, no. ``Fundamental research'' is performed in 
industry, Federal laboratories, or other types of institutions, as well 
as in universities. The regulations introduce some operational 
presumptions and procedures that can be used both by those subject to 
the regulations and by those who administer them to determine with some 
precision whether a particular research activity is covered. Recognizing 
that common and predictable norms operate in different types of 
institutions, the regulations use the institutional locus of the 
research as a starting point for these presumptions and procedures. 
Nonetheless, it remains the type of research, and particularly the 
intent and freedom to publish, that identifies ``fundamental

[[Page 229]]

research,'' not the institutional locus (Sec. 734.8(a) of this part).
    Question D(9): I am doing research on high-powered lasers in the 
central basic-research laboratory of an industrial corporation. I am 
required to submit the results of my research for prepublication review 
before I can publish them or otherwise make them public. I would like to 
compare research results with a scientific colleague from Vietnam and 
discuss the results of the research with her when she visits the United 
States. Do I need a license to do so?
    Answer: You probably do need a license (Sec. 734.8(d) of this part). 
However, if the only restriction on your publishing any of that 
information is a prepublication review solely to ensure that publication 
would compromise no patent rights or proprietary information provided by 
the company to the researcher your research may be considered 
``fundamental research,'' in which case you may be able to share 
information because it is not subject to the EAR. Note that the 
information will be subject to the EAR if the prepublication review is 
intended to withhold the results of the research from publication.
    Question D(10): Suppose I have already cleared my company's review 
process and am free to publish all the information I intend to share 
with my colleague, though I have not yet published?
    Answer: If the clearance from your company means that you are free 
to make all the information publicly available without restriction or 
delay, the information is not subject to the EAR. (Sec. 734.8(d) of this 
part)
    Question D(11): I work as a researcher at a Government-owned, 
contractor-operated research center. May I share the results of my 
unpublished research with foreign nationals without concern for export 
controls under the EAR?
    Answer: That is up to the sponsoring agency and the center's 
management. If your research is designated ``fundamental research'' 
within any appropriate system devised by them to control release of 
information by scientists and engineers at the center, it will be 
treated as such by the Commerce Department, and the research will not be 
subject to the EAR. Otherwise, you would need to obtain a license or 
qualify for a License Exception, except to publish or otherwise make the 
information public (Sec. 734.8(c) of this part).

                  Section E: Federal Contract Controls

    Question E(1): In a contract for performance of research entered 
into with the Department of Defense (DOD), we have agreed to certain 
national security controls. DOD is to have ninety days to review any 
papers we proposed before they are published and must approve assignment 
of any foreign nationals to the project. The work in question would 
otherwise qualify as ``fundamental research'' section under Sec. 734.8 
of this part. Is the information arising during or resulting from this 
sponsored research subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Under Sec. 734.11 of this part, any export or reexport of 
information resulting from government-sponsored research that is 
inconsistent with contract controls you have agreed to will not qualify 
as ``fundamental research'' and any such export or reexport would be 
subject to the EAR. Any such export or reexport that is consistent with 
the controls will continue to be eligible for export and reexport under 
the ``fundamental research'' rule set forth in Sec. 734.8(a) of this 
part. Thus, if you abide by the specific controls you have agreed to, 
you need not be concerned about violating the EAR. If you violate those 
controls and export or reexport information as ``fundamental research'' 
under Sec. 734.8(a) of this part, you may subject yourself to the 
sanctions provided for under the EAR, including criminal sanctions, in 
addition to administrative and civil penalties for breach of contract 
under other law.
    Question E(2): Do the Export Administration Regulations restrict my 
ability to publish the results of my research?
    Answer: The Export Administration Regulations are not the means for 
enforcing the national security controls you have agreed to. If such a 
publication violates the contract, you would be subject to 
administrative, civil, and possible criminal penalties under other law.

                    Section F: Commercial Consulting

    Question F(1): I am a professor at a U.S. university, with expertise 
in design and creation of submicron devices. I have been asked to be a 
consultant for a ``third-world'' company that wishes to manufacture such 
devices. Do I need a license to do so?
    Answer: Quite possibly you do. Application abroad of personal 
knowledge or technical experience acquired in the United States 
constitutes an export of that knowledge and experience that is subject 
to the Export Administration Regulations. If any part of the knowledge 
or experience your export or reexport deals with technology that 
requires a license under the EAR, you will need to obtain a license or 
qualify for a License Exception.

                    Section G: Software <SUP>2</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Exporters should note that these provisions do not apply to 
software controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations 
(e.g., certain encryption software).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Question G(1): Is the export or reexport of software in machine 
readable code subject to the EAR when the source code for such software 
is publicly available?

[[Page 230]]

    Answer: If the source code of a software program is publicly 
available, then the machine readable code compiled from the source code 
is software that is publicly available and therefore not subject to the 
EAR.
    Question G(2): Is the export or reexport of software sold at a price 
that does not exceed the cost of reproduction and distribution subject 
to the EAR?
    Answer: Software in machine readable code is publicly available if 
it is available to a community at a price that does not exceed the cost 
of reproduction and distribution. Such reproduction and distribution 
costs may include variable and fixed allocations of overhead and normal 
profit for the reproduction and distribution functions either in your 
company or in a third party distribution system. In your company, such 
costs may not include recovery for development, design, or acquisition. 
In this case, the provider of the software does not receive a fee for 
the inherent value of the software.
    Question G(3): Is the export or reexport of software subject to the 
EAR if it is sold at a price BXA concludes in a classification letter to 
be sufficiently low so as not to subject it to the EAR?
    Answer: In response to classification requests, BXA may choose to 
classify certain software as not subject to the EAR even though it is 
sold at a price above the costs of reproduction and distribution as long 
as the price is nonetheless sufficiently low to qualify for such a 
classification in the judgment of BXA.

                Section H: Available in a Public Library

    Question H(1): Is the export or reexport of information subject to 
the EAR if it is available in a library and sold through an electronic 
or print service?
    Answer: Electronic and print services for the distribution of 
information may be relatively expensive in the marketplace because of 
the value vendors add in retrieving and organizing information in a 
useful way. If such information is also available in a library--itself 
accessible to the public--or has been published in any way, that 
information is ``publicly available'' for those reasons, and the 
information itself continues not to be subject to the EAR even though 
you access the information through an electronic or print service for 
which you or your employer pay a substantial fee.
    Question H(2): Is the export or reexport of information subject to 
the EAR if the information is available in an electronic form in a 
library at no charge to the library patron?
    Answer: Information available in an electronic form at no charge to 
the library patron in a library accessible to the public is information 
publicly available even though the library pays a substantial 
subscription fee for the electronic retrieval service.
    Question H(3): Is the export or reexport of information subject to 
the EAR if the information is available in a library and sold for more 
than the cost of reproduction and distribution?
    Answer: Information from books, magazines, dissertations, papers, 
electronic data bases, and other information available in a library that 
is accessible to the public is not subject to the EAR. This is true even 
if you purchase such a book at more than the cost of reproduction and 
distribution. In other words, such information is ``publicly available'' 
even though the author makes a profit on your particular purchase for 
the inherent value of the information.

                        Section I: Miscellaneous

    Question I(1): The manufacturing plant that I work at is planning to 
begin admitting groups of the general public to tour the plant 
facilities. We are concerned that a license might be required if the 
tour groups include foreign nationals. Would such a tour constitute an 
export? If so, is the export subject to the EAR?
    Answer: The EAR define exports and reexports of technology to 
include release through visual inspection by foreign nationals of U.S.-
origin equipment and facilities. Such an export or reexport qualifies 
under the ``publicly available'' provision and would not be subject to 
the EAR so long as the tour is truly open to all members of the public, 
including your competitors, and you do not charge a fee that is not 
reasonably related to the cost of conducting the tours. Otherwise, you 
will have to obtain a license, or qualify for a License Exception, prior 
to permitting foreign nationals to tour your facilities (Sec. 734.7 of 
this part).
    Question I(2): Is the export or reexport of information subject to 
the EAR if the information is not in a library or published, but sold at 
a price that does not exceed the cost of reproduction and distribution?
    Answer: Information that is not in a library accessible to the 
public and that has not been published in any way, may nonetheless 
become ``publicly available'' if you make it both available to a 
community of persons and if you sell it at no more than the cost of 
reproduction and distribution. Such reproduction and distribution costs 
may include variable and fixed cost allocations of overhead and normal 
profit for the reproduction and distribution functions either in your 
company or in a third party distribution system. In your company, such 
costs may not include recovery for development, design, or acquisition 
costs of the technology or software. The reason for this conclusion is 
that the provider of the information receives nothing for the inherent 
value of the information.

[[Page 231]]

    Question I(3): Is the export or reexport of information contributed 
to an electronic bulletin board subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Assume each of the following:
    1. Information is uploaded to an electronic bulletin board by a 
person that is the owner or originator of the information;
    2. That person does not charge a fee to the bulletin board 
administrator or the subscribers of the bulletin board; and
    3. The bulletin board is available for subscription to any 
subscriber in a given community regardless of the cost of subscription.
    Such information is ``publicly available'' and therefore not subject 
to the EAR even if it is not elsewhere published and is not in a 
library. The reason for this conclusion is that the bulletin board 
subscription charges or line charges are for distribution exclusively, 
and the provider of the information receives nothing for the inherent 
value of the information.
    Question I(4): Is the export or reexport of patented information 
fully disclosed on the public record subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Information to the extent it is disclosed on the patent 
record open to the public is not subject to the EAR even though you may 
use such information only after paying a fee in excess of the costs of 
reproduction and distribution. In this case the seller does receive a 
fee for the inherent value of the technical data; however, the export or 
reexport of the information is nonetheless not subject to the EAR 
because any person can obtain the technology from the public record and 
further disclose or publish the information. For that reason, it is 
impossible to impose export controls that deny access to the 
information.

62 FR 25456, May 9, 1997]

Supplement No. 2 to Part 734--Calculation of Values for De Minimis Rules

    (a) Use the following guidelines in determining values for 
establishing exemptions or for submission of a request for 
authorization:
    (1) U.S. content value.
    (i) U.S. content value is the delivered cost to the foreign 
manufacturer of the U.S. origin parts, components, or materials. (When 
affiliated firms have special arrangements that result in lower than 
normal pricing, the cost should reflect ``fair market'' prices that 
would normally be charged to similar, unaffiliated customers.)
    (ii) In calculating the U.S. content value, do not include parts, 
components, or materials that could be exported from the United States 
to the new country of destination without a license (designated as 
``NLR'') or under License Exception GBS (see part 740 of the EAR) or 
under NLR for items classified as EAR99.
    (2) The foreign-made product value is the normal selling price 
f.o.b. factory (excluding value added taxes or excise taxes).
    (3) To determine the value of the U.S.-origin controlled content, 
you should classify the U.S.-origin content on the Commerce Control 
List, determine those items that would require a license from BXA for 
reexport to the ultimate destination of the foreign-made product if such 
parts, components, or materials were reexported to that destination in 
the form received, and divide the total value of the controlled U.S. 
parts, components, and materials incorporated into the foreign-made item 
by the sale price of the foreign-made item.
    (4) If no U.S. parts, components or materials are incorporated or if 
the incorporated U.S. parts, components, and materials are below the de 
minimis level, then the foreign-made item is not subject to the EAR by 
reason of Sec. 734.4 of this part, the classification of a foreign-made 
item is irrelevant in determining the scope of the EAR, and you should 
skip Step 4 in Sec. 732.2(d) and go on to consider Step 6 in 
Sec. 732.2(f) of the EAR regarding the foreign-produced direct product 
rule.

    Note to paragraph (a)--
    U.S. origin peripheral or accessory devices that are merely rack 
mounted with or cable connected into foreign equipment are not deemed to 
be incorporated components even though intended for use with products 
made abroad. Rather, such items are treated as U.S. items that retain 
their identity and remain subject to the EAR.

    (b) One-time report prior to reliance upon the de minimis exclusion. 
Report requirement. Before you may rely upon the de minimis exclusion 
for foreign software and technology commingled with U.S. software or 
technology, you must file a one-time report for the foreign software or 
technology. The report must include the percentage of U.S.-content by 
value and a description of your calculations including relevant values, 
assumptions, and the basis or methodologies for making the percentage 
calculation. The three criteria important to BXA in its review of your 
report will be the export price of the U.S.-content, the assumption 
regarding future sales of software, and the choice of the scope of 
foreign technology. Your methodologies must be based upon the accounting 
standards used in the operation of your business, and you must specify 
that standard in your report. Regardless of the accounting systems, 
standard, or conventions you use in the operation of your business, you 
may not depreciate the fair market values reported or otherwise reduce 
the fair market values by other accounting conventions such as 
depreciation. You may rely

[[Page 232]]

upon the de minimis exclusion from the commingled rule only to the 
extent you have reported the relevant calculations, values, assumptions, 
and the basis or methodologies for the calculations. These values may be 
historic or projected. You may rely on projected values only to the 
extent that and for so long as they remain consistent with your report 
or future values reduce the U.S.-content under your reported 
assumptions, basis, and methodologies. You are not required to file the 
above report if you do not choose to take advantage of the de minimis 
exclusion from the commingled rule.
    (2) Export price. The report must include a description of the U.S.-
content including its classification on the Commerce Control List, its 
performance characteristics and features, and the method of calculating 
its fair market value. The fair market value shall be the arms-length 
transaction price, if it is available. If an arms-length transaction 
price is unavailable, then the report will describe the valuation method 
chosen to calculate or derive the fair market value. Such methods may 
include comparable market prices or costs of production and 
distribution. This rule does not require calculations based upon any one 
accounting system or U.S. accounting standards. However, you must 
specify the accepted accounting standards you have chosen, and cost-
based methods of valuation must be based upon records you maintain in 
the normal course of business. You should also indicate whether reported 
values are actual arms-length market prices or derived from comparable 
transactions or costs of production, overhead, and profit. For example, 
if you chose to make calculations under the transfer pricing rules of 
the United States Internal Revenue Code at section 482, your report 
should indicate that this is the source for your methodology, and you 
should also indicate which of the several methodologies in these 
transfer pricing rules you have chosen.
    (3) Future software sales. For calculations of U.S.-content in 
foreign software, you shall include your historic and estimated future 
software sales in units and value along with the rationale and basis for 
those estimates in the report. Unlike parts incorporated into 
commodities, the cost of U.S. software code will be attributed or 
allocated to the future sales of foreign-made software incorporating the 
U.S. code, to determine the percentage of U.S. controlled content. In 
making this calculation for foreign-made software, you must make an 
estimate of future software sales of that foreign software if it is 
commingled with or incorporated with the U.S. code. The value of the 
U.S. code commingled with or incorporated into the foreign made software 
shall be divided by the total selling price of all foreign-made software 
units already sold, plus the total selling price of all foreign-made 
software units estimated for future sales.
    (4) Foreign technology and software. For calculations of U.S.-
content in foreign technology and software, you shall include in the 
report a description of the foreign technology or software and a 
description of its fair market value along with the rationale and basis 
for the selection and valuation of such foreign software or technology. 
The report does not require information regarding destinations and end 
users for reexport. The purpose of the report is solely to permit the 
U.S. Government to evaluate the reasonableness of U.S.-content 
calculations.
    (5) Report and wait. If you have not been contacted by BXA 
concerning your report within thirty days after filing the report with 
BXA, you may rely upon the calculations in your report and the de 
minimis exclusions for software and technology for so long as you are 
not contacted by BXA. BXA may contact you concerning your report to 
inquire of you further or to indicate that BXA does not accept the 
assumptions or rationale for your calculations. If you receive such a 
contact or communication from BXA, you may not rely upon the de minimis 
exclusions for software and technology in Sec. 734.4 of this part until 
BXA has indicated whether or not you may do so in the future. You must 
include in your report the name, title, address, telephone number, and 
facsimile number of the person BXA may contact concerning your report.

Sec. 736.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. A person may undertake transactions subject to the 
EAR without a license or other authorization, unless the regulations 
affirmatively

[[Page 233]]

state such a requirement. As such, if an export, reexport, or activity 
is subject to the EAR, the general prohibitions contained in this part 
and the License Exceptions specified in part 740 of the EAR must be 
reviewed to determine if a license is necessary. In the case of all 
exports from the United States, you must document your export as 
described in part 762 of the EAR regarding recordkeeping and clear your 
export through the U.S. Customs Service as described in part 758 of the 
EAR regarding export clearance requirements. Also note that for short 
supply controls all prohibitions and License Exceptions are in part 754 
of the EAR.
    (a) In this part we tell you:
    (1) The facts that make your proposed export, reexport, or conduct 
subject to these general prohibitions, and
    (2) The ten general prohibitions.
    (b) Your obligations under the ten general prohibitions and under 
the EAR depend in large part upon the five types of information 
described in Sec. 736.2(a) of this part and upon the general 
prohibitions described in Sec. 736.2(b) of this part. The ten general 
prohibitions contain cross-references to other parts of the EAR that 
further define the breadth of the general prohibitions. For that reason, 
this part is not freestanding. In part 732, we provide certain steps you 
may follow in proper order to help you understand the general 
prohibitions and their relationship to other parts of the EAR.
    (c) If you violate any of these ten general prohibitions, or engage 
in other conduct contrary to the Export Administration Act, the EAR, or 
any order, license, License Exception, or authorization issued 
thereunder, as described in part 764 of the EAR regarding enforcement, 
you will be subject to the sanctions described in that part.


<R05>
Sec. 736.2  General prohibitions and determination of applicability.

    (a) Information or facts that determine the applicability of the 
general prohibitions. The following five types of facts determine your 
obligations under the ten general prohibitions and the EAR generally:
    (1) Classification of the item. The classification of the item on 
the Commerce Control List (see part 774 of the EAR);
    (2) Destination. The country of ultimate destination for an export 
or reexport (see parts 738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country 
Chart and the Commerce Control List);
    (3) End-user. The ultimate end-user (see General Prohibition Four 
(paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and parts 744 and 764 of the EAR for 
a reference to the list of persons you may not deal with);
    (4) End-use. The ultimate end-use (see General Prohibition Five 
(paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 of the EAR for general 
end-use restrictions); and
    (5) Conduct. Conduct such as contracting, financing, and freight 
forwarding in support of a proliferation project as described in part 
744 of the EAR.
    (b) General prohibitions. The following ten general prohibitions 
describe certain exports, reexports, and other conduct, subject to the 
scope of the EAR, in which you may not engage unless you either have a 
license from the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) or qualify under 
part 740 of the EAR for a License Exception from each applicable general 
prohibition in this paragraph. The License Exceptions at part 740 of the 
EAR apply only to General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the 
Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three 
(Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports); however, selected License 
Exceptions are specifically referenced and authorized in part 746 of the 
EAR concerning embargo destinations and in Sec. 744.2(c) of the EAR 
regarding nuclear end-uses.
    (1) General Prohibition One--Export and reexport of controlled items 
to listed countries (Exports and Reexports). You may not, without a 
license or License Exception, export any item subject to the EAR to 
another country or reexport any item of U.S.-origin if each of the 
following is true:
    (i) The item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable 
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), and
    (ii) Export to the country of destination requires a license for the 
control reason as indicated on the Country Chart at part 738 of the EAR. 
(The scope of this prohibition is determined

[[Page 234]]

by the correct classification of your item and the ultimate destination 
as that combination is reflected on the Country Chart.) <SUP>1</SUP> 
Note that each License Exception described at part 740 of the EAR 
supersedes General Prohibition One if all terms and conditions of a 
given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See part 738 of the EAR for selected controls that are not 
specified on the Country Chart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) General Prohibition Two--Reexport and export from abroad of 
foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of 
controlled U.S. content (Parts and Components Reexports). (i) You may 
not, without a license or License Exception, export, reexport or export 
from abroad any foreign-made commodity, software, or technology 
incorporating U.S.-origin commodities, software, or technology 
respectively that is controlled to the country of ultimate destination 
if the foreign-made item meets all three of the following conditions:
    (A) It incorporates more than the de minimis amount of controlled 
U.S. content, as defined in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope 
of the EAR;
    (B) It is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable ECCN; 
and
    (C) Its export to the country of destination requires a license for 
that control reason as indicated on the Country Chart. (The scope of 
this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your 
foreign-made item and the ultimate destination, as that combination is 
reflected on the Country Chart.)
    (ii) Each License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR 
supersedes General Prohibition Two if all terms and conditions of a 
given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
    (3) General Prohibition Three--Reexport and export from abroad of 
the foreign-produced direct product of U.S. technology and software 
(Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports). (i) Country scope of 
prohibition. You may not export, reexport, or export from abroad items 
subject to the scope of this General Prohibition Three to Cuba, Libya, 
or a destination in Country Group D:1 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 
of the EAR).
    (ii) Product scope of foreign-made items subject to prohibition. 
This General Prohibition 3 applies if an item meets either the 
Conditions defining the direct product of technology or the Conditions 
defining the direct product of a plant in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of 
this section:
    (A) Conditions defining direct product of technology. Foreign-made 
items are subject to this General Prohibition 3 if they meet both of the 
following conditions:
    (1) They are the direct product of technology or software that 
requires a written assurance as a supporting document for a license, as 
defined in paragraph (o)(3)(i) of Supplement No. 2 to part 748 of the 
EAR, or as a precondition for the use of License Exception TSR at 
Sec. 740.6 of the EAR, and
    (2) They are subject to national security controls as designated on 
the applicable ECCN of the Commerce Control List at part 774 of the EAR.
    (B) Conditions defining direct product of a plant. Foreign-made 
items are also subject to this General Prohibition 3 if they are the 
direct product of a complete plant or any major component of a plant if 
both of the following conditions are met:
    (1) Such plant or component is the direct product of technology that 
requires a written assurance as a supporting document for a license or 
as a precondition for the use of License Exception TSR in Sec. 740.6 of 
the EAR, and
    (2) Such foreign-made direct products of the plant or component are 
subject to national security controls as designated on the applicable 
ECCN of the Commerce Control List at part 774 of the EAR.
    (iii) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described at part 
740 of the EAR supersedes this General Prohibition Three if all terms 
and conditions of a given exception are met by the exporter or 
reexporter.
    (4) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders)--Engaging in actions 
prohibited by a denial order. (i) You may not take any action that is 
prohibited by a denial order issued under part 766 of the EAR, 
Administrative Enforcement Proceedings. These orders prohibit many

[[Page 235]]

actions in addition to direct exports by the person denied export 
privileges, including some transfers within a single country either in 
the United States or abroad by other persons. You are responsible for 
ensuring that any of your transactions in which a person who is denied 
export privileges is involved do not violate the terms of the order. The 
names of persons denied export privileges are published in the Federal 
Register and are also included on the Denied Persons List, which is 
referenced in Supplement No. 2 to part 764 of the EAR, Enforcement. The 
terms of the standard denial order are set forth in Supplement No. 1 to 
part 764. You should note that some denial orders differ from the 
standard denial order. BXA may, on an exceptional basis, authorize 
activity otherwise prohibited by a denial order. See Sec. 764.3(a)(3) of 
the EAR.
    (ii) There are no License Exceptions described in part 740 of the 
EAR that authorize conduct prohibited by this General Prohibition Four.
    (5) General Prohibition Five--Export or reexport to prohibited end-
uses or end-users (End-Use End-User). You may not, without a license, 
knowingly export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to an end-user 
or end-use that is prohibited by part 744 of the EAR.
    (6) General Prohibition Six--Export or reexport to embargoed 
destinations (Embargo). (i) You may not, without a license or License 
Exception authorized under part 746, export or reexport any item subject 
to the EAR to a country that is embargoed by the United States or 
otherwise made subject to controls as both are described at part 746 of 
the EAR.
    (ii) License Exceptions to General Prohibition Six are described in 
part 746 of the EAR, on Embargoes and Other Special Controls. Unless a 
License Exception or other authorization is authorized in part 746 of 
the EAR, the License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR are not 
available to overcome this general prohibition.
    (7) General Prohibition Seven--Support of proliferation activities 
(U.S. person proliferation activity)--(i) Support of proliferation 
activities (U.S. person proliferation activity). (A) If you are a U.S. 
person as that term is defined in Sec. 744.6(c) of the EAR, you may not 
engage in any activities prohibited by Sec. 744.6(a) or (b) of the EAR, 
which prohibits the performance, without a license from BXA, of certain 
financing, contracting, service, support, transportation, freight 
forwarding, or employment that you know will assist in certain 
proliferation activities described further in part 744 of the EAR. There 
are no License Exceptions to this General Prohibition Seven in part 740 
of the EAR unless specifically authorized in that part.
    (B) If you are a U.S. person as that term is defined in 
Sec. 744.6(c) of the EAR, you may not export a Schedule 1 chemical 
listed in Supplement No. 1 to Part 745 without first complying with the 
provisions of Secs. 742.18 and 745.1 of the EAR.
    (C) If you are a U.S. person as that term is defined in 
Sec. 744.6(c) of the EAR, you may not export a Schedule 3 chemical 
listed in Supplement No. 1 to Part 745 to a destination not listed in 
Supplement No. 2 to Part 745 without complying with the End-Use 
Certificate requirements in Sec. 745.2 of the EAR that apply to Schedule 
3 chemicals controlled for CW reasons in ECCN 1C350 or ECCN 1C355.
    (8) General Prohibition Eight--In transit shipments and items to be 
unladen from vessels or aircraft (Intransit).
    (i) Unlading and shipping in transit. You may not export or reexport 
an item through or transit through a country listed in paragraph 
(b)(8)(ii) of this section unless a License Exception or license 
authorizes such an export or reexport directly to such a country of 
transit, or unless such an export or reexport is eligible to such a 
country of transit without a license.
    (ii) Country scope. This General Prohibition Eight applies to 
Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cuba, 
Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Mongolia, North Korea, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, 
Uzbekistan, Vietnam.
    (9) General Prohibition Nine--Violation of any order, terms, and 
conditions (Orders, Terms, and Conditions). You may not violate terms or 
conditions of a license or of a License Exception issued under or made a 
part of the EAR, and you may not violate any order issued

[[Page 236]]

under or made a part of the EAR. There are no License Exceptions to this 
General Prohibition Nine in part 740 of the EAR. Supplements Nos. 1 and 
2 to this part provide for certain General Orders and Administrative 
Orders.
    (10) General Prohibition Ten--Proceeding with transactions with 
knowledge that a violation has occurred or is about to occur (Knowledge 
Violation to Occur). You may not sell, transfer, export, reexport, 
finance, order, buy, remove, conceal, store, use, loan, dispose of, 
transfer, transport, forward, or otherwise service, in whole or in part, 
any item subject to the EAR and exported or to be exported with 
knowledge that a violation of the Export Administration Regulations, the 
Export Administration Act or any order, license, License Exception, or 
other authorization issued thereunder has occurred, is about to occur, 
or is intended to occur in connection with the item. Nor may you rely 
upon any license or License Exception after notice to you of the 
suspension or revocation of that license or exception. There are no 
License Exceptions to this General Prohibition Ten in part 740 of the 
EAR.

<R05>
Sec. 738.1  Introduction.

    (a) Commerce Control List scope. (1) In this part, references to the 
EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of 
Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) 
within the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which includes items 
(i.e., commodities, software, and technology) subject to the export 
licensing authority of BXA. The CCL does not include those items 
exclusively controlled for export or reexport by another department or 
agency of the U.S. Government. In instances where agencies other than 
the Department of Commerce administer controls over related items, 
entries in the CCL contain a reference to these controls.
    (2) The CCL is contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR. 
Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR contains the General Technology 
and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.
    (b) Commerce Country Chart scope. BXA also maintains the Commerce 
Country Chart. The Commerce Country Chart, located in Supplement No. 1 
to part 738, contains licensing requirements based on destination and 
Reason for Control. In combination with the CCL, the Commerce Country 
Chart allows you to determine whether a license is required for items on 
the CCL to any country in the world.


<R05>
Sec. 738.2  Commerce Control List (CCL) structure.

    (a) Categories. The CCL is divided into 10 categories, numbered as 
follows:

0--Nuclear Materials, Facilities and Equipment and Miscellaneous
1--Materials, Chemicals, ``Microorganisms,'' and Toxins
2--Materials Processing
3--Electronics
4--Computers
5--Telecommunications and Information Security
6--Lasers and Sensors
7--Navigation and Avionics
8--Marine
9--Propulsion Systems, Space Vehicles and Related Equipment

    (b) Groups. Within each category, items are arranged by group. Each 
category contains the same five groups. Each Group is identified by the 
letters A through E, as follows:

A--Equipment, Assemblies and Components
B--Test, Inspection and Production Equipment
C--Materials
D--Software
E--Technology

    (c) Order of review. In order to classify your item against the CCL, 
you should begin with a review of the general characteristics of your 
item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category on the 
CCL. Once the appropriate category is identified, you should match the 
particular characteristics and functions of your item to a specific 
ECCN. If the ECCN contains a list under the ``Items'' heading, you 
should review the list to determine within which subparagraph(s) your 
items are identified.
    (d) Entries. (1) Composition of an entry. Within each group, 
individual items are identified by an Export Control Classification 
Number (ECCN). Each number consists of a set of digits and a letter. The 
first digit identifies the general category within which the entry falls 
(e.g., 3A001). The letter immediately following this first digit 
identifies under which of the five groups the item is listed (e.g., 3 
A001). The second digit differentiates individual entries by identifying 
the type of controls associated with the items contained in the entry 
(e.g., 3A001). Listed below are the Reasons for Control associated with 
this second digit.

0: National Security reasons (including Dual Use and International 
          Munitions List) and Items on the NSG Dual Use Annex and 
          Trigger List
1: Missile Technology reasons
2: Nuclear Nonproliferation reasons
3: Chemical & Biological Weapons reasons
9: Anti-terrorism, Crime Control, Regional Stability, Short Supply, UN 
          Sanctions, etc.

    (i) Since Reasons for Control are not mutually exclusive, numbers 
are assigned in order of precedence. As an example, if an item is 
controlled for both

[[Page 239]]

National Security and Missile Technology reasons, the entry's third 
digit will be a ``0''. If the item is controlled only for Missile 
Technology the third digit will be ``1''.
    (ii) The numbers in either the second or third digit (e.g., 3A001) 
serve to differentiate between multilateral and unilateral entries. An 
entry with the number ``9'' as the second digit, identifies the entire 
entry as controlled for a unilateral concern (e.g., 2B991 for anti-
terrorism reasons). If the number ``9'' appears as the third digit, the 
item is controlled for unilateral purposes based on a proliferation 
concern (e.g., 2A292 is controlled for unilateral purposes based on 
nuclear nonproliferation concerns).
    (iii) The last digit within each entry (e.g., 3A001) is used for the 
sequential numbering of ECCNs to differentiate between entries on the 
CCL.
    (2) Reading an ECCN. A brief description is provided next to each 
ECCN. Following this description is the actual entry containing 
``License Requirements,'' ``License Exceptions,'' and ``List of Items 
Controlled'' sections. A brief description of each section and its use 
follows:
    (i) License Requirements. This section contains a separate line 
identifying all possible Reasons for Control in order of precedence, and 
two columns entitled ``Control(s)'' and ``Country Chart''.
    (A) The ``Controls'' header identifies all applicable Reasons for 
Control, in order of restrictiveness, and to what extent each applies 
(e.g., to the entire entry or only to certain subparagraphs). Those 
requiring licenses for a larger number of countries and/or items are 
listed first. As you read down the list the number of countries and/or 
items requiring a license declines. Since Reasons for Control are not 
mutually exclusive, items controlled within a particular ECCN may be 
controlled for more than one reason. The following is a list of all 
possible Reasons for Control:

AT  Anti-Terrorism
CB  Chemical & Biological Weapons
CC  Crime Control
CW  Chemical Weapons Convention
EI  Encryption Items
FC Firearms Convention
MT  Missile Technology
NS  National Security
NP  Nuclear Nonproliferation
RS  Regional Stability
SS  Short Supply
XP  Computers
SI  Significant Items

    (B) The ``Country Chart'' header identifies, for each applicable 
Reason for Control, a column name and number (e.g., CB Column 1). These 
column identifiers are used to direct you from the CCL to the 
appropriate column identifying the countries requiring a license. 
Consult part 742 of the EAR for an indepth discussion of the licensing 
requirements and policies applicable to each Country Chart column.
    (ii) License Exceptions. This section provides a brief eligibility 
statement for each ECCN-driven License Exception that may be applicable 
to your transaction, and should be consulted only AFTER you have 
determined a license is required based on an analysis of the entry and 
the Country Chart. The brief eligibility statement in this section is 
provided to assist you in deciding which ECCN-driven License Exception 
related to your particular item and destination you should explore prior 
to submitting an application. The term ``Yes'' (followed in some 
instances by the scope of Yes) appears next to each available ECCN-
driven License Exception. The term ``N/A'' will be noted for License 
Exceptions that are not available within a particular entry. If one or 
more License Exceptions appear to apply to your transaction, you must 
consult part 740 of the EAR to review the conditions and restrictions 
applicable to each available License Exception. The list of License 
Exceptions contained within each ECCN is not an all-exclusive list. 
Other License Exceptions, not based on particular ECCNs, may be 
available. Consult part 740 of the EAR to determine eligibility for non-
ECCN-driven License Exceptions.
    (iii) List of Items Controlled--(A) Units. The unit of measure 
applicable to each entry is identified in the ``Units'' header. Most 
measurements used in the CCL are expressed in metric units with an inch-
pound conversion where appropriate. Note that in some ECCNs the inch-
pound unit will be listed first. In instances where other units are in 
general usage or specified by law, these

[[Page 240]]

will be used instead of metric. Generally, when there is a difference 
between the metric and inch-pound figures, the metric standard will be 
used for classification and licensing purposes.
    (B) Related definitions. This header identifies, where appropriate, 
definitions or parameters that apply to all items controlled by the 
entry. The information provided in this section is unique to the entry, 
and hence not listed in the definitions contained in part 772 of the 
EAR.
    (C) Related controls. If another U.S. government agency or 
department has export licensing authority over items related to those 
controlled by an entry, a statement is included identifying the agency 
or department along with the applicable regulatory cite. An additional 
cross-reference may be included in instances where the scope of controls 
differs between a CCL entry and its corresponding entry on list 
maintained by the European Union. This information is provided to assist 
readers who use both lists.
    (D) Items. This header contains a positive list of all items 
controlled by a particular entry and must be reviewed to determine 
whether your item is controlled by that entry. In some entries, the list 
is contained within the entry heading. In these entries a note is 
included to direct you to the entry heading.

[61 FR 112756, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68579, Dec. 30, 1996; 
62 FR 25456, May 9, 1997; 64 FR 17970, Apr. 13, 1999; 27141, May 18, 
1999]


<R05>
Sec. 738.3  Commerce Country Chart structure.

    (a) Scope. The Commerce Country Chart (Country Chart) allows you to 
determine, based on the Reason(s) for Control associated with your item, 
if you need a license to export or reexport your item to a particular 
destination. There are only two instances where the chart cannot be used 
for this purpose:
    (1) Items controlled for short supply reasons. Due to the unique 
nature of these controls, entries controlled for Short Supply reasons 
will send you directly to part 754 of the EAR. Part 754 of the EAR is 
self-contained and includes information on licensing requirements, 
licensing policies, and all available License Exceptions, for items 
controlled for Short Supply reasons.
    (2) Unique entries. The following are unique entries where you do 
not need to consult the Country Chart to determine whether a license is 
required.
    (i) ECCNs 0A983 and 5A980. A license is required for all 
destinations of items controlled under these entries. No License 
Exceptions apply. If your item is controlled by 0A983 or 5A980 you 
should proceed directly to part 748 of the EAR for license application 
instructions and Sec. 742.11 or Sec. 742.13 of the EAR for information 
on the licensing policy relevant to these types of applications.
    (ii) ECCNs 0A982, 0A985, 0A988, 0A989, 0A999, 0B986, 0B999, 0D999, 
0E982, 1A999, 1B999, 1C355, 1C995, 1C998, 1C999, 1D999, 2A994, 2A999, 
2B999, 2D994, 2E994, 3A999, and 6A999. A license is required for items 
controlled under these entries only to the specific countries identified 
within each entry.
    (b) Countries. The first column of the Country Chart lists all 
countries in alphabetical order. There are a number of destinations that 
are not listed in the Country Chart contained in Supplement No. 1 to 
part 738. If your destination is not listed on the Country Chart and 
such destination is a territory, possession, or department of a country 
included on the Country Chart, the EAR accords your destination the same 
licensing treatment as the country of which it is a territory, 
possession, or department. For example, if your destination is the 
Cayman Islands, a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, consult the 
United Kingdom on the Country Chart for licensing requirements.
    (c) Columns. Stretching out to the right are horizontal headers 
identifying the various Reasons for Control. Under each Reason for 
Control header are diagonal column identifiers capping individual 
columns. Each column identifier consists of the two letter Reason for 
Control and a column number. (e.g., CB Column 1). The column identifiers 
correspond to those listed in the ``Country Chart'' header within the 
``License Requirements'' section of each ECCN.

[[Page 241]]

    (d) Cells. The symbol ``X'' is used to denote licensing requirements 
on the Country Chart. If an ``X'' appears in a particular cell, 
transactions subject to that particular Reason for Control/Destination 
combination require a license. There is a direct correlation between the 
number of ``X''s applicable to your transaction and the number of 
licensing reviews your application will undergo.

[61 FR 12756, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 42228, Aug. 7, 1998; 65 
FR 55178, Sept. 13, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 738.4  Determining whether a license is required.

    (a) Using the CCL and the Country Chart--(1) Overview. Once you have 
determined that your item is controlled by a specific ECCN, you must use 
information contained in the ``License Requirements'' section of that 
ECCN in combination with the Country Chart to decide whether a license 
is required.
    (2) License decision making process. The following decision making 
process must be followed in order to determine whether a license is 
required to export or reexport a particular item to a specific 
destination:
    (i) Examine the appropriate ECCN in the CCL. Is the item you intend 
to export or reexport controlled for a single Reason for Control?
    (A) If yes, identify the single Reason for Control and the relevant 
Country Chart column identifier (e.g., CB Column 1).
    (B) If no, identify the Country Chart column identifier for each 
applicable Reason for Control (e.g., NS Column 1, NP Column 1, etc.).
    (ii) Review the Country Chart. With each of the applicable Country 
Chart Column identifiers noted, turn to the Country Chart (Supplement 
No. 1 to part 738). Locate the correct Country Chart column identifier 
on the diagonal headings, and determine whether an ``X'' is marked in 
the cell next to the country in question for each Country Chart column 
identified in the applicable ECCN. If your item is subject to more than 
one reason for control, repeat this step using each unique Country Chart 
column identifier.
    (A) If yes, a license application must be submitted based on the 
particular reason for control and destination, unless a License 
Exception applies. If ``Yes'' is noted next to any of the listed License 
Exceptions, you should consult part 740 of the EAR to determine whether 
you can use any of the available ECCN-drvien License Exceptions to 
effect your shipment, rather than applying for a license. Each 
affirmative license requirement must be overcome by a License Exception. 
If you are unable to qualify for a License Exception based on each 
license requirement noted on the Country Chart, you must apply for a 
license. Note that other License Exceptions, not related to the CCL, may 
also apply to your transaction (See part 740 of the EAR).
    (B) If no, a license is not required based on the particular reason 
for control and destination. Provided General Prohibitions Four through 
Ten do not apply to your proposed transaction, you may effect your 
shipment using the symbol ``NLR''. Proceed to parts 758 and 762 of the 
EAR for information on export clearance procedures and recordkeeping 
requirements. Note that although you may stop after determining a 
license is required based on the first Reason for Control, it is best to 
work through each applicable Reason for Control. A full analysis of 
every possible licensing requirement based on each applicable Reason for 
Control is required to determine the most advantageous License Exception 
available for your particular transaction and, if a license is required, 
ascertain the scope of review conducted by BXA on your license 
application.
    (b) Sample analysis using the CCL and Country Chart--(1) Scope. The 
following sample entry and related analysis is provided to illustrate 
the type of thought process you must complete in order to determine 
whether a license is required to export or reexport a particular item to 
a specific destination using the CCL in combination with the Country 
Chart.

List of Items Controlled

Unit: Number
Related Definition: N/A
Related Controls: N/A
Items:

    a. Having x.
    b. Having z.

    (3) Sample analysis. After consulting the CCL, I determine my item, 
valued at $10,000, is classified under ECCN 2A000.a. I read that the 
entire entry is controlled for national security, and anti-terrorism 
reasons. Since my item is classified under paragraph .a, and not .b, I 
understand that though nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to a 
portion the entry, they do not apply to my item. I note that the 
appropriate Country Chart column identifiers are NS Column 2 and AT 
Column 1. Turning to the Country Chart, I locate my specific 
destination, India, and see that an ``X'' appears in the NS Column 2 
cell for India, but not in the AT Column 1 cell. I understand that a 
license is required, unless my transaction qualifies for a License 
Exception or Special Comprehensive License. From the License Exception 
LVS value listed in the entry, I know immediately that my proposed 
transaction exceeds the value limitation associated with LVS. Noting 
that License Exception GBS is ``Yes'' for this entry, I turn to part 740 
of the EAR to review the provisions related to use of GBS.

Sec. 740.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Scope. A ``License Exception'' is an authorization contained in 
this part that allows you to export or reexport under stated conditions, 
items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that would 
otherwise require a license under General Prohibition One, Two, Three, 
or Eight, as indicated under one or more of the Export Control 
Classification Numbers (ECCNs) in the Commerce Control List (CCL) in 
Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR and items subject to the EAR 
that would require a license based on the embargo policies described in 
part 746 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General 
Prohibition Six for embargoed destinations, refer to part 746 of the EAR 
to determine the availability of any License Exceptions. Special 
commodity controls apply to short supply items. License Exceptions for 
items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons are found 
in part 754 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General 
Prohibition Five, consult part 744 of the EAR. If your export or 
reexport is subject to General Prohibitions Four, Seven, Nine, or Ten, 
then no License Exceptions apply.
    (b) Certification. By using any of the License Exceptions you are 
certifying that the terms, provisions, and conditions for the use of the 
License Exception described in the EAR have been met. Please refer to 
part 758 of the EAR for clearance of shipments and documenting the use 
of License Exceptions.
    (c) License Exception symbols. Each License Exception bears a three 
letter symbol that will be used for export clearance purposes (see 
paragraph (d) of this section).
    (d) Shipper's Export Declaration or Automated Export System (AES) 
record. You must enter on any required Shipper's Export Declaration 
(SED) or Automated Export System (AES) record the correct License 
Exception symbol (e.g., LVS, GBS, CIV) and the correct Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) (e.g., 4A003, 5A002) for all shipments of 
items exported under a License Exception. Items temporarily in the 
United States meeting the provisions of License Exception TMP, under 
Sec. 740.9(b)(3), are excepted from this requirement. See Sec. 758.1 of 
the EAR for Shipper's Export Declaration requirements or Sec. 758.2 of 
the EAR for Automated Export System (AES) requirements.
    (e) Destination Control Statement. You may be required to enter an 
appropriate Destination Control Statement

[[Page 250]]

on commercial documents in accordance with Destination Control Statement 
requirements of Sec. 758.6 of the EAR.
    (f) Recordkeeping. Records of transactions involving exports under 
any of the License Exceptions must be maintained in accordance with the 
recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.

<R05>
Sec. 740.2  Restrictions on all License Exceptions.

    (a) You may not use any License Exception if any one or more of the 
following apply:
    (1) Your authorization to use a License Exception has been suspended 
or revoked, or your intended export does not qualify for a License 
Exception.
    (2) The export or reexport is subject to one of the ten General 
Prohibitions, is not eligible for a License Exception, and has not been 
authorized by BXA.
    (3) The item is for surreptitious interception of wire or oral 
communications, controlled under ECCN 5A980, unless you are a U.S. 
Government agency (see Sec. 740.11(b)(2)(ii) of this part, Governments 
(GOV)).
    (4) The commodity you are shipping is a specially designed crime 
control and detection instrument or equipment described in Sec. 742.7 of 
the EAR and you are not shipping to Iceland, New Zealand, or countries 
listed in Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), unless 
the shipment is authorized under License Exception BAG, Sec. 740.14(e) 
of this part (shotguns and shotgun shells).
    (5) The item is controlled for missile technology (MT) reasons, 
except that the items described in ECCNs 6A008, 7A001, 7A002, 7A004, 
7A101, 7A102, 7A103, 7A104, 7B001, 7D001, 7D002, 7D003, 7D101, 7D102, 
7E003, or 7E101, may be exported as part of a manned aircraft, land 
vehicle or marine vehicle or in quantities appropriate for replacement 
parts for such applications under Sec. 740.9(a)(2)(ii) (License 
Exception TMP for kits consisting of replacement parts), Sec. 740.10 
(License Exception RPL), Sec. 740.13 (License Exception TSU), or 
Sec. 740.15(c) (License Exception AVS for equipment and spare parts for 
permanent use on a vessel or aircraft).
    (6) The export or reexport is to an embargoed destination (Cuba, 
Iran, Iraq, and Libya), unless a license exception or portion thereof is 
specifically listed in the license exceptions paragraph pertaining to a 
particular embargoed country in part 746 of the EAR.
    (b) All License Exceptions are subject to revision, suspension, or 
revocation, in whole or in part, without notice. It may be necessary for 
BXA to stop a shipment or an export transaction at any stage of its 
progress, e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport. 
If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary to order 
the return or unloading of the shipment at any port of call.
    (c) BXA may by informing the exporter, suspend or revoke any License 
Exception in order to comply with U.S. Wassenaar obligations. In 
addition, BXA may inform an exporter, that before using any License 
Exception, a notice be submitted with BXA concerning the proposed 
export.

<R05>
Sec. 740.3  Shipments of limited value (LVS).

    (a) Scope. License Exception LVS authorizes the export and reexport 
in a single shipment of eligible commodities as identified by ``LVS - 
$(value limit)'' on the CCL.
    (b) Eligible Destinations. This License Exception is available for 
all destinations in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), 
provided that the net value of the commodities included in the same 
order and controlled under the same ECCN entry on the CCL does not 
exceed the amount specified in the LVS paragraph for that entry.
    (c) Definitions--(1) order. The term order as used in this 
Sec. 740.3 means a communication from a person in a foreign country, or 
that person's representative, expressing an intent to import commodities 
from the exporter. Although all of the details of the order need not be 
finally determined at the

[[Page 251]]

time of export, terms relating to the kinds and quantities of the 
commodities to be exported, as well as the selling prices of these 
commodities, must be finalized before the goods can be exported under 
License Exception LVS.
    (2) Net value: for LVS shipments. The actual selling price of the 
commodities that are included in the same order and are controlled under 
the same entry on the CCL, less shipping charges, or the current market 
price of the commodities to the same type of purchaser in the United 
States, whichever is the larger. In determining the actual selling price 
or the current market price of the commodity, the value of containers in 
which the commodity is being exported may be excluded. The value for LVS 
purposes is that of the controlled commodity that is being exported, and 
may not be reduced by subtracting the value of any content that would 
not, if shipped separately, be subject to licensing. Where the total 
value of the containers and their contents must be shown on Shipper's 
Export Declarations under one Schedule B Number, the exporter, in 
effecting a shipment under this License Exception, must indicate the 
``net value'' of the contained commodity immediately below the 
description of the commodity.
    (3) Single shipment. All commodities moving at the same time from 
one exporter to one consignee or intermediate consignee on the same 
exporting carrier even though these commodities will be forwarded to one 
or more ultimate consignees. Commodities being transported in this 
manner will be treated as a single shipment even if the commodities 
represent more than one order or are in separate containers.
    (d) Additional eligibility requirements and restrictions--(1) 
Eligible orders. To be eligible for this License Exception, orders must 
meet the following criteria:
    (i) orders must not exceed the applicable ``LVS'' dollar value 
limits. An order is eligible for shipment under LVS when the ``net 
value'' of the commodities controlled under the same entry on the CCL 
does not exceed the amount specified in the ``LVS'' paragraph for that 
entry. An LVS shipment may include more than one eligible order.
    (ii) orders may not be split to meet the applicable LVS dollar 
limits. An order that exceeds the applicable LVS dollar value limit may 
not be misrepresented as two or more orders, or split among two or more 
shipments, to give the appearance of meeting the applicable LVS dollar 
value limit. However an order that meets all the LVS eligibility 
requirements, including the applicable LVS dollar value limit, may be 
split among two or more shipments.
    (iii) orders must be legitimate. Exporters and consignees may not, 
either collectively or individually, structure or adjust orders to meet 
the applicable LVS dollar value limits.
    (2) Restriction on annual value of LVS orders. The total value of 
exports per calendar year to the same ultimate or intermediate consignee 
of commodities classified under a single ECCN may not exceed 12 times 
the LVS value limit for that ECCN; however, there is no restriction on 
the number of shipments provided that value is not exceeded. This annual 
value limit applies to shipments to the same ultimate consignee even 
though the shipments are made through more than one intermediate 
consignee. There is no restriction on the number of orders that may be 
included in a shipment, except that the annual value limit per ECCN must 
not be exceeded.
    (3) orders where two or more LVS dollar value limits apply. An order 
may include commodities that are controlled under more than one entry on 
the CCL. In this case, the net value of the entire order may exceed the 
LVS dollar value for any single entry on the CCL. However, the net value 
of the commodities controlled under each ECCN entry shall not exceed the 
LVS dollar value limit specified for that entry.

    Example to paragraph (d)(3): An order includes commodities valued at 
$8,000. The order consists of commodities controlled under two ECCN 
entries, each having an LVS value limit of $5000. Commodities in the 
order controlled under one ECCN are valued at $3,500 while those 
controlled under the other ECCN are valued at $4,500. Since the net 
value of the commodities controlled under each entry falls within the 
LVS dollar value limits applicable to that entry, the order may be 
shipped under this License Exception.

    (4) Prohibition against evasion of license requirements. Any 
activity involving the use of this License Exception to

[[Page 252]]

evade license requirements is prohibited. Such devices include, but are 
not limited to, the splitting or structuring of orders to meet 
applicable LVS dollar value limits, as prohibited by paragraphs (d)(1) 
(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (5) Exports of encryption items. For components or spare parts 
controlled for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5A002, exports under this 
License Exception must be destined to support an item previously 
authorized for export.
    (e) Reexports. Commodities may be reexported under this License 
Exception, provided that they could be exported from the United States 
to the new country of destination under LVS.
    (f) Reporting requirements. See Sec. 743.1 of the EAR for reporting 
requirements for exports of certain commodities under License Exception 
LVS.

<R05>
Sec. 740.4  Shipments to Country Group B countries (GBS).

    License Exception GBS authorizes exports and reexports to Country 
Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) of those commodities 
controlled to the ultimate destination for national security reasons 
only and identified by ``GBS--Yes'' on the CCL. See Sec. 743.1 of the 
EAR for reporting requirements for exports of certain commodities under 
License Exception GBS.

[63 FR 2456, Jan. 15, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 740.5  Civil end-users (CIV).

    License Exception CIV authorizes exports and reexports controlled to 
the ultimate destination for national security reasons only and 
identified by ``CIV--Yes'' on the CCL, provided the items are destined 
to civil end-users for civil end-uses in Country Group D:1, except North 
Korea. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) CIV may not be used for 
exports and reexports to military end-users or to known military uses. 
Such exports and reexports will continue to require a license. In 
addition to conventional military activities, military uses include any 
proliferation activities described and prohibited by part 744 of the 
EAR. A license is also required for transfer to military end-users or 
end-uses in eligible countries of items exported under CIV. See 
Sec. 743.1 of the EAR for reporting requirements for exports of certain 
commodities under License Exception CIV.

FR 38150, June 19, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 740.6  Technology and software under restriction (TSR).

    (a) Scope. License Exception TSR permits exports and reexports of 
technology and software controlled to the ultimate destination for 
national security reasons only and identified by ``TSR--Yes'' in entries 
on the CCL, provided the software or technology is destined to Country 
Group B. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) A written assurance is 
required from the consignee before exporting or reexporting under this 
License Exception.
    (1) Required assurance for export of technology. You may not export 
or reexport technology under this License Exception until you have 
received from the importer a written assurance that, without a BXA 
license or License Exception, the importer will not:
    (i) Reexport or release the technology to a national of a country in 
Country Groups D:1 or E:2; or
    (ii) Export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the direct product of the 
technology, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to 
national security controls as identified on the CCL (See General 
Prohibition Three, Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR); or
    (iii) If the direct product of the technology is a complete plant or 
any major component of a plant, export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the 
direct product of the plant or major component thereof, if such foreign 
produced direct product is subject to national security controls as 
identified on the CCL or is subject to State Department controls under 
the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121).
    (2) Required assurance for export of software. You may not export or 
reexport software under this License Exception until you have received 
from the importer a written assurance that, without a BXA license or 
License Exception, the importer will neither:

[[Page 253]]

    (i) Reexport or release the software or the source code for the 
software to a national of a country in Country Groups D:1 or E:2; nor
    (ii) Export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the direct product of the 
software, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to national 
security controls as identified on the CCL. (See General Prohibition 
Three, Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR).
    (3) Form of written assurance. The required assurance may be made in 
the form of a letter or any other written communication from the 
importer, including communications via facsimile, or the assurance may 
be incorporated into a licensing agreement that specifically includes 
the assurances. An assurance included in a licensing agreement is 
acceptable only if the agreement specifies that the assurance will be 
honored even after the expiration date of the licensing agreement. If 
such a written assurance is not received, License Exception TSR is not 
applicable and a license is required. The license application must 
include a statement explaining why assurances could not be obtained.

Sec. 740.7  Computers (CTP).

    (a) Scope. License Exception CTP authorizes exports and reexports of 
computers and specially designed components therefor, exported or 
reexported separately or as part of a system for consumption in Computer 
Tier countries as provided by this section. (Related equipment 
controlled under 4A003.d and .g is authorized under this License 
Exception, only when exported or reexported with these computers as part 
of a system.) You may not use this License Exception to export or 
reexport items that you know will be used to enhance the CTP beyond the 
eligibility limit allowed to your country of destination. When 
evaluating your computer to determine License Exception CTP eligibility, 
use the CTP parameter to the exclusion of other technical parameters for 
computers classified under ECCN 4A003.a, .b and .c, except of parameters 
specified as Missile Technology (MT) concerns or 4A003.e (equipment 
performing analog-to-digital conversions exceeding the limits in ECCN 
3A001.a.5.a). This License Exception does not authorize the export or 
reexport of graphic accelerators or coprocessors, or of computers 
controlled for MT reasons.

country.
    (2) Eligible computers. The computers eligible for License Exception 
CTP to Tier 1 destinations are those having a Composite Theoretical 
Performance (CTP) greater than 6,500 Millions of Theoretical Operations 
Per Second (MTOPS).
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Computer Tier 3--(1) Eligible countries. The countries that are 
eligible to receive exports and reexports under this License Exception 
are Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
Bahrain, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, China 
(People's Republic of), Comoros, Croatia, Djibouti, Egypt, and 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Federal Republic of, Georgia, India,

    (2) Eligible computers. The computers eligible for License Exception 
CTP to Tier 3 destinations are those having a CTP greater than 6,500 
MTOPS, but less than or equal to 85,000 MTOPS, subject to the 
restrictions in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (3) Eligible exports. Only exports and reexports to permitted end-
users and end-uses located in countries in Computer Tier 3. License 
Exception CTP does not authorize exports and reexports to Computer Tier 
3 for nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile end-users and end-uses 
and military end-users and end-uses subject to license requirements 
under Sec. 744.2, Sec. 744.3, Sec. 744.4, Sec. 744.5, and Sec. 744.12 of 
the EAR. Such exports and reexports will continue to require a license 
and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Retransfers to these 
end-users and end-uses in eligible countries are strictly prohibited 
without prior authorization.
    (4) Supporting documentation. Exporters are required to obtain a 
People's Republic of China (PRC) End-User Certificate before exporting 
computers described by paragraphs (d)(5)(i)(A) or (d)(5)(i)(B) of this 
section to the PRC, regardless of value. (See Sec. 748.10(b)(3) of the 
EAR for information on obtaining the PRC End-User Certificate.) 
Exporters are required to provide the PRC End-User Certificate Number to 
BXA as part of their post-shipment report (see paragraph (d)(5)(v) of 
this section). When providing the PRC End-User Certificate Number to 
BXA, you must identify the transaction in the post shipment report to 
which that PRC End-User Certificate Number applies. The original PRC 
End-User Certificate shall be retained in the exporter's files in 
accordance with the recordkeeping provisions of Sec. 762.2 of the EAR.
    (5) NDAA notification. (i) General requirement and procedures. The 
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of FY98 (Public Law 105-85, 
111 Stat. 1629), enacted on November 18, 1997 requires advance 
notification of certain exports and reexports of computers to Computer 
Tier 3 countries. For each such transaction destined to Computer Tier 3, 
prior to using License Exception CTP, you must first notify BXA by 
submitting a completed Multipurpose Application Form (BXA-748P). The 
Multipurpose Application Form must be completed including all 
information required for a license application according to the 
instructions described in Supplement No. 1 to part 748 of the EAR, with 
two exceptions. You (the applicant as listed in Block 14) shall in Block 
5 (Type of Application) mark the box ``Other.'' This designator will 
permit BXA to route the NDAA notice into a special processing procedure. 
(Blocks 6 and 7, regarding support documentation, may be left blank.) 
BXA will not initiate the registration of an

[[Page 255]]

NDAA notice unless all information on the Multipurpose Application form 
is complete.
    (A) Prior to February 26, 2001, advance notification is required for 
all exports and reexports of computers with a CTP greater than 12,500 
but less than or equal to 85,000 MTOPS to Computer Tier 3 destinations. 
You must also provide a notice using this procedure prior to exporting 
or reexporting items that you know will be used to enhance the CTP of a 
previously exported or reexported computer beyond 12,500 MTOPS, but less 
than or equal to 85,000 MTOPS.
    (B) Beginning on February 26, 2001 but prior to March 20, 2001, 
advanced notification is required for export and reexport of computers 
with a CTP greater than 28,000 MTOPS, but less than or equal to 85,000 
MTOPS to Computer Tier 3 destinations. You must also provide a notice 
using this procedure prior to exporting or reexporting items that you 
know will be used to enhance the CTP of a previously exported or 
reexported computer beyond 28,000 MTOPS, but less than or equal to 
85,000 MTOPS.
    (ii) Action by BXA. Within 24 hours of the registration of the NDAA 
notice, BXA will refer the notice for interagency review. Registration 
is defined as the point at which the notice is entered into BXA's 
electronic system.
    (iii) Review by other departments or agencies. The Departments of 
Defense, Energy, and State have the authority to review the NDAA notice. 
Objections by any department or agency must be received by the Secretary 
of Commerce within nine days of the referral. Unlike the provisions 
described in Sec. 750.4(b) of the EAR, there are no provisions for 
stopping the processing time of the NDAA notice. If, within 10 days 
after the date of registration, any reviewing agency provides a written 
objection to the export or reexport of a computer, License Exception CTP 
may not be used. In such cases, you will be notified that a license is 
required for the export or reexport. The NDAA notice will then be 
processed by BXA as a license application in accordance to the 
provisions described in Sec. 750.4 of the EAR, and the licensing 
policies set forth in the Export Administration Regulations. Its NDAA 
notice number will be changed to a license application number. BXA may 
at this time request additional information to properly review the 
license application. If BXA confirms that no objection has been raised 
within the 10-day period (as described in paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this 
section), you may proceed with the transaction on the eleventh day 
following date of registration. (Note that the fact that you have been 
advised to proceed with the transaction does not exempt you from other 
licensing requirements under the EAR, such as those based on knowledge 
of a prohibited end-use or end-user as referenced in general prohibition 
five (part 736 of the EAR) and set forth in part 744 of the EAR.)
    (iv) Status of pending advance notification requests. You must 
contact BXA's System for Tracking Export License Applications 
(``STELA'') at (202) 482-2752. (See Sec. 750.5 of the EAR for procedures 
to access information on STELA.) STELA will provide the date of 
registration of the NDAA notice. If no departments or agencies raise 
objections within the 10-day period, STELA will provide you on the 
eleventh day following date of registration with confirmation that no 
objections have been raised and you may proceed with the transaction. 
BXA will subsequently issue written confirmation to you. If a license is 
required, STELA will notify you that an objection has been raised and a 
license is required. The NDAA notice will be processed as a license 
application. In addition, BXA may provide notice of an objection by 
telephone, fax, courier service, or other means.
    (v) Post-shipment verification. This section outlines special post-
shipment reporting requirements for exporters of certain computers to 
destinations in Computer Tier 3. Post-shipment reports must be submitted 
in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (d)(5)(v), and all 
relevant records of such exports must be kept in accordance with part 
762 of the EAR.
    (A) Exporters must file post-shipment reports for computer exports, 
as well as exports of items used to enhance previously exported or 
reexported computers, according to the following schedule:

[[Page 256]]

    (1) For exports occurring prior to February 26, 2001, where the CTP 
is greater than 12,500 MTOPS; and
    (2) For exports on or after February 26, 2001, but prior to March 
20, 2001, where the CTP is greater than 28,000 MTOPS.
    (B) Information that must be included in each post-shipment report. 
No later than the last day of the month following the month in which the 
export takes place, the exporter must submit the following information 
to BXA at the address listed in paragraph (d)(5)(v)(C) of this section:
    (1) Exporter name, address, and telephone number;
    (2) NDAA notification number;
    (3) Date of export;
    (4) End-user name, point of contact, address, telephone number;
    (5) Carrier;

    (7) Commodity description, quantities--listed by model numbers, 
serial numbers, and CTP level in MTOPS; and
    (8) Certification line for exporters to sign and date. The exporter 
must certify that the information contained in the report is accurate to 
the best of his or her knowledge.

    Note to paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section:
    For exports authorized under License Exception CTP to the People's 
Republic of China (PRC), you must submit the PRC End-User Certificate 
Number identifying the transaction for which the End-User Certificate 
Number applies.

    (C) Mailing address. A copy of the post-shipment report[s] required 
under paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section shall be delivered to one of 
the following addresses. Note that BXA will not accept reports sent 
C.O.D.

(1) For deliveries by U.S. postal service: U.S. Department of Commerce, 
    Bureau of Export Administration, P.O. Box 273, Washington, D.C.

    (e) Restrictions. (1) Access by certain foreign nationals. Computers 
eligible for License Exception CTP may not be accessed either physically 
or computationally by nationals of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, 
Sudan or Syria, except commercial consignees described in Supplement No. 
3 to part 742 of the EAR are prohibited only from giving such nationals 
user-accessible programmability.
    (2) Reexport and retransfers. Computers eligible for License 
Exception CTP may not be reexported/retransferred without prior 
authorization from BXA i.e., a license, a permissive reexport, another 
License Exception, or ``No License Required''. This restriction must be 
conveyed to the consignee, via the Destination Control Statement, see 
Sec. 758.6 of the EAR. Additionally, the end-use and end-user 
restrictions in paragraph (d)(3) of this section must be conveyed to any 
consignee in Computer Tier 3.
    (f) Reporting requirements. In addition to the reporting 
requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, see Sec. 743.1 
of the EAR for additional reporting requirements of certain items under

<R05>
Sec. 740.9  Temporary imports, exports, and reexports (TMP).

    This License Exception authorizes various temporary exports and 
reexports; exports and reexports of items temporarily in the United 
States; and exports and reexports of beta test software.
    (a) Temporary exports and reexports--(1) Scope. You may export and 
reexport commodities and software for temporary use abroad (including 
use in international waters) subject to the conditions and exclusions 
described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Commodities and software 
shipped as temporary exports or reexports under the provisions of this 
paragraph (a) must be returned to the country from which they were 
exported as soon as practicable but, except in circumstances described 
in this section, no later than one year from the date of export. This 
requirement does not apply if the commodities and software are consumed 
or destroyed in the normal course of authorized temporary use abroad or 
an extension or other disposition is permitted by the EAR or in writing 
by BXA.
    (2) Eligible commodities and software. The following commodities and 
software are eligible to be shipped under this paragraph (a):
    (i) Tools of trade. Usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of 
tools of trade (commodities and software) for use by the exporter or 
employees of the exporter in a lawful enterprise or undertaking of the 
exporter. Eligible tools of trade may include, but are not limited to, 
such equipment and software as is necessary to commission or service 
goods, provided that the equipment or software is appropriate for this 
purpose and that all goods to be commissioned or serviced are of foreign 
origin, or if subject to the EAR, have been legally exported or 
reexported. The tools of trade must remain under the effective control 
of the exporter or the exporter's employee (see part 772 of the EAR for 
a definition of ``effective control''). The shipment of tools of trade 
may accompany the individual departing from the United States or may be 
shipped unaccompanied within one month before the individual's departure 
from the United States, or at any time after departure. No tools of the 
trade may be taken to Country Group E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 
740) or Sudan. For exports under this License Exception of laptop 
computers loaded with encryption software, refer to item interpretation 
13 in Sec. 770.2 of the EAR.
    (ii) Kits consisting of replacement parts. Kits consisting of 
replacement parts may be exported or reexported to all destinations, 
except Country Group E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), provided 
that:
    (A) The parts would qualify for shipment under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section if exported as one-for-one replacements;
    (B) The kits remain under effective control of the exporter or an 
employee of the exporter; and
    (C) All parts in the kit are returned, except that one-for-one 
replacements may be made in accordance with the requirements of License 
Exception RPL and the defective parts returned (see ``parts'', 
Sec. 740.10(a) of this part).
    (iii) Exhibition and demonstration. You may export or reexport under 
this provision commodities and software for exhibition or demonstration 
in all countries except countries listed in Country Group E:1 (see 
Supplement No. 1 to this part) provided that the exporter maintains 
ownership of the commodities and software while they are abroad and 
provided that the exporter,

[[Page 258]]

an employee of the exporter, or the exporter's designated sales 
representative retains ``effective control'' over the commodities and 
software while they are abroad (see part 772 of the EAR for a definition 
of ``effective control''). The commodities and software may not be used 
for their intended purpose while abroad, except to the minimum extent 
required for effective demonstration. The commodities and software may 
not be exhibited or demonstrated at any one site more than 120 days 
after installation and debugging, unless authorized by BXA. However, 
before or after an exhibition or demonstration, pending movement to 
another site, return to the United States or the foreign reexporter, or 
BXA approval for other disposition, the commodities and software may be 
placed in a bonded warehouse or a storage facility provided that the 
exporter retains effective control over their disposition. The export 
documentation for this type of transaction must show the exporter as 
ultimate consignee, in care of the person who will have control over the 
commodities and software abroad.
    (iv) Inspection and calibration. Commodities to be inspected, 
tested, calibrated or repaired abroad may be exported or reexported to 
all destinations under this section, except Country Group E:2, Sudan or 
Syria.
    (v) Containers. Containers for which another License Exception is 
not available and that are necessary for export of commodities. However, 
this ``containers'' provision does not authorize the export of the 
container's contents, which, if not exempt from licensing, must be 
separately authorized for export under either a License Exception or a 
license.
    (vi) Broadcast material. (A) Video tape containing program material 
recorded in the country of export to be publicly broadcast in another 
country.
    (B) Blank video tape (raw stock) for use in recording program 
material abroad.
    (vii) Assembly in Mexico. Commodities to be exported to Mexico under 
Customs entries that require return to the United States after 
processing, assembly, or incorporation into end products by companies, 
factories, or facilities participating in Mexico's in-bond 
industrialization program (Maquiladora), provided that all resulting 
end-products (or the commodities themselves) are returned to the United 
States.
    (viii) News media. (A) Commodities necessary for news-gathering 
purposes (and software necessary to use such commodities) may accompany 
``accredited'' news media personnel (i.e., persons with credentials from 
a news gathering or reporting firm) to Country Groups D:1 or E:2, or 
Sudan (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) if the commodities:
    (1) Are retained under ``effective control'' of the exporting news 
gathering firm;
    (2) Remain in the physical possession of the news media personnel. 
The term physical possession for purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(2)(viii), news media, is defined as maintaining effective measures 
to prevent unauthorized access (e.g., securing equipment in locked 
facilities or hiring security guards to protect the equipment); and
    (3) Are removed with the news media personnel at the end of the 
trip.
    (B) When exporting under this paragraph (a)(2)(viii) from the United 
States, the exporter must send a copy of the packing list or similar 
identification of the exported commodities, to: U.S. Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, Office of Enforcement 
Support, Room H4069, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., 
Washington, DC 20230, or any of its field offices, specifying the 
destination and estimated dates of departure and return. The Office of 
Export Enforcement (OEE) may spot check returns to assure that the 
temporary exports and reexports provisions of this License Exception are 
being used properly.
    (C) Commodities or software necessary for news-gathering purposes 
that accompany news media personnel to all other destinations shall be 
exported or reexported under paragraph (a)(2)(i), tools of trade, of 
this section if owned by the news gathering firm, or if they are 
personal property of the individual news media personnel. Note that 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), tools of trade and (a)(2)(viii), news media, of 
this section do not preclude independent ``accredited'' contract 
personnel, who are

[[Page 259]]

under control of news gathering firms while on assignment, from 
utilizing these provisions, provided that the news gathering firm 
designate an employee of the contract firm to be responsible for the 
equipment.)
    (ix) Temporary exports to a U.S. subsidiary, affiliate or facility 
in Country Group B. (A) Components, parts, tools or test equipment 
exported by a U.S. person to its subsidiary, affiliate or facility in a 
country listed in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to this part) 
that is owned or controlled by the U.S. person, if the components, part, 
tool or test equipment is to be used for manufacture, assembly, testing, 
production or modification, provided that no components, parts, tools or 
test equipment or the direct product of such components, parts, tools or 
test equipment are transferred or reexported to a country other than the 
United States from such subsidiary, affiliate or facility without prior 
authorization by BXA.
    (B) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ix), U.S. person is 
defined as follows: an individual who is a citizen of the United States, 
an individual who is a lawful permanent resident as defined by 8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(2) or an individual who is a protected individual as defined by 
8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3). U.S. person also means any juridical person 
organized under the laws of the United States, or any jurisdiction 
within the United States (e.g., corporation, business association, 
partnership, society, trust, or any other entity, organization or group 
that is incorporated to do business in the United States).
    (3) Special restrictions. (i) Destinations. (A) No commodity or 
software may be exported or reexported under paragraph (a) of this 
section to Country Group E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to this part) except 
as permitted by paragraph (a)(2)(viii) of this section (news media). 
These destination restrictions apply to temporary exports to and for use 
on any vessel, aircraft or territory under the ownership, control, 
lease, or charter by any country in Country Group E:2, or any national 
thereof.
    (B) No commodity or software may be exported to Country Group D:1 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) except:
    (1) Commodities and software exported under paragraph (a)(2)(viii), 
news media, of this section;
    (2) Commodities and software exported under paragraph (a)(2)(i), 
tools of trade, of this section; and
    (3) Commodities exported as kits of replacement parts, consistent

    (C) These destination restrictions apply to temporary exports to and 
for use on any vessel, aircraft or territory under ownership, control, 
lease, or charter by any country in Country Group D:1 or E:2, or any 
national thereof. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.)
    (ii) Ineligible commodities or software. Commodities or software 
that will be used outside of Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to 
part 740), Iceland, or New Zealand, either directly or indirectly in any 
sensitive nuclear activity as described in Sec. 744.2 of the EAR may not 
be exported or reexported to any destination under the temporary exports 
and reexports provisions of this License Exception.
    (iii) Use or disposition. No commodity or software may be exported 
or reexported under this paragraph (a) if:
    (A) An order to acquire the commodity or software has been received 
before shipment;
    (B) The exporter has prior knowledge that the commodity or software 
will stay abroad beyond the terms described in this paragraph (a); or
    (C) The commodity or software is for lease or rental abroad.
    (4) Return or disposal of commodities and software. All commodities 
and software exported or reexported under these provisions must, if not 
consumed or destroyed in the normal course of authorized temporary use 
abroad, be returned as soon as practicable but no later than one year 
after the date of export, to the United States or other country from 
which the commodities and software were so exported, or shall be 
disposed of or retained in one of the following ways:
    (i) Permanent export or reexport. If the exporter or the reexporter 
wishes to sell or otherwise dispose of the commodities or software 
abroad, except as permitted by this or other applicable License 
Exception, the exporter must

[[Page 260]]

request authorization by submitting a license application to BXA at the 
address listed in part 748 of the EAR. (See part 748 of the EAR for more 
information on license applications.) The request should comply with all 
applicable provisions of the EAR covering export directly from the 
United States to the proposed destination. The request must also be 
supported by any documents that would be required in support of an 
application for export license for shipment of the same commodities or 
software directly from the United States to the proposed destination. 
BXA will advise the exporter of its decision.
    (ii) Use of a license. An outstanding license may also be used to 
dispose of commodities or software covered by the provisions of this 
paragraph (a), provided that the outstanding license authorizes direct 
shipment of the same commodity or software to the same new ultimate 
consignee in the new country of destination.
    (iii) Authorization to retain abroad beyond one year. If the 
exporter wishes to retain a commodity or software abroad beyond the 12 
months authorized by paragraph (a) of this section, the exporter must 
request authorization by submitting Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose 
Application, 90 days prior to the expiration of the 12 month period. The 
request must be sent to BXA at the address listed in part 748 of the EAR 
and should include the name and address of the exporter, the date the 
commodities or software were exported, a brief product description, and 
the justification for the extension. If BXA approves the extension 
request, the exporter will receive authorization for a one-time 
extension not to exceed six months. BXA normally will not allow an 
extension for commodities or software that have been abroad more than 12 
months, nor will a second six month extension be authorized. Any request 
for retaining the commodities or software abroad for a period exceeding 
18 months must be made in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) Reexports. Commodities and software legally exported from the 
United States may be reexported to a new country(ies) of destination 
under this paragraph (a) provided its terms and conditions are met and 
the commodities and software are returned to the country from which the 
reexport occurred.
    (b) Exports of items temporarily in the United States: Scope. The 
provisions of this paragraph (b) describe the conditions for exporting 
foreign-origin items temporarily in the United States. The provisions 
include the export of items moving in transit through the United States, 
imported for display at a U.S. exhibition or trade fair, returned 
because unwanted, or returned because refused entry.

    Note 1 to paragraph (b) of this section:
    A commodity withdrawn from a bonded warehouse in the United States 
under a ``withdrawal for export'' customs entry is considered as 
``moving in transit''. It is not considered as ``moving in transit'' if 
it is withdrawn from a bonded warehouse under any other type of customs 
entry or if its transit has been broken for a processing operation, 
regardless of the type of customs entry.
    Note 2 to paragraph (b) of this section:
    Items shipped on board a vessel or aircraft and passing through the 
United States from one foreign country to another may be exported 
without a license provided that (a) while passing in transit through the 
United States, they have not been unladen from the vessel or aircraft on 
which they entered, and (b) they are not originally manifested to the 
United States.)

    (1) Items moving in transit through the United States. Subject to 
the following conditions, the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section authorize export of items moving in transit through the United 
States under a Transportation and Exportation (T.& E.) customs entry or 
an Immediate Exportation (I.E.) customs entry made at a U.S. Customs 
Office.
    (i) Items controlled for national security, nuclear proliferation, 
missile technology, or chemical and biological weapons reasons may not 
be exported to Country Group D:1, 2, 3, or 4 (see Supplement No. 1 to 
part 740), respectively, under this paragraph (b)(1).
    (ii) Items may not be exported to Country Group E:2 or Sudan under 
this section.
    (iii) The following may not be exported in transit from the United 
States under this paragraph (b)(1):

Import Certificate, Form BXA-645P;
    (B) Chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350; or
    (C) Horses for export by sea (refer to short supply controls in part 
754 of the EAR).
    (iv) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) apply to all shipments from 
Canada moving in transit through the United States to any foreign 
destination, regardless of the nature of the commodities or software or 
their origin. For such shipments the customs office at the U.S. port of 
export will require a copy of Form B-13, Canadian Customs Entry, 
certified or stamped by Canadian customs authorities, except where the 
shipment is valued at less than $50.00. (In transit shipments 
originating in Canada that are exempt from U.S. licensing, or made under 
a U.S. license or other applicable U.S. License Exception do not require 
this form.) The commodity or software description, quantity, ultimate 
consignee, country of ultimate destination, and all other pertinent 
details of the shipment must be the same on a required Form B-13, as on 
Commerce Form 7513, or when Form 7513 is not required, must be the same 
as on Customs Form 7512. When there is a material difference, a 
corrected Form B-13 authorizing the shipment is required.
    (2) Items imported for display at U.S. exhibitions or trade fairs. 
Subject to the following conditions, the provisions of this paragraph 
(b)(2) authorize the export of items that were imported into the United 
States for display at an exhibition or trade fair and were either 
entered under bond or permitted temporary free import under bond 
providing for their export and are being exported in accordance with the 
terms of that bond.
    (i) Items may be exported to the country from which imported into 
the United States. However, items originally imported from Cuba may not 
be exported unless the U.S. Government had licensed the import from that 
country.
    (ii) Items may be exported to any destination other than the country 
from which imported except:
    (A) Items imported into the United States under an International 
Import Certificate;
    (B) Exports to Country Group E:2 or Sudan (see Supplement No. 1 to 
part 740); or
    (C) Exports to Country Group D:1, 2, 3, or 4 (see Supplement No. 1 
to part 740) of items controlled for national security, missile 
technology, chemical and biological weapons reasons, or nuclear 
proliferation, respectively.
    (3) Return of unwanted shipments. A foreign-origin item may be 
returned to the country from which it was imported if its 
characteristics and capabilities have not been enhanced while in the 
United States. No foreign-origin items may be returned to Cuba or Libya.
    (4) Return of shipments refused entry. Shipments of items refused 
entry by the U.S. Customs Service, the Food and Drug Administration, or 
other U.S. Government agency may be returned to the country of origin, 
except to:
    (i) A destination in Cuba or Libya; or
    (ii) A destination from which the shipment has been refused entry 
because of the Foreign Assets Control Regulations of the Treasury 
Department, unless such return is licensed or otherwise authorized by 
the Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (31 CFR part 
500).
    (c) Exports of beta test software--(1) Scope. The provisions of 
paragraph (c) authorize exports and reexports to eligible countries of 
beta test software intended for distribution to the general public.
    (2) Eligible countries. The countries that are eligible to receive

E:2. In addition, encryption software under ECCN 5D002 is further 
restricted from being exported or reexported to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, 
North Korea, Sudan or Syria.
    (3) Eligible software. All software that is controlled by the 
Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR), and 
under Commerce licensing jurisdiction, is eligible for export and 
reexport, subject to the restrictions of this paragraph (c). Encryption 
software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 is eligible for 
export

[[Page 262]]

and reexport under this paragraph (c) provided the exporter has 
submitted by the time of export the information described in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of Supplement 6 to Part 742 to BXA, with a copy to the 
ENC Encryption Request Coordinator. The names and addresses of the 
testing consignees, except names and addresses of individual consumers, 
and the name and version of the beta software should be reported 
consistent with Sec. 740.17(e)(5). Any final product must be reviewed 
and classified under the requirements of Sec. 740.17.
    (4) Conditions for use. Any beta test software program may be 
exported or reexported to eligible countries if all of the conditions 
under this section are met:
    (i) The software producer intends to market the software to the 
general public after completion of the beta testing, as described in the 
General Software Note found in Supplement 2 to Part 774 or the 
Cryptography Note in Category 5--part II of the Commerce Control List 
(Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR);
    (ii) The software producer provides the software to the testing 
consignee free-of-charge or at a price that does not exceed the cost of 
reproduction and distribution; and
    (iii) The software is designed for installation by the end-user

    (5) Importer Statement. Prior to shipping any eligible software, the 
exporter or reexporter must obtain the following statement from the 
testing consignee, which may be included in a contract, non-disclosure 
agreement, or other document that identifies the importer, the software 
to be exported, the country of destination, and the testing consignee.

    We certify that this beta test software will only be used for beta 
testing purposes, and will not be rented, leased, sold, sublicensed, 
assigned, or otherwise transferred. Further, we certify that we will not 
transfer or export any product, process, or service that is the direct 
product of the beta test software.

    (6) Use limitations. Only testing consignees that provide the 
importer statement required by paragraph (c)(5) of this section may 
execute any software received.
    (7) Return or disposal of software. All beta test software exported 
must be destroyed abroad or returned to the exporter within 30 days of 
the end of the beta test period as defined by the software producer or, 
if the software producer does not define a test period, within 30 days 
of completion of the consignee's role in the test. Among other methods, 
this requirement may be satisfied by a software module that will destroy 
the software and all its copies at or before the end of the beta test 
period.

Sec. 740.10  Servicing and replacement of parts and equipment (RPL).

    This License Exception authorizes exports and reexports associated 
with one-for-one replacement of parts or servicing and replacement of 
equipment.
    (a) Parts--(1) Scope. The provisions of this paragraph (a) authorize 
the export and reexport of one-for-one replacement parts for previously 
exported equipment.
    (2) One-for-one replacement of parts. (i) The term replacement parts 
as used in this section means parts needed for the immediate repair of 
equipment, including replacement of defective or worn parts. (It 
includes subassemblies but does not include test instruments or 
operating supplies). (The term subassembly means a number of components 
assembled to perform a specific function or functions within a 
commodity. One example would be printed circuit boards with components 
mounted thereon. This definition does not include major subsystems such 
as those composed of a number of subassemblies.) Items that improve or 
change the basic design characteristics, e.g., as to accuracy, 
capability, performance or productivity, of the equipment upon which 
they are installed, are not deemed to be replacement parts. For kits 
consisting of replacement parts, consult Sec. 740.9(a)(2)(ii) of this 
part.

[[Page 263]]

    (ii) Parts may be exported only to replace, on a one-for-one basis, 
parts contained in commodities that were: legally exported from the 
United States; legally reexported; or made in a foreign country 
incorporating authorized U.S.-origin parts. The conditions of the 
original U.S. authorization must not have been violated. Accordingly, 
the export of replacement parts may be made only by the party who 
originally exported or reexported the commodity to be repaired, or by a 
party that has confirmed the appropriate authority for the original 
transaction.
    (iii) The parts to be replaced must either be destroyed abroad or 
returned promptly to the person who supplied the replacement parts, or 
to a foreign firm that is under the effective control of that person.
    (3) Exclusions. (i) No replacement parts may be exported to repair a 
commodity exported under a license if that license included a condition 
that any subsequent replacement parts must be exported only under a 
license.
    (ii) No parts may be exported to be held abroad as spare parts or 
equipment for future use. Replacement parts may be exported to replace 
spare parts that were authorized to accompany the export of equipment, 
as those spare parts are utilized in the repair of the equipment. This 
will allow maintenance of the stock of spares at a consistent level as 
parts are used.
    (iii) No parts may be exported to any destination except Iceland, 
New Zealand, or the countries listed in Country Group A:1 (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740) if the item is to be incorporated into or 
used in nuclear weapons, nuclear explosive devices, nuclear testing 
related to activities described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR, the 
chemical processing of irradiated special nuclear or source material, 
the production of heavy water, the separation of isotopes of source and 
special nuclear materials, or the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel 
containing plutonium, as described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR.
    (iv) No replacement parts may be exported to countries in Country 
Group E:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to this part) (countries designated by 
the Secretary of State as supporting acts of international terrorism) if 
the commodity to be repaired is an ``aircraft'' (as defined in part 772 
of the EAR) or national security controlled commodity.
    (v) The conditions described in this paragraph (a)(3) relating to 
replacement of parts do not apply to reexports to a foreign country of 
parts as replacements in foreign-origin products, if at the time the 
replacements are furnished, the foreign-origin product is eligible for 
export to such country under any of the License Exceptions in this part 
or the exceptions in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR.
    (4) Reexports. Parts exported from the United States may be 
reexported to a new country of destination, provided that the 
restrictions described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section are 
met. A party reexporting U.S.-origin one-for-one replacement parts shall 
ensure that the commodities being repaired were shipped to their present 
location in accordance with U.S. law and continue to be legally used, 
and that either before or promptly after reexport of the replacement 
parts, the replaced parts are either destroyed or returned to the United 
States, or to the foreign firm in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 
to part 740) that shipped the replacement parts.
    (b) Servicing and replacement--(1) Scope. The provisions of this 
paragraph (b) authorize the export and reexport of items that were 
returned to the United States for servicing and the replacement of 
defective or unacceptable U.S.-origin commodities and software.
    (2) Commodities and software sent to a United States or foreign 
party for servicing.
    (i) Definition. Servicing as used in this section means inspection, 
testing, calibration or repair, including overhaul and reconditioning. 
The servicing shall not have improved or changed the basic 
characteristics, e.g., as to accuracy, capability, performance, or 
productivity of the commodity or software as originally authorized for 
export or reexport.
    (ii) Return of serviced commodities and software. When the serviced 
commodity or software is returned, it may include any replacement or 
rebuilt parts necessary to its repair and may be accompanied by any 
spare part, tool, accessory, or other item that was sent with it for 
servicing.

[[Page 264]]

    (iii) Commodities and software imported from Country Group D:1 
except the PRC and North Korea. Commodities and software legally 
exported or reexported to a consignee in Country Group D:1 (except the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) and North Korea) (see Supplement No. 1 
to part 740) that are sent to the United States or a foreign party for 
servicing may be returned to the country from which it was sent, 
provided that both of the following conditions are met:
    (A) The exporter making the shipment is the same person or firm to 
whom the original license was issued; and
    (B) The end-use and the end-user of the serviced commodities or 
software and other particulars of the transaction, as set forth in the 
application and supporting documentation that formed the basis for 
issuance of the license have not changed.
    (iv) Terrorist supporting countries. No repaired commodity or 
software may be exported or reexported to countries in Country Group E:1 
(see Supplement No. 1 to this part).
    (3) Replacements for defective or unacceptable U.S.-origin 
equipment. (i) Subject to the following conditions, commodities or 
software may be exported or reexported to replace defective or otherwise 
unusable (e.g., erroneously supplied) items.
    (A) The commodity or software to be replaced must have been 
previously exported or reexported in its present form under a license or 
authorization granted by BXA.
    (B) No commodity or software may be exported or reexported to 
replace equipment that is worn out from normal use, nor may any 
commodity or software be exported to be held in stock abroad as spare 
equipment for future use.
    (C) The replacement item may not improve the basic characteristic, 
e.g., as to accuracy, capability, performance, or productivity, of the 
equipment as originally approved for export or reexport under a license 
issued by BXA.
    (D) No shipment may be made to countries in Country Group E:1 (see 
Supplement No. 1 to this part), or to any other destination to replace 
defective or otherwise unusable equipment owned or controlled by, or 
leased or chartered to, a national of any of those countries.
    (ii) Special conditions applicable to exports to Country Group B and 
Country Group D:1. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) In addition to 
the general conditions in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the 
following conditions apply to exports or reexports of replacements for 
defective or unacceptable U.S.-origin commodities or software to a 
destination in Country Group B or Country Group D:1:
    (A) By making such an export or reexport, the exporter represents 
that all the requirements of this paragraph (b) have been met and 
undertakes to destroy or return the replaced parts as provided in 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (B) The defective or otherwise unusable equipment must be replaced 
free of charge, except for transportation and labor charges. If 
exporting to the countries listed in Country Group D:1 (except the PRC), 
the exporter shall replace the commodity or software within the warranty 
period or within 12 months of its shipment to the ultimate consignee in 
the country of destination, whichever is shorter.
    (C) The commodity or software to be replaced must either be 
destroyed abroad or returned to the United States, or to a foreign firm 
in Country Group B that is under the effective control of the exporter, 
or to the foreign firm that is providing the replacement part or 
equipment. The destruction or return must be effected before, or 
promptly after, the replacement item is exported from the United States.
    (D) A party reexporting replacements for defective or unacceptable 
U.S.-origin equipment must ensure that the commodities or software being 
replaced were shipped to their present location in accordance with U.S. 
law and continue to be legally used.

Sec. 740.12  Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT).

    (a) Gift parcels--(1) Scope. The provisions of paragraph (a) 
authorize exports and reexports of gift parcels by an individual (donor) 
addressed to an individual, or a religious, charitable or educational 
organization (donee) located in any destination for the use of the donee 
or the donee's immediate family (and not for resale). The gift parcel 
must be provided free of charge to the donee. However, payment by the 
donee of any handling charges or of any fees levied by the importing 
country (e.g., import duties, taxes, etc.) is not considered to be a 
cost to the donee for purposes of this definition of ``gift parcel.''

    Note to paragraph (a) of this section:
    A gift parcel, within the context of this paragraph (a), does not 
include multiple parcels exported in a single shipment for delivery to 
individuals residing in a foreign country. Such multiple gift parcels, 
if subject to the General Prohibitions described in Sec. 734.2(b) of the 
EAR, must be licensed by BXA. (See Supplement No. 2 to part 748 of the 
EAR for licensing of multiple gift parcels).

    (2) Commodity, value and other limitations--(i) Eligible 
commodities. The eligible commodities are as follows:
    (A) The commodity must not be controlled for chemical and biological 
weapons (CB), missile technology (MT), national security (NS), or 
nuclear proliferation (NP) (see Commerce Control List, part 774 of the 
EAR); and
    (B) The commodity must be of a type and in quantities normally given 
as gifts between individuals.
    (1) For Cuba, the only commodities that may be included in a gift 
parcel are the following items: food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, 
medical supplies and devices, hospital supplies and equipment, equipment 
for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary 
medicines and supplies, fishing equipment and supplies, soap-making 
equipment, and in addition receive-only radio equipment for reception of 
commercial/civil AM/FM and short wave publicly available frequency 
bands, and batteries for such equipment.
    (2) For all other destinations, eligible commodities include all 
items described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(1) of this section as well as 
all other items normally sent as gifts. Gold bullion, gold taels, and 
gold bars are prohibited as are items intended for resale or reexport.

    Example to paragraph (a) of this section. A watch or piece of 
jewelry is normally sent as a gift. However, multiple watches, either in 
one package or in subsequent shipments, would not quality for such gift 
parcels because the quantity exceeds that normally given between 
individuals. Similarly, a sewing machine or bicycle, within the dollar 
limits of this License Exception, may be an appropriate gift. However, 
subsequent shipments of the same item to the same donee would not be a 
gift normally given between individuals.

    (3) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, clothing 
is appropriate, except that export of military wearing apparel to 
Country Group D:1 or E:2 under this License Exception

[[Page 270]]

is specifically prohibited, regardless of whether all distinctive U.S. 
military insignia, buttons, and other markings are removed.
    (ii) Import requirements. The commodities must be acceptable in type 
and quantity by the recipient country for import as gifts. Commodities 
exceeding the import limits may not be included in gift parcels.
    (iii) Frequency. Except for gift parcels of food to Cuba, not more 
than one gift parcel may be sent from the same donor to the same donee 
in any one calendar month. Parties seeking authorization to exceed this 
limit due to compelling humanitarian concerns (e.g., gifts of medicine 
to relatives) should submit a license application (BXA-748P) with 
complete justification.
    (iv) Value. The combined total domestic retail value of all 
commodities included in a gift parcel may not exceed $400, except for 
gift parcels to Cuba where the value of non-food items may not exceed 
$200. There is no dollar value limit on food contained in a gift parcel 
to Cuba.
    (3) How to export gift parcels. (i) A gift parcel must be sent 
directly to the donee by the individual donor, or for such donor by a 
commercial or other gift-forwarding service or organization. Each gift 
parcel must show, on the outside wrapper, the name and address of the 
donor, as well as the name and address of the donee, regardless of 
whether sent by the donor or by a forwarding service.
    (ii) Each parcel must have the notation ``GIFT--Export License Not 
Required'' written on the addressee side of the package and the symbol 
``GFT'' written on any required customs declaration.
    (b) Humanitarian donations--(1) Scope. The provisions of paragraph 
(b) authorize exports or reexports by groups or organizations of 
donations to meet basic human needs when those groups or organizations 
have experience in maintaining a verifiable system of distribution that 
ensures delivery to the intended beneficiaries.
    (2) Basic human needs. Basic human needs are defined as those 
requirements essential to individual well-being: health, food, clothing, 
shelter, and education. These needs are considered to extend beyond 
those of an emergency nature and those that meet direct needs for mere 
subsistence.
    (3) Eligible donors. Eligible donors are U.S. charitable 
organizations that have an established record of involvement in donative 
programs and experience in maintaining and verifying a system of 
distribution to ensure delivery of commodities and software to the 
intended beneficiaries. Eligible distribution arrangements may consist 
of any one or more of the following:
    (i) A permanent staff maintained in the recipient country to monitor 
the receipt and distribution of the donations to the intended 
beneficiaries;
    (ii) Periodic spot-checks in the recipient country by members of the 
exporter's staff; or
    (iii) An agreement to utilize the services of a charitable 
organization that has a monitoring system in place.
    (4) Donations. To qualify for export under the provisions of this 
paragraph (b), the items must be provided free of charge to the 
beneficiary. The payment by the beneficiary, however, of normal handling 
charges or fees levied by the importing country (e.g., import duties, 
taxes, etc.) is not considered to be a cost to the beneficiary for 
purposes of this paragraph (b).
    (5) Ineligible commodities and software. The following commodities 
and software are not eligible:
    (i) Commodities and software controlled for national security, 
chemical or biological weapons, and nuclear nonproliferation, missile 
technology or crime control reasons (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of 
the EAR);
    (ii) Exports for large-scale projects of the kind associated with 
comprehensive economic growth, such as dams and hydroelectric plants; or
    (iii) Exports to Cuba of medical items excluded by Sec. 746.2(a)(3) 
of the EAR.
    (6) Eligible items. Eligible commodities and software are those 
listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 740.
    (7) Additional recordkeeping requirements. In addition to the 
recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR, donors must keep 
records containing the following information:

[[Page 271]]

    (i) The donor organization's identity and past experience as an 
exporter of goods to meet basic human needs;
    (ii) Past and current countries to which the donative programs have 
been and are being directed, with particular reference to donative 
programs in embargoed destinations;
    (iii) Types of projects and commodities involved in the donative 
programs;
    (iv) Specific class(es) of beneficiaries of particular donated goods 
intended to be exported under this License Exception; and
    (v) Information concerning the source of funding for the donative 
programs and the projected annual value of exports of humanitarian 
donations.

Sec. 740.13  Technology and software--unrestricted (TSU)

    This license exception authorizes exports and reexports of operation 
technology and software; sales technology and software; software updates 
(bug fixes); ``mass market'' software subject to the General Software 
Note; and unrestricted encryption source code. Note that encryption 
software is not subject to the General Software Note (see paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section).
    (a) Operation technology and software--(1) Scope. The provisions of 
paragraph (a) permit exports and reexports of operation technology and 
software. ``Operation technology'' is the minimum technology necessary 
for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking), and repair of 
those products that are lawfully exported or reexported under a license, 
a License Exception, or NLR. The ``minimum necessary'' operation 
technology does not include technology for development or production and 
includes use technology only to the extent required to ensure safe and 
efficient use of the product. Individual entries in the software and 
technology subcategories of the CCL may further restrict the export or 
reexport of operation technology.
    (2) Provisions and destinations--(i) Provisions. Operation software 
may be exported or reexported provided that both of the following 
conditions are met:
    (A) The operation software is the minimum necessary to operate 
equipment authorized for export or reexport; and
    (B) The operation software is in object code.
    (ii) Destinations. Operation software and technology may be exported 
or reexported to any destination to which the equipment for which it is 
required has been or is being legally exported or reexported.
    (b) Sales technology--(1) Scope. The provisions of paragraph (b) 
authorize exports and reexports of sales technology. ``Sales 
technology'' is data supporting a prospective or actual quotation, bid, 
or offer to sell, lease, or otherwise supply any item.
    (2) Provisions and destinations--(i) Provisions. Sales technology 
may be exported or reexported provided that:
    (A) The technology is a type customarily transmitted with a 
prospective or actual quotation, bid, or offer in accordance with 
established business practice; and
    (B) Neither the export nor the reexport will disclose the detailed 
design, production, or manufacture technology, or the means of 
reconstruction, of either the quoted item or its product. The purpose of 
this limitation is to prevent disclosure of technology so detailed that 
the consignee could reduce the technology to production.
    (ii) Destinations. Sales technology may be exported or reexported to 
any destination.

    Note: Neither this section nor its use means that the U.S. 
Government intends, or is committed, to approve a license application 
for any commodity, plant, software, or technology that may be the 
subject of the transaction to which such quotation, bid, or offer 
relates. Exporters are advised to include in any quotations, bids, or 
offers, and in any contracts entered into pursuant to such quotations, 
bids, or offers, a provision relieving themselves of liability in the 
event that a license (when required) is not approved by the Bureau of 
Export Administration.

    (c) Software updates. The provisions of paragraph (c) authorize 
exports and reexports of software updates that are intended for and are 
limited to correction of errors (``fixes'' to ``bugs'') in

[[Page 272]]

software lawfully exported or reexported (original software). Such 
software updates may be exported or reexported only to the same 
consignee to whom the original software was exported or reexported, and 
such software updates may not enhance the functional capacities of the 
original software. Such software updates may be exported or reexported 
to any destination to which the software for which they are required has 
been legally exported or reexported.
    (d) General Software Note: ``mass market'' software--(1) Scope. The 
provisions of paragraph (d) authorize exports and reexports of ``mass 
market'' software subject to the General Software Note (see Supplement 
No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR; also referenced in this section).
    (2) Software not eligible for this license exception. This license 
exception is not available for certain encryption software controlled 
under ECCN 5D002. (Refer to the Cryptography Note in Category 5--Part 2 
of the Commerce Control List for information on Mass Market Encryption 
commodities and software. Also refer to Secs. 742.15(b)(1) and 748.3(b) 
of the EAR for information on item classifications for release from 
``EI'' controls and ``NS'' controls).
    (3) Provisions and destinations--
    (i) Destinations. ``Mass market'' software is available to all 
destinations except destinations in Country Group E:1 (see Supplement 
No. 1 to this part).
    (ii) Provisions. ``Mass market'' treatment is available for software 
that is generally available to the public by being:
    (A) Sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction, 
by means of:
    (1) Over the counter transactions;
    (2) Mail order transactions; or
    (3) Telephone call transactions; and
    (B) Designed for installation by the user without further 
substantial support by the supplier.
    (e) Unrestricted encryption source code. (1) Encryption source code 
controlled under ECCN 5D002, which would be considered publicly 
available under Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR and which is not subject to 
an express agreement for the payment of a licensing fee or royalty for 
commercial production or sale of any product developed with the source 
code is released from EI controls and may be exported or reexported 
without review under License Exception TSU, provided you have submitted 
written notification to BXA of the Internet location (e.g., URL or 
Internet address) or a copy of the source code by the time of export. 
Send the notification to BXA at crypt@bxa.doc.gov with a copy to ENC 
Encryption Request Coordinator, or see Sec. 740.17(e)(5) for the mailing 
addresses. Intellectual property protection (e.g., copyright, patent or 
trademark) will not, by itself, be construed as an express agreement for 
the payment of a licensing fee or royalty for commercial production or 
sale of any product developed using the source code.
    (2) Object code resulting from the compiling of source code which 
would be considered publicly available can be exported under TSU if the 
requirements of this section are otherwise met and no fee or payment 
(other than reasonable and customary fees for reproduction and 
distribution) is required for the object code. See Sec. 740.17(b)(4)(i) 
for the treatment of object code where a fee or payment is required.
    (3) You may not knowingly export or reexport source code or products 
developed with this source code to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, 
Sudan or Syria.
    (4) Posting of the source code or corresponding object code on the 
Internet (e.g., FTP or World Wide Web site) where it may be downloaded 
by anyone would not establish ``knowledge'' of a prohibited export or 
reexport, including that described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 
In addition, such posting would not trigger ``red flags'' necessitating 
the affirmative duty to inquire under the ``Know Your Customer'' 
guidance provided in Supplement No. 3 to part 732 of the EAR.

Sec. 740.14  Baggage (BAG).

    (a) Scope. This License Exception authorizes individuals leaving the 
United

[[Page 273]]

States either temporarily (i.e., traveling) or longer-term (i.e., 
moving) and crew members of exporting or reexporting carriers to take to 
any destination, as personal baggage, the classes of commodities and 
software described in this section.
    (b) Eligibility. Individuals leaving the United States may export or 
reexport any of the following commodities or software for personal use 
of the individuals or members of their immediate families traveling with 
them to any destination or series of destinations. Individuals leaving 
the United States temporarily (i.e., traveling) must bring back items 
exported and reexported under this License Exception unless they consume 
the items abroad or are otherwise authorized to dispose of them under 
the EAR. Crew members may export or reexport only commodities and 
software described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section to 
any destination.
    (1) Personal effects. Usual and reasonable kinds and quantities for 
personal use of wearing apparel, articles of personal adornment, toilet 
articles, medicinal supplies, food, souvenirs, games, and similar 
personal effects, and their containers.
    (2) Household effects. Usual and reasonable kinds and quantities for 
personal use of furniture, household effects, household furnishings, and 
their containers.
    (3) Vehicles. Usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of vehicles, 
such as passenger cars, station wagons, trucks, trailers, motorcycles, 
bicycles, tricycles, perambulators, and their containers.
    (4) Tools of trade. Usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of 
tools, instruments, or equipment and their containers for use in the 
trade, occupation, employment, vocation, or hobby of the traveler or 
members of the household being moved. For special provisions regarding 
encryption items subject to EI controls, see paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (c) Limits on eligibility. The export of any commodity or software 
is limited or prohibited, if the kind or quantity is in excess of the 
limits described in this section. In addition, the commodities or 
software must be:
    (1) Owned by the individuals (or by members of their immediate 
families) or by crew members of exporting carriers on the dates they 
depart from the United States;
    (2) Intended for and necessary and appropriate for the use of the 
individuals or members of their immediate families traveling with them, 
or by the crew members of exporting carriers;
    (3) Not intended for sale or other disposal; and
    (4) Not exported under a bill of lading as cargo if exported by crew 
members.
    (d) Special provision: unaccompanied baggage. Individuals departing 
the United States may ship unaccompanied baggage, which is baggage sent 
from the United States on a carrier other than that on which an 
individual departs. Crew members of exporting carriers may not ship 
unaccompanied baggage. Unaccompanied shipments under this License 
Exception shall be clearly marked ``BAGGAGE.'' Shipments of 
unaccompanied baggage may be made at the time of, or within a reasonable 
time before or after departure of the consignee or owner from the United 
States. Personal baggage controlled for chemical and biological weapons 
(CB), missile technology (MT), national security (NS) or nuclear 
nonproliferation (NP) must be shipped within 3 months before or after 
the month in which the consignee or owner departs the United States. 
However, commodities controlled for CB, MT, NS, or NP may not be 
exported under this License Exception to Country Groups D:1, D:2, D:3, 
D:4, E:2, or Sudan. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) No items 
controlled for EI reasons may be exported or reexported as unaccompanied 
baggage.
    (e) Special provisions: shotguns and shotgun shells. (1) A United 
States citizen or a permanent resident alien leaving the United States 
may export or reexport shotguns with a barrel length of 18 inches or 
over and shotgun shells under this License Exception, subject to the 
following limitations:
    (i) Not more than three shotguns may be taken on any one trip.
    (ii) The shotguns and shotgun shells must be with the person's 
baggage but they may not be mailed.
    (iii) The shotguns and shotgun shells must be for the person's 
exclusive use

[[Page 274]]

for legitimate hunting or lawful sporting purposes, scientific purposes, 
or personal protection, and not for resale or other transfer of 
ownership or control. Accordingly, except as provided in (e)(2) of this 
section, shotguns may not be exported permanently under this License 
Exception. All shotguns and unused shotgun shells must be returned to 
the United States. Note that since certain countries may require an 
Import Certificate or a U.S. export license before allowing the import 
of a shotgun, you should determine the import requirements of your 
country of destination in advance.
    (2) A nonresident alien leaving the United States may export or 
reexport under this License Exception only such shotguns and shotgun 
shells as he or she brought into the United States under the provisions 
of Department of Treasury Regulations (27 CFR 178.115(d)).
    (f) Special provisions: encryption software subject to EI controls. 
(1) Only a U.S. citizen or permanent resident as defined by 8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(20) may permanently export or reexport encryption items 
controlled for EI reasons under this License Exception.
    (2) The U.S. citizen or permanent resident must maintain effective 
control of the encryption items controlled for EI reasons.
    (3) The encryption items controlled for EI reasons may not be 
exported or reexported to Country Group E:2, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or

of foreign registry civil aircraft on temporary sojourn in the United 
States and of U.S. civil aircraft for temporary sojourn abroad; the 
export of equipment and spare parts for permanent use on a vessel or 
aircraft; and exports to vessels or planes of U.S. or Canadian registry 
and U.S. or Canadian Airlines' installations or agents. Generally, no 
License Exception symbol is necessary for export clearance purposes; 
however, when necessary, the symbol ``AVS'' may be used.
    (a) Aircraft on temporary sojourn--(1) Foreign registered aircraft. 
An operating civil aircraft of foreign registry that has been in the 
United States on a temporary sojourn may depart from the United States 
under its own power for any destination, provided that:
    (i) No sale or transfer of operational control of the aircraft to 
nationals of a destination in Country Group E:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to 
this part) has occurred while in the United States;
    (ii) The aircraft is not departing for the purpose of sale or 
transfer of operational control to nationals of a destination in Country 
Group E:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to this part); and
    (iii) It does not carry from the United States any item for which an 
export license is required and has not been granted by the U.S. 
Government.
    (2) U.S. registered aircraft. (i) A civil aircraft of U.S. registry 
operating under an Air Carrier Operating Certificate, Commercial

    (3) Criteria. The following nine criteria each must be met if the 
flight is to qualify as a temporary sojourn. To be considered a 
temporary sojourn, the flight must not be for the purpose of sale or 
transfer of operational control. An export is for the transfer of 
operational control unless the exporter retains each of the following 
indicia of control:
    (i) Hiring of cockpit crew. Right to hire and fire the cockpit crew.
    (ii) Dispatch of aircraft. Right to dispatch the aircraft.
    (iii) Selection of routes. Right to determine the aircraft's routes 
(except for contractual commitments entered into by the exporter for 
specifically designated routes).

aircraft, and ship and plane stores--(1) Vessel. Equipment and spare 
parts for permanent use on a vessel, when necessary for the proper 
operation of such vessel, may be exported or reexported for use on board 
a vessel of any registry, except a vessel registered in Country Group 
D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), Cuba, or owned or controlled by, 
or under charter or lease to any of these countries or their nationals. 
In addition, other equipment and services for necessary repair to 
fishing and fishery support vessels of Country Group D:1 may be exported

    (2) The commodities being reexported are not controlled for NP, CB, 
MT, SI, or CC reasons; and
    (3) The reexport is destined to either:
    (i) A country in Country Group B that is not also included in 
Country Group D:2, D:3, or D:4; Cambodia; or Laos; and the commodity 
being reexported is both controlled for national security reasons and 
not controlled for export to Country Group A:1; or
    (ii) A country in Country Group D:1 (National Security) (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740), other than Cambodia, Laos, or North Korea 
and the commodity being reexported is controlled for national security

Sec. 740.17  Encryption commodities and software (ENC).

    License Exception ENC authorizes the export and reexport of 
encryption items classified under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002 and 5E002. No 
encryption item(s) may be exported under this license exception to Cuba, 
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. Reporting requirements 
apply to exports made under the authority of License Exception ENC; see 
paragraph (e) of this section for these requirements.
    (a) Exports and reexports of encryption items. Exports and reexports 
of encryption items classified under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002 and 5E002 are 
authorized to any end-user located in the countries listed in Supplement 
3 to this part 740, except for exports of cryptanalytic items (as 
defined in Part 772 of the EAR) to government end-users. These items may 
also be exported or reexported to any destination for the internal use 
of foreign subsidiaries or offices of firms, organizations and 
governments headquartered in Canada or in countries listed in Supplement 
3 to this part 740.
    (b) For all other countries, you may export and reexport encryption 
commodities, software and components (as defined in part 772 of the EAR) 
under the provisions of License Exception ENC as enumerated in this 
section. For exports and reexports of encryption items which contain an 
open cryptographic interface (as defined in part 772 of the EAR), see 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (1) Encryption items for U.S. subsidiaries. Exports and reexports of 
any encryption item classified under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002 and 5E002 of any 
key length are authorized to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies (as 
defined in part 772 of the EAR) without review and classification. This 
includes source code and technology for internal company use, such as 
the development of new products. License Exception ENC also authorizes 
transfers by U.S. companies of encryption technology controlled under 
5E002 to foreign nationals in the United States, (except nationals of 
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria) for internal 
company use, including the development of new products. All items 
produced or developed by U.S. subsidiaries with encryption commodities, 
software and technology exported under this paragraph are subject to the 
EAR and require review and classification before any sale or retransfer 
outside of the U.S. company.
    (2) Encryption commodities and software. (i) Exports and reexports 
of any encryption commodity, general purpose toolkit, software and 
component are authorized after review and classification by BXA under 
ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002 to any individual, commercial firm or other non-
government end-user outside the countries (except Cuba, Iraq, Iran, 
Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria) listed in Supplement 3 to this part 
740. Encryption products classified under this paragraph require a 
license before export and reexport to governments (as defined in part 
772 of the EAR) outside the countries listed in Supplement 3 to this 
part 740. The restriction limiting exports or reexports to internal 
company proprietary use is removed.
    (ii) Certain restrictions apply to Internet and telecommunications 
service providers. Internet and telecommunications service providers can 
obtain and use any encryption product for their internal use and to 
provide any service under License Exception ENC. However, a license is 
required for the use of any product not classified as retail to provide 
services specific to government end-users outside the countries listed 
in Supplement 3 to this part 740, e.g., WAN, LAN, VPN, voice and 
dedicated-link services; application specific and e-commerce services 
and PKI encryption services specifically for government end-users.
    (3) Retail encryption commodities and software. Exports and 
reexports to any end-user of encryption commodities, software and 
components are authorized after review and classification by

[[Page 279]]

BXA as retail under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Encryption products exported 
or reexported under this paragraph (b)(3) can be used to provide 
services to any entity. Internet or telecommunications service providers 
can obtain retail products under License Exception ENC and use them to 
provide any service to any entity. Retail encryption commodities, 
software and components are products:
    (i) Generally available to the public by means of any of the 
following:
    (A) Sold in tangible form through retail outlets independent of the 
manufacturer;
    (B) Specifically designed for individual consumer use and sold or 
transferred through tangible or intangible means; or
    (C) Which are sold or will be sold in large volume without 
restriction through mail order transactions, electronic transactions, or 
telephone call transactions; and
    (ii) Meeting all of the following:
    (A) The cryptographic functionality cannot be easily changed by the 
user;
    (B) Substantial support is not required for installation and use;
    (C) The cryptographic functionality has not been modified or 
customized to customer specification; and
    (D) Are not network infrastructure products such as high end routers 
or switches designed for large volume communications.
    (iii) Subject to the criteria in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, retail encryption products include (but are not limited 
to) general purpose operating systems and their associated user-
interface client software or general purpose operating systems with 
embedded networking and server capabilities; non-programmable encryption 
chips and chips that are constrained by design for retail products; low-
end routers, firewalls and networking or cable equipment designed for 
small office or home use; programmable database management systems and 
associated application servers; low-end servers and application-specific 
servers (including client-server applications, e.g., Secure Socket Layer 
(SSL)-based applications) that interface directly with the user; and 
encryption products distributed without charge or through free or 
anonymous downloads.
    (iv) Encryption products and network-based applications which 
provide functionality equivalent to other encryption products classified 
as retail will be considered retail.
    (v) 56-bit products with key exchange mechanisms greater than 512 
bits and up to and including 1024 bits, or equivalent products not 
classified as mass market, or finance-specific encryption commodities 
and software of any key length restricted by design (e.g., highly field-
formatted with validation procedures and not easily diverted to other 
end-uses) and used to secure financial communications such as electronic 
commerce may be exported under the retail provisions of this section 
immediately after submitting a completed classification request to BXA.
    (vi) Items which would be controlled only because they incorporate 
components or software which provide short-range wireless encryption 
functions may be exported without review and classification by BXA and 
without reporting under the retail provisions of this section.
    (4) Commercial encryption source code. Exports and reexports of 
encryption source code not released under Sec. 740.13(e) are authorized 
subject to the following provisions:
    (i) Encryption source code which would be considered publicly 
available under Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR and which is subject to an 
express agreement for the payment of a licensing fee or royalty for 
commercial production or sale of any product developed using the source 
code (or object code resulting from compiling of any encryption such 
source code which would be considered publicly available) can be 
exported or reexported using License Exception ENC to any end-user 
without review and classification provided you have submitted to BXA 
(with a copy to the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator) by the time of 
export, written notification of the Internet location (e.g. URL or 
Internet address) or a copy of the source code. You may not knowingly 
export or reexport source code, object code or products developed with 
this source code to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan or 
Syria. Posting

[[Page 280]]

of the source code or corresponding object code on the Internet (e.g., 
FTP or World Wide Web site) where it may be downloaded by anyone would 
not establish ``knowledge'' of a prohibited export or reexport. In 
addition, such posting would not trigger ``red flags'' necessitating the 
affirmative duty to inquire under the ``Know Your Customer'' guidance 
provided in Supplement No. 3 to part 732 of the EAR.
    (ii) Encryption source code which would not be considered publicly 
available and which does not include source code that when compiled 
provides an open cryptographic interface (see paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section), may be exported or reexported using License Exception ENC to 
any individual, commercial firm or other non-government end-user after 
submitting a complete classification request to BXA with a copy to the 
ENC Coordinator.
    (5) Cryptographic interfaces. (i) Exports or reexports of encryption 
commodities, software and components which provide an open cryptographic 
interface (as defined in part 772 of the EAR) may be exported under 
License Exception ENC to any end-user located in any country listed in 
Supplement 3 to this part 740. Exports or reexports to other 
destinations of encryption commodities, software and components which 
provide an open cryptographic interface are not eligible to use License 
Exception ENC and require a license (unless exported to a subsidiary of 
a U.S. company under paragraph (b)(1) of this section). This does not 
apply to source code that would be considered publicly available under 
Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR.
    (ii) Encryption items which are limited to allowing foreign-
developed cryptographic products to operate with U.S. products (e.g. 
signing) can be exported or reexported under License Exception ENC to 
any end-user. Such exports are subject to reporting requirements (see 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section). No review of the foreign-developed 
cryptography is required.
    (c) Reexports and Transfers. U.S. or foreign distributors, resellers 
or other entities who are not original manufacturers of encryption 
commodities and software are permitted to use License Exception ENC only 
in instances where the export or reexport meets the applicable terms and 
conditions of this section. Transfers of encryption items listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section to government end-users or end-uses within 
the same country are prohibited unless otherwise authorized by license 
or license exception. Foreign products developed with or incorporating 
U.S.-origin encryption source code, components or toolkits remain 
subject to the EAR but do not require review and classification by BXA 
and can be exported or reexported without further authorization.
    (d) Eligibility for License Exception ENC. (1) Review and 
classification. You may initiate review and classification of your 
encryption items as required by this section by submitting a 
classification request in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 748.3(b) and Supplement 6 to Part 742 of the EAR. Indicate 
``License Exception ENC'' in Block 9: Special purpose, on form BXA-748P. 
Submit the original request to BXA and send a copy of the request to ENC 
Encryption Request Coordinator (see paragraph (e)(5) of this section for 
mailing addresses).
    (i) Exporters may immediately export and reexport any encryption 
item except ``cryptanalytic items'' as defined in part 772 of the EAR to 
any end-user located in the countries listed in Supplement 3 to this 
part 740 provided the exporter has submitted to BXA a completed 
classification request by the time of export.
    (ii) Exporters may, thirty days after receipt of a completed 
classification request by BXA, export and reexport to any non-government 
end-user located outside the countries listed in Supplement 3 to this 
part 740 any encryption product eligible under paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3) 
or (b)(4) of this section unless otherwise notified by BXA. No exports 
to government end-users located outside of countries listed in 
Supplement 3 to this part 740 are allowed under this provision. BXA 
reserves the right to suspend eligibility to export under this provision 
while a classification is pending.
    (2) Grandfathering. Finance-specific and 56-bit products previously 
reviewed and classified by BXA can be exported and reexported to any 
end-user without

[[Page 281]]

further review. Other encryption commodities, software or components 
previously approved for export can be exported and reexported without 
further review to any end-user in countries listed in Supplement 3 to 
this part 740 countries and to any non-government end-user outside of 
the countries listed in Supplement 3 to this part 740. This includes 
products approved under a license, an Encryption Licensing Arrangement, 
or classified as eligible to use License Exception ENC (except for those 
products which were only authorized for export to U.S. subsidiaries). 
Exports of products not classified by BXA as ``retail'' to governments 
of countries not listed in Supplement 3 to this part 740 require a 
license.
    (3) Key length increases. Exporters can increase the key lengths of 
previously classified products and continue to export without another 
review. No other change in the cryptographic functionality is allowed.
    (i) Any product previously classified as 5A002 or 5D002 can, with 
any upgrade to the key length used for confidentiality or key exchange 
algorithms, be exported or reexported under provisions of License 
Exception ENC to any non-government end-user without an additional 
review. Another classification is necessary to determine eligibility as 
a ``retail'' product under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Exporters must certify to BXA in a letter from a corporate 
official that the only change to the encryption product is the key 
length for confidentiality or key exchange algorithms and there is no 
other change in cryptographic functionality. Certifications must include 
the original authorization number issued by BXA and the date of 
issuance. BXA must receive this certification prior to any export of an 
upgraded product. The certification should be sent to BXA, with a copy 
sent to the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator (see paragraph (e)(5) of 
this section for mailing addresses).
    (e) Reporting requirements. (1) No reporting is required for exports 
of:
    (i) Any encryption to U.S. subsidiaries for internal company use;
    (ii) Finance-specific products;
    (iii) Encryption commodities or software with a symmetric key length 
not exceeding 64 bits or otherwise classified as qualifying for mass 
market treatment;
    (iv) Retail products exported to individual consumers;
    (v) Items exported via free or anonymous download;
    (vi) Encryption items from or to a U.S. bank, financial institution 
or their subsidiaries, affiliates, customers or contractors for banking 
or financial operations;
    (vii) Items which incorporate components limited to providing short-
range wireless encryption functions;
    (viii) Retail operating systems, or desktop applications (e.g. e-
mail, browsers, games, word processing, data base, financial 
applications or utilities) designed for, bundled with, or pre-loaded on 
single CPU computers, laptops or hand-held devices;
    (ix) Client Internet appliance and client wireless LAN cards;
    (x) Foreign products developed by bundling or compiling of source 
code.
    (2) Exporters must provide all available information as follows:
    (i) For items exported to a distributor or other reseller, including 
subsidiaries of U.S. firms, the name and address of the distributor or 
reseller, the item and the quantity exported and, if collected as part 
of the distribution process by the exporter, the end-user's name and 
address;
    (ii) For items exported through direct sale, the name and address of 
the recipient, the item, and the quantity exported (except for retail 
products if the end-user is an individual consumer); and
    (iii) For exports of 5E002 items to be used for technical assistance 
and which are not released by Sec. 744.9 of the EAR, the name and 
address of the end-user.
    (3) For direct sales or transfers of encryption components, 
commercial source code described under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
technology or general purpose encryption toolkits to foreign 
manufacturers when intended for use in foreign products developed for 
commercial sale, you must submit the names and addresses of the 
manufacturers using these items and, when

[[Page 282]]

the product is made available for commercial sale, a non-proprietary 
technical description of the foreign products for which the component, 
source code or toolkit are being used (e.g., brochures, other 
documentation, descriptions or other identifiers of the final foreign 
product; the algorithm and key lengths used; general programming 
interfaces to the product, if known; any standards or protocols that the 
foreign product adheres to; and source code, if available.).
    (4) Exporters of encryption commodities, software and components 
which were previously classified under License Exception ENC, or which 
have been licensed for export under an Encryption Licensing Arrangement, 
must comply with the reporting requirements of this section.
    (5) You must submit reports required under this section semi-
annually to BXA, unless otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(5). For 
exports occurring between January 1 and June 30, a report is due no 
later than August 1 of that year. For exports occurring between July 1 
and December 31, a report is due no later than February 1 the following 
year. Reports must include the classification or other authorization 
number. These reports must be provided in electronic form to BXA; 
suggested file formats for electronic submission include spreadsheets, 
tabular text or structured text. Exporters may request other reporting 
arrangements with BXA to better reflect their business models. Reports 
should be sent electronically to crypt@bxa.doc.gov, or disks and CDs can 
be mailed to the following addresses:
    (i) Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, Office 
of Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls, 14th Street and 
Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Room 2705, Washington, D.C. 20230, Attn: 
Encryption Reports.
    (ii) A copy of the report should be sent to: Attn: ENC Encryption 
Request Coordinator, 9800 Savage Road, Suite 6131, Ft. Meade, MD 20755-
6000.

Sec. 740.18  Agricultural commodities (AGR).

    (a) Eligibility requirements. License Exception AGR permits the 
export of agricultural commodities to Cuba, as well as the reexport of 
U.S. origin agricultural commodities to Cuba, provided your transaction 
meets all of the following criteria:
    (1) The commodity meets the definition of ``agricultural 
commodities'' in part 772 of the EAR;
    (2) The commodity is EAR99. You must have an official commodity 
classification of EAR99 from BXA for fertilizers, western red cedar and 
live horses before you submit a notification under this license 
exception. See Sec. 748.3 of the EAR for information on how to submit a 
commodity classification request;
    (3) The export or reexport is made pursuant to a written contract, 
except for donations and commercial samples which are not subject to 
this contract requirement;
    (4) The export or reexport is made within 12 months of the signing 
of the contract or within 12 months of notification that no objections 
were raised (if no contract is required). In the case of multiple 
partial shipments, all such shipments must be made within the 12 months 
of the signing of the contract or within 12 months of notification that 
no objections were raised (if no contract is required); and
    (5) You notify BXA prior to exporting or reexporting according to 
the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. If you intend 
to engage in multiple shipments during the one-year period after the 
signing of the contract, you need only notify BXA prior to the first 
shipment.
    (b) Restrictions. (1) No export or reexport to any individual or 
entity designated as a Specially Designated Terrorist or Foreign 
Terrorist Organization may be made under License Exception AGR (see part 
744 of the EAR).
    (2) No export or reexport to or for use in biological, chemical, 
nuclear warfare or missile proliferation activities may be made under 
License Exception AGR (see part 744 of the EAR).
    (3) No U.S.-owned or controlled foreign firm may export from abroad 
to Cuba a foreign produced agricultural commodity containing more than 
10% U.S.-origin content. Such U.S.-owned or controlled foreign firms 
require a specific license from BXA as well as

[[Page 283]]

the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(OFAC). Transactions not subject to the EAR (under 10% U.S.-origin 
content) require a license from OFAC.
    (c) Prior notification. (1) General requirement. You must notify BXA 
prior to any export or reexport (or prior to the first of multiple 
shipments) under License Exception AGR.
    (2) Procedures. You must provide prior notification of exports and 
reexports under License Exception AGR by submitting a completed 
Multipurpose Application Form (BXA-748P) or its electronic equivalent. 
The following blocks must be completed, as appropriate, on the 
Multipurpose Application Form: Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (by marking box 5 
``Other''), 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 (a), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), 
(j), 23, and 25 according to the instructions described in Supplement 
No. 1 to part 748 of the EAR. If your commodity is fertilizer, western 
red cedar or live horses, you must confirm that BXA has previously 
classified your commodity as EAR99 by placing the Commodity 
Classification Automatic Tracking System (CCATS) number in block 22(d). 
BXA will not initiate the registration of an AGR notification unless all 
requested information on the Multipurpose Application form is complete.
    (3) Action by BXA. Within two business days of the registration of 
the AGR notification, BXA will refer the notification for interagency 
review, or if necessary return the notification without action (e.g., if 
the information provided is incomplete). Registration is defined as the 
point at which the notification is entered into BXA's electronic system.
    (4) Review by other departments or agencies. The Departments of 
Defense, State, and other agencies, as appropriate, may review the AGR 
notification. BXA must receive department or agency objections within 
nine business days of the referral. Unlike the provisions described in 
Sec. 750.4(b) of the EAR, there are no provisions for stopping the 
processing time of the AGR notification. If, within 11 business days 
after the date of registration, any reviewing agency provides a written 
objection that the recipient may promote international terrorism or the 
transaction raises nonproliferation concerns, you may not use License 
Exception AGR. In such cases, BXA will notify you that a license is 
required for the export or reexport. BXA will then process the AGR 
notification as a license application in accordance with the provisions 
described in Sec. 750.4 of the EAR, and the licensing policies set forth 
in the EAR. At this time, BXA may request additional information. When 
BXA confirms that no agency has raised an objection within eleven 
business days (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), you 
may proceed with the transaction provided that you satisfy all other 
requirements of License Exception AGR, including the requirement to have 
a written contract prior to any shipment (unless a donation or 
commercial sample). (Note that the fact that you have been advised that 
no agency has objected to the transaction does not exempt you from other 
licensing requirements under the EAR, such as those based on knowledge 
of a prohibited end-use or end-user as referenced in general prohibition 
five (part 736 of the EAR) and set forth in part 744 of the EAR.)
    (5) Status of pending AGR notification requests. You must contact 
BXA's System for Tracking Export License Applications (``STELA'') at 
(202) 482-2752 for status of your pending AGR notification. (See 
Sec. 750.5 of the EAR for procedures to access information on STELA.) 
STELA will provide the date of registration of the AGR notification. If 
no department or agency objection is raised within 11 business days, 
STELA will, on the twelfth business day following the date of 
registration, provide you with confirmation of that fact. You may not 
proceed with your shipment unless you confirm with STELA that no 
objection has been raised. BXA will subsequently issue written 
confirmation to you. If an objection is raised, STELA will indicate that 
a license is required. The AGR notification will then be processed as a 
license application. In addition, BXA may provide notice of an objection 
by telephone, fax, courier service, or other means.
    (d) Donations. (1) Donations of agricultural commodities are 
eligible for

[[Page 284]]

export and reexport to Cuba under License Exception AGR, provided the 
transaction meets the requirements and procedures of this license 
exception (except the written contract requirement).
    (2) Donations of food items to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
and individuals in Cuba may also be eligible for License Exception GFT. 
See Sec. 740.12 for eligibility requirements of gift parcels and 
humanitarian donations under License Exception GFT.

<R05>
Sec. 742.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Scope. This part describes all the reasons for control reflected 
in the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR. In 
addition, it includes licensing requirements and licensing policies for 
the following items that are not reflected on the Country Chart: 
specially designed implements of torture, high performance computers, 
and communications intercepting devices. In addition to describing the 
reasons for control and licensing requirements and policies, this part 
describes any applicable contract sanctity provisions that may apply to 
specific controls and includes a description of any multilateral regime 
under which specific controls are maintained.
    (b) Reasons for control listed on the CCL not covered by this part. 
This part describes the license requirements and the licensing policies 
for all the ``Reasons for Control'' that are listed on the Commerce 
Control List (CCL) except ``Short Supply'' and ``U.N. Sanctions,'' which 
do not appear on the Country Chart.
    (1) Short Supply. ECCNs containing items subject to short supply 
controls (``SS'') refer the exporter to part 754 of the EAR. These ECCNs 
are: 0A980 (Horses for export by sea); 1C980 (certain inorganic 
chemicals); 1C981 (Crude petroleum, including reconstituted crude 
petroleum, tar sands, and crude shale oil); 1C982 (certain other 
petroleum products); 1C983 (Natural gas liquids and other natural gas 
derivatives);

[[Page 289]]

1C984 (certain manufactured gas and synthetic natural gas (except when 
commingled with natural gas and thus subject to export authorization 
from the Department of Energy); and 1C988 (Western red cedar (thuja 
plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed and worked lumber 
containing wane).
    (2) U.N. Sanctions. The United Nations imposes sanctions, short of 
complete embargoes, against certain countries which may result in 
controls that supplement those otherwise maintained under the EAR for 
that particular country. This part does not address license requirements 
and licensing policies for controls implementing U.N. sanctions. CCL 
entries containing items subject to U.N. sanctions will refer the 
exporter to part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls, 
for any supplemental controls that may apply to exports and reexports 
involving these countries.
    (c) Exports and reexports involving Cuba, Libya, Iraq, Iran, and the 
Bosnian Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This part does not 
cover license requirements and licensing policies that apply to exports 
and reexports to embargoed destinations (Cuba, Libya, Iraq, Iran and the 
Bosnian-Serb controlled areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina). These 
comprehensive embargoes cover a broader range of items than those 
reflected in the CCL. If you are exporting or reexporting to any of 
these destinations, you should first review part 746 of the EAR, 
Embargoes and Other Special Controls.
    (d) Anti-terrorism Controls on Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, 
Sudan and Syria. Commerce maintains anti-terrorism controls on Iran, 
North Korea, Syria and Sudan under section 6(a) of the Export 
Administration Act. Items controlled under section 6(a) to these three 
countries are described in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Commerce also 
maintains controls under section 6(j) of the EAA to Cuba, Libya, Iraq, 
Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. Items controlled to these seven 
countries under EAA section 6(j) are also described in Supplement 2 to 
part 742. The Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify 
appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before issuing a license 
for an item controlled under section 6(j) to Cuba, Libya, North Korea, 
Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria. As noted in paragraph (c) of this section, 
if you are exporting or reexporting to Cuba, Libya, Iran, and Iraq, you 
should review Part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.
    (e) End-user and end-use based controls. This part does not cover 
prohibitions and licensing requirements for exports of items not 
included on the CCL that are subject to end-use and end-user controls: 
certain nuclear end-uses; certain missile end-uses; certain chemical and 
biological weapons end-uses; certain naval nuclear propulsion end-uses; 
certain activities of U.S. persons; certain exports to and for the use 
of certain foreign vessels or aircraft; and certain exports to all 
countries for Libyan aircraft. Licensing requirements and policies for 
these exports are contained in part 744 of the EAR.
    (f) Overlapping license policies. Many items on the CCL are subject 
to more than one type of control (e.g., national security (NS), missile 
technology (MT), nuclear nonproliferation (NP), regional stability 
(RS)). In addition, applications for all items on the CCL, other than 
those controlled for short supply reasons, may be reviewed for missile 
technology (see Sec. 742.5(b)(3) of this part), nuclear nonproliferation 
(see Sec. 742.3(b)(2) of this part), or chemical and biological weapons 
(see Sec. 742.2(b)(3) of this part), if the end-use or end-user may be 
involved in certain proliferation activities. Finally, many 
multilaterally controlled items are reviewed for anti-terrorism reasons 
if they are destined for a terrorism-supporting country (see paragraph 
(d) of this section). Your application for a license will be reviewed 
under all applicable licensing policies. A license will be issued only 
if an application can be approved under all applicable licensing 
policies.

support of the U.S. foreign policy of opposing the

[[Page 290]]

proliferation and illegal use of chemical and biological weapons. (See 
also Sec. 742.18 of this part for license requirements pursuant to the 
Chemical Weapons Convention).
    (1) If CB Column 1 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is 
required to all destinations except Canada for the following:
    (i) Human pathogens, zoonoses, toxins, animal pathogens, genetically 
modified microorganisms and plant pathogens identified in ECCNs 1C351, 
1C352, 1C353 and 1C354; and
    (ii) Technology (ECCNs 1E001 and 1E351) for the production and/or 
disposal of microbiological commodities described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section.
    (2) If CB Column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is 
required to all destinations except countries in Country Group A:3 (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) (Australia Group members) for 
the following:
    (i) Chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350 (precursor and intermediate 
chemicals used in the production of chemical warfare agents).
    (A) This licensing requirement includes chemical mixtures containing 
any chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, except as specified in Note 2 to 
that ECCN.
    (B) This licensing requirement does not include chemical compounds 
created with any chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, unless those 
compounds are also identified in ECCN 1C350.
    (C) This licensing requirement does not apply to exports to CWC 
States Parties (destinations listed in Supplement No. 2 to Part 745 of 
the EAR) of medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits 
containing small quantities of chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350 that 
are also identified as Schedule 2 or 3 chemicals under the CWC, provided 
that the kits are pre-packaged materials of defined composition that are 
specifically developed, packaged, and marketed for diagnostic, 
analytical, or public health purposes and contain no more than 300 grams 
of any controlled chemical. These kits are controlled by ECCN 1C995 for 
CW and AT reasons.
    (ii) Software (ECCN 1D390) for process control that is specifically 
configured to control or initiate production of the chemical precursors 
controlled by ECCN 1C350.
    (iii) Technology (ECCNs 1E001 and 1E351) for the production and/or 
disposal of chemical precursors described in ECCN 1C350, and technology 
(ECCNs 1E001 and 1E350) involving the following for facilities designed 
or intended to produce chemicals described in 1C350:
    (A) Overall plant design;
    (B) Design, specification, or procurement of equipment;
    (C) Supervision of construction, installation, or operation of 
complete plant or components thereof;
    (D) Training of personnel; or
    (E) Consultation on specific problems involving such facilities.
    (3) If CB Column 3 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is

    (b) Licensing policy. (1) License applications for the items 
described in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered on a case-
by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would make a 
material contribution to the design, development, production, 
stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons. When an export or 
reexport is deemed to make such a contribution, the license will be 
denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered to 
determine what action should be taken on license applications:
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;

[[Page 291]]

    (ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its 
contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use 
of chemical or biological weapons;
    (iii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees against design, 
development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological 
weapons that are given in a particular case; and
    (v) The existence of a pre-existing contract.
    (3) BXA will review license applications in accordance with the 
licensing policy described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for items 
not described in paragraph (a) of this section that:
    (i) Require a license for reasons other than short supply;
    (ii) Are destined to any country except countries in Country Group 
A:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) (Australia Group 
members); and
    (iii) Could be destined for the design, development, production, 
stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons, or for a facility 
engaged in such activities.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates are set forth in 
Supplement No. 1 to part 742. Applicants who wish that a preexisting 
contract be considered in reviewing their license applications must 
submit documentation sufficient to establish the existence of such a 
contract.
    (d) Australia Group. The Australia Group, a multilateral body that 
works to halt the spread of chemical and biological weapons, has 
developed common control lists of items specifically related to chemical 
and biological weapons. Australia Group members are listed in Country 
Group A:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Controls on 
items listed in paragraph (a) of this section are consistent with lists

Sec. 742.3  Nuclear nonproliferation.

    (a) License requirements. Section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Act of 1978 requires BXA to identify items subject to the 
EAR that could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes if used 
for activities other than those authorized at the time of export or 
reexport. ECCNs on the CCL that include the symbol ``NP 1'' or ``NP 2'' 
in the ``Country Chart'' column of the ``License Requirements'' section 
identify items that could be of significance for nuclear explosive 
purposes and are therefore subject to licensing requirements under this 
part and under section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 
1978. These items are referred to as ``The Nuclear Referral List'' and 
are subject to the following licensing requirements:
    (1) If NP Column 1 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is 
required to all destinations except Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) member 
countries (Country Group A:4) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR).
    (2) If NP Column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the applicable ECCN, a license is 
required to Country Group D:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR).
    (3) Other nuclear-related license requirements are described in 
Secs. 744.2 and 744.5 of the EAR.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) To implement the controls in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the following factors are among those used to determine 
what action should be taken on individual applications:
    (i) Whether the items to be transferred are appropriate for the 
stated end-use and whether that stated end-use is appropriate for the 
end-user;
    (ii) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular item;
    (iii) Whether the items to be exported or reexported are to be used 
in research on, or for the development, design, manufacture, 
construction, operation, or maintenance of, any reprocessing or 
enrichment facility;
    (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for 
nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;
    (v) Whether any party to the transaction has been engaged in 
clandestine or illegal procurement activities;

[[Page 292]]

    (vi) Whether an application for a license to export or reexport to 
the end-user has previously been denied, or whether the end-user has 
previously diverted items received under a general license, a License 
Exception, or a validated license to unauthorized activities;
    (vii) Whether the export or reexport would present an unacceptable 
risk of diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded 
nuclear fuel-cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR; and
    (viii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, 
based on consideration of the following factors:
    (A) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition of 
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) or to a similar 
international legally-binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement;
    (B) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclear activities, 
facilities, or installations that are operational, being designed, or 
under construction under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards;
    (C) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil uses 
of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country;
    (D) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the government 
of the importing country are in support of nuclear nonproliferation and 
whether that government is in compliance with its international 
obligations in the field of non-proliferation;
    (E) The degree to which the government of the importing country 
cooperates in non-proliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness to 
consult on international nonproliferation issues); and
    (F) Information on the importing country's nuclear intentions and 
activities.
    (2) In addition, BXA will review license applications in accordance 
with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b) of this section for 
items not on the Nuclear Referral List that:
    (i) Require a license on the CCL for reasons other than ``short 
supply;'' and
    (ii) Are intended for a nuclear related end-use or end-user.
    (3) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensing policy 
for applications for those items that would make a direct and 
significant contribution to nuclear weapons and their delivery systems 
is extended review or denial.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    (d) Nuclear Suppliers Group. Most items on the Nuclear Referral List 
that require a license under NP Column No. 1 on the Country Chart (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) are contained in the Annex to 
the ``Guidelines for Transfers of Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Equipment, 
Material, and Related Technology'' (the Annex), as published by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency in INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2. The 
adherents to INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2, which includes the Nuclear 
Suppliers Guidelines, have agreed to establish export licensing 
procedures for the transfer of items identified in the Annex. Items that 
are listed as requiring a license under NP Column No. 2 on the Country 
Chart (see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) are not included in 
the Annex and are controlled only by the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 742.4  National security.

    (a) License requirements. It is the policy of the United States to 
restrict the export and reexport of items that would make a significant 
contribution to the military potential of any other country or 
combination of countries that would prove detrimental to the national 
security of the United States. Accordingly, a license is required for 
exports and reexports to all destinations, except Canada, for all items 
in ECCNs on the CCL that include NS Column 1 in the Country Chart column 
of the ``License Requirements'' section. A license is required to all 
destinations except Country Group A:1 and cooperating countries (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740) for all items in ECCNs on the CCL that 
include NS Column 2 in

[[Page 293]]

the Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section. The 
purpose of the controls is to ensure that these items do not make a 
contribution to the military potential of countries in Country Group D:1 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) that would prove 
detrimental to the national security of the United States. License 
Exception GBS is available for the export and reexport of certain 
national security controlled items to Country Group B (see Sec. 740.4 
and Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) The policy for national security 
controlled items exported or reexported to any country except a country 
in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) is to 
approve applications unless there is a significant risk that the items 
will be diverted to a country in Country Group D:1.
    (2) Except for those countries described in paragraphs (b)(5) 
through (b)(7) of this section, the general policy for exports and 
reexports of items to Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 
740 of the EAR) is to approve applications when BXA determines, on a 
case-by-case basis, that the items are for civilian use or would 
otherwise not make a significant contribution to the military potential 
of the country of destination that would prove detrimental to the 
national security of the United States.
    (3) To permit such policy judgments to be made, each application is 
reviewed in the light of prevailing policies with full consideration of 
all aspects of the proposed transaction. The review generally includes:
    (i) An analysis of the kinds and quantities of items to be shipped;
    (ii) Their military or civilian uses;
    (iii) The unrestricted availability abroad of the same or comparable 
items;
    (iv) The country of destination;
    (v) The ultimate end-users in the country of destination; and
    (vi) The intended end-use.
    (4) Although each proposed transaction is considered individually, 
items described in Advisory Notes on the Commerce Control List are more 
likely to be approved than others.
    (5) In recognition of efforts made to adopt safeguard measures for 
exports and reexports, Bulgaria, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, 
Mongolia, and Russia are accorded enhanced favorable consideration 
licensing treatment.
    (6) The general policy for Cambodia and Laos is to approve license 
applications when BXA determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the 
items are for an authorized use in Cambodia or Laos and are not likely 
to be diverted to another country or use contrary to the national 
security or foreign policy controls of the United States.
    (7) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensing policy 
is to approve applications, except that those items that would make a 
direct and significant contribution to electronic and anti-submarine 
warfare, intelligence gathering, power projection, and air superiority 
receive extended review or denial. Each application will be considered 
individually. Items may be approved even though they may contribute to 
Chinese military development or the end-user or end-use is military. 
Note that the Advisory Notes in the CCL headed ``Note for the People's 
Republic of China'' provide guidance on equipment likely to be approved 
more rapidly for China.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.

Sec. 742.5  Missile technology.

    (a) License requirements. (1) In support of U.S. foreign policy to 
limit the proliferation of missiles, a license is required to export and 
reexport items related to the design, development, production, or use of 
missiles. These items are identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column 
No. 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' 
section. Licenses for these items are required to all destinations, 
except Canada, as indicated by MT Column 1 of the Country Chart (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).
    (2) The term ``missiles'' is defined as rocket systems (including 
ballistic missile systems, space launch vehicles,

[[Page 294]]

and sounding rockets) and unmanned air vehicle systems (including cruise 
missile systems, target drones, and reconnaissance drones) capable of 
delivering at least 500 kilograms (kg) payload to a range of at least 
300 kilometers (km).
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications to export and reexport items 
identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chart 
column of the ``License Requirements'' section will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would 
make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. 
Applications for exports and reexports of such items contained in 
Category 7A or described by ECCN 9A101 on the CCL will be considered 
more favorably if such exports or reexports are determined to be 
destined to a manned aircraft, satellite, land vehicle, or marine 
vessel, in quantities appropriate for replacement parts for such 
applications. When an export or reexport is deemed to make a material 
contribution to the proliferation of missiles, the license will be 
denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered in 
reviewing individual applications.
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its 
contribution to the design, development, production, or use of missiles;
    (iii) The capabilities and objectives of the missile and space 
programs of the recipient country;
    (iv) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (v) The types of assurances or guarantees against design, 
development, production, or use of missiles that are given in a 
particular case; and
    (vi) The existence of a preexisting contract.
    (3) Controls on other items. BXA will review license applications, 
in accordance with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, for items not described in paragraph (a) of this section 
that:
    (i) Require a validated license for reasons other than short supply; 
and
    (ii) Could be destined for the design, development, production, or 
use of missiles, or for a facility engaged in such activities.
    (c) Contract sanctity. The following contract sanctity dates have 
been established:
    (1) License applications for batch mixers specified in ECCN 1B115.a 
involving contracts that were entered into prior to January 19, 1990, 
will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (2) License applications subject to ECCN 1B115.b or .c that involve 
a contract entered into prior to March 7, 1991, will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (3) Applicants who wish that a pre-existing contract be considered 
in reviewing their license applications must submit documentation 
sufficient to establish the existence of a contract.
    (d) Missile Technology Control Regime. Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR) members are listed in Country Group A:2 (see Supplement 
No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Controls on items identified in paragraph 
(a) of this section are consistent with the list agreed to in the MTCR 
and included in the MTCR Annex.


<R05>
Sec. 742.6  Regional stability.

    (a) License requirements. The following controls are maintained in 
support of U.S. foreign policy to maintain regional stability:
    (1) As indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 1 of the Country Chart 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR), a license is required to 
all destinations, except Canada, for items described on the CCL under 
ECCNs 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3, or .c; 6A003.b.3 and b.4; 6E001 (only 
technology for development of items in 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3, and .c, or 
6A003.b.3 and b.4); 6E002 (only technology for production of items in 
6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3, or .c, or 6A003.b.3 or b.4); 7D001 (only software 
for development or production of items in 7A001, 7A002, or 7A003); 7E001 
(only technology for the development of inertial navigation systems, 
inertial equipment, and specially designed components therefor for civil 
aircraft); 7E002 (only technology for the production of inertial 
navigation systems, inertial equipment, and specially designed 
components therefor for civil aircraft); 7E101 (only technology for the 
use of inertial

[[Page 295]]

navigation systems, inertial equipment, and specially designed 
components for civil aircraft)
    (2) As indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 2 of the Country Chart 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR), a license is required to 
any destination except countries in Country Group A:1 (see Supplement 
No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), Iceland and New Zealand for military 
vehicles and certain commodities (specially designed) used to 
manufacture military equipment, described on the CCL in ECCNs 0A018.c, 
1B018.a, 2B018, and 9A018.a and .b.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications to export and reexport items 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport could 
contribute directly or indirectly to any country's military capabilities 
in a manner that would alter or destabilize a region's military balance 
contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States.
    (2) Applications to export and reexport commodities described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section will generally be considered favorably 
on a case-by-case basis unless there is evidence that the export or 
reexport would contribute significantly to the destabilization of the 
region to which the equipment is destined.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining regional stability controls, at 
this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.

Sec. 742.7  Crime control.

    (a) License requirements. In support of U.S. foreign policy to 
promote the observance of human rights throughout the world, a license 
is required to export and reexport crime control and detection 
equipment, related technology and software as follows:
    (1) Crime control and detection instruments and equipment and 
related technology and software identified in the appropriate ECCNs on 
the CCL under CC Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License 
Requirements'' section. A license is required to countries listed in CC 
Column 1 (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR). Items affected by 
this requirement are identified on the CCL under the following ECCNs: 
0A978, 0A979, 0A984, 0A987, 0E984, 1A984, 1A985, 3A980, 3A981, 3D980, 
3E980, 4A003 (for fingerprint computers only), 4A980, 4D001 (for 
fingerprint computers only), 4D980, 4E001 (for fingerprint computers 
only), 4E980, 6A002 (for police-model infrared viewers only), 6E001 (for 
police-model infrared viewers only), 6E002 (for police-model infrared 
viewers only), and 9A980.
    (2) Shotguns with a barrel length greater than or equal to 24 
inches, identified in ECCN 0A984 on the CCL under CC Column 2 in the 
Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section regardless 
of end-user to countries listed in CC Column 2 (Supplement No. 1 part 
738 of the EAR).
    (3) Shotguns with barrel length greater than or equal to 24 inches, 
identified in ECCN 0A984 on the CCL under CC Column 3 in the Country 
Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section only if for sale or 
resale to police or law enforcement entities in countries listed in CC 
Column 3 (Supplement No. 1 part 738 of the EAR).
    (4) Certain crime control items require a license to all 
destinations, except Canada. These items are identified under ECCNs 
0A982, 0A985, and 0E982. Controls for these items appear in each ECCN; a 
column specific to these controls does not appear in the Country Chart 
(Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).
    (5) See Sec. 742.11 of the EAR for further information on items 
controlled under ECCN 0A983, which require a license to all 
destinations, including Canada.
    (b) Licensing policy. Applications for items controlled under this 
section will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-case basis 
unless there is civil disorder in the country or region or unless there 
is evidence that the government of the importing country may have 
violated internationally recognized human rights. The judicious use

[[Page 296]]

of export controls is intended to deter the development of a consistent 
pattern of human rights abuses, distance the United States from such 
abuses and avoid contributing to civil disorder in a country or region.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity date: August 22, 2000. 
Contract sanctity applies only to items controlled under ECCNs 0A982, 
0A985 and 0E982 destined for countries not listed in CC Column 1 of the 
Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining controls on crime control and 
detection items, at this time these controls are maintained only by the 
United States.

Sec. 742.8  Anti-terrorism: Iran.

    (a) License requirements. (1) If AT column 1 or AT column 2 of the 
Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to Part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in 
the appropriate ECCN, a license is required for export to Iran for anti-
terrorism purposes. In addition, portable electric power generators and 
related software and technology (ECCNs 2A994, 2D994 and 2E994) are 
controlled for export to Iran for anti-terrorism purposes. See paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section for controls maintained by the Department of the 
Treasury.
    (2) If AT column 1 or AT column 2 of the Commerce Country Chart 
(Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the 
appropriate ECCN, a license is required for reexport to Iran for anti-
terrorism purposes, except for ECCNs 2A994; 3A992.a; 5A991.g; 5A992; 
6A991; 6A998; 7A994; 8A992.d, .e, .f, and .g; 9A990.a and .b; and 
9A991.d and .e. In addition, items in these ECCNs are not counted as 
controlled U.S. content for the purpose of determining license 
requirements for U.S. parts, components or materials incorporated into 
foreign made products. However, the export from the United States to any 
destination with knowledge that they will be reexported directly or 
indirectly, in whole or in part to Iran is prohibited without a license. 
See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for controls maintained by the 
Department of the Treasury.
    (3) The Secretary of State has designated Iran as a country whose 
Government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism.
    (4) In support of U.S. foreign policy on terrorism-supporting 
countries, BXA maintains two types of anti-terrorism controls on the 
export and reexport of items described in Supplement 2 to part 742.
    (i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of 
Supplement No. 2 to part 742 are controlled under section 6(j) of the 
Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA), if destined to military, 
police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users.
    (ii) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of 
Supplement No. 2 to part 742 destined to non-sensitive end-users, as 
well as items described in paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(43) to all end-
users, are controlled to Iran under section 6(a) of the EAA. (See 
Supplement No. 2 to part 742 for more information on items controlled 
under sections 6(a) and 6(j) of the EAA and Sec. 750.6 of the EAR for 
procedures for processing license applications for items controlled 
under EAA section 6(j).)
    (5) Exports and certain reexports to Iran are subject to a 
comprehensive embargo administered by the Department of the Treasury's 
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). If you wish to export or 
reexport to Iran, the Government of Iran or any entity owned or 
controlled by that Government, you should review part 746 of the EAR and 
consult with OFAC. Please note that authorization from OFAC constitutes 
authorization under the EAR and no separate license or authorization 
from BXA is required.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act 
of October 23, 1992, requires BXA to deny licenses for items controlled 
to Iran for national security (section 5 of the 1979 EAA) or foreign 
policy reasons (section 6 of the 1979 EAA), absent contract sanctity or 
a Presidential waiver. License applications for which contract sanctity 
is established may be considered under policies in effect prior to the 
enactment of that Act. Otherwise, licenses for such items to Iran are 
subject to a general policy of denial.

[[Page 297]]

    (2) License applications for items controlled under section 6(a) of 
the EAA will also be reviewed to determine whether requirements of 
section 6(j) apply. Whenever the Secretary of State determines that an 
export or reexport could make a significant contribution to the military 
potential of Iran, including its military logistics capability, or could 
enhance Iran's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the 
Secretaries of State and Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior 
to the issuance of a license.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates and related policies 
for Iran are listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Applicants who wish 
a pre-existing contract to be considered must submit sufficient evidence 
to establish the existence of a contract.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this 
time these controls are maintained only by the United States.

    (ii) Items listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of Supplement 
No. 2 to part 742 destined to other end-users in Syria, as well as items 
to all end-users listed in (c)(6) through (c)(8), (c)(10) through 
(c)(14), (c)(16) through (c)(19), and (c)(22) through (c)(43) of 
Supplement No. 2 to part 742, are controlled to Syria under section 6(a) 
of the EAA.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications for export and reexport to 
all end-users in Syria of the following items will generally be denied:
    (i) Items that are controlled for chemical and biological weapons 
proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that contain 
CB Column 1, CB Column 2, or CB Column 3 in the Country Chart column of 
the ``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL.
    (ii) Military-related items controlled for national security reasons 
to any destination. These are items that contain NS Column 1 in the 
Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section in an ECCN 
on the CCL and is controlled by equipment or material entries ending in 
the number ``18.''
    (iii) Items that are controlled for missile proliferation reasons to

described in paragraph (a) of this section, and not described by 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, will generally be denied if the export 
or reexport is destined to a military end-user or for military end-use. 
Applications for non-military end-users or for non-military end-uses 
will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), 
of this section, applications for Syria will be considered on a case-by-
case basis if:
    (i) The transaction involves the reexport to Syria of items where 
Syria was not the intended ultimate destination at the time of original 
export from the United States, provided that the exports from the U.S. 
occurred prior to the applicable contract sanctity date (or, where the 
contract sanctity date is December 16, 1986, prior to June 18, 1987).
    (ii) The U.S. content of foreign-produced commodities is 20% or less 
by value; or
    (iii) The commodities are medical items.

    Note to paragraph (b) of this section:
    Applicants who wish any of the factors described in paragraph (b) of 
this section to be considered in reviewing their license applications 
must submit adequate documentation demonstrating the value of the U.S. 
content, the specifications and medical use of the equipment, or the 
date of export from the United States.

    (4) License applications for items reviewed under 6(a) controls will 
also be reviewed to determine the applicability of 6(j) controls to the 
transaction. When it is determined that an export or reexport could make 
a significant contribution to the military potential of Syria, including 
its military logistics capability, or could enhance Syria's ability to 
support acts of international terrorism, the Secretaries of State and 
Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior to issuance of a 
license.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates and related licensing 
policies for Syria are set forth in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. 
Applicants who wish a pre-existing contract to be considered must submit 
sufficient documentation to establish the existence of a contract.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this 
time these controls are maintained only by the United States.

Sec. 742.12  High performance computers.

    (a) License and recordkeeping requirements. (1) This section 
contains special provisions for exports, reexports, and certain intra-
country transfers of high performance computers, including software, and 
technology. This section affects the following ECCNs: 4A001; 4A002; 
4A003; 4D001; 4D002; and 4E001. Licenses are required under this section 
for ECCN's having an ``XP'' under ``Reason for Control'' when License 
Exception CTP is not available (see Sec. 740.7 of the EAR). License 
requirements reflected in this section are based on particular 
destinations, end-users, or end-uses. For the calculation of CTP, see 
the Technical Note that follows the Advisory Notes for Category 4 in the 
Commerce Control List. Note that License Exception CTP contains 
restrictions on access by nationals of certain countries, and on 
reexports and transfers of computers.
    (2) In recognition of the strategic and proliferation significance 
of high performance computers, a license is required for the export or 
reexport of high performance computers to destinations, end-users, and 
end-uses, as specified in this section and on the CCL. These license 
requirements supplement requirements that apply for other control 
reasons, such as nuclear nonproliferation provided in section 742.3 of 
the EAR. The license requirements described in this section 742.12 are 
not reflected on the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the 
EAR). Three Computer Country Tiers have been established for the 
purposes of these controls. Countries included in

[[Page 301]]

Computer Tiers 1 and 3 are listed in License Exception CTP in section 
740.7 of the EAR. As of January 19, 2001 there is no longer a Computer 
Tier 2, and countries that were in Tier 2 are incorporated into Computer 
Tier 1. Computer Tier 4 consists of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North 
Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
    (3) Exporters must keep accurate records of each export to countries 
not included in Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of 
the EAR) of a computer with a CTP greater than 6,500 MTOPS. These 
records must be submitted semiannually to BXA and must contain the 
information as described in Sec. 743.1 of the EAR.
    (b) Licensing policy. Licensing policies described in this section 
vary according to the country of destination, and the end-use or end-
user involved in the transaction. Note that in addition, license 
applications for items covered by Sec. 742.12 will also be reviewed 
under the nuclear nonproliferation licensing policy in Sec. 742.3(b). In 
certain cases, licenses may be subject to safeguard conditions. The 
specific conditions that may be imposed by BXA will depend on the 
country of destination, and the end-use or end-user of the export. BXA 
may also require end-use certification which, in appropriate cases, is 
certified by the government of the importing country. The range of 
possible safeguard conditions and related information are provided in 
Supplement No. 3 to part 742.
    (1) Computer Tier 1--(i) License requirement. No license is required 
under this Sec. 742.12 for exports or reexports of computers to and 
among countries listed in Computer Tier 1, for consumption in such 
countries or other disposition in accordance with the EAR.
    (ii) Licensing policy. A license is not required under this 
Sec. 742.12.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Computer Tier 3. (i) License requirement. (A) A license is 
required to export or reexport computers to countries in Computer Tier 3 
to nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile end-users and end-uses and 
military end-users and end-uses subject to license requirements under 
Sec. 744.2, Sec. 744.3, Sec. 744.4, Sec. 744.5, and Sec. 744.12 of the 
EAR in Computer Tier 3 countries.
    (B) A license is required to export or reexport computers with a CTP 
greater than 85,000 MTOPS to a country in Computer Tier 3.
    (C) Prior to February 26, 2001, a license may be required to export 
or reexport computers with a CTP greater than 12,500 MTOPS to countries 
in Computer Tier 3 pursuant to the NDAA (see Sec. 740.7(d)(5) of the 
EAR). Beginning on February 26, 2001 but prior to March 20, 2001, a 
license may be required to export or reexport computers with a CTP 
greater than 28,000 MTOPS but less than or equal to 85,000 MTOPS to 
countries in Computer Tier 3 pursuant to the NDAA.
    (ii) Licensing policy for nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile 
end-users and end-uses and military end-users and end-uses. License 
applications for exports and reexports to nuclear, chemical, biological, 
or missile end-users and end-uses and military end-users and end-uses 
subject to license requirements under Sec. 744.2, Sec. 744.3, 
Sec. 744.4, Sec. 744.5, and Sec. 744.12 of the EAR in countries in 
Computer Tier 3 will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis using the 
following criteria:
    (A) The presence and activities of countries and end-users of 
national security and proliferation concern and the relationships that 
exist between the government of the importing country and such countries 
and end-users;
    (B) The ultimate consignee's participation in, or support of, any of 
the following:
    (1) Activities that involve national security concerns; or
    (2) Nuclear, chemical, biological or missile proliferation 
activities described in part 744 of the EAR;
    (C) The extent to which the importing country is involved in 
nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation activities 
described in part 744 of the EAR;
    (D) The end-user, whether the end-use is single-purpose or multiple-
purpose.
    (iii) Licensing policy for other end-users and end-uses. License 
applications for exports and reexports to other end-uses and end-users 
located in Computer Tier 3 countries will generally be approved, except 
there is a presumption of denial

[[Page 302]]

for all applications for exports and reexports of computers having a CTP 
greater than 6,500 MTOPS destined to Indian and Pakistani entities 
determined to be involved in nuclear, missile, or military activities 
included in Supplement No. 4 to part 744 (Entity List). All license 
applications for exports and reexports to India and Pakistan not meeting 
these criteria for presumption of denial will be considered on a case-
by-case basis under other licensing policies set forth in the EAR 
applicable to such computers.
    (iv) Post-shipment verification. This section outlines special post-
shipment reporting requirements for exporters of certain computers to 
destinations in Computer Tier 3. Post-shipment reports must be submitted 
in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv), and all 
relevant records of such exports must be kept in accordance with part 
762 of the EAR.
    (A) Exporters must file post-shipment reports for computer exports, 
as well as exports of items used to enhance previously exported or 
reexported computers, according to the following schedule:

    (a) License requirement. (1) As set forth in ECCN 5A980, a license 
is required for the export or reexport to any destination, including 
Canada, of any electronic, mechanical, or other device primarily useful 
for surreptitious interception of wire or oral communications. This 
control implements a provision of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe 
Streets Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-361). This license requirement is not 
reflected on the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the 
EAR).
    (2) Communications intercepting devices are electronic, mechanical, 
or other devices that can be used for interception of wire or oral 
communications if their design renders them primarily useful for 
surreptitious listening even though they may also have innocent uses. A 
device is not restricted merely because it is small or may be adapted to 
wiretapping or eavesdropping. Some examples of devices to which these 
restrictions apply are: the martini olive transmitter; the infinity 
transmitter; the spike mike; and the disguised microphone appearing as a 
wristwatch, cufflink, or cigarette pack; etc. The restrictions do not 
apply to devices such as the parabolic microphone or other directional 
microphones ordinarily used by broadcasters at sports events, since 
these devices are not primarily useful for surreptitious listening.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) License applications will generally be 
approved for:
    (i) A provider of wire or electronic communication services or an 
officer, agent, or employee of, or person under contract with, such a 
provider in the normal course of the business of providing that wire or 
electronic communication service; and
    (ii) Officers, agents, or employees of, or person under contract 
with the United States, one of the 50 States, or a political subdivision 
thereof, when engaged in the normal course of government activities.
    (2) Other applications will generally be denied.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications involving exports and reexports of 
communications interception devices.
    (d) U.S. controls. Controls on this equipment are maintained by the 
United States government in accordance with the Omnibus Crime Control 
and Safe Streets Act of 1968.


<R05>
Sec. 742.14  Significant items: hot section technology for the development, production or overhaul of commercial aircraft engines, components, and systems.

    (a) License requirement. Licenses are required for all destinations, 
except Canada, for ECCNs having an ``SI'' under the ``Reason for 
Control'' paragraph. These items include hot section technology for the 
development, production or overhaul of commercial aircraft engines 
controlled under ECCN 9E003.a.1. through a.12., .f, and related 
controls.
    (b) Licensing policy. Pursuant to section 6 of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended, foreign policy controls apply to 
technology required for the development, production or overhaul of 
commercial aircraft engines controlled by ECCN 9E003.a.1. through a.12, 
.f, and related controls. These controls supplement the national 
security controls that apply to these items. Applications for export and 
reexport to all destinations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to 
determine whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S. 
national security and foreign policy interests. The following factors 
are among those that will be considered to determine what action will be 
taken on license applications:
    (1) The country of destination;
    (2) The ultimate end-user(s);
    (3) The technology involved;
    (4) The specific nature of the end-use(s); and
    (5) The types of assurance against unauthorized use or diversion 
that are given in a particular case.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this Sec. 742.14.

Sec. 742.15  Encryption items.

    Encryption items can be used to maintain the secrecy of information, 
and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm national security, 
foreign policy and law enforcement interests. The U.S. has a critical 
interest in ensuring that important and sensitive information of the 
public and private sector is protected. Consistent with our 
international obligations as a member of the Wassenaar Arrangement, the 
U.S. has a responsibility to maintain control over the export of 
encryption items. As the President indicated in Executive Order 13026 
and in his Memorandum of November 15, 1996, export of encryption 
software, like export of encryption hardware, is controlled because of 
this functional capacity to encrypt information on a computer system, 
and not because of any informational or theoretical value that such 
software may reflect, contain, or represent, or that its export may 
convey to others abroad. For this reason, export controls on encryption 
software are distinguished from controls on other software regulated 
under the EAR.
    (a) License requirements. Licenses are required for exports and 
reexports of encryption items (EI) classified under ECCNS 5A002, 5D002 
and 5E002 to all destinations except Canada. Refer to part 740 of this 
EAR for licensing exceptions and to part 772 of the EAR for the 
definition of ``encryption items.''
    (b) Licensing policy. The following licensing policies apply to 
items identified in paragraph (a) of this section. Except as otherwise 
noted, applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by BXA, in 
conjunction with other agencies, to determine whether the export or 
reexport is consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy 
interests. For subsequent bundling and updates of these items see 
paragraph (n) of Sec. 770.2 of the EAR. No exports without a license are 
authorized to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria.
    (1) Encryption items under ECCNs 5A992, 5D992 and 5E992. Certain 
encryption commodities, software and technology may be classified under 
ECCNs 5A992, 5D992 or 5E992. These items continue to be subject to AT1 
controls. Such items include encryption commodities, software and 
technology with key lengths up to and including 56-bits with an 
asymmetric key exchange algorithm not exceeding 512 bits; products which 
only provide key management with asymmetric key exchange algorithms not 
exceeding 512 bits; and mass market encryption commodities and software 
with key lengths not exceeding 64-bits for the symmetric algorithm. 
Refer to the Cryptography Note (Note 3) to part II of Category 5 of the 
CCL for a definition of mass market encryption commodities and software. 
Key exchange mechanisms, proprietary key exchange mechanisms, or company 
proprietary commodities and software implementations may also be 
eligible for this treatment. Exporters may self-classify such 5A992, 
5D992 or 5E992 items and export them without review and classification 
by BXA provided you have submitted to BXA and the ENC Encryption Request 
Coordinator by the time of export the information described in 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of Supplement 6 to this part 742. 
Notification should be made by e-mail to crypt@bxa.doc.gov.
    (2) Encryption items under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002 and 5E002. All 
encryption commodities, software and components classified by BXA under 
ECCNs 5A002, 5D002 and 5E002 except cryptanalytic items are authorized 
for export and reexport to any end-user in the countries listed in 
Supplement 3 to Part 740 of the EAR. Items classified by BXA as retail 
products under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002 are authorized for export and 
reexport to any end-user. All 5A002, 5D002 and 5E002 encryption items 
are authorized for export or reexport to any individual, commercial firm 
or other non-government end-user in countries not listed in Supplement 3 
to Part 740 of the EAR. No exports of such items are authorized without 
a license to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Sudan or Syria. Any 
encryption item (including technology classified under ECCN 5E002) is 
authorized for export or reexport to U.S. subsidiaries (as defined in 
part 772).
    (3) Encryption licensing. Exporters may submit applications for 
licenses or Encryption Licensing Arrangements for exports and reexports 
of encryption

[[Page 305]]

items not eligible for license exception, including exports and 
reexports of encryption technology to strategic partners of U.S. 
companies (as defined in part 772). For Encryption Licensing 
Arrangements, the applicant must specify the sales territory and class 
of end-user. Encryption Licensing Arrangements granted for exports of 
unlimited quantities for all destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, 
Libya, North Korea, Sudan or Syria, are valid for four years, and may 
require reporting. Licenses are required for exports of encryption items 
to governments, or Internet and telecommunications service providers for 
the provision of services specific to governments, and may be favorably 
considered for civil uses, e.g., social or financial services to the 
public; civil justice; social insurance, pensions and retirement; taxes 
and communications between governments and their citizens.

Sec. 742.17  Exports of firearms to OAS member countries.

    (a) License requirements. BXA maintains a licensing system for the 
export of shotguns and related items to all OAS member countries. This 
action is based on the Organization of American States (OAS) Model 
Regulations for the Control of the International Movement of Firearms, 
their Parts and Components and Munitions (OAS Model Regulations) which 
were developed to assist OAS member countries to implement the Inter-
American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking 
in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials 
(Firearms Convention).<SUP>1</SUP> Items subject to these controls are 
identified by ``FC Column 1'' in the ``License Requirements'' section of 
their Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the Commerce 
Control List (CCL). If ``FC Column 1'' of the Commerce Country Chart 
(Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated for a particular 
country, a license is required for export to that destination. Licenses 
will generally be issued on an Import Certificate or equivalent official 
document, satisfactory to BXA, issued by the government of the importing 
country is also required for the export of such items to OAS member 
countries.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Status of Convention as of April 13, 1999 had not entered into 
force.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Licensing policy. Applications supported by an Import 
Certificate or equivalent official document issued by the government of 
the importing country for such items will generally be approved, except 
there is a policy of denial for applications to export items linked to 
such activities as drug trafficking, terrorism, and transnational 
organized crime.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications under this Sec. 742.17.
    (d) OAS Model Regulations. The OAS Model Regulations on which 
regulations are based are designed by OAS member countries to combat 
illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, ammunition, 
explosives, and other related materials in North and South America 
because of their links to such activities as drug trafficking, 
terrorism, and transnational organized crime.
    (e) OAS member countries to which firearms controls under this 
section apply. The OAS member countries include: Antigua and Barbuda, 
Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, 
Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El 
Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, 
Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, the 
United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
    (f) Items/Commodities. Items requiring a license under this section 
are ECCNs 0A984 (shotguns with a barrel length 18 inches or over and 
related parts, and buckshot shotgun shells), 0A986 (shotgun shells, and 
related parts) and 0A987 (optical sighting devices). (See Supplement No. 
1 to Part 774 of the EAR.)
    (g) Validity period for licenses. Although licenses generally will 
be valid for a period of two years, your ability to ship items that 
require an Import

Sec. 742.18  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC or Convention).

    States that are parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons and on 
Their Destruction, also known as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC or 
Convention), undertake never to develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, 
transfer, or use chemical weapons. As a State Party to the Convention, 
the United States is subjecting certain toxic chemicals and their 
precursors listed in Schedules within the Convention to trade 
restrictions. Trade restrictions include: a prohibition on the export of 
Schedule 1 chemicals to States not Party to the CWC; a prohibition on 
the reexport of Schedule 1 chemicals to all destinations (both States 
Parties to the CWC and States not Party to the CWC); license 
requirements for the export of Schedule 1 chemicals to all States 
Parties; a prohibition on the export of Schedule 2 chemicals to States 
not Party to the CWC; and an End-Use Certificate requirement for exports 
of Schedule 3 chemicals to States not Party to the CWC. Exports of CWC 
chemicals that do not require a license for CW reasons (e.g., exports 
and reexports of Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 chemicals to States Parties 
to the CWC) may require a license for other reasons set forth in the 
EAR. (See, in particular, the license requirements in Sec. 742.2 of the 
EAR that apply to exports and reexports of chemicals and precursors 
controlled by ECCN 1C350, for CB reasons. Also note the end-use and end-
user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR and the restrictions that apply 
to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.)
    (a) License requirements. (1) Schedule 1 chemicals under ECCN 1C350 
or ECCN 1C351. A license is required for CW reasons to export or 
reexport Schedule 1 chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350.a.20, a.24, or 
a.31 or ECCN 1C351.d.5 or d.6 to all destinations including Canada. CW 
applies to 1C351.d.5 for ricin in the form of Ricinus Communis 
Agglutinin<INF>II</INF> (RCA<INF>II</INF>), which is also known as ricin 
D or Ricinus Communis Lectin<INF>III</INF> (RCL<INF>III</INF>), and 
Ricinus Communis Lectin<INF>IV</INF> (RCL<INF>IV</INF>), which is also 
known as ricin E. CW applies to 1C351.d.6 for saxitoxin identified by 
C.A.S. 35523-89-8. (Note that the advance notification procedures and 
annual reporting requirements described in Sec. 745.1 of the EAR also 
apply to exports of Schedule 1 chemicals.)
    (2) Schedule 2 and 3 chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350, ECCN 
1C355, or ECCN 1C995. (i) States Parties to the CWC. Neither a license 
nor an End-Use Certificate is required for CW reasons to export or 
reexport Schedule 2 and 3 chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350, ECCN 
1C355, or 1C995.b to States Parties to the CWC (destinations listed in 
Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR).
    (ii) States not Party to the CWC. (A) Schedule 2 chemicals. A 
license is required for CW reasons to export or reexport Schedule 2 
chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350, ECCN 1C355, or ECCN 1C995.b to 
States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 
to part 745 of the EAR).
    (B) Schedule 3 chemicals. (1) Exports. A license is required for CW 
reasons to export Schedule 3 chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350, ECCN 
1C355, or ECCN 1C995.b to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not 
listed in Supplement No. 2 to Part 745 of the EAR), unless the exporter 
obtains from the consignee an End-Use Certificate (issued by the 
government of the importing country) prior to exporting the Schedule 3 
chemicals and submits it to BXA in accordance with the procedures 
described in Sec. 745.2 of the EAR. Note, however, that obtaining an 
End-Use Certificate does not relieve the exporter from the 
responsibility of complying with other license requirements set forth 
elsewhere in the EAR.
    (2) Reexports. Neither a license nor an End-Use Certificate is 
required for CW reasons to reexport Schedule 3 chemicals controlled 
under ECCN 1C350, ECCN 1C355, or ECCN 1C995.b from States Parties to the 
CWC (destinations listed in Supplement No. 2 to part

[[Page 307]]

745 of the EAR) to States not Party to the CWC. However, a license may 
be required for other reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. In 
addition, please note that reexports of Schedule 3 chemicals may be 
subject to an End-Use Certificate requirement by governments of other 
countries when the chemicals are destined for States not Party to the 
CWC.
    (C) Technology controlled under ECCN 1E355. A license is required 
for CW reasons to export or reexport technology controlled under ECCN 
1E355 to all States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in 
Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR), except for Israel and Taiwan.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Schedule 1 chemicals--(i) Exports to 
States Parties to the CWC. Applications to export Schedule 1 chemicals 
controlled under ECCN 1C350 or ECCN 1C351 to States Parties to the CWC 
(destinations listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) 
generally will be denied, unless all of the following conditions are 
met:
    (A) The chemicals are destined only for purposes not prohibited 
under the CWC (i.e., research, medical, pharmaceutical, or protective 
purposes);
    (B) The types and quantities of chemicals are strictly limited to 
those that can be justified for those purposes;
    (C) The Schedule 1 chemicals were not previously imported into the 
United States (this does not apply to Schedule 1 chemicals imported into 
the United States prior to April 29, 1997, or imported into the United 
States directly from the same State Party to which they now are to be 
returned, i.e., exported); and
    (D) The aggregate amount of Schedule 1 chemicals in the country of 
destination at any given time is equal to or less than one metric ton 
and receipt of the proposed export will not cause the country of 
destination to acquire or to have acquired one metric ton or more of 
Schedule 1 chemicals in any calendar year.
    (ii) Exports to States not Party to the CWC. Applications to export 
Schedule 1 chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350 or ECCN 1C351 to States 
not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to 
part 745 of the EAR) generally will be denied, consistent with U.S. 
obligations under the CWC to prohibit exports of these chemicals to 
States not Party to the CWC.
    (iii) Reexports. Applications to reexport Schedule 1 chemicals 
controlled under ECCN 1C350 or ECCN 1C351 generally will be denied to 
all destinations (including both States Parties to the CWC and States 
not Party to the CWC).
    (2) Schedule 2 chemicals. Applications to export or reexport 
Schedule 2 chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350, ECCN 1C355, or ECCN 
1C995.b to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in 
Supplement No. 2 to part 745) generally will be denied, consistent with 
U.S. obligations under the CWC to prohibit exports of these chemicals to 
States not Party to the CWC.
    (3) Schedule 3 chemicals. Applications to export Schedule 3 
chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350, ECCN 1C355, or ECCN 1C995.b to 
States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 
to part 745) generally will be denied.
    (4) Technology controlled under ECCN 1E355. Exports and reexports of 
technology controlled under ECCN 1E355 will be reviewed on a case-by-
case basis.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.

export or reexport is destined to nuclear end-users or nuclear end-uses. 
Applications for non-nuclear end-users or for non-nuclear end-uses, 
excluding items described in (c)(24)(iv)(A) of Supplement No. 2 to part 
742, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (4) License applications for items reviewed under section 6(a) 
controls will also be reviewed to determine the applicability of section 
6(j) controls to the transaction. When it is determined that an export 
or reexport could make a significant contribution to the military 
potential of North Korea, including its military logistics capability, 
or could enhance North Korea's ability to support acts of international 
terrorism, the Secretaries of State and Commerce will notify the 
Congress 30 days prior to issuance of a license.

                           Biological Weapons

    Note: Exports and reexports of items in performance of contracts 
entered into before the applicable contract sanctity date(s) will be 
eligible for review on a case-by-case basis or other applicable 
licensing policies that were in effect prior to the contract sanctity 
date. The contract sanctity dates set forth in this supplement are for 
the guidance of exporters. Contract sanctity dates are established in 
the course of the imposition of foreign policy controls on specific 
items and are the relevant dates for the purpose of licensing 
determinations involving such items. If you believe that a specific 
contract sanctity date is applicable to your transaction, you should 
include all relevant information with your license application.
    (1) The contract sanctity date for exports to Iran or Syria of 
dimethyl methylphosphonate, methyl phosphonyldifluoride, phosphorous 
oxychloride, thiodiglycol, dimethylamine hydrochloride, dimethylamine, 
ethylene chlorohydrin (2-chloroethanol), and potassium fluoride is April

   Supplement No. 2 to Part 742--Anti-Terrorism Controls: Iran, North 
   Korea, Syria and Sudan Contract Sanctity Dates and Related Policies

    Note: Exports and reexports of items in performance of contracts 
entered into before the applicable contract sanctity date(s) will be 
eligible for review on a case-by-case basis or other applicable 
licensing policies that were in effect prior to the contract sanctity 
date. The contract sanctity dates set forth in this Supplement are for 
the guidance of exporters. Contract sanctity dates are established in 
the course of the imposition of foreign policy controls on specific 
items and are the relevant dates for the purpose of licensing 
determinations involving such items. If you believe that a specific 
contract sanctity date is applicable to your transaction, you should 
include all relevant information with your license application. BXA will 
determine any applicable contract sanctity date at the time an 
application with relevant supporting documents is submitted.

    (a) Terrorist-supporting countries. The Secretary of State has 
designated Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria as 
countries whose governments have repeatedly provided support for acts of 
international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export Administration 
Act (EAA).
    (b) Items controlled under EAA sections 6(j) and 6(a). Whenever the 
Secretary of State determines that an export or reexport to any of these 
countries could make a significant contribution to the military 
potential of such country, including its military logistics capability, 
or could enhance the ability of such country to support acts of 
international terrorism, the item is subject to mandatory control under 
EAA section 6(j) and the Secretaries of Commerce and State are required 
to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before a 
license for such an item may be issued.
    (1) On December 28, 1993, the Secretary of State determined that the 
export to Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria of items 
described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this Supplement, if 
destined to military, police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users, 
are controlled under EAA section 6(j). Therefore, the 30-day advance 
Congressional notification requirement applies to the export or reexport 
of these items to sensitive end-users in any of these countries.
    (2) License applications for items controlled to designated 
terrorist-supporting countries under EAA section 6(a) will also be 
reviewed to determine whether the Congressional notification 
requirements of EAA section 6(j) apply.
    (3) Items controlled for anti-terrorism reasons under section 6(a) 
to Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria are:
    (i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) to non-
sensitive end-users, and
    (ii) The following items to all end-users: for Iran, items in 
paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(43) of this Supplement; for North Korea, 
items in paragraph (c)(6) through (c)(44) of this Supplement; for Sudan, 
items in paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(14), and (c)(16) through (c)(43) 
of this Supplement; and for Syria, items in paragraphs (c)(6) through 
(c)(8), (c)(10) through (c)(14), (c)(16) through (c)(19), and (c)(22) 
through (c)(43) of this Supplement.
    (c) The license requirements and licensing policies for items 
controlled for anti-terrorism reasons to Iran, Syria, Sudan, and North 
Korea are generally described in Secs. 742.8, 742.9, 742.10, and 742.19 
of this part, respectively. This Supplement provides guidance on 
licensing policies for Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan and related 
contract sanctity dates that may be available for transactions 
benefitting from pre-existing contracts involving Iran, Syria, and 
Sudan. Exporters are advised that the Treasury Department's Office of 
Foreign Assets Control administers a comprehensive trade and investment 
embargo against Iran (See Executive Orders 12957, 12959 and 13059 of 
March 15, 1995, May 6, 1995 and August 19, 1997, respectively.) 
Exporters are further advised that exports and reexports to Iran of 
items that are listed on the CCL as requiring a license for national 
security or foreign policy reasons are subject to a policy of denial 
under the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of October 23, 1992 (50 
U.S.C. 1701 note (1994)). Transactions involving Iran and benefitting 
from a contract that pre-dates October 23, 1992 may be considered under 
the applicable licensing policy in effect prior to that date.
    (1) All items subject to national security controls.

  Supplement No. 3 to Part 742--High Performance Computers; Safeguard 
                   Conditions and Related Information

    This supplement sets forth the security conditions and safeguard 
plans for the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of high 
performance computers that may be imposed by BXA to certain 
destinations. The licensing policies for the export, reexport, or in-
country transfer of high performance computers are set forth in 
Sec. 742.12 of this part.
    (a) Safeguard conditions. Following interagency review of the 
application, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) will instruct the 
exporter to submit a safeguard plan signed by the ultimate consignee and 
certified by the export control authorities of the importing country 
(see Certification by export control authorities of importing country in 
this supplement). The safeguard plan must indicate that the ultimate 
consignee agrees to implement those safeguards required by the BXA as a 
condition of issuing the license. BXA will inform exporters concerning 
which of the following safeguards will be imposed as license conditions:
    (1) The applicant will assume responsibility for providing adequate 
security against physical diversion of the computer during shipment 
(e.g., delivery by either attended or monitored shipment, using the most 
secure route possible--this precludes using the services or facilities 
of any country in Computer Tier 4).
    (2) There will be no reexport or intra-country transfer of the 
computer without prior written authorization from BXA.
    (3) The computer systems will be used only for those activities 
approved on the license or reexport authorization.
    (4) There will be no changes either in the end-users or the end-uses 
indicated on the license without prior written authorization by BXA.
    (5) Only software that supports the approved end-uses will be 
shipped with the computer system.
    (6) The end-user will station security personnel at the computer 
using facility to ensure that the appropriate security measures are 
implemented.
    (7) The exporter will station representatives at the computer using 
facility, or make such individuals readily available, to guide the 
security personnel in the implementation and operation of the security 
measures.
    (8) The security personnel will undertake the following measures 
under the guidance of the exporter's representatives:
    (i) The physical security of the computer using facility;
    (ii) The establishment of a system to ensure the round-the-clock 
supervision of computer security;
    (iii) The inspection, if necessary, of any program or software to be 
run on the computer system in order to ensure that all usage conforms to 
the conditions of the license;
    (iv) The suspension, if necessary, of any run in progress and the 
inspection of any output generated by the computer to determine whether 
the program runs or output conform with the conditions of the license;
    (v) The inspection of usage logs daily to ensure conformity with the 
conditions of the license and the retention of records of these logs for 
at least a year;
    (vi) The determination of the acceptability of computer users to 
ensure conformity with the conditions of the license;
    (vii) The immediate reporting of any security breaches or suspected 
security breaches to the government of the importing country and to the 
exporter's representatives;
    (viii) The execution of the following key tasks:
    (A) Establishment of new accounts;
    (B) Assignment of passwords;
    (C) Random sampling of data;
    (D) Generation of daily logs;
    (ix) The maintenance of the integrity and security of tapes and data 
files containing archived user files, log data, or system backups.
    (9) The exporter's representatives will be present when certain key 
functions are being carried out (e.g., the establishment of new 
accounts, the assignment of passwords, the random sampling of data, the 
generating of daily logs, the setting of limits to computer resources 
available to users in the development mode, the certification of 
programs for conformity to the approved end-uses before they are allowed 
to run in the production mode, and the modification to previously 
certified production programs).

[[Page 323]]

    (10) The security personnel and the exporter's representatives will 
provide monthly reports on the usage of the computer system and on the 
implementation of the safeguards.
    (11) The computer system will be housed in one secure building and 
protected against theft and unauthorized entry at all times.
    (12) Restricted nationals, i.e., nationals of Computer Tier 4 
countries, will not be allowed access to computers:
    (i) No physical or computational access to computers may be granted 
to restricted nationals without prior written authorization from BXA, 
except that commercial consignees as described in this supplement are 
prohibited only from giving such nationals user-accessible 
programmability without prior written authorization;
    (ii) No passwords or IDs may be issued to restricted nationals;
    (iii) No work may be performed on the computer on behalf of 
restricted nationals; and
    (iv) No conscious or direct ties may be established to networks 
(including their subscribers) operated by restricted nationals.
    (13) Physical access to the computer, the operator consoles, and 
sensitive storage areas of the computer using facility will be 
controlled by the security personnel, under the guidance and monitoring 
of the exporter's representatives, and will be limited to the fewest 
number of people needed to maintain and run the computer system.
    (14) The computer will be equipped with the necessary software to: 
Permit access to authorized persons only, detect attempts to gain 
unauthorized access, set and maintain limits on usage, establish 
accountability for usage, and generate logs and other records of usage. 
This software will also maintain the integrity of data and program 
files, the accounting and audit system, the password or computational 
access control system, and the operating system itself.
    (i) The operating system will be configured so that all jobs can be 
designated and tracked as either program development jobs or as 
production jobs.
    (ii) In the program development mode, users will be free, following 
verification that their application conforms to the agreed end-use, to 
create, edit, or modify programs, to use utilities such as editors, 
debuggers, or compilers and to verify program operation. Programs in the 
development mode will be subject to inspection as provided by paragraph 
(a)(8)(iii) of this supplement.
    (iii) In the production mode, users will have access to the full 
range of computer resources, but will be prohibited from modifying any 
program or using utilities that could modify any program. Before being 
allowed to run in the production mode, a program will have to be 
certified for conformity to approved end-uses by the security personnel 
and the exporter's representatives.
    (iv) Programs certified for execution in the production mode will be 
protected from unauthorized modification by appropriate software and 
physical security measures. Any modifications to previously certified 
production programs will be approved by the security personnel under the 
guidance and monitoring of the exporter's representatives.
    (v) The computer will be provided with accounting and audit software 
to ensure that detailed logs are maintained to record all computer 
usage. A separate log of security-related events will also be kept.
    (vi) For each job executed in the production mode, the operating 
system will record execution characteristics in order to permit 
generation of a statistical profile of the program executed.
    (15) The source code of the operating system will be accessible only 
to the exporter's representatives. Only those individuals will make 
changes in this source code.
    (16) The security personnel, under the guidance of the exporter's 
representatives, will change passwords for individuals frequently and at 
unpredictable intervals.
    (17) The security personnel, under the guidance of the exporter's 
representatives, will have the right to deny passwords to anyone. 
Passwords will be denied to anyone whose activity does not conform to 
the conditions of the license.
    (18) Misuse of passwords by users will result in denial of further 
access to the computer.
    (19) The exporter's representatives will install a strict password 
system and provide guidance on its implementation.
    (20) Only the exporter's representatives will be trained in making 
changes in the password system and only they will make such changes.
    (21) No computer will be networked to other computers outside the 
computer center without prior authorization from BXA.
    (22) Generally, remote terminals will not be allowed outside the 
computer using facility without prior authorization by BXA. If remote 
terminals are specifically authorized by the license:
    (i) The terminals will have physical security equivalent to the 
safeguards at the computer using facility;
    (ii) The terminals will be constrained to minimal amounts of 
computer resources (CPU time, memory access, number of input-output 
operations, and other resources);
    (iii) The terminals will not be allowed direct computational access 
to the computer (i.e., the security personnel, under the guidance of the 
exporter's representatives, will validate the password and identity of 
the user of any remote terminals before any such user is permitted to 
access the computer); all terminals will be connected to the computer

[[Page 324]]

system by a dedicated access line and a network access controller.
    (23) There will be no direct input to the computer from remote 
terminals. Any data originating from outside the computer using 
facility, except for direct input from terminals within the same 
compound as the computer using facility, will first be processed by a 
separate processor or network access controller in order to permit 
examination of the data prior to its entry into the computer.
    (24) The exporter will perform all maintenance of the computer 
system.
    (25) Spare parts kept on site will be limited to the minimum amount. 
Spares will be kept in an area accessible only to the exporter's 
representatives. These representatives will maintain a strict audit 
system to account for all spare parts.
    (26) No development or production technology on the computer system 
will be sent with the computer to the ultimate consignee.
    (27) The end-user must immediately report any suspicions or facts 
concerning possible violations of the safeguards to the exporter and to 
the export control authorities of the importing country.
    (28) The exporter must immediately report any information concerning 
possible violations of the safeguards to BXA. A violation of the 
safeguards might constitute grounds for suspension or termination of the 
license, preventing the shipment of unshipped spare parts, or the denial 
of additional licenses for spare parts, etc.
    (29) The end-user will be audited quarterly by an independent 
consultant who has been approved by the export control authorities of 
the importing and exporting countries, but is employed at the expense of 
the end-user. The consultant will audit the computer usage and the 
implementation of the safeguards.
    (30) The installation and operation of the computer will be 
coordinated and controlled by the following management structure:
    (i) Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will comprise 
nationals of the importing country who will oversee the management and 
operation of the computer.
    (ii) Security Staff. The Security Staff will be selected by the end-
user or the government of the importing country to ensure that the 
required safeguards are implemented. This staff will be responsible for 
conducting an annual audit to evaluate physical security, administrative 
procedures, and technical controls.
    (iii) Technical Consultative Committee. This committee will comprise 
technical experts from the importing country and the exporting company 
who will provide guidance in operating and maintaining the computer. At 
least one member of the committee will be an employee of the exporter. 
The committee will approve all accounts and maintain an accurate list of 
all users. In addition, the committee will advise the Steering Committee 
and the Security Staff concerning the security measures needed to ensure 
compliance with the safeguards required by the license.
    (31) An ultimate consignee who is a multiple-purpose end-user, such 
as a university, will establish a peer review group comprising experts 
who represent each department or application area authorized for use on 
the computer under the conditions of the license. This group shall have 
the following responsibilities:
    (i) Review all requests for computer usage and make recommendations 
concerning the acceptability of all projects and users;
    (ii) Submit these recommendations to the Security Staff and 
Technical Consultative Committee for review and approval (see paragraph 
(a)(28) of this supplement);
    (iii) Establish acceptable computer resource parameters for each 
project and review the results to verify their conformity with the 
authorized end-uses, restrictions, and parameters; and
    (iv) Prepare monthly reports that would include a description of any 
runs exceeding the established parameters and submit them to the 
security staff.
    (32) The end-user will also cooperate with any post-shipment 
inquiries or inspections by the U.S. Government or exporting company 
officials to verify the disposition and/or use of the computer, 
including access to the following:
    (i) Usage logs, which should include, at a minimum, computer users, 
dates, times of use, and amount of system time used;
    (ii) Computer access authorization logs, which should include, at a 
minimum, computer users, project names, and purpose of projects.
    (33) The end-user will also cooperate with the U.S. Government or 
exporting company officials concerning the physical inspection of the 
computer using facility, on short notice, at least once a year and will 
provide access to all data relevant to computer usage. This inspection 
will include:
    (i) Analyzing any programs or software run on the computer to ensure 
that all usage complies with the authorized end-uses on the license. 
This will be done by examining user files (e.g., source codes, machine 
codes, input/output data) that are either on-line at the time of the 
inspection or that have been previously sampled and securely stored.
    (ii) Checking current and archived usage logs for conformity with 
the authorized end-uses and the restrictions imposed by the license.
    (iii) Verifying the acceptability of all computer users in 
conformity with the authorized end-uses and the restrictions imposed by 
the license.

[[Page 325]]

    (34) Usage requests that exceed the quantity of monthly CPU time 
specified on the license shall not be approved without prior written 
authorization from the BXA. Requests for computational access approval 
shall include a description of the intended purpose for which access is 
sought.
    (35) In addition to, or in lieu of, the normal access by on-site 
exporting company staff or its representatives, the company, when 
required by the exporting government, will provide a separate remote 
electronic access capability to the computer for the purposes of 
maintenance, troubleshooting, inspection of work in progress, and 
auditing of all work performed on the computer. On-site and central 
exporting company hardware and software maintenance facilities, at the 
direction of the exporting company staff or its representatives, to 
gather information such as:
    (i) Statistical profiles of production jobs;
    (ii) Logs of jobs run in both production and development mode;
    (iii) Logs and reports of security related events.
    If such method is used, the remote maintenance facilities will be 
considered part of the operating system and protected accordingly, and 
will be available only to exporting company operational staff or its 
representatives. The maintenance hardware and software and associated 
communication links will be protected to ensure the integrity and 
authenticity of data and programs and to prevent tampering with 
hardware.
    (36) The export company staff or its representatives will be 
required to provide personnel for a specified period of time at the 
computer facility for management, operation, and safeguarding of the 
computer.
    (b) Certification by export control authorities of importing 
country. (1) The following importing government certification may be 
required under Sec. 742.12 of this part:

    This is to certify that (name of ultimate consignee) has declared to 
(name of appropriate foreign government agency) that the computer (model 
name) will be used only for the purposes specified in the end-use 
statement and that the ultimate consignee will establish and adhere to 
all the safeguard conditions and perform all other undertakings 
described in the end-use statement.
    The (name of appropriate foreign government agency) will advise the 
United States Government of any evidence that might reasonably indicate 
the existence of circumstances (e.g., transfer of ownership) that could 
affect the objectives of the security safeguard conditions.

    (2) Other importing government assurances regarding prohibited 
activities may also be required on a case-by-case basis.
    (c) Commercial consignees. Exports or reexports of computers that 
are solely dedicated to the following non-scientific and non-technical 
commercial business uses will usually be eligible for a reduced set of 
security safeguard conditions:
    (1) Financial services (e.g., banking, securities and commodity 
exchanges);
    (2) Insurance;
    (3) Reservation systems;
    (4) Point-of-sales systems;
    (5) Mailing list maintenance for marketing purposes;
    (6) Inventory control for retail/wholesale distribution.

Sec. 744.1  General provisions.

    (a) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are references 
to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part contains prohibitions 
against exports, reexports, and selected transfers to certain end-users 
and end-uses as introduced under General Prohibition Four (Denial 
Orders) and prohibitions against exports or reexports to certain end-
uses as introduced, under General Prohibition Five (End-use/End-users). 
Sections 744.2, 744.3, 744.4, and 744.5 prohibit exports and reexports 
of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear, missile, chemical and 
biological weapons, and nuclear maritime end-uses. Section 744.6 
prohibits certain activities by U.S. persons in support of certain 
nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological end-uses regardless of whether 
that support involves the export or reexport of items subject to the 
EAR. Sections 744.7 and 744.8 prohibit exports and reexports of certain 
items for certain aircraft and vessels. In addition, these sections 
include license review

[[Page 330]]

standards for export license applications submitted as required by these 
sections. It should also be noted that part 764 of the EAR prohibits 
exports, reexports and certain in-country transfers of items subject to 
the EAR to denied parties.
    (b) Steps. The following are steps you should follow in using the 
provisions of this part:
    (1) Review end-use and end-user prohibitions. First, review each 
end-use and end-user prohibition described in this part to learn the 
scope of these prohibitions.
    (2) Determine applicability. Second, determine whether any of the 
end-use and end-user prohibitions described in this part are applicable 
to your planned export, reexport, or other activity. See Supplement No. 
1 to part 732 for guidance.
    (c) A list of entities is included in Supplement No. 4 to this part 
744 of the EAR (Entity List). Exporters are hereby informed that these 
entities are ineligible to receive any items subject to the EAR without 
a license to the extent specified in the supplement. No License 
Exceptions are available for exports or reexports to listed entities of 
specified items, except License Exceptions for items listed in 
Sec. 740.2(a)(5) of the EAR destined to listed Indian or Pakistani 
entities intended to ensure the safety of civil aviation and safe 
operation of commercial passenger aircraft.

<R05>
Sec. 744.2  Restrictions on certain nuclear end-uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements for 
items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport to any 
destination, other than countries in the Supplement No. 3 to this part, 
any item subject to the EAR without a license if at the time of the 
export or reexport you know <SUP>1</SUP> the item will be used directly 
or indirectly in any one or more of the following activities described 
in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Part 772 of the EAR defines ``knowledge'' for all of the EAR 
except part 760, Restrictive Trade Practices and Boycotts. The 
definition, which includes variants such as ``know'' and ``reason to 
know'', encompasses more than positive knowledge. Thus, the use of 
``know'' in this section in place of the former wording ``know or have 
reason to know'' does not lessen or otherwise change the 
responsibilities of persons subject to the EAR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Nuclear explosive activities. Nuclear explosive activities, 
including research on or development, design, manufacture, construction, 
testing or maintenance of any nuclear explosive device, or components or 
subsystems of such a device.\2\ \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Nuclear explosive devices and any article, material, equipment, 
or device specifically designed or specially modified for use in the 
design, development, or fabrication of nuclear weapons or nuclear 
explosive devices are subject to export licensing or other requirements 
of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State, or 
the licensing or other restrictions specified in the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended. Similarly, items specifically designed or 
specifically modified for use in devising, carrying out, or evaluating 
nuclear weapons tests or nuclear explosions (except such items as are in 
normal commercial use for other purposes) are subject to the same 
requirements.
    \3\ Also see Secs. 744.5 and 748.4 of the EAR for special provisions 
relating to technical data for maritime nuclear propulsion plants and 
other commodities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Activities including research 
on, or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation, or 
maintenance of any nuclear reactor, critical facility, facility for the 
fabrication of nuclear fuel, facility for the conversion of nuclear 
material from one chemical form to another, or separate storage 
installation, where there is no obligation to accept International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards at the relevant facility or 
installation when it contains any source or special fissionable material 
(regardless of whether or not it contains such material at the time of 
export), or where any such obligation is not met.
    (3) Safeguarded and unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Safeguarded 
and

[[Page 331]]

unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activities, including research on or 
development, design, manufacture, construction, operation or maintenance 
of any of the following facilities, or components for such facilities: 
\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Such activities may also require a specific authorization from 
the Secretary of Energy pursuant to Sec. 57.b.(2) of the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, as amended, as implemented by the Department of Energy's 
regulations published in 10 CFR 810.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Facilities for the chemical processing of irradiated special 
nuclear or source material;
    (ii) Facilities for the production of heavy water;
    (iii) Facilities for the separation of isotopes of source and 
special nuclear material; or
    (iv) Facilities for the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel 
containing plutonium.
    (b) Additional prohibition on exporters or reexporters informed by 
BXA. BXA may inform an exporter or reexporter, either individually by 
specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is 
required for export or reexport of specified items to specified end-
users, because BXA has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of 
use in, or diversion to, any of the activities described in paragraph 
(a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the 
direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. 
When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written 
notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does not 
excuse the exporter or reexporter from compliance with the license 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Exceptions. Despite the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section, you may export technology subject to the EAR 
under the operation technology and software or sales technology and 
software provisions of License Exception TSU (see Sec. 740.13 (a) and 
(b)), but only to and for use in countries listed in Country Group A:1 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), Iceland and New Zealand. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of part 740 of the EAR, the provisions of 
Sec. 740.13 (a) and (b) will only overcome general prohibition five for 
countries listed in Country Group A:1, Iceland and New Zealand.
    (d) License review standards. The following factors are among those 
used by the United States to determine whether to grant or deny license 
applications required under this section:
    (1) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be 
transferred are appropriate for the stated end-use and whether that 
stated end-use is appropriate for the end-user;
    (2) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular 
commodity, software, or technology;
    (3) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be exported 
are to be used in research on or for the development, design, 
manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance of any reprocessing 
or enrichment facility;
    (4) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for 
nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;
    (5) Whether the end-user has been engaged in clandestine or illegal 
procurement activities;
    (6) Whether an application for a license to export to the end-user 
has previously been denied, or whether the end-use has previously 
diverted items received under a license, License Exception, or NLR to 
unauthorized activities;
    (7) Whether the export would present an unacceptable risk of 
diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear fuel-
cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2 of this part; and
    (8) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, based 
on consideration of the following factors:
    (i) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition of 
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) (see Supplement 
No. 2 to part 742 of the EAR), or to a similar international legally-
binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement;

[[Page 332]]

    (ii) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclear 
activities, facilities or installations that are operational, being 
designed, or under construction, under International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards;
    (iii) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil 
uses of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country;
    (iv) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the government 
of the importing country are in support of nuclear nonproliferation and 
whether that government is in compliance with its international 
obligations in the field of nonproliferation;
    (v) The degree to which the government of the importing country 
cooperates in nonproliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness to 
consult on international nonproliferation issues);
    (vi) Intelligence data on the importing country's nuclear intentions 
and activities.

Sec. 744.3  Restrictions on certain missile end-uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements for 
items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport an item 
subject to the EAR without a license if at the time of the export or 
reexport you know the item:
    (1) Is destined to or for a project listed in the footnote to 
Country Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (2) Will be used in the design, development, production or use of 
missiles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4, whether or not 
that use involves a listed project.
    (b) Additional prohibition on exporters informed by BXA. BXA may 
inform the exporter or reexporter, either individually by specific 
notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for a 
specific export or reexport, or for exports or reexports of specified 
items to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk of 
use in or diversion to activities described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, anywhere in the world. Specific notice is to be given only by, 
or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export 
Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed 
by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the absence of 
any such notification does not excuse the exporter from compliance with 
the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. An 
illustrative list of projects is included in a footnote to Country Group 
D:4. Exporters and reexporters are deemed to have been informed that an 
individual license is required to export or reexport to these projects. 
Exporters should be aware that the list of projects in Country Group D:4 
is not comprehensive; extra caution should be exercised when making any 
shipments to a country listed in Country Group D:4.
    (c) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions 
described in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) License review standards for certain missile end-uses. (1)

considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export would 
make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. When an 
export is deemed to make a material contribution, the license will be 
denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered to 
determine what action should be taken on an application required by this 
section:
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export in terms of its contribution to 
the design, development, production, or use of missiles;
    (iii) The capabilities and objectives of the missile and space 
programs of the recipient country;
    (iv) The non-proliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (v) The types of assurances or guarantees against design, 
development, production or use for missiles delivery purposes that are 
given in a particular case; and

Sec. 744.4  Restrictions on certain chemical and biological weapons end-uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements for 
items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport an item 
subject to the EAR without a license if at the time of the export or 
reexport you know the item will be used in the design, development, 
production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons in or 
by a country listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 
740 of the EAR).
    (b) Additional prohibition on exporters informed by BXA. BXA may 
inform the exporter or reexporter, either individually by specific 
notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for a 
specific export or reexport, or for export or reexport of specified 
items to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk of 
use in or diversion to such activities, anywhere in the world. Specific 
notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is 
provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two 
working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export 
Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not 
excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions 
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) License review standards. (1) Applications to export or reexport 
items subject to this section will be considered on a case-by-case basis 
to determine whether the export or reexport would make a material 
contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use 
of chemical or biological weapons. When an export is deemed to make such 
a contribution, the license will be denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered to 
determine what action should be taken on an application required under 
this section:
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export in terms of its contribution to 
the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or 
biological weapons;
    (iii) The non-proliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees against design, 
development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological

stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons in or by a country 
listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR).
    (ii) No U.S. person shall, without a license from BXA, knowingly 
support an export, reexport, or transfer that does not have a license as 
required by this section. Support means any action, including financing, 
transportation, and freight forwarding, by which a person facilitates an 
export, reexport, or transfer without being the actual exporter or 
reexporter.
    (2) Other activities unrelated to exports. No U.S. person shall, 
without a license from BXA:
    (i) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S. 
person knows will directly assist in the design, development, 
production, or use of missiles in or by a country listed in Country 
Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (ii) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S. 
person knows directly will directly assist in the design, development, 
production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons in or 
by a country listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 
740 of the EAR).
    (3) Whole plant requirement. No U.S. person shall, without a license 
from BXA, participate in the design, construction, export, or reexport 
of a whole plant to make chemical weapons precursors identified in ECCN 
1C350, in countries other than those listed in Country Group A:3 
(Australia Group) (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (b) Additional prohibitions on U.S. persons informed by BXA. BXA may 
inform U.S. persons, either individually or through amendment to the 
EAR, that a license is required because an activity could involve the 
types of participation and support described in paragraph (a) of this 
section anywhere in the world.
    Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice 
is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two 
working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export 
Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not 
excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the 
term U.S. person includes:
    (1) Any individual who is a citizen of the United States, a 
permanent resident alien of the United States, or a protected individual 
as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3);
    (2) Any juridical person organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States, including foreign 
branches; and
    (3) Any person in the United States.
    (d) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions 
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) License review standards. Applications to engage in activities 
otherwise prohibited by this section will be denied if the activities 
would make a material contribution to the design, development, 
production, stockpiling, or use of nuclear explosive devices, chemical 
or biological weapons, or of missiles.

Sec. 744.9  Restrictions on technical assistance by U.S. persons with respect to encryption items.

    (a) General prohibition. No U.S. person may, without authorization 
from BXA, provide technical assistance (including training) to foreign 
persons with the intent to aid a foreign person in the development or 
manufacture outside the United States of encryption commodities and 
software that, if of United States origin, would be controlled for EI 
reasons under ECCN 5A002 or 5D002. Technical assistance may be exported 
immediately to nationals of the countries listed in Supplement 3 to part 
740 of the EAR (except for technical assistance to government end-users 
for cryptanalytic items) provided the exporter has submitted to BXA a 
completed classification request by the time of export. Note that this 
prohibition does not apply if the U.S. person providing the assistance 
has a license or is otherwise entitled to export the encryption 
commodities and software in question to the foreign person(s) receiving 
the assistance. Note in addition that the mere teaching or discussion of 
information about cryptography, including, for example, in an academic 
setting or in the work of groups or bodies engaged in standards 
development, by itself would not establish the intent described in this 
section, even where foreign persons are present.
    (b) Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the 
term U.S. person includes:
    (1) Any individual who is a citizen or permanent resident alien of 
the United States;
    (2) Any juridical person organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States, including foreign 
branches; and
    (3) Any person in the United States.
    (c) License review standards. Applications involving activities 
described in this section will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to 
determine whether the activity is consistent with U.S. national security 
and foreign policy interests.

persons with terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace 
process. Pursuant to the Executive Order, the Department of the 
Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), maintains 31 CFR part 
595, the Terrorism Sanctions Regulations. In the Appendices to 31 CFR 
Chapter V, pursuant to 31 CFR part 595, these Specially Designated 
Terrorists are identified by the bracketed suffix initials [SDT]. The 
requirements set forth below further the objectives of Executive Order 
12947.
    (a) License requirement(s). (1) All exports and reexports to an SDT 
by a U.S. person of any item subject to the EAR; and
    (2) A license requirement applies to all exports and reexports to an 
SDT of any item subject to the EAR on the Commerce Control List (CCL).
    (3) To avoid duplication, U.S. persons are not required to seek 
separate authorization for an export or reexport subject both to the EAR 
and to OFAC's Terrorism Sanctions Regulations. Therefore, if OFAC 
authorizes an export or reexport by a U.S. person to a SDT, no separate 
authorization from BXA is necessary.
    (4) Any export or reexport by a U.S. person of any item subject to 
both the EAR and OFAC's Terrorism Sanctions Regulations and not 
authorized by OFAC is a violation of the EAR. Any export from abroad or 
reexport by a non-U.S. person of items requiring a license pursuant to 
this section and not authorized by BXA is a violation of the EAR.
    (5) These licensing requirements supplement any other requirements 
set forth elsewhere in the EAR.
    (b) Exceptions. No License Exceptions or other BXA authorization for 
items described by paragraph (a) of this section are available for 
exports or reexports to SDTs.
    (c) Licensing policy. Applications for licenses required by 
paragraph (a) of this section generally will be denied. You should 
consult with OFAC concerning transactions subject to OFAC licensing 
requirements.
    (d) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.

the Foreign Terrorist Organizations Sanctions Regulations, requiring 
U.S. financial institutions to block all financial transactions 
involving assets of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations within 
the possession or control of such U.S. financial institutions. Section 
303 of the Anti-Terrorism Act prohibits persons within the United States 
or subject to U.S. jurisdiction from knowingly providing material 
support or resources to a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and 
makes violations punishable by criminal penalties under title 18, United 
States Code. These designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations are listed 
in the Appendices to 31 CFR Chapter V and identified by the bracketed 
suffix initials [FTO]. The export control requirements set forth below 
further the objectives of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
    (a) License requirement(s). A license requirement applies to:
    (1) All exports and reexports to an FTO of any item subject to the 
EAR on the Commerce Control List (CCL); and
    (2) All exports and reexports to an FTO by a U.S. person of any item 
subject to the EAR.
    (3) Any export or reexport by a U.S. person prohibited by the EAR 
and not authorized by BXA is a violation of the EAR. Any export from 
abroad or reexport by a non-U.S. person of items requiring a license 
pursuant to this section and not authorized by BXA is a violation of the 
EAR.
    (4) These licensing requirements supplement any other requirements 
set forth elsewhere in the EAR.

[[Page 338]]

    (b) Exceptions. No License Exceptions or other BXA authorization for 
items described by paragraph (a) of this section are available for 
exports or reexports to FTOs.
    (c) Licensing policy. Applications for exports and reexports to FTOs 
of all items identified by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section 
will generally be denied, to the extent they constitute material support 
or resources, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2339A(b).
    (d) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    Note to Sec. 744.14: This section does not implement, construe, or 
limit the scope of any criminal statute, including (but not limited to) 
18 U.S.C. 2339B(a)(1) and 2339A, and does not excuse any person from 
complying with any criminal statute, including (but not limited to) 18 
U.S.C. 2339B(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. 2339A.

Sec. 744.16  Restrictions on exports and reexports by U.S. persons to specially designated persons on the list of Specially Designated Nationals identified by 
          the bracketed suffix initials [FRYM].

    BXA maintains restrictions on exports and reexports of any item 
subject to the EAR by U.S. persons to persons designated pursuant to 
Executive Order 13088 of June 9, 1998, as amended by Executive Order 
13192 of January 17, 2001 (Executive Order 13088, as amended). These 
designated persons include individuals listed in the Annex to Executive 
Order 13192, as well as persons designated by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State pursuant to that 
order (e.g., the former President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
Slobodan Milosevic; his close associates; persons determined to be under 
open indictment by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia; and persons determined to have sought, or to be seeking, to 
maintain or reestablish illegitimate control over the political 
processes or economic resources of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro)). Persons designated pursuant to Executive Order 
13088, as amended, are included on the list of Specially Designated 
Nationals maintained by the Department of the Treasury's Office of 
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and identified by the bracketed suffix 
initials [FRYM]. The requirements set forth in this section further the 
objectives of Executive Order 13088, as amended.
    (a) License requirements. (1) A license is required for all exports 
and reexports of any item subject to the EAR by a U.S. person to a 
person on the list of Specially Designated Nationals maintained by OFAC 
and identified by the bracketed initials [FRYM].
    (2) A U.S. person may also be required to seek separate 
authorization from OFAC for an export or reexport to a designated person 
identified by the bracketed initials [FRYM].
    (b) License policy. Applications for exports and reexports of any 
item subject to the EAR by a U.S. person to a Specially Designated 
National identified by the bracketed initials [FRYM] will be reviewed 
with a general policy of denial.

Sec. 745.1  Advance notification and annual report of all exports of Schedule 1 chemicals to other States Parties.

    Pursuant to the Convention, the United States is required to notify 
the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) not less 
than 30 days in advance of every export of a Schedule 1 chemical, in any 
quantity, to another State Party. In addition, the United States is 
required to provide a report of all exports of Schedule 1 chemicals to 
other States Parties during each calendar year. If you plan to export 
any quantity of a Schedule 1 chemical controlled under the EAR and 
licensed by the Department of Commerce or controlled under the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and licensed by the 
Department of State, you are required under this section to notify the 
Department of Commerce in advance of this export. You are also required 
to provide an annual report of exports that actually occurred during the 
previous calendar year. The United States will transmit the advance 
notifications and an aggregate annual report to the OPCW of exports of 
Schedule 1 chemicals from the United States. Note that the notification 
and annual report requirements of this section do not relieve the 
exporter of any requirement to obtain a license from the Department of 
Commerce for the export of Schedule 1 chemicals subject to the EAR or 
from the Department of State for the export of Schedule 1 chemicals 
subject to the ITAR.
    (a) Advance notification of exports. You must notify BXA at least 45 
calendar days prior to exporting any quantity of a Schedule 1 chemical 
listed in Supplement No. 1 to this part to another State Party. This is

Sec. 745.2  End-Use Certificate reporting requirements under the Chemical Weapons Convention.

    Note: The End-Use Certificate requirement of this section does not 
relieve the exporter of any requirement to obtain a license from the 
Department of Commerce for the export of Schedule 3 chemicals subject to 
the Export Administration Regulations or from the Department of State 
for the export of Schedule 3 chemicals subject to the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations.
    (a)(1) No U.S. person, as defined in Sec. 744.6(c) of the EAR, may 
export from the United States any Schedule 3 chemical identified in 
Supplement No. 1 to this part to countries not party to the Chemical 
Weapons Convention (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to this 
part) unless the U.S. person obtains from the consignee an End-Use 
Certificate issued by the government of the importing destination. This 
Certificate must be issued by the foreign government's agency 
responsible for foreign affairs or any other agency or department 
designated by the importing government for this purpose. Supplement No. 
3 to this part includes foreign authorized agencies responsible for 
issuing End-Use Certificates pursuant to this section. Additional 
foreign authorized agencies responsible for issuing End-Use Certificates 
will be included in Supplement No. 3 to this part when known. End-Use 
Certificates may be issued to cover aggregate quantities against which 
multiple shipments may be made to a single consignee. An End-Use 
Certificate covering multiple shipments may be used until the aggregate 
quantity is shipped. End-Use Certificates must be submitted separately 
from license applications.
    (2) Submit a copy of the End-Use Certificate to the Department of 
Commerce by fax at (703) 235-1481 or to the following address no later 
than 7 days after the date of export, for mail and

courier deliveries: Information Technology Team, Department of Commerce, 
Bureau of Export Administration, 1555 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 710, 
Arlington, VA 22209. Attn: CWC End-Use Certificate Report.
    (b) The End-Use Certificate described in paragraph (a) of this 
section must state the following:
    (1) That the chemicals will be used only for purposes not prohibited 
under the Chemical Weapons Convention;
    (2) That the chemicals will not be transferred to other end-user(s) 
or end-use(s);
    (3) The types and quantities of chemicals;
    (4) Their specific end-use(s); and
    (5) The name(s) and complete address(es) of the end-user(s).

<R05>
Sec. 746.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. This part implements broad based controls for items 
and activities subject to the EAR imposed to implement U.S. government 
policies. Two categories of controls are included in this part.
    (a) Comprehensive controls. This part contains or refers to all the 
BXA licensing requirements, licensing policies, and License Exceptions 
for countries subject to general embargoes, currently Cuba, Libya, Iran 
and Iraq. This part is the focal point for all the EAR requirements for 
transactions involving these countries.
    (1) Cuba and Libya. All the items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) 
require a license to Cuba or Libya. In addition, most other items 
subject to the EAR, but not included on the CCL, designated by the 
Number ``EAR99'', require a license to Cuba or Libya. Most items 
requiring a license to these destinations are subject to a general 
policy of denial. Because these controls extend to virtually all 
exports, they do not appear in the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR, 
nor are they reflected in the Commerce Control List in part 774 of the 
EAR.
    (2) Iran and Iraq. While BXA maintains controls on exports and 
reexports to Iran and Iraq, comprehensive embargoes on transactions 
involving these countries are administered by the Department of the 
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
    (b) Rwanda. The second category of controls that apply to Rwanda are 
supplemental to the controls described in the Country Chart in part 738 
of the EAR. Such controls are listed under each affected ECCN on the CCL 
in part 774 of the EAR.
    (c) This part also contains descriptions of controls maintained by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Treasury Department and by 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls in the Department of State. 
Comprehensive embargoes and supplemental controls implemented by BXA 
under the EAR usually also involve controls on items and activities 
maintained by these agencies. This part sets forth the allocation of 
licensing responsibilities between BXA and these other agencies. 
References to the requirements of other agencies are informational; for 
current, complete, and authoritative requirements, you should consult 
the appropriate agency's regulations.
    (d) Supplement No. 1 to this part provides you with general 
information on United Nations sanctions administered by the Department 
of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) (31 CFR part 
590) on UNITA in Angola.
    (e) Supplement No. 2 to this part provides you with general 
information on United Nations arms embargoes administered by the 
Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) on all the countries 
of the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Slovenia), 
Liberia and Somalia.

Sec. 746.2  Cuba.

    (a) License requirements. As authorized by section 6 of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA) and by the Trading with the 
Enemy Act of 1917, as amended, you will need a license to export or 
reexport all items subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR for the

    (1) License Exceptions. You may export or reexport without a license 
if

[[Page 352]]

your transaction meets all the applicable terms and conditions of any of 
the following License Exceptions. To determine the scope and eligibility 
requirements, you will need to turn to the sections or specific 
paragraphs of part 740 of the EAR (License Exceptions). Read each 
License Exception carefully, as the provisions available for embargoed 
countries are generally narrow.
    (i) Temporary exports and reexports (TMP) by the news media (see 
Sec. 740.9(a)(2)(viii) of the EAR).
    (ii) Operation technology and software (TSU) for legally exported 
commodities (see Sec. 740.13(a) of the EAR).
    (iii) Sales technology (TSU) (see Sec. 740.13(b) of the EAR).
    (iv) Software updates (TSU) for legally exported software (see 
Sec. 740.13(c) of the EAR).

    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Licensing policy. Items requiring a license are subject to a 
general policy of denial, except as follows:
    (1) Medicines and Medical Devices. Applications to export medicines 
and medical devices as defined in part 772 of the EAR will generally be 
approved, except:
    (i) To the extent restrictions would be permitted under section 5(m) 
of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA), or section 
203(b)(2) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act;
    (ii) If there is a reasonable likelihood that the item to be 
exported will be used for purposes of torture or other human rights 
abuses;
    (iii) If there is a reasonable likelihood that the item to be 
exported will be reexported;
    (iv) If the item to be exported could be used in the production of 
any biotechnological product; or
    (v) If it is determined that the United States government is unable 
to verify, by on-site inspection or other means, that the item to be 
exported will be used for the purpose for which it was intended and only 
for the use and benefit of the Cuban people, but this exception shall 
not apply to donations of medicines for humanitarian purposes to a 
nongovernmental organization in Cuba.
    (2) Telecommunications commodities may be authorized on a case-by-
case basis, provided the commodities are part of an FCC-approved project 
and are necessary to provide efficient and adequate telecommunications 
services between the United States and Cuba.
    (3) Exports from third countries to Cuba of non-strategic foreign-
made products that contain an insubstantial proportion of U.S.-origin 
materials, parts, or components will generally be considered favorably 
on a case-by-case basis, provided all of the following conditions are 
satisfied:
    (i) The local law requires, or policy favors, trade with Cuba;
    (ii) The U.S.-origin content does not exceed 20 percent of the value 
of the product to be exported from the third country. Requests where the 
U.S.-origin parts, components, or materials represent more than 20 
percent by value of the foreign-made product will generally be denied. 
See Supplement No. 2 to part 734 of the EAR for instructions on how to 
calculate value; and
    (iii) You are not a U.S.-owned or -controlled entity in a third 
country as defined by OFAC regulations, 31 CFR part 515, or you are a 
U.S.-owned or controlled entity in a third country and

[[Page 353]]

one or more of the following situations applies:
    (A) You have a contract for the proposed export that was entered 
into prior to October 23, 1992.
    (B) Your transaction involves the export of foreign-produced 
medicines or medical devices incorporating U.S. origin parts, components 
or materials, in which case the application will be reviewed according 
to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (C) Your transaction is for the export of foreign-produced 
telecommunications commodities incorporating U.S.-origin parts, 
components and materials, in which case the application will be reviewed 
under the licensing policy set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (D) Your transaction is for the export of donated food to 
individuals or non-governmental organizations in Cuba and does not 
qualify as a humanitarian donation under License Exception GFT 
(Sec. 740.12 of the EAR) or License Exception AGR (Sec. 740.18 of the 
EAR).
    (4) Applications for licenses may be approved, on a case-by-case 
basis, for certain exports to Cuba intended to provide support for the 
Cuban people, as follows:
    (i) Applications for licenses for exports of certain commodities and 
software may be approved to human rights organizations, or to 
individuals and non-governmental organizations that promote independent 
activity intended to strengthen civil society in Cuba when such exports 
do not give rise to U.S. national security or counter-terrorism 
concerns. Examples of such commodities include fax machines, copiers, 
computers (e.g., 486-level/CTP of 24.8 MTOPS or less), business/office 
software, document scanning equipment, printers, typewriters, and other 
office or office communications equipment. Applicants may donate or sell 
the commodities or software to be exported. Reexport to other end-users 
or end-uses is not authorized.
    (ii) Commodities and software may be approved for export to U.S. 
news bureaus in Cuba whose primary purpose is the gathering and 
dissemination of news to the general public. In addition to the examples 
of commodities and software listed in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section, certain telecommunications equipment necessary for the 
operation of news organizations (e.g., 33M bit/s data signaling rate or 
less) may be approved for export to U.S. news bureaus.
    (iii) Exports of agricultural items, which are outside the scope of 
agricultural commodities as defined in part 772 of the EAR, such as 
insecticides, pesticides and herbicides, as well as agricultural 
commodities not eligible for License Exception AGR, require a license 
and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
    (c) Cuba has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country 
whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of 
international terrorism. For anti-terrorism controls, see Supplement 2 
to part 742 of the EAR.
    (d) Definitions. For purposes of this section, ``U.S. person'' means 
any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, as 
described in Sec. 515.329 of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (31 
CFR 515.329).
    (e) Related controls. OFAC maintains controls on the activities of 
persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, wherever located, involving 
transactions with Cuba or any specially designated Cuban national, as 
provided in 31 CFR part 515. OFAC's Terrorism List Government Sanctions 
Regulations in 31 CFR part 596 prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in a 
financial transaction with the government of a designated state sponsor 
of international terrorism without OFAC authorization. The Department of 
State also implements sanctions on countries that are designated state 
sponsors of international terrorism. Exporters and reexporters should 
consult with those agencies for further guidance on these related 
controls.

Sec. 746.3  Iraq.

    (a) License requirements. OFAC administers an embargo against Iraq 
under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
of

[[Page 354]]

1977, as amended, and the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as 
amended, and in conformance with United Nations Security Council 
Resolutions. The applicable OFAC regulations, the Iraqi Sanctions 
Regulations, are found in 31 CFR part 575. You should consult with OFAC 
for authorization to export or reexport items subject to U.S. 
jurisdiction to Iraq, or to any entity owned or controlled by, or 
specially designated as acting for or on behalf of, the Government of 
Iraq. Please note that such applications will generally be denied by 
OFAC, absent a published policy stating otherwise. Under the EAR, you 
need a license to export or reexport to Iraq any item on the CCL 
containing a CB Column 1, CB Column 2, CB Column 3, NP Column 1, NP 
Column 2, NS Column 1, NS Column 2, MT Column 1, RS Column 1, RS Column 
2, CC Column 1, CC Column 2, CC Column 3 in the Country Chart Column of 
the License Requirements section of an ECCN, or classified under ECCNs 
1C980, 1C981, 1C982, 1C983, 1C984, 1C997, 5A980, 0A980, 0A982, 0A983, 
0A985, and 0E982; however, to avoid duplication, an authorization from 
OFAC constitutes authorization under the EAR, and no separate BXA 
authorization is necessary. No person may export or reexport any item 
subject to both the EAR and OFAC's Iraqi Sanctions Regulations without 
prior OFAC authorization. Exports and reexports subject to the EAR that 
are not subject to the Iraqi Sanctions Regulations may require 
authorization from BXA.
    (1) License Exceptions. You may export or reexport without a license 
if your transaction meets all the applicable terms and conditions of one 
of the following License Exceptions. Read each License Exception 
carefully, as the provisions available for embargoed countries are 
generally narrow.
    (i) Baggage (BAG) (see Sec. 740.14 of the EAR).
    (ii) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see 
Sec. 740.11 of the EAR).
    (2) Exports for the official use of the United Nations, its 
personnel or agencies (excluding its relief or developmental agencies). 
You must consult with OFAC to determine what transactions are eligible.
    (b) Iraq has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country 
that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism. For anti-terrorism controls, see Supplement 2 to part 742 of 
the EAR.
    (c) Related controls. OFAC maintains controls on the activities of 
U.S. persons, wherever located, involving transactions with Iraq or any 
specially designated Iraqi national, as provided in 31 CFR part 575.

Sec. 746.4  Libya.

    (a) Introduction. The Department of the Treasury and the Department 
of Commerce maintain comprehensive controls on exports and reexports to 
Libya. OFAC maintains comprehensive controls on exports and 
transshipments to Libya under the Libyan Sanctions Regulations (31 CFR 
part 550). To avoid duplicate licensing procedures, OFAC and BXA have 
allocated licensing responsibility as follows: OFAC licenses direct 
exports and transshipments to Libya; BXA licenses reexports, exports of 
foreign-manufactured items containing U.S.-origin parts, components or 
materials, and exports of foreign-produced direct product of U.S. 
technology or software. Issuance of an OFAC license also constitutes 
authorization under the EAR, and no license from BXA is necessary. 
Exports and reexports subject to the EAR that are not subject to the 
Libyan Sanctions Regulations continue to require authorization from BXA.
    (b) License requirements.
    (1) Exports. OFAC and BXA both require a license for virtually all 
exports (including transshipments) to Libya. Except as noted in 
paragraph (b) of this section or specified in OFAC regulation, you may 
not use any BXA License Exception or other BXA authorization to export 
or transship to Libya. You will need a license from OFAC for all direct 
exports and transshipments to Libya except those eligible for the 
following BXA License Exceptions:
    (i) Baggage (BAG) (see Sec. 740.14 of the EAR).

[[Page 355]]

    (ii) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see 
Sec. 740.11 of the EAR).
    (iii) Gift parcels (GFT) (see Sec. 740.12(a) of the EAR).
    (2) Reexports. You will need a license from BXA to reexport any 
U.S.-origin item from a third country to Libya, any foreign-manufactured 
item containing U.S.-origin parts, components or materials, as defined 
in Sec. 734.2(b)(2) of the EAR, or any national security-controlled 
foreign-produced direct product of U.S. technology or software, as 
defined in Sec. 734.2(b)(3) of the EAR, exported from the U.S. after 
March 12, 1982. You will need a license from BXA to reexport all items 
subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR) to Libya, except:
    (i) Food, medicines, medical supplies, and agricultural commodities;
    (ii) Reexports eligible for the following License Exceptions (read 
each License Exception carefully, as the provisions available for 
embargoed countries are generally narrow):
    (A) Temporary exports and reexports (TMP): reexports by the news 
media (see Sec. 740.9(a)(2)(viii) of the EAR).
    (B) Operation technology and software (TSU) for legally exported 
commodities (see Sec. 740.13(a) of the EAR).
    (C) Sales technology (TSU) (see Sec. 740.13(b) of the EAR).
    (D) Software updates (TSU) for legally exported software (see

    (E) Parts (RPL) for one-for-one replacement in certain legally 
exported commodities (Sec. 740.10(a) of the EAR).
    (F) Baggage (BAG) (Sec. 740.14 of the EAR).
    (G) Aircraft and vessels (AVS) for vessels only (see Sec. 740.15 
(c)(1) of the EAR), and temporary reexports of foreign registered 
aircraft (see Sec. 740.15 (a)(4) of the EAR).
    (H) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see 
Sec. 740.11 of the EAR).
    (I) Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT) (see Sec. 740.12 
of the EAR).
    (J) Permissive reexports of certain spare parts in foreign-made 
equipment (see Sec. 740.16(h) of the EAR).
    (c) Licensing policy. (1) You should consult with OFAC regarding 
licensing policy for transactions subject to OFAC regulation.
    (2) The licensing policy for BXA controls is as follows. Licenses 
will generally be denied for:
    (i) Items controlled for national security purposes and related 
technology and software, including controlled foreign produced products 
of U.S. technology and software exported from the United States after 
March 12, 1982; and
    (ii) Oil and gas equipment and technology and software, if listed in 
paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section, or if determined by BXA not to be 
readily available from sources outside the United States; and
    (iii) Commodities, software, and technology destined for the 
petrochemical processing complex at Ras Lanuf, if listed in paragraph 
(c)(2)(vii) of this section, or where such items would contribute 
directly to the development or construction of that complex (items 
destined for the township at Ras Lanuf, or for the public utilities or 
harbor facilities associated with that township, generally will not be 
regarded as making such a contribution where their functions will be 
primarily related to the township, utilities or harbor);
    (iv) Aircraft (including helicopters) or aircraft parts, components, 
or accessories to Libya or the provision of engineering and maintenance 
servicing of Libyan aircraft or aircraft components;
    (v) Arms and related material of all types, including the sale or 
transfer of weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, 
paramilitary police equipment, spare parts for the aforementioned, and 
equipment or supplies for the manufacture or maintenance of the 
aforementioned.
    (vi) Materials destined for the construction, improvement or 
maintenance of Libyan civilian or military airfields and associated 
facilities and equipment or any engineering or other services or 
components destined for the maintenance of any Libyan civil or military 
airfields or associated facilities and equipment, except emergency 
equipment and equipment and services directly related to civilian air 
traffic control; and

[[Page 356]]

    (vii) Items listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(vii) (A) through (E) and 
equipment and supplies for the manufacture or maintenance of such items:
    (A) Pumps of medium or large capacity (equal to or larger than 3500 
cubic meters per hour) and drivers (gas turbines and electric motors) 
designed for use in the transportation of crude oil and natural gas.
    (B) Equipment designed for use in crude oil export terminals, as 
follows:
    (1) Loading buoys or single point moorings;
    (2) Flexible hoses for connection between underwater manifolds

sizes (from 12-16 inches); or
    (3) Anchor chains.
    (C) Equipment not specially designed for use in crude oil export 
terminals, but which because of its large capacity can be used for this 
purpose, as follows:
    (1) Loading pumps of large capacity (4000 m \3\/h) and small head 
(10 bars);
    (2) Boosting pumps within the same range of flow rates;
    (3) Inline pipe line inspection tools and cleaning devices (i.e., 
pigging tools) (16 inches and above); or
    (4) Metering equipment of large capacity (1000 m \3\/h and above).
    (D) Refinery equipment, as follows:
    (1) Boilers meeting American Society of Mechanical Engineers 1 
standards;
    (2) Furnaces meeting American Society of Mechanical Engineers 8 
standards;
    (3) Fractionation columns meeting American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers 8 standards;
    (4) Pumps meeting American Petroleum Institute 610 standards;
    (5) Catalytic reactors meeting American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers 8 standards; or
    (6) Prepared catalysts, including catalysts containing platinum and 
catalysts containing molybdenum.
    (E) Spare parts for any of the items described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(vii) of this section.
    (3) Notwithstanding the presumptions of denial in paragraphs (c)(2) 
(i) through (iii) of this section, licenses will generally be issued for 
items not included in paragraphs (c)(2) (iv) through (vii) of this 
section when the transaction involves:
    (i) The export or reexport of commodities or technology and software 
under a contract in effect prior to March 12, 1982, where failure to 
obtain a license would not excuse performance under the contract;
    (ii) Reexport of items not controlled for national security purposes 
that had been exported from the United States prior to March 12, 1982 or 
exports of foreign products incorporating such items as components; or
    (iii) Incorporation of U.S.-origin parts, components, or materials 
in foreign-manufactured products destined for Libya, where the U.S. 
content is 20 percent or less by value.
    (4) Notwithstanding the presumption of denial in paragraph (c)(2) 
(iv) through (vii), applications for reexports under a contract pre-
dating January 18, 1994, will be reviewed under the licensing policy in 
effect prior to that date.
    (5) Licenses will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-
case basis when the transaction involves the following items, provided 
such items are not included in paragraph (c)(2) (iv) through (vii):
    (i) Reexports of items subject to national security controls that 
were exported prior to March 12, 1982 and exports of foreign products 
incorporating such U.S.-origin components, where the particular 
authorization would not be contrary to specific foreign policy 
objectives of the United States; or
    (ii) Items destined for use in the development or construction of 
the petrochemical processing complex at Ras Lanuf, where the transaction 
could be approved but for the general policy of denial set out in 
paragraph (c)(2)(iii), and where either:
    (A) The transaction involves a contract in effect before December 
20, 1983 that requires export or reexport of the items in question; or
    (B) The items had been exported from the U.S. before that date.
    (iii) Other unusual situations such as transactions involving firms 
with contractual commitments in effect before March 12, 1982.
    (6) Licenses will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-
case basis

[[Page 357]]

for the reexport of reasonable quantities for civil use of off-highway 
wheel tractors of carriage capacity of 9t (10 tons) or more, as defined 
in ECCN 9A990.b, provided such tractors are not for uses described in 
paragraph (c)(2) (iv) through (vi) of this section.
    (7) All other reexports not covered by United Nations resolutions 
will generally be approved, subject to any other licensing policies 
applicable to a particular transaction.

whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of 
international terrorism. For anti-terrorism controls, see Supplement 2 
to part 742 of the EAR.
    (e) Related controls. OFAC administers broad economic sanctions on 
Libya, and restricts participation by U.S. persons in transactions with 
Libya or specially designated Libyan nationals. The applicable OFAC

Sec. 746.7  Iran.

    The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) 
administers a comprehensive trade and investment embargo against Iran 
under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
of 1977, as amended, section 505 of the International Security and 
Development Cooperation Act of 1985, and Executive Orders 12957 and 
12959 of March 15, 1995 and May 6, 1995, respectively. This embargo 
includes prohibitions on export and certain reexport transactions 
involving Iran, including transactions dealing with items subject to the 
EAR. (See OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 560.) BXA 
continues to maintain licensing requirements on exports and reexports to 
Iran under the EAR as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. No 
person may export or reexport items subject to both the EAR and OFAC's 
Iranian Transactions Regulations without prior OFAC authorization. 
Exports and reexports subject to the EAR that are not subject to the 
Iranian Transactions Regulations may require authorization from BXA.
    (a) License requirements--(1) OFAC administered embargo. You should 
consult with OFAC if:
    (i) You seek authorization to export from the United States; or
    (ii) You are a United States person (as defined in OFAC's Iranian 
Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 560) and seek authorization to 
export or reexport from a third country; or
    (iii) You seek authorization to reexport U.S.-origin items that were 
subject to any export license application requirements prior to 
Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995.
    (2) BXA license requirements. A license is required under the EAR:
    (i) To export to Iran any item on the CCL containing a CB Column 1, 
CB Column 2, CB Column 3, NP Column 1, NP Column 2, NS Column 1, NS 
Column 2, MT Column 1, RS Column 1, RS Column 2, CC Column 1, CC Column 
2, CC Column 3, AT Column 1 or AT Column 2 in the Country Chart Column 
of the License Requirements section of an ECCN, or classified under 
ECCNs 1C980, 1C981, 1C982, 1C983, 1C984, 5A980, 0A980, and 0A983; or
    (ii) To reexport to Iran any of the items identified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section, except for ECCNs 2A994; 3A992.a; 5A991.g; 
5A992; 6A991; 6A998; 7A994; 8A992.d, .e, .f, and .g; 9A990.a and .b; and 
9A991.d and .e. However, the export of these items from the United 
States to any destination with knowledge that they will be reexported, 
in whole or in part, to Iran, is prohibited without a license; or
    (iii) To export or reexport items subject to the general 
prohibitions, including proliferation end-use prohibitions (see part 736 
of the EAR).
    (3) BXA authorization. To avoid duplication, exporters or 
reexporters are not required to seek separate authorization from BXA for 
an export or reexport subject both to the EAR and to OFAC's Iranian 
Transactions Regulations. Therefore, if OFAC authorizes an export or 
reexport, no separate authorization from BXA is necessary.

[[Page 358]]

    (4) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term ``United 
States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident 
alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States (including 
foreign branches), or any person in the United States; the term 
``foreign person'' means those not defined as United States persons.
    (b) Iran has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country 
that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism. For anti-terrorism controls, see Sec. 742.8 of the EAR and 
Supplement 2 to part 742.

rights or obligations conferred or imposed by any international 
agreement or any contract entered into or any license or permit granted 
prior to that date, except to the extent provided in regulations,

section. You will also need a license for the sale, supply, export or 
reexport to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) 
of such items by any U.S. person in any foreign country or other 
location. (Reexport controls imposed by this embargo apply only to 
reexports by U.S. persons. Reexport controls on U.S.-origin items to the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) set forth in 
other parts of the EAR remain in effect.) You will also need a license 
for the use of any U.S.-registered aircraft or vessel to supply or

6E002, 9A980, and 9A991.a.
    (2) Date of embargo. The licensing requirements in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section were effective on July 14, 1998, except for ECCN 0E982, 
which took effect on September 13, 2000.
    (b) Licensing policy. Applications for export or reexport of all 
items listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are 
subject to a general policy of denial. Consistent with United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 1160, this embargo is effective 
notwithstanding the existence of any rights or obligations conferred or 
imposed by any international agreement or any contract entered into or 
any license or permit granted prior to the appropriate date referred to 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except to the extent provided in 
regulations, orders, directives or licenses that may be issued in the 
future under Executive Order 12918 or under the EAR.
    (c) Related controls. The Department of State, Office of Defense 
Trade Controls, maintains related controls on arms and military 
equipment under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 
parts 120 through 130). You should also contact the Department of the 
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control concerning any restrictions 
which might apply to U.S. persons involving financial transactions or 
dealings with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro).

opinion or licensing decision only through the review of a properly 
completed application supported by all relevant facts and required 
documentation submitted in writing or electronically to BXA.
    (c) Confidentiality. Consistent with section 12(c) of the Export 
Administration Act, as amended, information obtained for the purposes of

<R05>
Sec. 748.3  Classification and Advisory Opinions.

    (a) Introduction. In light of your responsibility to classify your 
item, you may ask BXA to provide you with the correct Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) to the paragraph (or subparagraph if 
appropriate). BXA will advise you whether or not your item is subject to 
the EAR and, if applicable, the appropriate ECCN. This type of request 
is commonly referred to as a ``Classification Request''. If requested, 
for a given end-use, end-user, and/or destination, BXA will advise you 
whether a license is required, or likely to be granted, for a particular 
transaction. Note that these responses do

[[Page 362]]

not bind BXA to issuing a license in the future. This type of request, 
along with requests for guidance regarding other interpretations of the 
EAR are commonly referred to as ``Advisory Opinions''.
    (b) Classification requests. You must submit your Classification 
Request using Form BXA-748P or its electronic equivalent. See the 
instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 748 to complete the 
Blocks identified for this type of request. Classification Requests must 
be sent to BXA at one of the addresses listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of this 
part or submitted electronically. Be certain that your request is 
complete and does not omit any essential information.
    (1) Each Classification Request must be limited to six items. 
Exceptions may be granted by BXA on a case-by-case basis for several 
related items if the relationship between the items is satisfactorily 
substantiated in the request. Classification requests must be supported 
by any descriptive literature, brochures, precise technical 
specifications or papers that describe the items in sufficient technical 
detail to enable classification by BXA.
    (2) When submitting a Classification Request, you must complete 
Blocks 1 through 5, 14, 22 (a), (b), (c), (d), and (i), 24, and 25 on 
Form BXA-748P. You must provide a recommended classification in Block 
22(a) and explain the basis for your recommendation based on the 
technical parameters specified in the appropriate ECCN in Block 24. If 
you are unable to determine a recommended classification for your item, 
include an explanation in Block 24, identifying the ambiguities or 
deficiencies that precluded you from making a recommended 
classification.
    (3) Classification requests for a Department of Commerce review of 
encryption software transferred from the U.S. Munitions List consistent 
with Executive Order 13026 of November 15, 1996 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 
228) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date are 
required prior to export to determine eligibility for release from EI 
controls. Exporters may self-classify 5A992, 5D992 or 5E992 items after 
submitting to BXA and the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator by the time 
of export the information described in paragraphs 1-5 of Supplement 6 to 
Part 742 of the EAR. Refer to Sec. 742.15(b) and Supplement No. 6 to 
Part 742 of the EAR for instructions on submitting such requests for 
mass market encryption software.
    (c) Advisory Opinions. Advisory Opinions must be submitted in 
writing to the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of the EAR. Both your 
letter and envelope must be marked ``Advisory Opinion.''
    (1) Your letter must contain the following information if you are 
requesting guidance regarding interpretations of the EAR:
    (i) The name, title, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the 
person to contact,
    (ii) Your complete address comprised of street address, city, state, 
country, and postal code; and
    (2) If you are requesting BXA to determine whether a license is 
required, or the licensing policy related to a particular end-use, end-
user, and/or destination, in addition to the information required in 
Sec. 748.3(c)(1) you must also include:
    (i) All available information on the parties to the transaction and 
the proposed end-use or end-user,
    (ii) The model number for each item, where appropriate,
    (iii) The Export Control Classification Number, if known, for each 
item; and
    (iv) Any descriptive literature, brochures, technical specifications 
or papers that describe the items in sufficient technical detail to 
enable BXA to verify the correct classification.

<R05>
Sec. 748.4  Basic guidance related to applying for a license.

    (a) License applicant. (1) Export transactions. Only a person in the 
United States may apply for a license to export items from the United 
States. The applicant must be the exporter, who is the U.S. principal 
party in interest with the authority to determine and control the 
sending of items out of the United States, except for Encryption License 
Arrangements (ELA) (see

[[Page 363]]

Sec. 750.7(d) of the EAR). See definition of ``exporter'' in part 772 of 
the EAR.
    (2) Routed export transactions. The U.S. principal party in interest 
or the duly authorized U.S. agent of the foreign principal party in 
interest may apply for a license to export items from the United States. 
Prior to submitting an application, the agent that applies for a license 
on behalf of the foreign principal party in interest must obtain a power 
of attorney or other written authorization from the foreign principal 
party in interest. See Sec. 758.3(b) and (d) of the EAR.
    (3) Reexport transactions. The U.S. or foreign principal party in 
interest, or the duly authorized U.S. agent of the foreign principal 
party in interest, may apply for a license to reexport controlled items 
from one country to another. Prior to submitting an application, an 
agent that applies for a license on behalf of a foreign principal party 
in interest must obtain a power-of-attorney or other written 
authorization from the foreign principal party in interest, unless there 
is a preexisting relationship by ownership, control, position of 
responsibility or affiliation. See power-of-attorney requirements in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (b) Disclosure of parties on license applications and the power of 
attorney. (1) Disclosure of parties. License applicants must disclose 
the names and addresses of all parties to a transaction. When the 
applicant is the U.S. agent of the foreign principal party in interest, 
the applicant must disclose the fact of the agency relationship, and the 
name and address of the agent's principal. If there is any doubt about 
which persons should be named as parties to the transaction, the 
applicant should disclose the names of all such persons and the 
functions to be performed by each in Block 24 (Additional Information) 
of the BXA-748P Multipurpose Application form. Note that when the 
foreign principal party in interest is the ultimate consignee or end-
user, the name and address need not be repeated in Block 24. See 
``Parties to the transaction'' in Sec. 748.5.
    (2) Power of attorney or other written authorization--(i) 
Requirement. An agent must obtain a power of attorney or other written 
authorization from the principal party in interest, unless there is a 
preexisting relationship by ownership, control, position of 
responsibility or affiliation, prior to preparing or submitting an 
application for a license, when acting as either:
    (A) An agent, applicant, licensee and exporter for a foreign 
principal party in interest in a routed transaction; or
    (B) An agent who prepares an application for export on behalf of a 
U.S. principal party in interest who is the actual applicant, licensee 
and exporter in an export transaction.
    (ii) Application. When completing the BXA-748P Multipurpose 
Application Form, Block 7 (documents on file with applicant) must be 
marked ``other'' and Block 24 (Additional information) must be marked 
``748.4(b)(2)'' to indicate that the power of attorney or other written 
authorization is on file with the agent. See Sec. 758.3(d) for power of 
attorney requirement, and see also part 762 of the EAR for recordkeeping 
requirements.
    (c) Prohibited from applying for a license. No person convicted of a 
violation of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the Export 
Administration Act, as amended, at the discretion of the Secretary of 
Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up to 10 years from the 
date of the conviction. See Sec. 766.25 of the EAR.
    (d) Prior action on a shipment. If you have obtained a license 
without disclosure of the facts described in this section, the license 
will be deemed to have been obtained without disclosure of all facts 
material to the granting of the license and the license so obtained will 
be deemed void. See part 764 of the EAR for other sanctions that may 
result in the event a violation occurs.
    (1) Licenses for items subject to detention or seizure. If you 
submit a license application for items that you know have been detained 
or seized by the Office of Export Enforcement or by the U.S. Customs 
Service, you must disclose this fact to BXA when you submit your license 
application.
    (2) Licenses for items previously exported. You may not submit a 
license application to BXA covering a shipment that is already laden 
aboard the exporting carrier, exported or reexported. If such export or 
reexport should not have been made without

[[Page 364]]

first securing a license authorizing the shipment, you must send a 
letter of explanation to the Office of Export Enforcement, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., H4520, 
Washington, D.C., 20230. The letter must state why a license was not 
obtained and disclose all facts concerning the shipment that would 
normally have been disclosed on the license application. You will be 
informed of any action and furnished any instructions by the Office of 
Export Enforcement.
    (e) Multiple shipments. Your license application need not be limited 
to a single shipment, but may represent a reasonable estimate of items 
to be shipped throughout the validity of the license. Do not wait until 
the license you are using expires before submitting a new application. 
You may submit a new application prior to the expiration of your current 
license in order to ensure uninterrupted shipping.
    (f) Second application. You may not submit a second license 
application covering the same proposed transaction while the first is 
pending action by BXA.
    (g) Resubmission. If a license application is returned without 
action to you by BXA or your application represents a transaction 
previously denied by BXA, and you want to resubmit the license 
application, a new license application must be completed in accordance 
with the instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 748. Cite 
the Application Control Number on your original application in Block 24 
on the new license application.
    (h) Emergency processing. If you believe an emergency situation 
beyond your control necessitates expedited processing of your license 
application, you should contact BXA's Exporter Counseling Division of 
the Office of Exporter Services. This office may be reached by telephone 
on (202) 482-4811 or by facsimile on (202) 482-3617. These procedures do 
not apply to emergency handling of Special Comprehensive License 
applications.
    (1) How to request emergency handling. If your license application 
is already pending with BXA, contact the Exporter Counseling Division 
directly on either number listed in paragraph (h) of this section. If 
you have not yet submitted your license application, include a written 
letter with the title ``Emergency Handling Request'' with your license 
application. The letter must include:
    (i) A justification for the request, supported, where appropriate, 
with copies of orders, communications, or other documentation to 
substantiate that your request constitutes a valid emergency. You may be 
specifically requested to supply other documents not included with your 
submission.
    (ii) An acknowledgement by you that any license issued under these 
emergency procedures will have a limited validity period as described in 
Sec. 750.7(g) of the EAR, and that it generally will not be extended.
    (2) Prompt delivery of emergency handling requests. You are 
responsible for prompt delivery of your request and license application 
to BXA. You may hand-carry your request and license application or use 
the services of an overnight courier to ensure prompt delivery. If you 
desire to hand-carry your request and license application, you may hand 
deliver it to the Exporter Counseling Division at the address stated in 
Sec. 748.2(a) of this part. If you decide to use an overnight courier, 
use the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part. The envelope 
containing your license application should be labeled ``Attn: Exporter 
Counseling Division, Emergency Handling Request Enclosed''.
    (3) Review of emergency handling requests. BXA views an emergency as 
an unforeseeable situation over which you have no control. On the day of 
receipt, BXA will evaluate your license application and decide whether 
emergency handling is warranted. Frequent emergency request will be 
given particularly close scrutiny. This procedure is not designed to 
become a substitute for timely filing of license applications.
    (4) Action on license applications processed under emergency 
procedures. If you have submitted an emergency request, you will be 
contacted by the Exporter Counseling Division informing you of whether 
or not your request for emergency processing has been granted. If your 
license is approved under emergency handling procedures, you will be

[[Page 365]]

notified by BXA of the approval by telephone or in person. You will be 
given the license number and verbal authorization to effect shipment 
immediately, without waiting for the actual license. Any license 
approved under these emergency handling procedures will have a limited 
validity period as described in Sec. 750.7(g) of the EAR.

Sec. 748.5  Parties to the transaction.

    The following parties may be entered on the BXA-748P Multipurpose 
Application Form or electronic equivalent. The definitions, which also 
appear in part 772 of the EAR, are set out here for your convenience to 
assist you in filling out your application correctly.
    (a) Applicant. The person who applies for an export or reexport 
license, and who has the authority of a principal party in interest to 
determine and control the export or reexport of items. See Sec. 748.4(a) 
and definition of ``exporter'' in part 772 of the EAR.
    (b) Other party authorized to receive license. The person authorized 
by the applicant to receive the license. If a person and address is 
listed in Block 15 of the BXA-748P Multipurpose Application Form or the 
electronic equivalent, the Bureau of Export Administration will send the 
license to that person instead of the applicant. Designation of another 
party to receive the license does not alter the responsibilities of the 
applicant, licensee or exporter.
    (c) Purchaser. The person abroad who has entered into the 
transaction to purchase an item for delivery to the ultimate consignee. 
In most cases, the purchaser is not a bank, forwarding agent, or 
intermediary. The purchaser and ultimate consignee may be the same 
entity.
    (d) Intermediate consignee. The person that acts as an agent for a 
principal party in interest and takes possession of the items for the 
purpose of effecting delivery of the items to the ultimate consignee. 
The intermediate consignee may be a bank, forwarding agent, or other 
person who acts as an agent for a principal party in interest.
    (e) Ultimate consignee. The principal party in interest located 
abroad who receives the exported or reexported items. The ultimate 
consignee is not a forwarding agent or other intermediary, but may be 
the end-user.
    (f) End-user. The person abroad that receives and ultimately uses 
the exported or reexported items. The end-user is not a forwarding agent 
or intermediary, but may be the purchaser or ultimate consignee.

[65 FR 42569, July 10, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 748.6  General instructions for license applications.

    (a) Form and instructions. An application for license, whether to 
export or reexport, must be submitted on Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose 
Application (revised June 15, 1996 or later), and Form BXA-748P-A, Item 
Appendix, and Form BXA-748P-B, End-User Appendix. Facsimiles or copies 
of these forms are not acceptable. Instructions for preparing Form BXA-
748P are contained in Supplement No. 1 to this part 748. See 
Sec. 748.7(a) of this part for instructions on submitting license 
applications electronically.
    (b) Application Control Number. Each application form includes a 
preprinted Application Control Number. The Application Control Number, 
consisting of a letter followed by six digits, is for use by BXA when 
processing applications, and by applicants when communicating with BXA 
concerning pending applications. This number is used for tracking 
purposes within the U.S. Government. The Application Control Number is 
not a license number.
    (c) Approval or denial in entirety. License applications may be 
approved in whole or in part, denied in whole or in part, or returned 
without action. However, you may specifically request that your license 
application be considered as a whole and either approved or denied in 
its entirety.
    (d) Combining items on license applications. Any items may be 
combined on a single application, however, if the items differ 
dramatically (e.g., computers and shotguns) the number of BXA offices to 
which a license application may be referred for review may increase 
significantly. Accordingly, it is recommended that you limit items on 
each license application to those that are similar and/or related.

[[Page 366]]

    (e) Assembly and additional information. All documents or 
correspondence accompanying your license application should bear the 
Application Control Number, and be stapled together. Where necessary, 
BXA may require you to submit additional information beyond that stated 
in the EAR confirming or amplifying information contained in your 
license application.
    (f) Changes in facts. Answers to all items on the license 
application will be deemed to be continuing representations of the 
existing facts or circumstances. Any material or substantive change in 
the terms of the order, or in the facts relating to the transaction, 
must be promptly reported to BXA, whether a license has been granted or 
the license application is still under consideration. If a license has 
been granted and such changes are not excepted in Sec. 750.7(c) of the 
EAR, they must be reported immediately to BXA, even though shipments 
against the license may be partially or wholly completed, during the 
validity period of the license.
    (g) Request for extended license validity period. An extended 
validity period will generally be granted if your transaction is related 
to a multi-year project, when production lead time will not permit 
export or reexport during the normal validity period or for other 
similar circumstances. A continuing requirement to supply spare or 
replacement parts will not normally justify an extended validity period. 
To request an extended validity period, include justification for your 
request in Block 24 on the application.


<R05>
Sec. 748.7  Applying electronically for a license or Classification request.

    (a) Authorization. You may apply electronically once you have been 
authorized to do so by BXA. An authorization to submit applications 
electronically may be limited or withdrawn by BXA at any time. There are 
no prerequisites for obtaining permission to submit electronically or 
limitations in terms of country eligibility. However, BXA may direct for 
any reason that any electronic application be resubmitted in writing, in 
whole or in part
    (1) Requesting approval to submit applications electronically. To 
submit applications electronically, your company must submit a written 
request to BXA at one of the addresses identified in Sec. 748.2(c) of 
this part. Both the envelope and letter must be marked ``Attn: 
Electronic Submission Request''. Your letter must contain your company's 
name, and the address, telephone number, and name of the principal 
contact person in your company. Before approving your request, BXA will 
provide you with language for a number of required certifications. Once 
you have completed the necessary certifications, you may be approved by 
BXA to submit applications electronically.
    (2) Assignment and use of company and personal identification 
numbers. (i) Each company granted permission to submit applications 
electronically will be assigned a company identification number. Each 
person approved by BXA to submit applications electronically for the 
company will be assigned a personal identification number (``PIN'') 
telephonically by BXA. A PIN will be assigned to you only if your 
company has certified to BXA that you are authorized to act for it in 
making electronic submissions under the EAR.
    (ii) Your company may reveal the assigned company identification 
number only to the PIN holders, their supervisors, employees, or agents 
of the company with a commercial justification for knowing the company 
identification number.
    (iii) An individual PIN holder may not:
    (A) Disclose the PIN to anyone;
    (B) Record the PIN either in writing or electronically;
    (C) Authorize another person to use the PIN; or
    (D) Use the PIN following termination by BXA or your company of your 
authorization or approval for PIN use.
    (iv) To prevent misuse of the PIN:
    (A) If a PIN is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, the company 
and the PIN holder must report the loss, theft or compromise of the PIN 
immediately by telephoning BXA at (202) 482-0436. You must confirm this 
notification in writing within two business

[[Page 367]]

days to BXA at the address provided in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part.
    (B) Your company is responsible for immediately notifying BXA 
whenever a PIN holder leaves the employ of the company or otherwise 
ceases to be authorized by the company to submit applications 
electronically on its behalf.
    (v) No person may use, copy, steal or otherwise compromise a PIN 
assigned to another person; and no person may use, copy, steal or 
otherwise compromise the company identification number where the company 
has not authorized such person to have access to the number.
    (b) Electronic submission of applications. (1) All applications. 
Upon submission of the required certifications and approval of the 
company's request to use electronic submission, BXA will provide 
instructions both on the method to transmit applications electronically 
and the process for submitting required supporting documents and 
technical specifications. These instructions may be modified by BXA from 
time to time.
    (2) License Applications. The electronic submission of an 
application for license will constitute an export control document. Such 
submissions must provide the same information as written applications 
and are subject to the recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR. 
The applicant company and PIN holder submitting the application will be 
deemed to make all representations and certifications as if the 
submission were made in writing by the company and signed by the 
submitting PIN holder. Electronic submission of a license application 
will be considered complete upon the transmittal of the application to 
BXA or to an entity under contract to receive such applications for BXA.
    (c) Maintenance of a log. Your company must maintain a log, either 
manually or electronically, specifying the date and time of each 
electronic submission, the ECCNs of items on each electronic submission, 
and the name of the employee or agent submitting the license 
application. This log may not be altered. Written corrections must be 
made in a manner that does not erase or cover original entries. If the 
log is maintained electronically, corrections may only be made as 
notations.
    (d) Updating. An applicant company must promptly notify BXA of any 
change in its name or address. If your company wishes to have an 
individual added as a PIN holder, your company must advise BXA and 
follow the instructions provided by BXA. Your company should conduct 
periodic reviews to ensure that PINs are held only by individuals whose 
current responsibilities make it necessary and appropriate that they act 
for the company in this capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 748.8  Unique license application requirements.

Sec. 748.9  Support documents for license applications.

    (a) Exemptions. If you plan to submit a license application 
involving one of the following situations and your item is not a 
firearms item destined for an OAS member country, no support 
documentation is required. Simply submit the license application. If 
your item is a firearms item (Reason for Control identified as ``FC'' on 
the Commerce Control List, Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) 
destined for an OAS member country, proceed to Sec. 748.14 of this part.
    (1) All exports and reexports involving ultimate consignees located 
in any of the following destinations:

Bahamas
Barbados
Belize
Bermuda
Bolivia
Brazil
Canada
Chile
Colombia
Costa Rica
Dominican Republic
Ecuador

Guyana
Haiti
Honduras
Jamaica
Leeward and Windward Islands
Mexico
Miquelon and St. Pierre Islands
Netherlands Antilles
Nicaragua
Panama
Paraguay
Peru
Surinam
Trinidad and Tobago

Venezuela

    (2) The ultimate consignee or purchaser is a foreign government(s) 
or foreign government agency(ies). To determine whether the parties to 
your transaction meet the definition of ``government agency'' refer to 
the definition contained in part 772 of the EAR. Remember, if either the 
ultimate consignee or purchaser is not a foreign government or foreign 
government agency, a statement is required from the nongovernmental 
party. However, support documents are required from governments of the 
People's Republic of China, India, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland, Romania, and Slovakia.
    (3) The license application is filed by, or on behalf of, a relief 
agency registered with the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid, 
U.S. Agency for International Development, for export to a member agency 
in the foreign country.
    (4) The license application is submitted to export or reexport items 
for temporary exhibit, demonstration, or testing purposes.
    (5) The license application is submitted for items controlled for 
short supply reasons (see part 754 of the EAR).
    (6) The license application is submitted under the Special 
Comprehensive License procedure described in part 752 of the EAR.
    (7) The license application is submitted to export or reexport 
software or technology.
    (8) The license application is submitted to export or reexport 
encryption items controlled under ECCNs 5A002, 5B002, 5D002 and 5E002.
    (b) Support document requirements. License applications not exempt 
under paragraph (a) of this section generally must be supported by 
documents designed to elicit information concerning the disposition of 
the items intended for export or reexport. These support documents must 
be either submitted at the time the license application is filed or 
retained in the applicant's files in accordance with the recordkeeping 
provisions of part 762 of the EAR. The type of support documentation 
required is dependent on the item involved and the country of ultimate 
destination. To determine which type of support documentation is 
required, answer the following questions:
    (1) Does your transaction involve items controlled for national 
security reasons?
    (i) If yes, continue with question number 2 in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (ii) If no, your transaction may require a Statement by Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser. Read the remainder of this section beginning 
with paragraph (c) of this section, then proceed to Sec. 748.11 of the 
EAR.

[[Page 369]]

    (2) Does your transaction involve items controlled for national 
security reasons destined for one of the following countries? (This 
applies only to those overseas destinations specifically listed.)

Argentina
Australia
Austria
Belgium
Bulgaria
China (PRC)
Czech Republic
Denmark
Finland
France
Germany
Greece
Hong Kong
Hungary
India
Ireland, Republic of
Italy
Japan
Korea, Republic of
Liechtenstein
Luxembourg
Netherlands
New Zealand
Norway
Pakistan
Poland
Portugal
Romania
Singapore
Slovakia
Spain
Sweden
Switzerland
Taiwan
Turkey
United Kingdom

    (i) If yes, your transaction may require an Import or End-User 
Certificate. Note that if the destination is the People's Republic of 
China, a Statement of Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser may be 
substituted for a PRC End-User Certificate under the following 
conditions:
    (A) The item to be exported (i.e., replacement parts and sub-
assemblies) is for servicing previously exported items and is valued at 
$75,000 or less; or
    (B) The End-User is not a Chinese entity.
    (ii) If no, your transaction may require a Statement by Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser. Read the remainder of this section beginning 
with paragraph (c) of this section, then proceed to Sec. 748.11 of the 
EAR.
    (c) License applications requiring support documents. License 
applications requiring support by either a Statement by the Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser or an Import or End-User Certificate must 
indicate the type of support document obtained in Block 6 or 7 on your 
application with an ``X'' in the appropriate box. If the support 
document is an Import or End User Certificate, you must also identify 
the originating country and number of the Certificate in Block 13 on 
your application. If a license application is submitted without either 
the correct Block or Box marked on the application or the required 
support document, the license application will be immediately returned 
without action unless the satisfactory reasons for failing to obtain the 
document are supplied in Block 24 or in an attachment to your license 
application.
    (1) License applications supported by an Import or End User 
Certificate. If submission of the original certificate is not required 
by Sec. 748.10(g) of this part, you may submit your license application 
upon receipt of a facsimile or other legible copy of the Import or End 
User Certificate provided that no shipment is made against any license 
issued based upon the Import or End User Certificate prior to receipt 
and retention of the original statement by the applicant. If 
Sec. 748.10(g) of this part requires submission of the original 
certificate with your license application, you must submit the original. 
Copies will not be accepted.
    (2) License applications supported by Ultimate Consignee and 
Purchaser statements. These types of license applications may be 
submitted upon receipt of a facsimile or other legible copy of the 
original statement provided that the applicant receives the manually-
signed original within 60 days from the date the original is signed by 
the ultimate consignee.
    (d) Exceptions to obtaining the required support document. BXA will 
consider the granting of an exception to the requirement for supporting 
document where the requirements cannot be met due to circumstances 
beyond your control. An exception will not be granted contrary to the 
objectives of the U.S. export control laws and regulations. Refer to 
Sec. 748.12(d) of this part for specific instructions on procedures for 
requesting an exception.
    (e) Validity period. (1) When an Import or End-User Certificate or a 
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser is required to support one 
or more license applications, you must submit the first license 
application within the validity period shown on the Certificate, or 6 
months from the date the Certificate was issued or Statement signed, 
whichever is shorter.
    (2) All subsequent license applications supported by the same Import 
or End-Use Certificate must be submitted

[[Page 370]]

to BXA within one year from the date that the first license application 
supported by the same Import or End-Use Certificate was submitted to 
BXA.
    (3) All subsequent license applications supported by the same 
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser must be submitted within 
two years of the first application if the statement was completed as a 
single transaction statement. If the statement was completed as a 
multiple transaction statement, all applications must be submitted 
within two years of signature by the consignee or purchaser, whichever 
was last.
    (f) English translation requirements. All abbreviations, coded 
terms, or other expressions on support documents having special 
significance in the trade or to the parties to the transaction must be 
explained on an attachment to the document. Documents in a language 
other than English must be accompanied by an attachment giving an 
accurate English translation, either made by a translating service or 
certified by you to be correct. Explanations or translations should be 
provided on a separate piece of paper, and not entered on the support 
documents themselves.
    (g) Responsibility for full disclosure. (1) Information contained in 
a support document cannot be construed as extending or expanding or 
otherwise modifying the specific information supplied in a license 
application or license issued by BXA. The license application covering 
the transaction discloses all facts pertaining to the transaction. The 
authorizations contained in the resulting license are not extended by 
information contained in an Import Certificate, End-User Certificate or 
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser regarding reexport from 
the country of destination or any other facts relative to the 
transaction that are not reported on the license application.
    (2) Misrepresentations, either through failure to disclose facts, 
concealing a material fact, or furnishing false information, will 
subject responsible parties to administrative action by BXA. 
Administrative action may include suspension, revocation, or denial of 
licensing privileges and denial of other participation in exports from 
the United States.
    (3) In obtaining the required support document, you as the applicant 
are not relieved of the responsibility for full disclosure of any other 
information concerning the ultimate destination and end-use, end-user of 
which you know, even if inconsistent with the representations made in 
the Import Certificate, End-User Certificate, or Statement by Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser. You are responsible for promptly notifying BXA 
of any change in the facts contained in the support document that comes 
to your attention.
    (h) Effect on license application review. BXA reserves the right in 
all respects to determine to what extent any license will be issued 
covering items for which an Import or End-User Certificate has been 
issued by a foreign government. BXA will not seek or undertake to give 
consideration to recommendations from the foreign government as to the 
action to be taken on a license application. A supporting document 
issued by a foreign government will be only one of the factors upon 
which BXA will base its licensing action, since end-uses and other 
considerations are important factors in the decision making process.
    (i) Request for return of support documents submitted to BXA. If an 
applicant is requested by a foreign importer to return an unused or 
partially used Import or End-User Certificate submitted to BXA in 
support of a license application, the procedure provided in this 
paragraph (i) should be followed:
    (1) The applicant must send a letter request for return of an Import 
or End-User Certificate to the address stated in Sec. 748.2(c) of this 
part, ``Attn: Import/End-User Certificate Request''.
    (2) The letter request must include the name and address of the 
importer, the Application Control Number under which the original Import 
or End-User Certificate was submitted, the Application Control Numbers 
for any subsequent license applications supported by the same 
certificate, and one of the following statements, if applicable:

[[Page 371]]

    (i) If the certificate covers a quantity greater than the total 
quantity identified on the license application(s) submitted against it, 
a statement that the certificate will not be used in connection with 
another license application.
    (ii) If you do not intend to make any additional shipments under a 
license covered by the certificate, or are in possession of an expired 
license covered by the certificate, a statement to this effect, 
indicating the unshipped items.
    (j) Recordkeeping requirements for returning certificates retained 
by the applicant. (1) Though the recordkeeping provisions of the EAR 
require that all original support documents be retained for a period of 
five years, an unused or partially used certificate may be returned at 
the request of a foreign importer provided that you submit the original 
certificate, accompanied by a letter of explanation, a copy of each 
license covered by the certificate, and a list of all shipments made 
against each license to BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c). BXA 
will notify you in writing whether your request has been granted. The 
following information must be contained in your letter of explanation:
    (i) A statement citing the foreign importer's request for return of 
the certificate;
    (ii) The license number(s) that have been issued against the 
certificate (including both outstanding and expired licenses); and
    (iii) If the certificate covers a quantity greater that the total 
quantity stated on the license(s), you must include a statement that the 
certificate will not be used in connection with another license 
application.
    (2) If your request is granted, BXA will return the certificate to 
you. You must make a copy of the certificate before you return the 
original to the importer. This copy must show all the information 
contained on the original certificate including any notation made on the 
certificate by BXA. The copies must be retained on file along with your 
correspondence in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions in part 
762 of the EAR.

Sec. 748.10  Import and End-User Certificates.

    (a) Scope. There are a variety of Import and End-User Certificates 
currently in use by various governments. The control exercised by the 
government issuing the Import or End-User Certificate is in addition to 
the conditions and restrictions placed on the transaction by BXA. The 
laws and regulations of the United States are in no way modified, 
changed, or superseded by the issuance of an Import or End-User 
Certificate. This section describes exceptions and relationships true 
for both Import and End-User Certificates, and applies only to 
transactions involving national security controlled items destined for 
one of the countries identified in Sec. 748.9(b)(2) of this part.
    (b) Import or End-User Certificate. An Import or End-User 
Certificate must be obtained, unless your transaction meets one of the 
exemptions stated in Sec. 748.9(a) of this part, if:
    (1) Any commodities on your license application are controlled for 
national security (NS) reasons, except for items controlled under ECCN 
5A002 or 5B002;
    (2) The ultimate destination is a country listed in Sec. 748.9(b)(2) 
of this part.
    (3) Your transaction involves an export to the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) of a computer. You must obtain a PRC End-User Certificate, 
regardless of dollar value, as follows:
    (i) For exports of computers as described by Sec. 740.7(d)(5)(i)(A) 
or Sec. 740.7(d)(5)(i)(B) of the EAR, regardless of value, to the 
People's Republic of China. (See paragraph (c) of this section for 
information on obtaining the PRC End-User Certificate.) Exporters are 
required to obtain a PRC End-User Certificate before exporting computers 
to the PRC. In addition, exporters are required to provide the PRC End-
User Certificate Number to BXA as part of their post-shipment report 
(see

[[Page 372]]

Sec. 740.7(d)(5)(v) of the EAR). When providing the PRC End-User 
Certificate Number to BXA, you must identify the transaction in the post 
shipment report to which that PRC End-User Certificate Number applies. 
The original PRC End-User Certificate shall be retained in the 
exporter's files in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions of 
Sec. 762.2 of the EAR.
    (ii) For exports of computers that require license applications.
    (4) Your license application involves the export of commodities and 
software classified in a single entry on the CCL, the total value of 
which exceeds $5,000. Note that this $5,000 threshold does not apply to 
exports to the People's Republic of China of computers subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 748.10(b)(3).
    (i) Your license application may list several separate CCL entries. 
If any entry controlled for national security reasons exceeds $5,000, 
then an Import or End-User Certificate must be obtained covering all 
items controlled for national security reasons on your license 
application;
    (ii) If your license application involves a lesser transaction that 
is part of a larger order for items controlled for national security 
reasons in a single ECCN exceeding $5,000, an Import or End-User 
Certificate must be obtained.
    (iii) You may be specifically requested by BXA to obtain an Import 
Certificate for a transaction valued under $5,000.
    (c) How to obtain an Import or End-User Certificate. (1) Applicants 
must request that the importer (e.g., ultimate consignee or purchaser) 
obtain the Import or End-User Certificate, and that it be issued 
covering only those items that are controlled for national security 
reasons. Importers should not be requested to obtain an Import or End-
User Certificate for items that are controlled for reasons other than 
national security. Upon receipt, the importer must transmit the original 
document to the applicant.
    (2) The applicant's name must appear on the Import or End-User 
Certificate submitted to BXA as either the applicant, supplier, or order 
party. The Import Certificate may be made out to either the ultimate 
consignee or the purchaser, even though they are different parties, as 
long as both are located in the same country.

    Note to paragraph (c) of this section:
    You should furnish the consignee with the item description contained 
in the CCL to be used in applying for the Import or End-User 
Certificate. It is also advisable to furnish a manufacturer's catalog, 
brochure, or technical specifications if the item is new.

    (3) If your transaction requires support of a PRC End-User 
Certificate, you must ensure the following information is included on 
the PRC End-User Certificate signed by an official of the Department of 
Science and Technology of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation (MOFTEC) with MOFTEC's seal affixed to it:
    (i) Title of contract and contract number (optional);
    (ii) Names of importer and exporter;
    (iii) End-User and end-use;
    (iv) Description of the item, quantity and dollar value; and
    (v) Signature of the importer and date.
    (d) Where to obtain Import and End-User Certificates. See Supplement 
No. 4 to this part for a list of the authorities administering the 
Import Certificate/Delivery Verification and End-User Certificate 
Systems in other countries.
    (e) Triangular symbol on International Import Certificates. (1) In 
accordance with international practice, the issuing government may stamp 
a triangular symbol on the International Import Certificate (IIC). This 
symbol is notification that the importer does not intend to import or 
retain the items in the country issuing the certificate, but that, in 
any case, the items will not be delivered to any destination except in 
accordance with the export regulations of the issuing country.
    (2) If you receive an IIC bearing a triangular symbol, you must 
identify all parties to the transaction on the license application, 
including those located outside the country issuing the IIC. If the 
importer declines to provide you with this information, you may advise 
the importer to provide the information directly to BXA, through a U.S. 
Foreign Commercial Service office, or in a sealed envelope to you marked 
``To be opened by BXA only''.

[[Page 373]]

    (f) Multiple license applications supported by one certificate. An 
Import or End-User Certificate may cover more than one purchase order 
and more than one item. Where the certificate includes items for which 
more than one license application will be submitted, you must include in 
Block 24 on your application, or in an attachment to each license 
application submitted against the certificate, the following 
certification:

    I (We) certify that the quantities of items shown on this license 
application, based on the Certificate identified in Block 13 of this 
license application, when added to the quantities shown on all other 
license applications submitted to BXA based on the same Certificate, do 
not total more than the total quantities shown on the above cited 
Certificate.

    (g) Submission of Import and End-User Certificates. If a PRC End-
User Certificate is required for your proposed transaction, you must 
submit the original certificate with your license application. Copies 
will not be accepted. All other certificates must be retained on file by 
the applicant in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions of part 
762 of the EAR, and not submitted with the license application.
    (h) Alterations. After an Import or End-User Certificate is issued 
by a foreign government, no corrections, additions, or alterations may 
be made on the Certificate by any person. If you desire to explain any 
information contained on the Certificate, you may attach a signed 
statement to the Certificate.
    (i) Request for Delivery Verification. BXA will, on a selective 
basis, require Delivery Verification documents for shipments supported 
by Import Certificates. You will be notified if Delivery Verification is 
required at the time of issuance of the license. Please refer to 
Sec. 748.13 of this part for detailed information on these procedures.
    (j) Retention procedures. You must retain on file the original copy 
of any certificate issued in support of a license application submitted 
to BXA, unless the original is submitted with the license application. 
All recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR apply to 
this requirement, except that reproductions may not be substituted for 
the officially authenticated original in this instance.

Sec. 748.11  Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser.

    (a) Exceptions to completing a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and 
Purchaser. A Statement by the Ultimate Consignee and/or Purchaser 
involved in a transaction must be completed unless:
    (1) An International Import Certificate, a People's Republic of 
China End-User Certificate, an Indian Import Certificate, or a 
Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian or Slovak Import 
Certificate is required in support of the license application;
    (2) The applicant is the same person as the ultimate consignee, 
provided the required statements are contained in Block 24 on the 
license application. This exemption does not apply where the applicant 
and consignee are separate entities, such as parent and subsidiary, or 
affiliated or associated firms;
    (3) The application is valued at $5000 or less, and is not part of a 
larger transaction; or
    (4) The transaction meets one of the exemptions stated in 
Sec. 748.9(a) of this part.
    (b) Submission of the Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser. 
A copy of the statement must be submitted with your license application 
if the country of ultimate destination is listed in either Country Group 
D:2, D:3, or D:4 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). The copy 
submitted by the applicant must be of sufficient quality to ensure all 
assertions made on the statement are legible and that the signatures are 
sufficiently legible to permit identification of the signature as that 
of the signer. The applicant must receive the manually-signed original 
within 60 days from the date the original is signed by the ultimate 
consignee. The applicant must, upon receipt, retain the manually-signed 
original, and both the ultimate consignee and purchaser should retain a 
copy of

[[Page 374]]

the statement in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions contained 
in part 762 of the EAR.
    (c) Form or letter. The ultimate consignee and purchaser must 
complete either a statement on company letterhead in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section or Form BXA-711, Statement by Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser. If the consignee and purchaser elect to 
complete the statement on letterhead and both the ultimate consignee and 
purchaser are the same entity, only one statement is necessary. If the 
ultimate consignee and purchaser are separate entities, separate 
statements must be prepared and signed. If the ultimate consignee and 
purchaser elects to complete Form BXA-711, only one Form BXA-711 
(containing the signatures of the ultimate consignee and purchaser) need 
be completed. Whether your ultimate consignee and purchaser sign a 
written statement or complete Form BXA-711, the following constraints 
apply:
    (1) Responsible officials representing the ultimate consignee and 
purchaser must sign the statement. ``Responsible official'' is defined 
as someone with personal knowledge of the information included in the 
statement, and authority to bind the ultimate consignee or purchaser for 
whom they sign, and who has the power and authority to control the use 
and disposition of the licensed items.
    (2) The authority to sign the statement may not be delegated to any 
person (agent, employee, or other) whose authority to sign is not 
inherent in his or her official position with the ultimate consignee or 
purchaser for whom he or she signs. The signing official may be located 
in the U.S. or in a foreign country. The official title of the person 
signing the statement must also be included.
    (3) The consignee and/or purchaser must submit information that is 
true and correct to the best of their knowledge and must promptly send a 
new statement to the applicant if changes in the facts or intentions 
contained in their statement(s) occur after the statement(s) have been 
forwarded to the applicant. Once a statement has been signed, no 
corrections, additions, or alterations may be made. If a signed 
statement is incomplete or incorrect in any respect, a new statement 
must be prepared, signed and forwarded to the applicant.
    (d) Instructions for completing Form BXA-711. Instructions on 
completing Form BXA-711 are contained in Supplement No. 3 to this part. 
The ultimate consignee and purchaser may sign a legible copy of Form 
BXA-711. It is not necessary to require your ultimate consignee and 
purchaser sign an original Form BXA-711, provided all information 
contained on the copy is legible.
    (e) Instructions for completing the statement on letterhead. 
Information in response to each of the following criteria must be 
included in the statement. If any information is unknown, that fact 
should be disclosed in the statement. Preprinted information supplied on 
the statement, including the name, address, or nature of business of the 
ultimate consignee or purchaser appearing on the letterhead or order 
form is acceptable but will not constitute evidence of either the 
signer's identity, the country of ultimate destination, or end-use of 
the items described in the license application.
    (1) Paragraph 1. One of the following certifications must be 
included depending on whether the statement is proffered in support of a 
single license application or multiple license applications:
    (i) Single. This statement is to be considered part of a license 
application submitted by [name and address of applicant].
    (ii) Multiple. This statement is to be considered a part of every 
license application submitted by [name and address of applicant] until 
two years from the date this statement is signed.
    (2) Paragraph 2. One or more of the following certifications must be 
included. Note that if any of the facts related to the following 
statements are unknown, this must be clearly stated.
    (i) The items for which a license application will be filed by [name 
of applicant] will be used by us as capital equipment in the form in 
which received in a manufacturing process in [name of country] and will 
not be reexported or incorporated into an end product.

[name of applicant] will be processed or incorporated by us into the 
following product(s) [list products] to be manufactured in [name of 
country] for distribution in [list name of country or countries].
    (iii) The items for which a license application will be filed by

additional facts that are inconsistent with the above statements. We 
shall promptly send a replacement statement to [name of the applicant] 
disclosing any material change of facts or intentions described in this 
statement that occur after this statement has been prepared and 
forwarded to [name of applicant]. We acknowledge that the making of any 
false statement or concealment of any material fact in connection with 
this statement may result in imprisonment or fine, or both, and denial, 
in whole or in part, of participation in U.S. exports or reexports.
    (ii) Except as specifically authorized by the U.S. Export 
Administration Regulations, or by written approval from the Bureau of 
Export Administration, we will not reexport, resell, or otherwise 
dispose of any items approved on a license supported by this statement:
    (1) To any country not approved for export as brought to our 
attention by the exporter; or
    (2) To any person if there is reason to believe that it will result 
directly or indirectly in disposition of the items contrary to the 
representations made in this statement or contrary to the U.S. Export 
Administration Regulations.
    (iii) We understand that acceptance of this statement as a support 
document cannot be construed as an authorization by BXA to reexport the 
items in the form in which received even though we may have indicated 
the intention to reexport, and that authorization to reexport is not 
granted in an export license on the basis of information provided in the 
statement, but as a result of a specific request in a license 
application.

Sec. 748.12  Special provisions for support documents.

    (a) Grace periods. Whenever the requirement for an Import or End-
User Certificate or Statement by Ultimate Consignee or Purchaser is 
imposed or extended by a change in the regulations, the license 
application need not conform to the new support documentation 
requirements for a period of 45 days after the effective date of the 
regulatory change published in the Federal Register.
    (1) Requirements are usually imposed or extended by virtue of one of 
the following:
    (i) Addition or removal of national security controls over a 
particular item; or
    (ii) Development of an Import Certificate/Delivery Verification or 
End-User Certificate program by a foreign country; or
    (iii) Removal of an item from eligibility under the Special 
Comprehensive

[[Page 376]]

License described in part 752 of the EAR, when you hold such a special 
license and have been exporting the item under that license.
    (2) License applications filed during the 45 day grace period must 
be accompanied by any evidence available to you that will support 
representations concerning the ultimate consignee, ultimate destination, 
and end use, such as copies of the order, letters of credit, 
correspondence between you and ultimate consignee, or other documents 
received from the ultimate consignee. You must also identify the 
regulatory change (including its effective date) that justifies exercise 
of the 45 day grace period. Note that an Import or End-User Certificate 
will not be accepted, after the stated grace period, for license 
applications involving items that are no longer controlled for national 
security reasons. If an item is removed from national security controls, 
you must obtain a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser as 
described in Sec. 748.11 of this part. Likewise, any item newly 
controlled for national security purposes requires support of an Import 
or End-User Certificate as described in Sec. 748.10 of this part after 
expiration of the stated grace period.
    (b) Reexports. If a support document would be required for an export 
from the United States, the same document would be required for reexport 
to Country Group D:1 and E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR).
    (c) Granting of exceptions to the support documentation requirement. 
An exception to obtaining the required support documentation will be 
considered by BXA, however, an exception will not be granted contrary to 
the objectives of the U.S. export control program. A request for 
exception may involve either a single transaction, or where the reason 
necessitating the request is continuing in nature, multiple 
transactions. If satisfied by the evidence presented, BXA may waive the 
support document requirement and accept the license application for 
processing. Favorable consideration of a request for exception generally 
will be given in instances where the support document requirement:
    (1) Imposes an undue hardship on you and/or ultimate consignee 
(e.g., refusal by the foreign government to issue an Import or End-User 
Certificate and such refusal constitutes discrimination against you); or
    (2) Cannot be complied with (e.g., the items will be held in a 
foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse for subsequent distribution in 
one or more countries); or
    (3) Is not applicable to the transaction (e.g., the items will not 
be imported for consumption into the named country of destination).
    (d) Procedures for requesting an exception. (1) Requests for 
exception must be submitted with the license application to which the 
request relates. Where the request relates to more than one license 
application it should be submitted with the first license application 
and referred to in Block 24 on any subsequent license application. The 
request for exception must be submitted in writing on the applicant's 
letterhead.
    (2) In instances where you are requesting exception from obtaining 
an Import or End-User Certificate, the request must be accompanied by a 
manually-signed original Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser 
as described in Sec. 748.11 of this part.
    (3) At a minimum, the letter request must include:
    (i) Name and address of ultimate consignee;
    (ii) Name and address of purchaser, if different from ultimate 
consignee;
    (iii) Location of foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse if the 
items will be exported to a foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse;
    (iv) Type of request, i.e., whether for a single transaction or 
multiple transactions;
    (v) Full explanation of the reason(s) for requesting the exception;
    (vi) Nature and duration of the business relationship between you 
and ultimate consignee and purchaser shown on the license application;
    (vii) Whether you have previously obtained and/or submitted to BXA 
an Import or End-User Certificate issued in the name of the ultimate 
consignee

[[Page 377]]

and/or purchaser, and a list of the Application Control Number(s) to 
which the certificate(s) applied; and
    (viii) Any other facts to justify granting an exception.
    (4) Action by BXA. (i) Single transaction request. Where a single 
transaction is involved, BXA will act on the request for exception at 
the same time as the license application with which the request is 
submitted. In those instances where the related license application is 
approved, the issuance of the license will serve as an automatic notice 
to the applicant that the exception was approved. If any restrictions 
are placed on granting of the exception, these will appear on the 
approval. If the request for exception is not approved, BXA will advise 
you by letter.
    (ii) Multiple transactions request. Where multiple transactions are 
involved, BXA will advise you by letter of the action taken on the 
exception request. The letter will contain any conditions or 
restrictions that BXA finds necessary to impose (including an exception 
termination date if appropriate). In addition, a written acceptance of 
these conditions or restrictions may be required from the parties to the 
transaction.
    (e) Availability of original. The original certificate or statement 
must be kept on file, and made available for inspection in accordance 
with the provisions of part 762 of the EAR. To ensure compliance with 
this recordkeeping requirement, BXA will require applicants, on a random 
basis, to submit specific original certificates and statements that have 
been retained on file. Applicants will be notified in writing of any 
such request.

<R05>
Sec. 748.13  Delivery Verification (DV).

    (a) Scope. (1) BXA may request the licensee to obtain verifications 
of delivery on a selective basis. A Delivery Verification Certificate 
(DV) is a document issued by the government of the country of ultimate 
destination after the export has taken place and the items have either 
entered the export jurisdiction of the recipient country or are 
otherwise accounted for by the importer to the issuing government. 
Governments that issue DVs are listed in Supplement No. 4 to this part.
    (2) If BXA decides to request verification of delivery, the request 
will appear as a condition on the face of the license. If the license is 
sent directly to a party other than the applicant authorized to receive 
the license (e.g., agent, forwarder, broker, etc.), such party is 
responsible for notifying the licensee immediately in writing that a DV 
is required.
    (b) Exception to obtaining Delivery Verification. The DV requirement 
for a particular transaction is automatically canceled if, subsequent to 
the issuance of a license, the item is no longer controlled for national 
security reasons. In this instance, the licensee must send a letter to 
BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part, stating that 
the items on the license are no longer controlled for national security 
reasons, and accordingly, the request for DV will not be fulfilled by 
the licensee.
    (c) Procedure for obtaining Delivery Verification. When notified 
that a DV is required by BXA, the licensee must transmit to the importer 
a written request for a DV at the time of making each shipment under the 
license (whenever possible, this request should be submitted together 
with the related bill of lading or air waybill). The request must 
include the number of the Import or End-User Certificate for the 
transaction referred to on the license, and notify the importer that 
this same Import or End-User Certificate number should be shown on the 
DV.
    (1) The importer must obtain the DV from the appropriate government 
ministry identified in Supplement No. 4 to this part, and forward the 
completed DV to the licensee. The DV must cover the items described on 
the license that have been shipped. Note that BXA must be able to relate 
the description provided in the DV to the approved license. In order to 
ensure the same terminology is used, the licensee should provide the 
importer with the description as it appears on the license.
    (2) The original copy of the DV must be sent to BXA within 90 days 
after the last shipment has been made against the license. If 
verification of delivery is required for items covered by a license 
against which partial shipments have

[[Page 378]]

been made, the licensee shall obtain the required DV for each partial 
shipment, and retain these on file until all shipments have been made 
against the license. Once all shipments against the license have been 
made (or the licensee has determined that none will be), the licensee 
must forward, in one package, all applicable DVs to BXA at the address 
listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part.
    (3) The documents must be forwarded with a dated letter giving the 
license number, the name, title and signature of the authorized 
representative, and one of the following statements:
    (i) The total quantity authorized by license number ______ has been 
exported, and all delivery verification documents are attached.
    (ii) A part of the quantity authorized by license number ______ will 
not be exported. Delivery verification documents covering all items 
exported are attached.
    (iii) No shipment has been made against this license, and none is 
contemplated.
    (d) Inability to obtain Delivery Verification Certificates. If a 
licensee is unable to obtain the required DV (within the time frame 
stated above, or at all) from the importer, the licensee must promptly 
notify BXA and, upon request, make available all information and 
records, including correspondence, regarding the attempt to obtain the 
DV.

<R05>
Sec. 748.14  Import Certificate for firearms destined for Organization of American States member countries.

    (a) Scope. Consistent with the OAS Model Regulations, BXA requires 
from all OAS member countries an Import Certificate issued by the 
government of the importing country for items classified as ECCNs 0A984, 
0A986, or 0A987. For those OAS member countries that have not yet 
established or implemented an Import Certificate procedure, BXA will 
accept an equivalent official document (e.g., import license or letter 
of authorization) issued by the government of the importing country as 
supporting documentation for the export of firearms. This section 
describes the requirements for Import Certificates or official 
equivalents in support of license applications submitted to BXA for 
firearms items that are identified by ``FC Column 1'' in the ``License 
Requirements'' section of the Commerce Control List.
    (b) Import Certificate Procedure. An Import Certificate or 
equivalent official document must be obtained from the government of the 
importing OAS member country for firearms items classified as ECCNs 
0A984, 0A986, or 0A987. Except as provided by Sec. 748.9(a) of the EAR, 
the applicant must obtain and retain on file either the original or 
certified copy of the Import Certificate, or an original or certified 
copy of equivalent official document issued by the government of the 
importing country in support of any license application for export of 
firearms items classified as 0A984, 0A986, or 0A987. All the 
recordkeeping provisions of Sec. 762.2 of the EAR apply to this 
requirement. The applicant must clearly note the number and date of the 
Import Certificate or equivalent official document on all export license 
applications (BXA Form 748P, Multipurpose Application Form, Block 13) 
supported by that Certificate or equivalent official document. The 
applicant must also indicate in Block 7 of the application that the 
Certificate or equivalent official document has been received and will 
be retained on file. However, the applicant may submit an application 
before obtaining the original or certified copy of the Import 
Certificate, or the official original or certified copy of the 
equivalent document, provided that:
    (1) The applicant has received a facsimile of the Import Certificate 
or equivalent official document at the time the license application is 
filed; and
    (2) The applicant states on the application that a facsimile of the 
Import Certificate or equivalent official document has been received and 
that no shipment will be made against the license prior to obtaining the 
original or certified copy of the Import Certificate or the original or 
certified copy of the equivalent official document issued by the 
importing country and retaining it

[[Page 379]]

on file. Generally, BXA will not consider any license application for 
the export of firearms items if the application is not supported by an 
Import Certificate or its official equivalent. If the government of the 
importing country will not issue an Import Certificate or its official 
equivalent, the applicant must supply the information described in 
paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(vi) through (viii) of this section on 
company letterhead.
    (c) Countries to which firearms controls apply. The firearms 
controls apply to all OAS member countries: Antigua and Barbuda, 
Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, 
Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El 
Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, 
Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, the 
United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
    (d) Items/Commodities. An Import Certificate or equivalent official 
document is required for items controlled under Export Control 
Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 0A984, 0A986, or 0A987.
    (e) Use of the Import Certificate. An Import Certificate or 
equivalent official document can only be used to support one BXA Form-
748P, Multipurpose Application. The BXA Form-748P, Multipurpose 
Application, must include the same items as those listed on the Import 
Certificate or the equivalent official document.
    (f) Validity period. Import Certificates or equivalent official 
documents issued by an OAS member country will be valid for a period of 
one year or less. Although licenses generally are valid for two years, 
your ability to ship may be affected by the validity of the Import 
Certificate or equivalent official document.

to OAS member countries. (1) Applicants must request that the importer 
(e.g., ultimate consignee or purchaser) obtain the Import Certificate or 
an equivalent official document from the government of the importing 
country, and that it be issued covering the quantities and types of 
items that the applicant intends to export. Upon receipt of the Import 
Certificate or its official equivalent, the importer must provide the 
original or a certified copy of the Import Certificate or the original 
or a certified copy of the equivalent official document to the 
applicant. The applicant shall obtain the required documents prior to 
submitting a license application, except as provided in paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) The Import Certificate or its official equivalent must contain 
the following information:
    (i) Applicant's name and address. The applicant may be either the 
exporter, supplier, or order party.
    (ii) Import Certificate Identifier/Number.
    (iii) Name of the country issuing the certificate or unique country 
code.
    (iv) Date the Import Certificate was issued, in international date 
format (e.g., 24/12/98 (24 December 1998), or 3/1/99 (3 January 1999)).
    (v) Name of the agency issuing the certificate, address, telephone 
and facsimile numbers, signing officer name, and signature.
    (vi) Name of the importer, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, 
country of residence, representative's name if commercial or government 
body, citizenship, and signature.
    (vii) Name of the end-user(s), if known and different from the 
importer, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, country of 
residence, representative's name if commercial (authorized distributor 
or reseller) or government body, citizenship, and signature. Note that 
BXA does not require the identification of each end-user when the 
firearms items will be resold by a distributor or reseller if unknown at 
the time of export.
    (viii) Description of the items approved for import including a 
technical description and total quantity of firearms, parts and 
components, ammunition and parts.

    Note to paragraph (g)(2)(viii): You must furnish the consignee with 
a detailed technical description of each item to be given to the 
government for its use in issuing the Import Certificate. For example, 
for shotguns, provide the type, barrel length, overall length, number of 
shots, the manufacturer's name, the country of manufacture, and the

[[Page 380]]

serial number for each shotgun. For ammunition, provide the caliber, 
velocity and force, type of bullet, manufacturer's name and country of 
manufacture.

    (ix) Expiration date of the Import Certificate in international date 
format (e.g., 24/12/98) or the date the items must be imported, 
whichever is earlier.
    (x) Name of the country of export (i.e., United States).
    (xi) Additional information. Certain countries may require the 
tariff classification number, by class, under the Brussels Convention 
(Harmonized Tariff Code) or the specific technical description of an 
item. For example, shotguns may need to be described in barrel length, 
overall length, number of shots, manufacturer's name and country of 
manufacture. The technical description is not the Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN).
    (h) Where to obtain Import Certificates. See Supplement No. 6 to 
this part for a list of the OAS member countries' authorities 
administering the Import Certificate System.
    (i) Alterations. After an Import Certificate or official equivalent 
document is used to support the issuance of a license, no corrections, 
additions, or alterations may be made on the Certificate by any person. 
If you desire to explain any information contained on the Import 
Certificate or official equivalent document, you may attach a signed 
statement to the Import Certificate or official equivalent.
    (j) Request for return of Import Certificates. A U.S. exporter may 
be requested by a foreign importer to return an unused Import 
Certificate. Refer to Sec. 748.9(j) of this part for procedures and 
recordkeeping requirements for returning an Import Certificate retained 
by the applicant.

[61 FR 12812, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25463, May 9, 1997; 64 
FR 47105, Aug. 30, 1999]

   Supplement No. 5 to Part 748--U.S. Import Certificate and Delivery 
                         Verification Procedure

    The United States participates in an Import Certificate/Delivery 
Verification procedure. Under this procedure, U.S. importers are 
sometimes required to provide their foreign suppliers with an U.S. 
International Import Certificate that is validated by the U.S. 
Government. This certificate tells the government of the exporter's 
country that the items covered by the certificate will be imported into 
the U.S. Economy and will not be reexported except as authorized by U.S. 
export control regulations. In addition, in some cases, the exporter's 
government may require a delivery verification. Under this procedure, 
the U.S. Customs Service validates a certificate confirming that the 
items have entered the U.S. economy. The U.S. importer must return this 
certificate to the foreign exporter.
    This supplement establishes the procedures and requirements of BXA 
with respect to both of these programs. Paragraph (a) of this supplement 
contains the requirements and procedures of the U.S. International 
Import Certificate procedure. Paragraph (b) of this supplement contains 
the requirements and procedures of the Delivery Verification procedure.
    (a) U.S. International Import Certificates. If you are a U.S. 
importer, a foreign supplier may request you to obtain a U.S. import 
certificate. The reason for this request is that the exporter's 
government requires a U.S. import certificate as a condition to issuing 
an export license. To obtain such a certificate you will have to fill in 
and execute the U.S. International Import Certificate form (Form BXA-
645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53) and submit it to the U.S. government agency that 
has jurisdiction over the items you are importing. In doing so, you will 
be making a representation to the United States Government that you will 
import the items described in the certificate into the United States or 
if not so imported, you will not divert, transship or reexport them to 
another destination with the explicit approval of the U.S. government 
agency that has jurisdiction over those items. (Representations that 
items will be entered into the U.S. do not preclude the temporary 
unloading of items in a foreign trade zone for subsequent entry into the 
economy of the U.S.) If the items described in the certificate are 
subject to U.S. Department of Commerce jurisdiction, the Department will 
validate the certificate and return it to you. You may then send the 
certificate to your foreign supplier. In this way the government of the 
exporting country is assured that the items will become subject to the 
export control laws of the United States.
    (1) Items for which the U.S. Department of Commerce issues U.S. 
International Import Certificates and forms to use. The Department of 
Commerce issues U.S. International Import Certificates for the following 
types of items.
    (i) Items controlled for National Security reasons. Items under the 
export licensing jurisdiction of BXA that are identified as controlled 
for national security reasons on the Commerce Control List (Supplement 
No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). You will need to submit in triplicate a 
completed Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53;
    (ii) Nuclear equipment and materials. Items subject to the export 
licensing jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for nuclear 
equipment and materials. (see 10 CFR part 110). You will need to submit 
in quadruplicate a completed Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53; and
    (iii) Munitions Items. Items listed on the U.S. Munitions List (see 
22 CFR part 121) that do not appear on the more limited U.S. Munitions 
Import List (27 CFR 47.21). You will need to submit in triplicate a 
completed Form BXA-645P. For triangular transactions (See paragraph 
(a)(5) of this supplement) involving items on the U.S. Munitions List, 
you must contact the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade 
Controls and use Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53. You should contact the 
Treasury Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for items 
appearing on the U.S. Munitions Import List. You will need to use Form 
ATF-4522.
    (2) Where to submit forms. U.S. International Import Certificates 
and requests to amend certificates may be presented for validation 
either in person or by mail at the following locations.
    (i) By mail to the Bureau of Export Administration, P.O. Box 273, 
Washington D.C. 20044, Attn: Import Certificate Request; or
    (ii) In person or by mail at one of the following Department of 
Commerce U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service District Offices:

Boston, MA
Buffalo, NY
Chicago, IL
Cincinnati, OH
Cleveland, OH
Dallas, TX
Detroit, MI
Houston, TX
Kansas City, MO
Los Angeles, CA
Miami, FL
New Orleans, LO
New York, NY
Philadelphia, PA
Phoenix, AZ
Pittsburgh, PA
Portland, OR
St. Louis, MO
San Francisco, CA
Savannah, GA
Seattle, WA
Trenton, NJ

    (3) U.S. International Import Certificate validity periods. The U.S. 
International Import Certificate must be submitted to the foreign 
government within six months from

[[Page 391]]

the date of certification by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The 
expiration of this six-month period in no way affects the responsibility 
of the importer to fulfill the commitments made in obtaining the 
certificate. If the certificate is not presented to the government of 
the exporting country before the expiration of its validity period, the 
exporter must apply for a new certificate. The original unused U.S. 
International Import Certificate must be returned to BXA at the address 
specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.
    (4) Statements on the certificate or amendments are representations 
to the U.S. Government which continue in effect.
    (i) All statements and representations made in a U.S. International 
Import Certificate or an amendment thereto, will be deemed to be 
continuing in nature until the transaction described in the certificate 
is completed and the items are delivered into the economy of the 
importing country.
    (ii) Any change of fact or intention in regard to the transaction 
described in the certificate shall be promptly disclosed to BXA by the 
U.S. importer by presentation of an amended certificate. The amended 
certificate must describe all of the changes and be accompanied by the 
original certificate bearing the certification of BXA. If the original 
certificate has been transferred to the foreign exporter, you must, 
where possible, attempt to obtain the original certificate prior to 
applying for an amendment. If the original certificate is unobtainable 
because the foreign exporter has submitted it to the appropriate foreign 
government, or for any other reason, then you must submit a written 
statement with your amendment giving the reasons for your failure to 
submit the original certificate.
    (5) Certificates for Triangular transaction (items will not enter 
the U.S. or applicant is not sure that they will enter the United 
States).
    (i) In accordance with international practice, BXA will, upon 
request, stamp the certificate with a triangular symbol as notification 
to the government of the exporting country that the U.S. importer is 
uncertain whether the items will be imported into the U. S. or knows 
that the items will not be imported into the U.S., but that, in any 
case, the items will not be delivered to any other destination except in 
accordance with the EAR.
    (ii) The triangular symbol on a certificate U.S. International 
Import Certificate is not, in and of itself, an approval by BXA to 
transfer or sell items to a foreign consignee. Note that a triangular 
Certificate will not be issued covering foreign excess property sold 
abroad by the U.S. Department of Defense.
    (6) Approval to export items to a foreign consignee prior to 
delivery under a U.S. International Import Certificate. The written 
approval of BXA is required before items covered by a U.S. International 
Import Certificate (whether or not bearing a triangular symbol) may be 
shipped to a destination other than the U.S. or Canada or sold to a 
foreign purchaser, and before title to or possession of such items may 
be transferred to a foreign transferee. This requirement does not apply 
after the items have been delivered in accordance with the undertaking 
set forth in the Certificate or if at the time of such shipment, sale, 
passage of possession or passage of title, a License Exception or a NLR 
provision of the EAR would authorize the transaction.
    (i) If prior approval is required, a letter requesting authorization 
to release the shipment shall be submitted to BXA at the address listed 
in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.
    (ii) The letter must contain the certificate number; date issued; 
location of the issuing office; names, addresses, and identities of all 
parties to the complete transaction; and the quantity, dollar value, and 
description of the items. The letter must be accompanied by the U.S. 
International Import Certificate, and all other documentation required 
by the EAR for the item and country of ultimate destination, as 
identified in part 748 of the EAR. If requirements stated in part 748 of 
the EAR do not apply to your transaction, you must identify the intended 
end-use of the items in your letter.
    (iii) Where the letter request is approved and is supported by a 
foreign import certificate, no further approval from BXA is required for 
the purchaser or transferee to resell or again transfer the items. 
However, where BXA approves a request that was not supported by a 
foreign import certificate, the person to whom approval is granted is 
required to inform the purchaser or transferee, in writing, that the 
items are to be shipped to the approved destination only and that no 
other disposition of the items is permitted without the approval of BXA.
    (iv) If the transaction is approved, a validated letter of approval 
will be sent to the U.S. purchaser for retention in his records. Where a 
DV or other official government confirmation of delivery is required, 
the letter will so indicate.
    (v) If the items covered by a certificate have been imported into a 
destination other than the U.S. and the foreign exporter of the items 
requests a Delivery Verification, the person who obtained the 
certificate must obtain a DV from the person to whom the items were 
delivered in the actual importing country. (If a DV is unobtainable, 
other official government confirmation of delivery must be obtained.) 
The DV or other official government confirmation of delivery must be 
submitted to BXA together with an explanatory letter giving the U.S. 
International Import Certificate number, date

[[Page 392]]

issued, and location of issuing office. BXA will then issue Form ITA-
6008, Delivery Compliance Notice, in two copies, the original of which 
must be forwarded to the country of origin in order to serve as evidence 
to the exporting country that the requirements of the U.S. Government 
have been satisfied with respect to delivery of the items.
    (vi) Delivery, sale, or transfer of items to another U.S. purchaser.
    (A) Items covered by a U.S. International Import Certificate may not 
be sold, and title to or possession of such items may not be 
transferred, to another U.S. purchaser or transferee before the items 
are delivered to the U.S. (or to an approved foreign destination, as 
provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this supplement), except in accordance 
with the provisions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this supplement. 
The provisions of this paragraph do not apply after the items have been 
delivered in accordance with the undertaking set forth in the 
certificate.
    (B) Resale or transfer to another U.S. purchaser or transferee 
requires the prior approval of BXA only in cases where the buyer or 
transferee is listed in Supplement No. 1 to part 766 of the EAR. 
However, you, as the person who obtained the certificate are required to 
notify BXA of any change in facts or intentions relating to the 
transaction, and in all cases you will be held responsible for the 
delivery of the items in accordance with the EAR. You are required in 
all cases to secure, prior to sale or transfer, and to retain in your 
files in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in part 
762 of the EAR, written acceptance by the purchaser or transferee of:
    (1) All obligations undertaken by, and imposed under the EAR, upon 
the holder of the certificate; and
    (2) An undertaking that all subsequent sales or transfers will be 
made subject to the same conditions.
    (iii) The responsibility of the certificate holder for obtaining a 
DV also applies to those cases where the items are resold to a U.S. 
purchaser (See paragraph (b)(1) of this supplement.
    (vii) Reexport or transshipment of items after delivery to U.S. 
Items imported into the U.S. under the provisions of a U.S. 
International Import Certificate may not be reexported to any 
destination under the intransit provisions of License Exception TMP (see 
Sec. 740.9(b)(1) of the EAR). However, all other provisions of the EAR 
applicable to items of domestic origin shall apply to the reexport of 
items of foreign origin shipped to the U.S. under a U.S. International 
Import Certificate.
    (viii) Lost or destroyed U.S. International Import Certificates. If 
a U.S. International Import Certificate is lost or destroyed, a 
duplicate copy may be obtained by the person in the U.S. who executed 
the original U.S. International Import Certificate by submitting to any 
of the offices listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement new Form 
BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53 in the same way as an original request, except 
that the forms shall be accompanied by a letter detailing the 
circumstances under which the original certificate was lost or destroyed 
and certifying:
    (A) That the original U.S. International Import Certificate No. 
______, dated ______, issued to (name and address of U.S. importer) for 
import from (foreign exporter's name and address) has been lost or 
destroyed; and
    (B) That if the original U.S. International Import Certificate is 
found, the applicant agrees to return the original or duplicate of the 
certificate to the Bureau of Export Administration.
    (ix) Unused U.S. International Import Certificates. If the 
transaction will not be completed and the U.S. International Import 
Certificate will not be used, return the certificate for cancellation to 
BXA at the address listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.
    (b) Delivery Verification Certificate. U.S. importers may be 
requested by their foreign suppliers to furnish them with a certified 
Form BXA-647P, Delivery Verification Certificate, covering items 
imported into the U.S. These requests are made by foreign governments to 
assure that strategic items shipped to the U.S. are not diverted from 
their intended destination. In these instances, the issuance of an 
export license by the foreign country is conditioned upon the subsequent 
receipt of a Delivery Verification Certificate from the U.S. importer. 
Accordingly, your compliance with your foreign exporter's request for a 
Delivery Verification is necessary to ensure your foreign exporter 
fulfills its government obligations and is able to participate in future 
transactions with you. Failure to comply may subject your exporter to 
penalties that may prevent future trade.
    (1) The responsibility of a person or firm executing a U.S. 
International Import Certificate for providing the foreign exporter with 
confirmation of delivery of the items includes instances where the items 
are resold or transferred to another U.S. person or firm prior to actual 
delivery to the U.S. or to an approved foreign destination. The person 
who executed the U.S. International Import Certificate shall secure in 
writing from the U.S. purchaser or transferee, and retain in your files 
in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions stated in part 762 of 
the EAR:
    (i) Acceptance of the obligation to provide the purchaser or 
transferee with either the

[[Page 393]]

Delivery Verification (or other official government confirmation of 
delivery if a Delivery Verification is unobtainable) or assurance that 
this document was submitted to BXA; and
    (ii) An undertaking that each succeeding U.S. transferee or 
purchaser will assume the same obligation or assurance. In each case the 
seller or transferor must transmit to the U.S. purchaser or transferee 
the U.S. International Import Certificate number covering the export 
from the foreign country and request that they pass it on to any other 
U.S. purchasers or transferees.
    (2) Completion and certification of Delivery Verification 
Certificates. If you are requested by your foreign exporter to provide a 
Delivery Verification, you must obtain Form BXA-647P from a U.S. customs 
office or one of the offices listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
supplement and complete all blocks (except those below the line titled 
``To be completed by U.S. Customs Service'') on the form. The language 
used in the block titled ``Description of Goods'' must describe the 
items in the same terms as those shown on the applicable U.S. 
International Import Certificate. Upon completion Form BXA-647P must be 
presented, in duplicate, to a U.S. customs office. The U.S. customs 
office will certify Form BXA-647P only where the import is made under a 
warehouse or consumption entry.
    (3) Disposition of certified Delivery Verification Certificates. The 
importer must send the original certified Delivery Verification 
Certificate to the foreign exporter or otherwise dispose of it in 
accordance with the instructions of the exporting country. The duplicate 
copy will be retained by the U.S. customs office.
    (4)(i) Issuance of a U.S. Delivery Compliance Notice in lieu of a 
Delivery Verification Certificate. If you are requested to provide a 
Delivery Verification Certificate but do not wish to disclose the name 
of your customer to the foreign exporter (e.g., in the event that the 
items are resold or transferred to another person or firm before the 
items enter the U.S.), you may submit an originally completed Form BXA-
647P together with an explanatory letter requesting a Delivery 
Compliance Notice, to BXA at the address listed in (a)(2)(i) of this 
supplement.
    (ii) BXA will provide you with a notice signifying that the items 
were imported into the U.S. and that a satisfactory DV has been 
submitted to BXA. You must then forward the original notice to your 
foreign exporter for submission to the foreign government. A copy of the 
notice should be retained in your files in accordance with the 
recordkeeping provisions stated in part 762 of the EAR.
    (5)(i) Lost or destroyed Delivery Verification Certificate. When a 
Delivery Verification Certificate is lost or destroyed, the U.S. 
importer must submit a letter to BXA at the address listed in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this supplement certifying that:
    (A) The original Delivery Verification Certificate has been lost or 
destroyed;
    (B) The circumstances under which it was lost or destroyed;
    (C) The type of customs entry (warehouse or consumption), entry 
number, and date of entry; and
    (D) The number and date of the related U.S. International Import 
Certificate.
    (ii) BXA will, in applicable cases, notify the exporting government 
that a Delivery Verification Certificate been issued.
    (c) Penalties and sanctions for violations. The enforcement 
provisions of part 764 and Supplement No. 2 to part 736 of the EAR apply 
to transactions involving imports into the U.S. covered by this 
supplement and to both foreign and U.S. parties involved in a violation 
of this supplement. Any provisions of part 764 and Supplement No. 2 to 
part 736 of the EAR which, by their terms, relate to ``exports'' or 
``exports from the U.S.'' are also deemed to apply and extend to imports 
into the U.S., applications for U.S. International Import Certificates 
(Forms BXA-645P presented to U.S. Department of Commerce for 
certification), U.S. International Import Certificates, and Delivery 
Verification Certificates, described in this supplement. (Applications 
the documents described in this supplement, are included within the 
definition of export control documents provided in part 772 of the EAR.) 
Refer to Sec. 764.3 of the EAR for more information.

Sec. 750.2  Processing of Classification Requests and Advisory Opinions.

    (a) Classification requests. All classification requests submitted 
in accordance with procedures described in Sec. 748.3 (a) and (b) of the 
EAR will be answered within 14 calendar days after receipt. All 
responses will inform the person of the proper classification (e.g., 
whether or not the item is subject to the Export Administration 
Regulations (EAR) and, if applicable, the appropriate Export Control 
Classification Number [ECCN]).
    (b) Advisory Opinion requests. All advisory opinions submitted in 
accordance with procedures described in Sec. 748.3(a) and (c) of the EAR 
will be answered within 30 calendar days after receipt.


<R05>
Sec. 750.3  Review of license applications by BXA and other government agencies and departments.

    (a) Review by BXA. In reviewing specific license applications, BXA 
will conduct a complete analysis of the license application along with 
all documentation submitted in support of the application. In addition 
to reviewing the item and end-use, BXA will consider the reliability of 
each party to the transaction and review any available intelligence 
information. To the maximum extent possible, BXA will make licensing 
decisions without referral of license applications to other agencies, 
however, BXA may consult with other U.S. departments and agencies 
regarding any license application.
    (b) Review by other departments or agencies. (1) The Departments of 
Defense, Energy, State, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency 
(ACDA) have the authority to review any license application submitted 
under the EAR. In addition, BXA may, where appropriate, refer license 
applications to other U.S. government departments or agencies. These 
agencies and departments will be referred to as ``agencies'' for the 
purposes of this part. Though these agencies have the authority to 
review any license application, they may determine that they do not need 
to review certain types of license applications. In these instances, the 
agency will provide BXA with a Delegation of Authority to process those 
license applications without review by that particular agency.
    (2) The Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and ACDA are 
generally concerned with license applications involving items controlled 
for national security, missile technology, nuclear nonproliferation, and 
chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons or destined for 
countries and/or end uses of concern. In particular, these agencies are 
concerned with reviewing license applications as follows:
    (i) The Department of Defense is concerned primarily with items 
controlled for national security and regional stability reasons and with 
controls related to encryption items;
    (ii) The Department of Energy is concerned primarily with items 
controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons;
    (iii) The Department of State is concerned primarily with items 
controlled for regional stability, anti-terrorism, crime control 
reasons, and sanctions; and

[[Page 395]]

    (iv) ACDA is concerned primarily with items controlled for national 
security, nuclear nonproliferation, regional stability, and anti-
terrorism reasons.
    (v) The Department of Justice is concerned with controls relating to 
encryption items.

<R05>
Sec. 750.4  Procedures for processing license applications.

    (a) Overview. (1) All license applications will be resolved or 
referred to the President no later than 90 calendar days from the date 
of BXA's registration of the license application. Processing times for 
the purposes of this section are defined in calendar days. The 
procedures and time limits described in this part apply to all license 
applications registered on or after February 4, 1996. The procedures and 
time limits in effect prior to December 6, 1995 will apply to license 
applications registered prior to February 4, 1996.
    (2) Properly completed license applications will be registered 
promptly upon receipt by BXA. Registration is defined as the point at 
which the application is entered into BXA's electronic license 
processing system. If your application contains deficiencies that 
prevent BXA from registering your application, BXA will attempt to 
contact you to correct the deficiencies, however, if BXA is unable to 
contact you, the license application will be returned without being 
registered. The specific deficiencies requiring return will be 
enumerated in a notice accompanying the returned license application. If 
a license application is registered, but BXA is unable to correct 
deficiencies crucial to processing the license application, it will be 
returned without action. The notice will identify the deficiencies and 
the action necessary to correct the deficiencies. If you decide to 
resubmit the license application, it will be treated as a new license 
application when calculating license processing time frames.
    (b) Actions not included in processing time calculations. The 
following actions will not be counted in the time period calculations 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the processing of 
license applications:
    (1) Agreement by the applicant to the delay. BXA may request 
applicants to provide additional information in support of their license 
application, respond to questions arising during processing, or accept 
proposed conditions or riders on their license application. If BXA has 
provided the applicant with an intent to deny letter described in 
Sec. 750.6 of this part, processing times may be suspended in order to 
negotiate modifications to a license application and obtain agreement to 
such modifications from the foreign parties to the license application.
    (2) Pre-license checks. If a pre-license check, to establish the 
identity and reliability of the recipient of the controlled items, is 
conducted through government channels, provided that:
    (i) The need for such a pre-license check is established by the 
Secretary, or by another agency, if the request for a pre-license check 
is made by such agency and the request is made in accordance with the 
following time frames;
    (A) The pre-license check is requested within 5 days of the 
determination that it is necessary; and
    (B) The analysis resulting from the pre-license check is completed 
within 5 days.
    (3) Government-to-Government assurances. Requests for government-to-
government assurances of suitable end-use of items approved for export 
or reexport when failure to obtain such assurances would result in 
rejection of the license application, provided that:
    (i) The request for such assurances is sent to the Secretary of 
State within five days of the determination that the assurances are 
required;
    (ii) The Secretary of State initiates the request of the relevant 
government within 10 days of receipt of the request for such assurances; 
and
    (iii) The license is issued within 5 days of the Secretary's receipt 
of the requested assurances.
    (4) Consultations. Consultation with other governments, if such 
consultation is provided for by a relevant bilateral arrangement or 
multilateral regime as a precondition for approving a license.

[[Page 396]]

    (5) Multilateral reviews. Multilateral review of a license 
application if such review is required by the relevant multilateral 
regime.
    (6) Congressional notification. Under Section 6(j) of the Export 
Administration Act, as amended (EAA), the Secretaries of Commerce and 
State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 
days prior to issuing a license to any country designated by the 
Secretary of State as being terrorist-supporting for any items that 
could make a significant contribution to the military potential of such 
countries, or could enhance the ability of such countries to support 
acts of international terrorism. Accordingly, the issuance of any 
license subject to this requirement will be delayed for 30 days.
    (i) Designated countries. The following countries have been 
designated by the Secretary of State as terrorist-supporting countries: 
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
    (ii) Items subject to notification requirement. License applications 
involving the export or reexport of the following items to the military, 
police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users are subject to this 
notification requirement:
    (A) All items controlled for national security reasons, except 
digital computers with a Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP) less 
than 500 Mtops;
    (B) All items controlled for chemical and biological weapons 
proliferation reasons;
    (C) All items controlled for missile technology reasons;
    (D) All items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons; and
    (E) All items controlled by the CCL where the entry heading 
identifies the items controlled as those contained in the International 
Munitions List.
    (iii) Additional notifications. The Secretaries of Commerce and 
State must also notify the appropriate Congressional committees 30 days 
before a license is issued for the export or reexport of any item 
controlled on the CCL to a designated country if the Secretary of State 
determines that the export or reexport ``could make a significant 
contribution to the military potential of such country, including its 
military logistics capability, or could enhance the ability of such 
country to support acts of international terrorism.''
    (c) Initial processing. Within 9 days of license application 
registration, BXA will, as appropriate:
    (1) Contact the applicant if additional information is required, if 
the license application is improperly completed, or required support 
documents are missing, to request additional or corrected information;
    (2) Assure the stated classification on the license application is 
correct;
    (3) Return the license application if a license is not required with 
a statement notifying the applicant that a license is not required;
    (4) Approve the license application or notify the applicant of the 
intent to deny the license application; or
    (5) Refer the license application electronically along with all 
necessary recommendations and analysis concurrently to all agencies 
unless the application is subject to a Delegation of Authority. Any 
relevant information not contained in the electronic file will be 
simultaneously forwarded in paper copy.
    (d) Review by other agencies and/or interagency groups. (1) Within 
10 days of receipt of a referral the reviewing agency must advise BXA of 
any information not contained in the referral as described in paragraph 
(c)(5) of this section. BXA will promptly request such information from 
the applicant. The time that elapses between the date the information is 
requested by the reviewing agency and the date the information is 
received by the reviewing agency will not be counted in processing time 
frames.
    (2) Within 30 days of receipt of the initial referral, the reviewing 
agency will provide BXA with a recommendation either to approve (with or 
without conditions or riders) or deny the license application. As 
appropriate, such a recommendation may be made with the benefit of 
consultation and/or discussions in interagency groups established to 
provide expertise and coordinate interagency consultation. These 
interagency groups consist of:
    (i) The Missile Technology Export Control Group (MTEC). The MTEC, 
chaired

[[Page 397]]

by the Department of State, reviews license applications involving items 
controlled for missile technology reasons. The MTEC also reviews license 
applications involving items not controlled for missile technology (MT) 
reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-user of MT 
concern.
    (ii) The SubGroup on Nuclear Export Coordination (SNEC). The SNEC, 
chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications 
involving items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons. The 
SNEC also reviews license applications involving items not controlled 
for nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons, but destined for a country 
and/or end-use/end-user of NP concern.
    (iii) The Shield. The Shield, chaired by the Department of State, 
reviews license applications involving items controlled for chemical and 
biological weapons reasons. The Shield also reviews license applications 
involving items not controlled for chemical and biological weapons (CBW) 
reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-user of CBW 
concern.
    (e) Recommendations by reviewing agencies. Reviewing agencies 
recommending denial of a license application must provide a statement of 
reasons, consistent with the provisions of the EAA or EAR, and cite both 
the statutory and the regulatory basis for the recommendation to deny. A 
reviewing agency that fails to provide a recommendation within 30 days 
with a statement of reasons supported by the statutory and regulatory 
basis shall be deemed to have no objection to the final decision of BXA.
    (f) Interagency dispute resolution and escalation procedures--(1) 
Escalation to the Operating Committee (OC). (i) In any instance where 
the reviewing agencies are not in agreement on final disposition of a 
license application, it will be escalated to the OC for resolution. The 
Chair of the OC will consider the recommendations of the reviewing 
agencies and any information provided by the applicant in person during 
an open OC session. Each agency will be informed of the Chair's decision 
on the license application within 14 days after the deadline for 
receiving agency recommendations.
    (ii) If any agency disagrees with the OC Chair's decision, the 
agency may escalate the decision by appealing to the Chair of the 
Advisory Committee on Export Policy for resolution. If such a request 
for escalation is not made within 5 days of the decision of the OC 
Chair, the Chair's decision will be final.
    (2) Escalation to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP). 
Requests for escalation to the ACEP must be in writing from an official 
appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, or 
a person properly acting in such capacity, and cite both the statutory 
and the regulatory basis for the appeal. The ACEP will review all 
relevant information and recommendations. The Chair of the ACEP will 
inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote decision of the ACEP 
within 11 days from the date of receipt of the escalation request. 
Within 5 days of the decision, any dissenting agency may appeal in 
writing the ACEP's decision to the Secretary of Commerce in the 
Secretary's capacity as the Chair of the Export Administration Review 
Board. The written request must be made by the head of the agency 
requesting escalation and cite both the statutory and the regulatory 
basis for the appeal. Within the same period of time, the Secretary may 
initiate a meeting on his or her own initiative to consider a license 
application. In the absence of a timely appeal, the decision of the ACEP 
will be final.
    (3) Escalation to the Export Administration Review Board (EARB). The 
EARB will review all relevant information and recommendations, and such 
other export control matters as may be appropriate. The Secretary of 
Commerce will inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote 
decision of the EARB within 11 days from the date of receipt of the 
appeal. Within 5 days of the decision, any agency dissenting from the 
decision of the EARB may appeal the decision to the President. The 
appeal must be in writing from the head of the dissenting agency. In the 
absence of a timely appeal, the decision of the EARB will be final.

[61 FR 12829, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25463, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 750.6  Denial of license applications.

    (a) Intent to deny notification. If BXA intends to deny your license 
application, BXA will notify you in writing within 5 days of the 
decision. The notification will include:
    (1) The intent to deny decision;
    (2) The statutory and regulatory basis for the denial;
    (3) To the extent consistent with the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States, the specific considerations that led to the 
decision to deny the license application;
    (4) What, if any, modifications or restrictions to the license 
application would allow BXA to reconsider the license application;
    (5) The name of the BXA representative in a position to discuss the 
issues with the applicant; and
    (6) The availability of appeal procedures.
    (b) Response to intent to deny notification. You will be allowed 20 
days from the date of the notification to respond to the decision before 
the license application is denied. If you respond to the notification, 
BXA will advise you if, as a result of your response, the decision to 
deny has been changed. Unless you are so advised by the 45th day after 
the date of the notification, the denial will become final, without 
further notice. You will then have 45 days from the date of final denial 
to exercise the right to appeal under part 756 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7  Issuance of licenses.

    (a) Scope. A license authorizes only a specific transaction, or 
series of transactions, as described in the license application and any 
supporting documents. A license application may be approved in whole or 
in part or further limited by conditions or other restrictions appearing 
on the license itself or in the EAR. When a license application is 
approved by BXA, a license is issued as described in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Issuance of a license. After a license application is approved, 
a computer generated license is issued by the Department of Commerce 
bearing the license number and a validation date. Where appropriate, the 
license will also show an expiration date. Where necessary, attachments 
to a license will also be validated with the Department of Commerce seal 
and the date of validation. Exporters must use the complete license 
number when preparing a Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) and other 
export control documents, and in communicating with the Department of 
Commerce concerning the license.
    (c) Changes to the license. (1) The following non-material changes 
do not require submission of a ``Replacement'' license or any other 
notification to BXA. (If you wish to make any change not identified in 
this paragraph, you

[[Page 399]]

will need to submit a ``Replacement'' license in accordance with the 
instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 748 of the EAR, Block 
11):
    (i) Decrease in unit price or total value;
    (ii) Increase in price or quantity if permitted under the shipping 
tolerances in Sec. 750.11 of this part;
    (iii) Increase in price that can be justified on the basis of 
changes in point of delivery, port of export, or as a result of 
transportation cost, drayage, port charges, warehousing, currency 
fluctuations, etc.;
    (iv) Establishment of unit or total price in conformance with a 
``price statement'' on a license that permits price to be based on the 
market price at a specified date plus an exporter's mark-up, or like 
basis;
    (v) Change in intermediate consignee if the new intermediate 
consignee is located in the country of ultimate destination as shown on 
the license, except a change in, or addition of, an intermediate 
consignee involving a consolidated shipment;
    (vi) Change in continuity of shipment by unloading from carrier at a 
country listed in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of 
the EAR) port not in the country of ultimate destination, without the 
designation of an intermediate consignee on the shipping documents and 
license, provided:
    (A) The purpose is to transfer the shipment to another vessel, 
barge, or vehicle, solely for onforwarding to the country of destination 
shown on the shipping documents and the license;
    (B) The shipment is moving on a through bill of lading;
    (C) The carrier is not registered in, owned or controlled by, or 
under charter or lease to a country in Country Group D:1 or E:2 (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), or a national of any of these 
countries;
    (D) The carrier retains custody of the shipment until it is 
delivered to the ultimate consignee; and
    (E) The original bill of lading or air waybill first issued at the 
port of export is delivered with the shipment to the ultimate consignee;
    (vii) Change in address of purchaser or ultimate consignee if the 
new address is located within the same country shown on the license; or
    (viii) Change in ECCN, unit of quantity, unit price, or wording of 
the item description (where necessary only for the purpose of conforming 
to an official revision in the CCL). This does not cover an actual 
change in the item to be shipped, or an increase in the price or 
quantity.
    (2)(i) For Encryption Licensing Arrangements issued by BXA for 
exports and reexports of items controlled under ECCN 5A002, 5B002, and 
5D002, and for encryption commodities and software previously on the 
U.S. Munitions List and currently authorized for export or reexport 
under a State Department license, distribution arrangement or any other 
authority of the State Department, you must by letter to BXA a request 
for approval of any additional country of destination.
    (ii) Letters requesting changes pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of 
this section should be made by the license holder on company letterhead, 
clearly identifying the original license number and the requested 
change. In addition, requests for changes to State licenses or other 
authorizations must be accompanied by a copy of the original State 
license or authorization. The requested changes may not take effect 
until approved in writing by BXA. Send requests for changes to the 
following address: Office of Strategic Trade, Bureau of Export 
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 2705, 14th Street and 
Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: Encryption Division.
    (d) Responsibility of the licensee. The person to whom a license is 
issued is the licensee. In export transactions, the exporter must be the 
licensee, and the exporter-licensee is responsible for the proper use of 
the license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to 
the extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some 
other party to the transaction. In the case of Encryption License 
Agreements (ELA), the licensee may not necessarily be the exporter or 
reexporter. In this case, the authorized user of the ELA is responsible 
for proper use of the

[[Page 400]]

license, and for all terms and conditions of the license, except to the 
extent that certain terms and conditions are directed toward some other 
party to the transaction. In reexport or routed export transactions, a 
U.S. agent acting on behalf of a foreign principal party in interest may 
be the licensee; in these cases, both the agent and the foreign 
principal party in interest, on whose behalf the agent has acted, are 
responsible for the use of the license, and for all terms and conditions 
of the license, except to the extent that certain terms and conditions 
are directed toward some other party to the transaction. It is the 
licensee's responsibility to communicate the specific license conditions 
to the parties to whom those conditions apply. In addition, when 
required by the license, the licensee is responsible for obtaining 
written acknowledgment(s) of receipt of the conditions from the 
party(ies) to whom those conditions apply.
    (e) Prohibited use of a license. No person convicted of a violation 
of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion 
of the Secretary of Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up 
to 10 years from the date of the conviction. See Sec. 766.25 of the EAR.
    (f) Quantity of commodities authorized. Unlike software and 
technology, commodities will be approved with a quantity or dollar value 
limit. The ``Unit'' paragraph within each CCL commodity entry will list 
a specific ``Unit'' for those commodities controlled by that entry. Any 
license resulting from a license application to export or reexport 
commodities will be licensed in terms of the specified ``Unit''. If a 
commodity is licensed in terms of ``$ value'', the unit of quantity 
commonly used in trade may also be shown on the license. Though this 
unit may be shown on the approved license, the quantity of commodities 
authorized is limited entirely by the total dollar value shown on the 
approved license.
    (g) License validity period. Licenses involving the export or 
reexport of items will generally have a 24-month validity period, unless 
a different validity period has been requested and specifically approved 
by BXA. Exceptions from the 24-month validity period include, license 
applications reviewed and approved as an ``emergency'' (see Sec. 748.4 
(h) of the EAR), license applications for items controlled for short 
supply reasons, and Special Comprehensive Licenses.
    Emergency licenses will expire no later than the last day of the 
calendar month following the month in which the emergency license is 
issued. Licenses for items controlled for short supply reasons will be 
limited to a 12-month validity period. The expiration date will be 
clearly stated on the face of the license. If the expiration date falls 
on a legal holiday (Federal or State), the validity period is 
automatically extended to midnight of the first day of business 
following the expiration date. (See part 752 of the EAR for validity 
periods for Special Comprehensive Licenses.)
    (1) Extended validity period. Validity periods in excess of 24 
months generally will not be granted. BXA will consider granting a 
validity period exceeding 24 months when extenuating circumstances 
warrant such an extension, however, no changes will be approved related 
to any other particular on the license (e.g., parties to the 
transaction, countries of ultimate destination, etc.). For example, an 
extended validity period will generally be granted where the transaction 
is related to a multi-year project, when production lead time will not 
permit an export or reexport during the original validity period of the 
license, when an unforeseen emergency prevents shipment within the 24-
month validity of the license, or for other similar circumstances. A 
continuing requirement to supply spare or replacement parts will not 
normally justify an extended validity period. Licenses issued in 
accordance with the emergency clearance provisions contained in 
Sec. 748.4(h) of the EAR will not be extended. See Sec. 752.9 of the EAR 
for information relating to the extension of a Special Comprehensive 
License.
    (2) Request for extension. (i) The applicant must submit a letter in 
writing to request an extension in the validity period of a previously 
approved license.

[[Page 401]]

The subject of the letter must be titled: ``Request for Validity Period 
Extension'' and contain the following information:
    (A) The name, address, and telephone number of the requestor;
    (B) A copy of the original license, with the license number, 
validation date, and current expiration date legible; and
    (C) Justification for the extension;
    (ii) It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that all 
applicable support documents remain valid and are in the possession of 
the applicant. If the request for extension is approved, BXA will 
provide the applicant with a written response.
    (h) Specific types of licenses--(1) Licenses for temporary exports 
or reexports. If you have been granted a license for the temporary 
export or reexport of items and you decide not to return the items to 
the United States, you must submit a license application requesting 
authorization to dispose of the items. Except when the items are to be 
used on a temporary basis at a new destination (and returned to the 
United States after such use), you must ensure that your license 
application is accompanied by all documents that would be required if 
you had requested a license to export or reexport the same item directly 
to the new destination.
    (2) Intransit within the United States. If you have been issued a 
license authorizing an intransit shipment (that does not qualify for the 
intransit provisions of License Exception TMP) through the United 
States, your license will be valid only for the export of the intransit 
shipment wholly of foreign origin and for which a Transportation and 
Exportation customs entry or an Immediate Exportation customs entry is 
outstanding.
    (3) Intransit outside the United States. If you have been issued a 
license authorizing unlading or transit through a country listed in the 
General Prohibition Eight contained in Sec. 736.2(b)(8) of the EAR, and 
you did not know the identity of the intermediate consignee at the time 
of the original license application, you must notify BXA in writing once 
you have ascertained the identity of the intermediate consignee. Your 
notification must contain the original license number, and the complete 
name, address, and telephone number of the intermediate consignee. The 
written request must be submitted to BXA at the address listed in 
Sec. 748.2(c) of the EAR.
    (4) Replacement license. If you have been issued a ``replacement'' 
license (for changes to your original license that were not covered in 
paragraph (c) of this section), you must attach the ``replacement'' 
license to the original, and retain both.
    (i) Terminating license conditions. Exporters or reexporters who 
have shipped under licenses with conditions that would not apply to an 
export under a License Exception or if no license was required, and 
foreign consignees who have agreed to such conditions, are no longer 
bound by these conditions when the licensed items become eligible for a 
License Exception or can be exported or reexported without a license. 
Items that become eligible for a License Exception are subject to the 
terms and conditions of the applicable License Exception and to the 
restrictions in Sec. 740.2 of the EAR. Items that become eligible for 
export without a license remain subject to the EAR and any export, 
reexport, or disposition of such items may only be made in accordance 
with the requirements of the EAR. Termination of license conditions does 
not relieve an exporter or reexporter of its responsibility for 
violations that occurred prior to the availability of a License 
Exception or prior to the removal of license requirements.
    (j) Records. If you have been issued a license you must retain the 
license, and maintain complete records in accordance with part 762 of 
the EAR including any licenses (whether used or unused, valid or 
expired) and all supporting documents and shipping records.

Sec. 750.8  Revocation or suspension of licenses.

    (a) Revocation. All licenses for exports or reexports are subject to 
revision, suspension, or revocation, in

[[Page 402]]

whole or in part, without notice whenever it is known that the EAR have 
been violated or that a violation is about to occur. BXA's Office of 
Exporter Services may revoke any license in which a person who has been 
convicted of one of the statutes specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, 
at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, has an interest in the 
license at the time of the conviction. It may be necessary for BXA to 
stop a shipment or an export or reexport transaction at any stage in the 
process (e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport). 
If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary for BXA 
to order the return or unloading of such shipment at any port of call in 
accordance with the provisions of the EAA.
    (b) Return of revoked or suspended licenses. If BXA revokes or 
suspends a license, the licensee shall return the license immediately 
upon notification that the license has been suspended or revoked. The 
license must be returned to BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) 
of the EAR, Attn:'' Return of Revoked/Suspended License''. All 
applicable supporting documents and records of shipments must be 
retained by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions 
of part 762 of the EAR. If the licensee fails to return a license 
immediately upon notification that it has been suspended or revoked, BXA 
may impose sanctions provided for in part 764 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 750.9  Duplicate licenses.

    (a) Lost, stolen or destroyed. If a license is lost, stolen or 
destroyed, you, as the licensee, may obtain a duplicate of the license 
by submitting a letter to the BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) 
of the EAR, Attention: Duplicate License Request''. You must certify in 
your letter:
    (1) That the original license ([number] issued to [name and address 
of licensee]) has been lost, stolen or destroyed;
    (2) The circumstances under which it was lost, stolen or destroyed; 
and
    (3) If the original license is found, the licensee will return 
either the original or duplicate license to the BXA. Note that if 
shipment was made against the original license, those shipments must be 
counted against the duplicate license. If you are issued a duplicate 
license you must retain the duplicate license in accordance with the 
recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR.
    (b) Hong Kong Trade Department. BXA will automatically issue a 
duplicate license whenever the license lists a party in Hong Kong as the 
intermediate consignee, or when Hong Kong is identified as the country 
from which the reexport will take place. The duplicate license will be 
labeled ``Duplicate for Hong Kong Trade Department''. This duplicate 
must be forwarded to the reexporter or intermediate consignee for 
submission to the Hong Kong Trade Department. The original license must 
be retained on file by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeeping 
provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 750.10  Transfers of licenses for exports.

    (a) Authorization. As the licensee, you may not transfer a license 
issued for the export of items from the United States to any other 
party, except with the prior written approval of BXA. BXA may authorize 
a transfer of a license for export to a transferee who is subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, is a principal party in interest, and 
will assume all powers and responsibilities under the license for the 
control of the shipment of the items out of the United States. BXA will 
approve only one transfer of the same license and only transfers of 
licenses to export items.
    (b) How to request the transfer of licenses--(1) Letter from 
licensee. You, as the licensee, must submit a letter in writing to 
request a transfer of a license or licenses. The letter must contain the 
following information:
    (i) The reasons for the requested transfer;
    (ii) Either a list of the outstanding license numbers or a statement 
that all outstanding licenses in the name of the licensee are to be 
transferred, and the total number of such outstanding licenses;
    (iii) A list of all license applications for export to be 
transferred that are

[[Page 403]]

pending with BXA, identifying the Application Control Number for each, 
or other information that will assist in identifying the pending license 
applications;
    (iv) Name and address of the person you intend to transfer the 
licenses and license applications to;
    (v) The facts necessitating transfer;
    (vi) A statement as to whether or not any consideration has been, or 
will be, paid for the transfer; and
    (vii) Identification by name of the legal document (certificate, 
agreement, etc.) or other authority by which the new firm name is 
legally established, the new corporation or firm created, or the assets 
transferred and showing the effective date of such document and the 
state where filed or recorded.
    (2) Information from transferee. The person to whom you wish to 
transfer your license(s) must provide you a signed letter, that must be 
submitted with your request, containing the following:
    (i) That the transferee is a principal party in interest in the 
transaction covered by the license, or is acting as agent for a 
principal party in interest;
    (ii) That the transferee is subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States;
    (iii) That the transferee assumes all powers and responsibilities 
under the license for the control of the shipment of the items out of 
the United States;
    (iv) Whether any consideration has been, has not been, or will be 
paid for the transfer;
    (v) The name and address of the foreign principal in instances where 
the transferee will make the export as an agent on behalf of a foreign 
principal; and
    (vi) If the license is to be transferred to a subsidiary or firm, or 
if you transfer to the transferee all, or a substantial portion, of your 
assets or business, the transferee must certify that the legal authority 
changing the exporter imposes on the transferee the responsibility to 
accept and fulfill the obligations of the transferor under the 
transactions covered by the license; and
    (vii) The following certification:

    The undersigned hereby certifies that, if license number(s) 
____________ is (are) transferred in accordance with my (our) request, 
any and all documents evidencing the order covered by this (these) 
license(s) will be retained and made available upon request in 
compliance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in Part 762 of 
the Export Administration Regulations. The undersigned further certifies 
compliance with all requirements of the Export Administration 
Regulations regarding these licenses.

    (c) Notification of transfer and recordkeeping. Unless instructed 
otherwise by BXA, you must retain the license(s) pending notification by 
BXA of the action taken. If the request is approved, you must forward 
the license(s) to the transferee and the validated letter received from 
BXA authorizing the transfer. If the transfer request is not approved, 
the license(s) must either be returned to BXA or used by you if you so 
choose and have retained the legal and operational capacity fully to 
meet the responsibilities imposed by the license(s). If your initial 
request is returned by BXA for additional information, after obtaining 
the necessary information you may resubmit your request.

<R05>
Sec. 750.11  Shipping tolerances.

    (a) Applicability and use of shipping tolerances. Under some 
circumstances, you may use a license issued for the export of items from 
the United States to export more than the quantity or value shown on 
that license. This additional amount is called a shipping tolerance. 
This section tells you, as the licensee, when you may take advantage of 
a shipping tolerance and the amount of shipping tolerance you are 
permitted to use.
    (1) If you have already shipped the full amount approved on your 
license, you may not use this shipping tolerance provision. No further 
shipment may be made under the license.
    (2) The amount of shipping tolerance you are permitted is based on 
the ``Unit'' specified for the item you want to export in the applicable 
ECCN on the CCL (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). You must 
calculate shipping tolerance based on the applicable ``Unit'' whether 
that be Number, Dollar Value, or Area, Weight, or other Measure. You may 
not use any other unit that may appear on your license.

[[Page 404]]

    (b) Calculating shipping tolerances. There are three basic rules, 
one for items licensed by ``Dollar Value'', one for items licensed by 
``Number'', and another for items licensed by ``Area, Weight or other 
Measure''.
    (1) Items licensed by ``Dollar Value''. If the ``Unit'' paragraph in 
the ECCN applicable to your item reads ``Sec. value'' or ``in 
Sec. value'', there is no shipping tolerance. You may not ship more than 
the total dollar value stated on your license.
    (2) Items licensed by ``Number''. If the ``Unit'' paragraph in the 
ECCN applicable to your item reads ``Number'' or ``in Number'', there is 
no shipping tolerance with respect to the number of units. However, the 
value of all of your shipments under one license may exceed the total 
dollar value stated on that license by up to 25%.
    (3) Items licensed by ``Area, Weight or Measure''. If the ``Unit'' 
paragraph in the ECCN applicable to your item reads ``kilograms'' or 
``square meters'' or some other unit of area, weight or measure, your 
shipment may exceed the unshipped balance of the area, weight or other 
measure listed on your license by up to 10% and the total dollar value 
shown on your license by up to 25%, unless;
    (i) Your license stipulates a specific shipping tolerance; or
    (ii) Your item is controlled for short supply reasons and a smaller 
tolerance has been established. (See part 754 of the EAR).
    (c) Examples of shipping tolerances.--(1) A license authorizes the 
export of 100,000 kilograms of an item controlled by an ECCN where the 
``Unit'' is stated as ``kilograms'', the total cost of which is 
$1,000,000:
    (i) One shipment. If one shipment is made, the quantity that may be 
exported may not exceed 110,000 kg (10% tolerance on the unshipped Area, 
Weight, or Measure balance), and the total cost of that one shipment may 
not exceed $1,250,000:

  $1,000,000  (the total value shown on the license)
    +250,000  (25% of the total value shown on the license)
-------------
  $1,250,000
 

    (ii) Two shipments. If the first shipment is for 40,000 kg (valued 
at $400,000), the second shipment may not exceed 66,000 kg (10% of the 
unshipped balance of 60,000 kg (6,000 kg) plus the unshipped balance), 
and the total cost of the second shipment shall not exceed $850,000:

    $600,000  (the value of the unshipped balance of 60,000 kg)
    +250,000  (25% of the original total value shown on the license)
-------------
    $850,000
 

    (iii) Three shipments. If the first shipment is for 40,000 kg 
(valued at $400,000) the second shipment is for 20,000 kg (valued at 
$200,000), the third shipment may not exceed 44,000 kg (10% of the 
unshipped balance of 40,000 kg (4,000 kg) plus the unshipped balance), 
and the total cost of the third shipment can not exceed $650,000:

    $400,000  (the value of the unshipped balance of 40,000 kg)
    +250,000  (25% of the original total value on the license)
-------------
    $650,000
 

    (2) A license authorizes the export of an item controlled by an ECCN 
where the ``Unit'' is stated as ``$ value'', the total cost of which is 
$5,000,000. There is no shipping tolerance on this license because the 
items are controlled by an ECCN where ``$ value'' is the stated 
``Unit''.
    (3) A license authorizes the export of 10 pieces of equipment 
controlled by an ECCN where the ``Unit'' is stated as ``Number'', with a 
total value of $10,000,000 and the export of parts and accessories 
covered by that same entry valued at $1,000,000:
    (i)(A) If one shipment is made, the quantity of equipment that may 
be exported may not exceed 10 pieces of equipment because there is no 
shipping tolerance on the ``number'' of units. That one shipment of 
equipment may not exceed $12,500,000:

 $10,000,000  (the total value shown on the license)
  +2,500,000  (25% of the total value shown on the license)
-------------
 $12,500,000
 

    (B) If the one shipment includes parts and accessories, those parts 
and accessories may not exceed $1,000,000 because there is no shipping 
tolerance on any commodity licensed in terms of dollar value.
    (ii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valued at

[[Page 405]]

$4,000,000, the second shipment may not exceed 6 pieces of equipment (no 
tolerance on ``number'') valued at no more than $8,500,000:

  $6,000,000  (the value of the unshipped 6 pieces).
  +2,500,000  (25% of the original total value shown on the license).
-------------
  $8,500,000
 

    (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts and 
accessories, the second shipment may not exceed $700,000 of parts and 
accessories because there is no shipping tolerance on any commodity 
licensed in terms of dollar value.
    (iii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valued 
at $4,000,000 and the second shipment is for 3 pieces of equipment 
valued at $3,000,000, the third shipment may not exceed 3 pieces of 
equipment (no tolerance on ``number'') valued at no more than 
$5,500,000:

  $3,000,000  (the value of the unshipped 3 pieces).
  +2,500,000  (25% of the original value shown on the license),
-------------
  $5,500,000
 

    (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts and accessories 
and the second shipment includes another $300,000, the third shipment 
may not exceed $400,000 because there is no shipping tolerance on 
commodities licensed in terms of dollar value.

<R05>
Sec. 752.1  Scope.

    (a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are 
references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part describes the 
provisions of the Special Comprehensive License (SCL). You may apply for 
an SCL, when appropriate, in lieu of a license described in part 748 of 
the EAR, or a License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR, for 
multiple exports and reexports of items subject to the EAR. The SCL 
provides authorization to make specified exports and reexports that are 
otherwise prohibited by General Prohibitions One, Two, and Three 
described in part 736 of the EAR. The existence of an SCL does not 
supersede an exporter's obligation to request a separate license as may 
be required by part 744 of the EAR. Because the Bureau of Export 
Administration (BXA) does not review each individual transaction 
authorized by an SCL, parties to the SCL must have the mechanisms in 
place to ensure that each export and reexport made under an SCL meets 
all the terms and conditions of the license and are in accordance with 
all applicable provisions of the EAR. It is through the design and 
effective implementation of an Internal Control Program (ICP) that the 
SCL holder and the SCL consignee (referred to as ``consignee'' for 
purposes of this part) assure that exports and reexports are not made 
contrary to the EAR.

[[Page 406]]

    (2) Definitions--(i) SCL holder. As used in this part, ``SCL 
holder'' is that party approved on an SCL to perform activities approved 
under the SCL.
    (ii) SCL consignee. As used in this part, ``SCL consignee'' or 
``consignee'' means any party authorized to receive items under the SCL 
and named as a consignee on an approved Form BXA-752, Statement by 
Consignee in Support of Special Comprehensive License.
    (b) ICP requirement. To qualify for an SCL, you must develop an ICP. 
Section 752.11 of this part includes a general description of the 
elements of the ICP, and guidance on which elements your company must 
implement before making shipments under the SCL. The elements of the ICP 
your company will develop reflect the complexity of the activities 
authorized under the SCL, the countries and items involved, and the 
relationship between the SCL holder and the approved consignees. BXA may 
require you to include in your ICP any combination of elements, 
depending upon the nature of your SCL application. During your pre-
application consultation required by Sec. 752.5(a)(1), BXA will provide 
you guidance on which elements you must implement.

[61 FR 12835, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25463, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 752.2  Eligible activities.

    (a) Possible authorizations. Under the SCL, BXA may authorize you to 
perform any number of activities, which can be grouped under the general 
categories of ``service'', ``end-user'', ``distribution'' and ``other'' 
activities. Examples of the general categories include:
    (1) Service activities. Exporting items subject to the EAR as spare 
and replacement parts for servicing or stocking.
    (2) End-user activities. Exporting and reexporting items subject to 
the EAR for use as capital equipment.
    (3) Distribution activities. Exporting and reexporting items subject 
to the EAR for the purpose of resale and reexport by consignees.
    (4) Other activities. Other activities not included in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section may be authorized by BXA under the 
SCL on a case-by-case basis.
    (b) Prohibited activities. The general prohibitions described in 
Sec. 736.2(b)(4) through (10) of the EAR apply to all exports and 
reexports by, and conduct of, all parties approved on your SCL, unless 
you are specifically authorized under the SCL to perform such 
activities, or the particular activity otherwise qualifies for a License 
Exception described in part 740 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 752.3  Eligible items.

    (a) All items subject to the EAR, including items eligible for 
License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR, are eligible for 
export and reexport under the SCL, except:
    (1) Items controlled for missile technology reasons that are 
identified by the letters MT in the applicable ``Reason for Control'' 
paragraph on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (see Supplement No. 1 to 
part 774 of the EAR);
    (2) Items controlled by ECCNs 1C351, 1C352, 1C353, 1C354, 1C991,

precursors and chemical warfare agents, to destinations listed in 
Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR);
    (4) Items controlled for short supply reasons that are identified by 
the letters ``SS'' in the applicable ``Reason for Control'' paragraph on 
the CCL;
    (5) Items controlled for EI reasons on the CCL;
    (6) Maritime (civil) nuclear propulsion systems or associated design 
or production software and technology identified in Sec. 744.5 of the 
EAR;
    (7) Communications intercepting devices controlled by ECCN 5A980 on 
the CCL;
    (8) Hot section technology for the development, production or 
overhaul of commercial aircraft engines controlled under ECCN 9E003.a.1. 
through a.12. .f, and related controls;
    (9) Items specifically identified as ineligible by BXA on your 
approved SCL; and
    (10) Additional items consistent with international commitments.

[[Page 407]]

    (b) Items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons that are 
identified by the letters NP in the applicable ``Reason for Control'' 
paragraph on the CCL may be authorized on a case-by-case basis provided 
controls are in place to screen for proscribed end-users or end-uses.

<R05>
Sec. 752.4  Eligible countries.

    (a) General provisions. All countries are eligible under the SCL 
except:
    (1) Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
    (2) Other countries that BXA may designate on a case-by-case basis 
as ineligible to receive items under the SCL.
    (b) Servicing prohibitions. Under the SCL, you may not service any 
item when you know that the item is owned or controlled by, or under the 
lease or charter of, entities in countries identified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section or any national of such countries.


<R05>
Sec. 752.5  Steps you must follow to apply for an SCL.

    (a) Step One: Establish applicant reliability--(1) Pre-application 
consultation. To apply for an SCL, BXA must determine your reliability 
as a potential SCL holder. BXA usually does this through consultation 
with company officials and a review of the criteria identified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. To determine whether your company 
requires a consultation before you apply for an SCL, contact BXA at the 
address, phone, or telefacsimile numbers included in Sec. 752.17 of this 
part.
    (2) Criteria for determining eligibility. BXA will review the 
following criteria to help determine SCL holder eligibility:
    (i) Evidence of past licensing history and projected, continuous 
large volume exports;
    (ii) Reliability of all parties relative to their compliance with 
the EAR;
    (iii) Commitment of all parties of the necessary resources to 
implement and maintain an adequate ICP; and
    (iv) Evidence of all parties knowledge of all provisions of the EAR.
    (b) Step Two: Establish consignee reliability--(1) Requirements. You 
must make an initial determination of the reliability of all consignees 
that are listed on your application for an SCL, based upon the criteria 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Determining reliability. The criteria that you should take into 
consideration include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Criteria. (A) The proposed consignee has a satisfactory record 
established through BXA pre-license checks, or extensive experience as a 
consignee under any license issued by BXA;
    (B) The proposed consignee is a wholly-owned subsidiary or a 
controlled-in-fact affiliate of the applicant or of a consignee that is 
already approved on an SCL. See part 772 of the EAR for a definition of 
controlled-in-fact; or
    (C) You have evidence of an established, on-going business 
relationship with the proposed consignee.
    (ii) Exception. The provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section do not preclude the authority of BXA to determine the 
reliability and eligibility of a proposed consignee. BXA may, based upon 
any negative information on the proposed consignees, deny a proposed 
consignee.
    (c) Step Three: Prepare your documentation. Complete Form BXA-748P, 
Multipurpose Application, Form BXA-748P-A, Item Appendix, Form BXA-748P-
B, End-User Appendix, an ICP, a comprehensive narrative statement, Form 
BXA-752, Statement by Consignee in Support of Special Comprehensive 
License, Form BXA-752-A, Reexport Territories, and all applicable 
certifications. Submit this documentation to BXA at one of the addresses 
included in Sec. 752.17 of this part.
    (1) Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose Application, and Form BXA-748P-A, 
Item Appendix. You must complete Form BXA-748P and Form 748P-A according 
to the instructions found in Supplement Nos. 1 and 2 of this part.
    (2) Form BXA-748P-B, End-User Appendix. You must identify end-users 
on Form BXA-748P-B if you are requesting approval to export or reexport

[[Page 408]]

items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation or chemical and biological 
control reasons.
    (3) ICP. You must provide a copy of your proposed ICP as required by 
Sec. 752.11 of this part. You must indicate whether any of the elements 
of the ICP will not be implemented and explain why these elements were 
deemed inapplicable. Existence of a properly constructed ICP will not 
relieve you of your responsibility to comply with requirements of all 
applicable regulations pertaining to your SCL;
    (4) Comprehensive narrative statement. Prepare a comprehensive 
narrative statement on your company letterhead that includes the 
following information:
    (i) An overview of the total business activity that will be 
performed by you and all other parties who will receive items under the 
authority of your SCL, including consignees, subcontractors, and 
vessels;
    (ii) A description of the nature and anticipated volume of regular 
and repetitive transactions proposed by consignees under the license;
    (iii) An explanation of the relationship between the parties to the 
application, such as affiliate, subsidiary, or parent, etc;
    (iv) A certification that you will implement, upon approval of the 
application by BXA, an ICP that incorporates all applicable elements 
listed in Sec. 752.11 of this part and any additional elements as 
required by BXA upon approval of the SCL; and
    (v) Information on whether proposed consignees are end-users or will 
reexport the items received under your SCL. You must describe the 
proposed consignee's activities completely to determine the appropriate 
ICP elements that you and your consignees must implement.
    (5) Form BXA-752, Statement of Consignee in Support of Special 
Comprehensive License. This Form is completed by each consignee. You 
must submit one completed, signed, original Form BXA-752 for each 
proposed consignee on your SCL application. See Supplement No. 3 to this 
part for instructions on completing Form BXA-752. Form BXA-752 is not 
required if the proposed consignee is both an end-user and a ``foreign 
government agency'' as defined in part 772 of the EAR.
    (6) Form BXA-752-A, Reexport Territories. You must complete Form 
BXA-752-A, and attach it to the appropriate Form BXA-752, whenever 
Blocks 8B, 8C, 8E, and/or 8F are selected on Form BXA-752. See the 
instruction found in Supplement No. 3 to this part. Form BXA-752-A is 
not required if the proposed consignee is both an end-user and a foreign 
government agency (see part 772 of the EAR for a definition of foreign 
government agency).
    (7) Consignee certifications. Each consignee must provide certain 
certifications on company letterhead that is signed by the consignee. 
Attach certifications to the appropriate Form BXA-752. Each consignee 
must certify that:
    (i) They will implement, upon approval of the SCL by BXA, an ICP 
that incorporates all applicable elements listed in Sec. 752.11 of this 
part and any additional elements as required by BXA upon approval of 
your SCL. If certain elements of an ICP will not be included, state the 
reasons for that determination;
    (ii) They will comply with all provisions of the EAR, including the 
recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR, all applicable system 
review requirements of Sec. 752.14 of this part, and the reexport 
restrictions of Sec. 752.6 of this part; and
    (iii) They will make available for inspection, upon request by BXA, 
all records required by Sec. 752.12 of this part and part 762 of the 
EAR.
    (8) Additional certifications. (i) Temporary exports. Proposed 
consignees that plan to exhibit or demonstrate items in countries other 
than those in which they are located or are authorized under an SCL, an 
approved Form BXA-752, or a License Exception provision described in 
Sec. 740.8(a)(2)(iii) of the EAR may obtain permission to do so by 
including the following additional certification on company letterhead, 
and attaching it to Form BXA-752.

    I (We) request authorization to reexport temporarily, for exhibit or 
demonstration in countries eligible to receive items under the Special 
Comprehensive License. The items exported will be retained under my 
(our) ownership and control, and will be returned by me (us) to (name 
destination) promptly after their exhibit or demonstration abroad,

[[Page 409]]

and in no case later than one year after the date of reexport, unless 
other disposition is authorized in writing by the Bureau of Export 
Administration.

    (ii) Chemicals and chemical equipment certification. If you are 
requesting authority to export chemicals or chemical equipment eligible 
for the SCL, you must obtain a signed written statement on company 
letterhead from the proposed consignee(s) and end-user(s) (except those 
located in Country Group A:3) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR) certifying the following:

    No chemicals or chemical equipment received under this Special 
Comprehensive License will be transferred, resold, or reexported to a 
destination that requires a license, unless the new end-user has been 
approved by the Bureau of Export Administration, and in no case will the 
items be retransferred, resold, or reexported to a party who is not the 
end-user.

    (iii) Nuclear nonproliferation certification. If you are requesting 
the export or reexport under the EAR of items controlled for nuclear 
nonproliferation reasons described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR, prior to 
submitting an SCL application, you must obtain a signed written 
statement on company letterhead from the proposed consignee(s) and end-
user(s) certifying the following:
    (A) The items to be exported or replicas thereof (``replicas'' refer 
to items produced abroad based on physical examination of the items 
originally exported, matching it in all critical design and performance 
parameters), will not be used in any of the activities described in 
Sec. 744.2 of the EAR; and
    (B) Written authorization will be obtained from BXA prior to 
transferring or reexporting the items, unless they are destined to 
Canada or would not require a license to the new country of destination.

<R05>
Sec. 752.8  SCL application review process.

    (a) Scope. Under an SCL, you are authorized to make multiple exports 
and reexports without review and approval of each individual transaction 
by BXA. To approve an SCL, BXA must be satisfied that the persons 
benefiting from this license will adhere to the conditions of the 
license and the EAR, and that approval of the application will not be 
detrimental to U.S. national security, nonproliferation, or foreign 
policy interests. In reviewing and approving a specific SCL request, BXA 
retains the right to limit the eligibility of items or to prohibit the 
export, reexport, or transfer of items under the SCL to specific firms, 
individuals, or countries.
    (b) Elements of review. To permit BXA to make such judgments, BXA 
will thoroughly analyze your past export and reexport transactions, 
inspect your export and reexport documents, and interview company 
officials of both the applicant and the consignees, as necessary. If BXA 
cannot verify that an appropriate ICP will be implemented upon approval 
of the SCL by BXA, or establish the reliability of the proposed parties 
to the application, it may deny the application, or modify it by 
eliminating certain consignees, items, countries, or activities.
    (c) order requirement. You do not need to have in your possession an 
order from the proposed consignee at the time you apply for an SCL. 
However, evidence of a consignee's firm intention to place orders on a 
continuing basis is required.
    (d) Criteria for review. BXA will consider the following factors 
during the processing of your SCL application:
    (1) The specific nature of proposed end-use and end-uses;
    (2) The significance of the export in terms of its contribution to 
the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of nuclear or 
chemical or biological weapons, or missiles;
    (3) The types of assurances against design, development, production, 
stockpiling, or use of nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, or 
missiles that are included in the ICP;
    (4) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (5) Corporate commitment of the resources necessary to implement and 
maintain an adequate ICP;
    (6) Evidence of past licensing history of the applicant and 
consignees, and projected, continuous large volume exports and/or 
reexports;
    (7) Reliability of all parties;
    (8) Information on all parties' compliance with the provisions of 
the EAR; and
    (9) All parties' knowledge of the EAR.
    (e) Application processing time-frames. Upon receiving an SCL 
application, BXA may review the application for up to two weeks to 
determine whether the SCL application is complete. When all 
documentation requirements are met, BXA will register the application.

[[Page 411]]

After the date of registration, the SCL application will be processed 
according to the procedures described in part 750 of the EAR.

Sec. 750.10(a) of the EAR you may not transfer a license--including a 
Special Comprehensive License--except with the prior written approval of 
BXA. In addition, BXA reserves the right to modify, revoke, or suspend 
an SCL in the event of a change in control of the previously approved 
SCL holder or consignee(s). In reviewing requests to transfer an SCL or 
consignee authority under an SCL and in reviewing changes in control of 
an SCL holder or approved consignee, BXA will consider the reliability 
of the new parties.
    (4) Remove reexport territories. If you remove a country from a

you remove an item from your SCL. After review of the change by BXA, BXA 
will send you a validated Form BXA-748P and Form BXA-748P-A, if 
applicable. The SCL holder must send a copy of each validated form to 
all applicable consignees and attach a copy to their BXA-752.

will return to the SCL holder two validated copies of Form BXA-752 and 
Form BXA-748P-B, which will include any special instructions that may be 
necessary. You must send one copy of Forms BXA-752 and BXA-748P to the 
relevant consignee.

Sec. 752.11  Internal Control Programs.

    (a) Scope--(1) Introduction. It is through Internal Control Programs 
(ICPs) that the SCL holder and the consignee assure that exports and 
reexports are not made contrary to the EAR. The elements of your ICP 
will reflect the complexity of the activities authorized under the SCL, 
the countries and items involved, and the relationship between the SCL 
holder and the approved consignees.
    (2) General requirements. Prior to making any exports and reexports 
under an SCL, you and your consignees, when required, must implement an 
ICP that is designed to ensure compliance with the SCL and the EAR. This 
section provides an overview of the elements that comprise an ICP. You 
may obtain from BXA at the address found in Sec. 752.17 of this part 
guidelines to assist you in developing an adequate ICP. You must submit 
with your application for an SCL a copy of your proposed ICP, along with 
any consignee ICPs, when required, incorporating the elements described 
in this section, as appropriate. BXA may require you to modify your ICP 
depending upon the activities, items, and destinations requested on your 
application for an SCL.
    (b) Requirements. You may not make any shipments under an SCL until 
you and your consignees, when appropriate, implement all the elements of 
the required ICP. If there are elements that you consider inapplicable, 
you must explain the reasons for this determination at the time of 
application for an SCL. Existence of a properly constructed ICP will not 
relieve the SCL holder of liability for improper use or failure to 
comply with the requirements of the EAR.
    (c) Elements of an ICP. Following is a list of ICP elements. The 
specific elements that should be included in your ICP depend upon the 
complexity of the activities authorized under your SCL, the countries 
and items involved, and the relationship between the SCL holder and the 
approved consignees.
    (1) A clear statement of corporate policy communicated to all levels 
of the firm involved in exports and reexports, traffic, and related 
functions, emphasizing the importance of SCL compliance;
    (2) Identification of positions (and maintenance of current list of 
individuals occupying the positions) in the SCL holder firm and 
consignee firms responsible for compliance with the requirements of the 
SCL procedure;
    (3) A system for timely distribution to consignees and verification 
of receipt by consignees of the Denied Persons List (Supplement No. 2 to 
part 764 of the EAR) and other regulatory materials necessary to ensure 
compliance;
    (4) A system for screening items, training and servicing 
transactions against Denied Persons List (Supplement No. 2 to part 764 
of the EAR) and any relevant updates to the Denied Persons List;

[[Page 416]]

    (5) A system for assuring compliance with items and destination 
restrictions, including controls over reexports by consignees and direct 
exports to consignee customers;
    (6) A compliance review program covering the SCL holder and 
extending to all consignees;
    (7) A system for assuring compliance with controls on exports and 
reexports of nuclear items and to nuclear end-uses described in 
Secs. 742.3 and 744.2 of the EAR;
    (8) An on-going program for informing and educating employees 
responsible for processing transactions involving items received under 
the SCL about applicable regulations, limits, and restrictions of the 
SCL;
    (9) A program for recordkeeping as required by the EAR;
    (10) An order processing system that documents employee clearance of 
transactions in accordance with applicable elements of the company ICP;
    (11) A system for monitoring in-transit shipments and shipments to 
bonded warehouses and free trade zones;
    (12) A system for notifying BXA promptly if the SCL holder knows 
that a consignee is not in compliance with terms of the SCL;
    (13) A system to screen against customers who are known to have, or 
are suspected of having, unauthorized dealings with specially designated 
regions and countries for which nonproliferation controls apply;
    (i) The signs of potential diversion that you should take into 
consideration include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (A) The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant to offer 
information about the end-use (or end-user) of a product.
    (B) The product's capabilities do not fit the buyer's line of 
business; for example, a small bakery places an order for several 
sophisticated lasers.
    (C) The product ordered is incompatible with the technical level of 
the country to which the product is being shipped. For example, 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment would be of little use in a 
country without an electronics industry.
    (D) The customer has little or no business background. For example, 
financial information unavailable from normal commercial sources and 
corporate principals unknown by trade sources.
    (E) The customer is willing to pay cash for a very expensive item 
when the terms of the sale call for financing.
    (F) The customer is unfamiliar with the product's performance 
characteristics but still wants the product.
    (G) Routine installation, training or maintenance services are 
declined by the customer.
    (H) Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are planned for out-of-
the-way destinations.
    (I) A freight forwarding firm is listed as the product's final 
destination.
    (J) The shipping route is abnormal for the product and destination.
    (K) Packaging is inconsistent with the stated method of shipment or 
destination.
    (L) When questioned, the buyer is evasive or unclear about whether 
the purchased product is for domestic use, export, or reexport.
    (M) Customer uses only a ``P.O. Box'' address or has facilities that 
appear inappropriate for the items ordered.
    (N) Customer's order is for parts known to be inappropriate, or for 
which the customer appears to have no legitimate need (e.g., there is no 
indication of prior authorized shipment of system for which the parts 
are sought).
    (O) Customer is known to have, or is suspected of having 
unauthorized dealings with parties and/or destinations in ineligible 
countries.
    (ii) When any of the above characteristics have been identified, but 
through follow-up inquiries or investigation have not been 
satisfactorily resolved, the consignee should not transact any business 
with the customer under the SCL. Apply for a license according to part 
748 of the EAR. You should explain the basis for the concern regarding 
the proposed customer, and state that you are an SCL consignee. Also, 
cite the SCL number, and your consignee number;
    (14) A system for assuring compliance with controls over exports and 
reexports for missile-related end-uses and end-users described in 
Sec. 744.3 of the EAR;

[[Page 417]]

    (15) A system for assuring compliance with control over exports and 
reexports of chemical precursors and biological agents and related items 
and end-uses described in Secs. 742.2 and 744.4 of the EAR;

[61 FR 12835, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25466, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 752.12  Recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) SCL holder and consignees. In addition to the recordkeeping 
requirements of part 762 of the EAR, the SCL holder and each consignee 
must maintain copies of manuals, guidelines, policy statements, internal 
audit procedures, reports, and other documents making up the ICP of each 
party included under an SCL. Also, all parties must maintain copies of 
the most current Denied Persons List (see Supplement No. 2 to part 764 
of the EAR) as well as all updates, and all other regulatory materials 
necessary to ensure compliance with the SCL, such as relevant changes to 
the EAR, product classification, additions, deletions, or other 
administrative changes to the SCL, transmittal letters and consignee's 
confirmations of receipt of these materials.
    (b) Consignees. All consignees must retain all records of the types 
of activities identified in Sec. 752.2(a)(3) of this part. Records on 
such sales or reexports must include the following:
    (1) Full name and address of individual or firm to whom sale or 
reexport was made;
    (2) Full description of each item sold or reexported;
    (3) Units of quantity and value of each item sold or reexported; and
    (4) Date of sale or reexport.


<R05>
Sec. 752.13  Inspection of records.

    (a) Availability of records. You and all consignees must make 
available all of the records required by Sec. 752.12 of this part and 
Sec. 762.2 of the EAR for inspection, upon request, by BXA or by any 
other representative of the U.S. Government, in accordance with part 762 
of the EAR.
    (b) Relationship of foreign laws. Foreign law may prohibit 
inspection of records by a U.S. Government representative in the foreign 
country where the records are located. In that event, the consignee must 
submit with the required copies of Form BXA-752 an alternative 
arrangement for BXA to review consignee activities and determine whether 
or not the consignee has complied with U.S. export control laws and 
regulations, which must be approved by BXA.
    (c) Failure to comply. Parties failing to comply with requests to 
inspect documents may be subject to orders denying export privileges 
described in part 764 of the EAR or to the administrative actions 
described in part 766 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 752.14  System reviews.

    (a) Post-license system reviews. BXA may conduct system reviews of 
the SCL holder as well as any consignee. Generally, BXA will give 
reasonable notice to SCL holders and consignees in advance of a system 
review. The review will involve interviews with company officials, the 
inspection of records, and the review of ICPs. BXA may conduct special 
unannounced system reviews if BXA has reason to believe an SCL holder or 
consignee has improperly used or has failed to comply with the SCL.
    (b) Other reviews. BXA may require an SCL holder or consignee to 
submit to its office a list of all sales made under the SCL during a 
specified time-frame. Also, BXA may request from any consignee a list of 
transactions during a specified period involving direct shipments of 
items received under SCLs to customers of other consignees and sales to 
customers in reexport territories authorized by BXA on the consignee's 
validated Form BXA-752.


<R05>
Sec. 752.15  Export clearance.

    (a) Shipper's Export Declaration (SED). The SED covering an export 
made under an SCL must be prepared in accordance with standard 
instructions described in Sec. 758.1 of the EAR. If the SCL holder has 
implemented the Bureau of Census Monthly Reporting System, the SCL 
holder must comply with the Census requirements.
    (1) Item descriptions. Item descriptions on the SED must indicate 
specifically the ECCN and item description conforming to the applicable 
CCL description and incorporating any additional

[[Page 418]]

information where required by Schedule B; (e.g., type, size, name of 
specific item, etc.).
    (2) Value of shipments. There is no value limitation on shipments 
under the SCL; however, you must indicate the value of each shipment on 
the SED.
    (3) SCL number. The SED must include the SCL number followed by a 
blank space, and then the consignee number identifying the SCL's 
approved consignee to whom the shipment is authorized.
    (b) Destination control statement. The SCL holder and consignees 
must enter a destination control statement on all copies of the bill of 
lading or air way-bill, and the commercial invoice covering exports 
under the SCL, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 758.6 of the 
EAR. Use of a destination control statement does not preclude the 
consignee from reexporting to any of the SCL holder's other approved 
consignees or to other countries for which specific prior approval has 
been received from BXA. In such instances, reexport is not contrary to 
U.S. law and, therefore, is not prohibited. Another destination control 
statement may be required or approved by BXA on a case-by-case basis.

[61 FR 12835, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25466, May 9, 1997; 65 
FR 42570, July 10, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 752.16  Administrative actions.

    (a)(1) If BXA is not satisfied that you or other parties to the SCL 
are complying with all conditions and requirements of the SCL, or that 
ICPs employed by parties to such licenses are not adequate, BXA may, in 
addition to any enforcement action pursuant to part 764 of the EAR, take 
any licensing action it deems appropriate, including the following:
    (i) Suspend the privileges under the SCL in whole or in part, or 
impose other restrictions;
    (ii) Revoke the SCL in whole or in part;
    (iii) Prohibit consignees from receiving items authorized under the 
SCL, or otherwise restrict their activities under the SCL;
    (iv) Restrict items that may be shipped under the SCL;
    (v) Require that certain exports, transfers or reexports be 
individually authorized by BXA;
    (vi) Restrict parties to whom consignees may sell under the SCL; and
    (vii) Require that an SCL holder provide an audit report to BXA of 
selected consignees or overseas operations.
    (2) Whenever necessary to protect the national interest of the U.S., 
BXA may take any licensing action it deems appropriate, without regard 
to contracts or agreements entered into before such administrative 
action, including those described in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (vii) 
of this section.
    (b) Appeals. Actions taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
may be appealed under the provisions of part 756 of the EAR.

Sec. 754.1  Introduction.

    (a) Scope. In this part, references to the Export Administration 
Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. 
This part implements the provisions of section 7, ``Short Supply 
Controls,'' of the Export Administration Act (EAA) and similar 
provisions in other laws that are not based on national security and 
foreign policy grounds.
    (b) Contents. Specifically, this part deals with the following:
    (1) It sets forth the license requirements and licensing policies 
for commodities that contain the symbol ``SS'' in the ``Reason for 
Control'' part of ``License Requirements'' section of the applicable 
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) identified on the Commerce 
Control List (Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). In appropriate 
cases, it also provides for License Exceptions from the short supply 
licensing requirements described in this part. The license requirements 
and policies that are described in this part cover the following:

<R05>
Sec. 754.2  Crude oil.

    (a) License requirement. As indicated by the SS notation in the 
``License Requirements'' section of ECCN 1C981 on the CCL (Supplement 
No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR), a license is required for the export of 
crude oil to all destinations, including Canada. See paragraph (h) of 
this section for a License Exception permitting the export of certain 
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, paragraph (i) of this section 
for a License Exception for certain shipments of samples, and paragraph 
(j) of this section for a License Exception for exports of oil 
transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted pursuant to section 
203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1652). 
``Crude oil'' is defined as a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in 
liquid phase in underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric 
pressure after passing through surface separating facilities and which 
has not been processed through a crude oil distillation tower. Included 
are reconstituted crude petroleum, and lease condensate and liquid 
hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. Drip 
gases are also included, but topped crude oil, residual oil, and other 
finished and unfinished oils are excluded.
    (b) License policy. (1) BXA will approve applications to export 
crude oil for the following kinds of transactions if BXA determines that 
the export is consistent with the specific requirements pertinent to 
that export:
    (i) Exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet (see paragraph (d) of this 
section);
    (ii) Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein (see paragraph 
(e) of this section);
    (iii) Exports in connection with refining or exchange of strategic 
petroleum reserve oil (see paragraph (f) of this section);
    (iv) Exports of heavy California crude oil up to an average volume 
not to exceed 25 MB/D (see paragraph (g) of this section);
    (v) Exports that are consistent with international agreements as 
described in the statutes listed in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (vi) Exports that are consistent with findings made by the President 
under an applicable statute, including the statutes described in 
paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (vii) Exports of foreign origin crude oil where, based on written 
documentation satisfactory to BXA, the exporter can demonstrate that the 
oil is not of U.S. origin and has not been commingled with oil of U.S. 
origin. See paragraph (h) of this section for the provisions of License 
Exception SPR permitting exports of certain crude oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve.
    (2) BXA will review other applications to export crude oil on a 
case-by-case basis and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, generally will approve such applications if BXA determines that 
the proposed export is consistent with the national interest and the 
purposes of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). Although BXA 
will consider all applications for approval, generally, the following 
kinds of transactions will be

[[Page 423]]

among those that BXA will determine to be in the national interest and 
consistent with the purposes of EPCA.
    (i) The export is part of an overall transaction:
    (A) That will result directly in the importation into the United 
States of an equal or greater quantity and an equal or better quality of 
crude oil or of a quantity and quality of petroleum products listed in 
Supplement No. 1 to this part that is not less than the quantity and 
quality of commodities that would be derived from the refining of the 
crude oil for which an export license is sought;
    (B) That will take place only under contracts that may be terminated 
if the petroleum supplies of the United States are interrupted or 
seriously threatened; and
    (C) In which the applicant can demonstrate that, for compelling 
economic or technological reasons that are beyond the control of the 
applicant, the crude oil cannot reasonably be marketed in the United 
States.
    (ii) Exports involving temporary exports or exchanges that are 
consistent with the exceptions from the restrictions of the statutes 
listed in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Additional statutory controls. (1) The following statutes 
provide controls on the export of domestically produced crude oil based 
on its place of origin or mode of transport. If such other statutory 
controls apply, an export may only be approved if the President makes 
the findings required by the applicable law.
    (i) Section 201 of Public Law 104-58, entitled ``Exports of Alaskan 
North Slope Oil,'' provides for exports of domestically produced crude 
oil transported by pipeline over rights-of-way granted pursuant to 
section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 
1652) (``TAPS crude oil''). The President made a determination on April 
28, 1996.
    (ii) The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 restricts exports of 
domestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over rights-of-
way granted pursuant to section 28(u) of that Act (30 U.S.C. 185(u)) 
(``MLA'').
    (iii) The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act restricts exports of 
crude oil produced from the outer Continental Shelf (29 U.S.C. 1354) 
(``OCSLA'').
    (iv) The Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act restricts the 
export of crude oil produced from the naval petroleum reserves (10 
U.S.C. 7430) (``NPRPA'').
    (2) Supplement No. 3 to this part describes the relevant statutory 
provisions. In cases where a particular statute applies, a Presidential 
finding is necessary before the export can be authorized. You should 
note that in certain cases it is possible that more than one statute 
could apply to a particular export of crude oil.
    (d) Exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet. The licensing policy is to 
approve applications for exports of crude oil that was derived from the 
state-owned submerged lands of Alaska's Cook Inlet and has not been, or 
will not be, transported by a pipeline over a federal right-of-way 
subject to the MLA or the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization 
Act.<SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ On November 6, 1985, the Secretary of Commerce determined that 
the export of crude oil derived from State waters in Alaska's Cook Inlet 
is consistent with the national interest and the purposes of the Energy 
Policy and Conservation Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein. (1) Except for 
TAPS crude oil, the licensing policy is to approve applications for 
exports of crude oil to Canada for consumption or use therein.
    (2) The licensing policy for TAPS crude oil is to approve 
applications for an average of no more than 50,000 barrels of oil per 
day for consumption or use in Canada, subject to the following 
procedures and conditions:
    (i) Any ocean transportation of the commodity will be made by 
vessels documented for United States coastwise trade under 46 U.S.C. 
12106. Only barge voyages between the State of Washington and Vancouver, 
British Columbia, and comparable barge movements across waters between 
the U.S. and Canada may be excluded from this requirement. The Bureau of 
Export Administration will determine, in consultation with the Maritime 
Administration, whether such transportation is ``ocean'' transportation; 
and

[[Page 424]]

    (ii) Authorization to export TAPS crude oil will be granted on a 
quarterly basis. Applications will be accepted by BXA no earlier than 
two months prior to the beginning of the calendar quarter in question, 
but must be received no later than the 25th day of the second month 
preceding the calendar quarter. For example, for the calendar quarter 
beginning April 1 and ending June 30, applications will be accepted 
beginning February 1, but must be received no later than February 25.
    (iii) The quantity stated on each application must be the total 
number of barrels for the quarter, not a per-day rate. This quantity 
must not exceed 50,000 barrels times the number of calendar days in the 
quarter.
    (iv) Each application must include support documents providing 
evidence that the applicant has either:
    (A) Title to the quantity of barrels stated in the application; or
    (B) A contract to purchase the quantity of barrels stated in the 
application.
    (v) The quantity of barrels authorized on each license for export 
during the calendar quarter will be determined by the BXA as a prorated 
amount based on:
    (A) The quantity requested on each license application; and
    (B) The total number of barrels that may be exported by all license 
holders during the quarter (50,000 barrels per day multiplied by the 
number of calendar days during the quarter).
    (vi) Applicants may combine their licensed quantities for as many as 
four consecutive calendar quarters into one or more shipments, provided 
that the validity period of none of the affected licenses has expired.
    (vii) BXA will carry forward any portion of the 50,000 barrels per 
day quota that has not been allocated during a calendar quarter, except 
that no un-allocated portions will be carried over to a new calendar 
year. The un-allocated volume for a calendar quarter will be added, 
until expended, to the quotas available for each quarter through the end 
of the calendar year.
    (f) Refining or exchange of Strategic Petroleum Reserve Oil. (1) 
Exports of crude oil withdrawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
(SPR) will be approved if BXA, in consultation with the Department of 
Energy, determines that such exports will directly result in the 
importation into the United States of refined petroleum products that 
are needed in the United States and that otherwise would not be 
available for importation without the export of the crude oil from the 
SPR.
    (2) Licenses may be granted to export, for refining or exchange 
outside of the United States, SPR crude oil that will be sold and 
delivered, pursuant to a drawdown and distribution of the SPR, in 
connection with an arrangement for importing refined petroleum products 
into the United States.
    (3) BXA will approve license applications subject to the following 
conditions:
    (i) You must provide BXA evidence of the following:
    (A) A title to the quantity of barrels of SPR crude stated in the 
application; or
    (B) A contract to purchase, for importation, into the United States 
the quantity of barrels of SPR crude stated in the application.
    (ii) The following documentation must be submitted to BXA no later 
than fourteen days following the date that the refined petroleum 
products are imported in the U.S. in exchange for the export of SPR 
crude:
    (A) Evidence that the exporter of the SPR crude has title to or a 
contract to purchase refined petroleum product;
    (B) A copy of the shipping manifest that identifies the refined 
petroleum products; and
    (C) A copy of the entry documentation required by the U.S. Customs 
Service that show the refined petroleum products were imported into the 
United States, or a copy of the delivery receipt when the refined 
petroleum products are for delivery to the U.S. military outside of the 
United States.
    (4) You must complete both the export of the SPR crude and the 
import of the refined petroleum products no later than 30 days following 
the issuance of the export license, except in the case of delivery to 
the U.S. military outside of the United States, in which case the 
delivery of the refined petroleum products must be completed no later 
than the end of the term of the

[[Page 425]]

contract with the Department of Defense.
    (g) Exports of certain California crude oil. The export of 
California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20.0 degrees API or 
lower, at an average volume not to exceed 25 MB/D, will be authorized as 
follows.
    (1) Applicants must submit their applications on Form BXA-748 to the 
following address: Office of Exporter Services, ATTN: Short Supply 
Program--Petroleum, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of 
Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
    (2) The quantity stated on each application must be the total number 
of barrels proposed to be exported under the license--not a per-day 
rate. This quantity must not exceed 25 percent of the annual authorized 
export quota. Potential applicants may inquire of BXA as to the amount 
of the annual authorized export quota available.
    (3) Each application shall be accompanied by a certification by the 
applicant that the California heavy crude oil:
    (i) Has a gravity of 20.0 degrees API or lower;
    (ii) Was produced within the state of California, including its 
submerged state lands;
    (iii) Was not produced or derived from a U.S. Naval Petroleum 
Reserve; and
    (iv) Was not produced from submerged lands of the U.S. Outer 
Continental Shelf.
    (4) Each license application must be based on an order, and be 
accompanied by documentary evidence of such an order (e.g., a letter of 
intent).
    (5) BXA will adhere to the following procedures for licensing 
exports of California heavy crude oil:
    (i) BXA will issue licenses for approved applications in the order 
in which the applications are received (date-time stamped upon receipt 
by BXA), with the total quantity authorized for any one license not to 
exceed 25 percent of the annual authorized volume of California heavy 
crude oil.
    (ii) BXA will approve only one application per month for each 
company and its affiliates.
    (iii) BXA will consider the following factors (among others) when 
determining what action should be taken on individual license 
applications:
    (A) The number of licenses to export California heavy crude oil that 
have been issued to the applicant or its affiliates during the then-
current calendar year;
    (B) The number of applications pending in BXA that have been 
submitted by applicants who have not previously been issued licenses 
under this section to export California heavy crude oil during the then-
current calendar year; and
    (C) The percentage of the total amount of California heavy crude oil 
authorized under other export licenses previously issued to the 
applicant pursuant to this section that has actually been exported by 
the applicant.
    (iv) BXA will approve applications contingent upon the licensee 
providing documentation meeting the requirements of both 
paragraphs(g)(5)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section prior to any export 
under the license:
    (A) Documentation showing that the applicant has or will acquire 
title to the quantity of barrels stated in the application. Such 
documentation shall be either:
    (1) An accepted contract or bill of sale for the quantity of barrels 
stated in the application; or
    (2) A contract to purchase the quantity of barrels stated in the 
application, which may be contingent upon issuance of an export license 
to the applicant.
    (B) Documentation showing that the applicant has a contract to 
export the quantity of barrels stated in the application. The contract 
may be contingent upon issuance of the export license to the applicant.
    (v) BXA will carry forward any portion of the 25 MB/D quota that has 
not been licensed, except that no unallocated portions will be carried 
forward more than 90 days into a new calendar year. Applications to 
export against any carry-forward must be filed with BXA by January 15 of 
the carry-forward year.
    (vi) BXA will return to the available authorized export quota any 
portion of the 25 MB/D per day quota that has

[[Page 426]]

been licensed, but not shipped, during the 90-day validity period of the 
license.
    (vii) BXA will not carry over to the next calendar year pending 
applications from the previous year.
    (6) License holders:
    (i) Have 90 calendar days from the date the license was issued to 
export the quantity of California heavy crude oil authorized on the 
license. Within 30 days of any export under the license, the exporter 
must provide BXA with a certified statement confirming the date and 
quantity of California heavy crude oil exported.
    (ii) Must submit to BXA, prior to any export under the license, the 
documentation required by paragraph (g)(5)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) May combine authorized quantities into one or more shipments, 
provided that the validity period of none of the affected licenses has 
expired.
    (iv) Are prohibited from transferring the license to another party 
without prior written authorization from BXA.
    (7) BXA will allow a 10 percent tolerance on the unshipped balance 
based upon the volume of barrels it has authorized. BXA will allow a 25 
percent shipping tolerance on the total dollar value of the license. See 
Sec. 750.11 of the EAR for an explanation of shipping tolerances.
    (h) License Exception for certain shipments from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserves (SPR). Subject to the requirements set forth in this 
paragraph, License Exception SPR may be used to export without a license 
foreign origin crude oil imported and owned by a foreign government or 
its representative which is imported for storage in, and stored in, the 
United States Strategic Petroleum Reserves pursuant to an appropriate 
agreement with the U.S. Government or an agency thereof. If such foreign 
origin oil is commingled with other oil in the SPR, such export is 
authorized under License Exception SPR only if the crude oil being 
exported is of the same quantity and of comparable quality as the 
foreign origin crude oil that was imported for storage in the SPR and 
the Department of Energy certifies this fact to BXA.
    (1) The requirements and restrictions described in Secs. 740.1 and 
740.2 of the EAR that apply to all License Exceptions also apply to the 
use of License Exception SPR.
    (2) A person exporting crude oil pursuant to this License Exception 
must enter on any required Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) the letter 
code ``SS-SPR.''
    (i) License Exception for certain sample shipments. Subject to the 
requirements set forth in this paragraph, License Exception SS-SAMPLE 
may be used to export crude oil for analytic and testing purposes.
    (1) An exporter may ship up to 10 barrels of crude oil to any one 
end-user annually, up to an annual cumulative limit of 100 barrels per 
exporter.
    (2) The requirements and restrictions described in Secs. 740.1 and 
740.2 of the EAR that apply to all License Exceptions also apply to the 
use of License Exception SPR.
    (3) A person exporting crude oil pursuant to this License Exception 
must enter on any required Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) the letter 
code ``SS-SAMPLE''.
    (j) License Exception for exports of TAPS Crude Oil. (1) License 
Exception TAPS may be used to export oil transported over right-of-way 
granted pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline 
Authorization Act (TAPS), provided the following conditions are met:
    (i) The TAPS oil is transported by a vessel documented under the 
laws of the United States and owned by a citizen of the United States 
(in accordance with section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. app. 
802));
    (ii) All tankers involved in the TAPS export trade use the same 
route that they do for shipments to Hawaii until they reach a point 300 
miles due south of Cape Hinchinbrook Light and then turn toward Asian 
destinations. After reaching that point, tankers in the TAPS oil export 
trade must remain outside of the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic 
Zone, as defined in 16 U.S.C. 1802(6). Tankers returning from foreign 
ports to Valdez, Alaska must abide by the same restrictions, in reverse, 
on their return route. This condition shall not be construed to limit 
any statutory, treaty or Common Law

[[Page 427]]

rights and duties imposed upon and enjoyed by tankers in the TAPS oil 
export trade, including, but not limited to, force majeure and maritime 
search and rescue rules; and
    (iii) The owner or operator of a tanker exporting TAPS oil shall:
    (A) Adopt a mandatory program of deep water ballast exchange (i.e., 
at least 2,000 meters water depth). Exceptions can be made at the 
discretion of the captain only in order to ensure the safety of the 
vessel and crew. Records must be maintained in accordance with paragraph 
(j)(3) of this section.
    (B) Be equipped with satellite-based communications systems that 
will enable the Coast Guard independently to determine the tanker's 
location; and
    (C) Maintain a Critical Area Inspection Plan for each tanker in the 
TAPS oil export trade in accordance with the U.S. Coast Guard's 
Navigation and Inspection Circular No. 15-91 as amended, which shall 
include an annual internal survey of the vessel's cargo block tanks.
    (2) Shipper's Export Declaration. In addition to the requirements of 
paragraph (j)(1) of this section, for each export under License 
Exceptions TAPS, the exporter must file with BXA a Shipper's Export 
Declaration (SED) covering the export not later than 21 days after the 
export has occurred. The SED shall be sent to the following address: 
Manager, Short Supply Program, Department of Commerce, Office of 
Chemical and Biological Controls and Treaty Compliance, Bureau of Export 
Administration, Room 2075, Washington, D.C. 20230.

Supplement No. 3 to Part 754--Statutory Provisions Dealing With Exports 
                              of Crude Oil

[The statutory material published in this supplement is for the 
information of the reader only. See the U.S. Code for the official text 
of this material.]

                            Public Law 104-58

              SEC. 201. EXPORTS OF ALASKAN NORTH SLOPE OIL.

    Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 185(s)) is amended 
by amending subsection(s) to read as follows:

                  ``EXPORTS OF ALASKAN NORTH SLOPE OIL

    (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subsection and 
notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or any other provision 
of laws (including any regulation) applicable to the export of oil 
transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted pursuant to section 
203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1652), 
such oil may be exported unless the President finds that exportation of 
this oil is not in the national interest. The President shall make his 
national interest determination within five months of the date of 
enactment of this subsection. In evaluating whether exports of this oil 
are in the national interest, the President shall at a minimum 
consider--
    (A) whether exports of this oil would diminish the total quantity or 
quality of petroleum available to the United States;
    (B) the results of an appropriate environmental review, including 
consideration of appropriate measures to mitigate any potential adverse 
effects of exports of this oil on

[[Page 432]]

the environment, which shall be completed within four months of the date 
of the enactment of this subsection; and
    (C) whether exports of this oil are likely to cause sustained 
material oil supply shortages or sustained oil prices significantly 
above world market levels that would cause sustained material adverse 
employment effects in the United States or that would cause substantial 
harm to consumers, including noncontiguous States and Pacific 
territories.
    If the President determines that exports of this oil are in the 
national interest, he may impose such terms and conditions (other than a 
volume limitation) as are necessary or appropriate to ensure that such 
exports are consistent with the national interest.
    (2) Except in the case of oil exported to a country with which the 
United States entered into a bilateral international oil supply 
agreement before November 26, 1979, or to a country pursuant to the 
International Emergency Oil Sharing Plan of the International Energy 
Agency, any oil transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted 
pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act 
(43 U.S.C. 1652) shall, when exported, be transported by a vessel 
documented under the laws of the United States and owned by a citizen of 
the United States (as determined in accordance with section 2 of the 
Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. App. 802)).
    (3) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the authority of the 
President under the Constitution, the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act ( ) 
U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or Part B of title II of the Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271-76) to prohibit exports.
    (4) The Secretary of Commerce shall issue any rules necessary for 
implementation of the President's national interest determination, 
including any licensing requirements and conditions, within 30 days of 
the date of such determination by the President. The Secretary of 
Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in administering the 
provisions of this subsection.
    (5) If the Secretary of Commerce finds that exporting oil under 
authority of this subsection has caused sustained material oil supply 
shortage or sustained oil prices significantly above world market levels 
and further finds that these supply shortages or price increases have 
caused or are likely to cause sustained material adverse employment 
effects in the United States, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation 
with the Secretary of Energy, shall recommend, and the President may 
take, appropriate action concerning exports of this oil, which may 
include modifying or revoking authority to export such oil.
    (6) Administrative action under this subsection is not subject to 
sections 551 and 553 through 559 of title 5, United States Code.

                          Limitations on Export

    Any domestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over 
rights-of-way granted pursuant to this section, except such crude oil 
which is either exchanged in similar quantity for convenience or 
increased efficiency of transportation with persons or the government of 
an adjacent foreign state, or which is temporarily exported for 
convenience or increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an

to all of the limitations and licensing requirements of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 and following) and, in 
addition, before any crude oil subject this section may be exported 
under the limitations and licensing requirements and penalty and 
enforcement provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979 the 
President must make and publish an express finding that such exports 
will not diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum available 
to the United States, and are in the national interest and are in accord 
with the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979: Provided, 
That the President shall submit reports to the Congress containing 
findings made under this section, and after the date of receipt of such 
report Congress shall have a period of sixty calendar days, thirty days 
of which Congress must have been in session, to consider whether exports 
under the terms of this section are in the national interest. If the 
Congress within this time period passes a concurrent resolution of 
disapproval stating disagreement with the President's finding concerning 
the national interest, further exports made pursuant to the 
aforementioned Presidential finding shall cease.

of no increase in reliance on imported oil or gas.
    Before any oil or gas subject to this section may be exported under 
the requirements and provisions of the Export Administration Act of

the national interest, further exports made pursuant to such 
Presidential findings shall cease.

administrative action taken by the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) 
may appeal to the Under Secretary for reconsideration of that 
administrative action. The following types of administrative actions are 
not subject to the appeals procedures described in this part 756:
    (1) Issuance, amendment, revocation, or appeal of a regulation. 
(These requests may be submitted to BXA at any time.)
    (2) Denial or probation orders, civil penalties, sanctions, or other 
actions under parts 764 and 766 of the EAR, except that, an appeal from 
an action taken under Sec. 766.25 shall be subject to the appeals 
procedures described in this part 756.
    (b) Definitions. [Reserved]

[61 FR 12851, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25467, May 9, 1997; 65 
FR 14863, Mar. 20, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 756.2  Appeal from an administrative action.

    (a) Review and appeal officials. The Under Secretary may delegate to 
the Deputy Under Secretary for Export Administration or to another BXA 
official the authority to review and decide the appeal. In addition, the 
Under Secretary may designate any BXA official

[[Page 434]]

to be an appeals coordinator to assist in the review and processing of 
an appeal under this part. The responsibilities of an appeals 
coordinator may include presiding over informal hearings.
    (b) Appeal procedures--(1) Filing. An appeal under this part must be 
received by the Under Secretary for Export Administration, Bureau of 
Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3898, 14th 
Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20230, not later 
than 45 days after the date appearing on the written notice of 
administrative action.
    (2) Content of appeal. The appeal must include a full written 
statement in support of appellant's position. The appeal must include a 
precise statement of why the appellant believes the administrative 
action has a direct and adverse effect and should be reversed or 
modified. The Under Secretary may request additional information that 
would be helpful in resolving the appeal, and may accept additional 
submissions. The Under Secretary will not ordinarily accept any 
submission filed more than 30 days after the filing of the appeal or of 
any requested submission.
    (3) Request for informal hearing. In addition to the written 
statement submitted in support of an appeal, an appellant may request, 
in writing, at the time an appeal is filed, an opportunity for an 
informal hearing. The Under Secretary may grant or deny a request for an 
informal hearing. Any hearings will be held in the District of Columbia 
unless the Under Secretary determines, based upon good cause shown, that 
another location would be better.
    (4) Informal hearing procedures--(i) Presentations. The Under 
Secretary shall provide an opportunity for the appellant to make an oral 
presentation based on the materials previously submitted by the 
appellant or made available by the Department in connection with the 
administrative action. The Under Secretary may require that any facts in 
controversy be covered by an affidavit or testimony given under oath or 
affirmation.
    (ii) Evidence. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law do 
not apply, and all evidentiary material deemed by the Under Secretary to 
be relevant and material to the proceeding, and not unduly repetitious, 
will be received and considered.
    (iii) Procedural questions. The Under Secretary has the authority to 
limit the number of people attending the hearing, to impose any time or 
other limitations deemed reasonable, and to determine all procedural 
questions.
    (iv) Transcript. A transcript of an informal hearing shall not be 
made, unless the Under Secretary determines that the national interest 
or other good cause warrants it, or the appellant requests a transcript. 
If the appellant requests a transcript, the appellant will be 
responsible for paying all expenses related to production of the 
transcript.
    (v) Report. When the Under Secretary designates another BXA official 
to conduct an informal hearing, that official will submit a written 
report containing a summary of the hearing and recommended action to the 
Under Secretary.
    (c) Decisions--(1) Determination of appeals. In addition to the 
documents specifically submitted in connection with the appeal, the 
Under Secretary shall consider any recommendations, reports, or relevant 
documents available to BXA in determining the appeal, but shall not be 
bound by any such recommendation, nor prevented from considering any 
other information, or consulting with any other person or groups, in 
making a determination. The Under Secretary may adopt any other 
procedures deemed necessary and reasonable for considering an appeal. 
The Under Secretary shall decide an appeal within a reasonable time 
after receipt of the appeal. The decision shall be issued to the 
appellant in writing and contain a statement of the reasons for the 
action.
    (2) Effect of the determination. The decision of the Under Secretary 
shall be final.
    (d) Effect of appeal. Acceptance and consideration of an appeal 
shall not affect any administrative action, pending or in effect, unless 
the Under Secretary, upon request by the appellant

[[Page 435]]

and with opportunity for response, grants a stay.

<R05>
Sec. 758.1  The Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) or Automated Export System (AES) record.

    (a) The Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) or Automated Export 
System (AES) record. The SED (Form 7525-V, Form 7525-V-Alt, or Automated 
Export System record) is used by the Bureau of Census to collect trade 
statistics and by the Bureau of Export Administration for export control 
purposes. The SED or AES record collects basic information such as the 
names and addresses of the parties to a transaction; the Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) (when required), the Schedule B number or 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule number, the description, quantity and value 
of the items exported; and the license authority for the export. The SED 
or the AES electronic equivalent is a statement to the United States 
Government that the transaction occurred as described.
    (b) When an SED or AES record is required. Except when the export of 
items subject to the EAR is to take place electronically or in an 
otherwise intangible form, you must file an SED or AES record with the 
United States Government for items subject to the EAR, including exports 
by U.S. mail, in the following situations:
    (1) For all exports of items subject to the EAR that are destined to 
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Serbia (except Kosovo), Sudan, or 
Syria, regardless of value (see 15 CFR 30.55(h) of the FTSR); and
    (2) For all exports of items subject to the EAR that are authorized 
under a license, regardless of value, or destination;
    (3) For all exports of commodities and mass market software subject 
to the EAR that are authorized under a License Exception or under NLR, 
when the value of the commodities or mass market software classified 
under a single Schedule B Number (or Harmonized Tariff Schedule number) 
is over $2,500, except as exempted by the Foreign Trade Statistics 
Regulations (FTSR) in 15 CFR part 30 and referenced in paragraph (c) of 
this section;
    (4) For all exports of items subject to the EAR that will be 
transshipped through Canada to a third destination, where the export 
would require an SED or AES record or license if shipped directly to the 
final destination from the United States (see 15 CFR 30.58(c) of the 
FTSR).

    Note to paragraph (b):
    In addition to the Shipper's Export Declaration for exports, the 
Bureau of Census Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations provide for a 
specific Shipper's Export Declaration for In-Transit Goods (Form 7513). 
See 15 CFR 30.3 and 30.8 of the FTSR.

    (c) Exemptions. A complete list of exemptions from the SED or AES 
filing requirement is set forth in the FTSR. Some of these FTSR 
exemptions have elements in common with certain EAR License Exceptions. 
An FTSR exemption may be narrower than a License Exception. The 
following references are provided in order to direct you to the FTSR 
exemptions that relate to EAR License Exceptions:
    (1) License Exception Baggage (BAG), as set forth in Sec. 740.14 of 
the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.56 of the FTSR;

[[Page 436]]

    (2) License Exception Gift Parcels and Humanitarian Donations (GFT), 
as set forth in Sec. 740.12 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.55(g) of the FTSR;
    (3) License Exception Aircraft and Vessels (AVS), as set forth in 
Sec. 740.15 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.55(l) of the FTSR;
    (4) License Exception Governments and International Organizations 
(GOV), as set forth in Sec. 740.11 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.53 of the 
FTSR;
    (5) License Exception Technology and Software Under Restriction 
(TSR), as set forth in Sec. 740.6 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.55(n) of the 
FTSR; or
    (6) License Exception Temporary Imports, Exports, and Reexports 
(TMP) ``tools of trade'', as set forth in Sec. 740.9(a)(2)(i) of the 
EAR. See 15 CFR 30.56(b) of the FTSR.
    (d) Notation on export documents for exports exempt from SED or AES 
record requirements. When an exemption from filing the Shipper's Export 
Declaration or Automated Export System record applies, the export 
authority (License Exception or NLR) of all the items must be entered on 
the loading document (e.g., Cargo Declaration, manifest, bill of lading, 
(master) air waybill) by the person responsible for preparing the 
document. This requirement is intended to parallel the Bureau of Census 
requirement, so that notations as to the basis for the SED exemption and 
the license authority are entered in the same place and manner (see 15 
CFR 30.21 of the FTSR for detailed requirements). The loading document 
must be available for inspection by government officials, along with the 
items, prior to lading on the carrier.
    (e) Signing the Shipper's Export Declaration or transmitting data 
via AES. The person who signs the SED must be in the United States at 
the time of signing. The person who transmits data via AES must be a 
certified AES participant in accordance with 15 CFR 30.60 of the FTSR. 
The person that signs the SED or transmits data via AES, whether 
exporter or agent, is responsible for the truth, accuracy, and 
completeness of the SED or AES record, except insofar as that person can 
demonstrate that he or she reasonably relied on information furnished by 
others.
    (f) The SED or AES record is an export control document. The SED or 
AES record is a statement to the U.S. Government. The SED or AES record 
is an export control document as defined in part 772 of the EAR. False 
statements made thereon may be a violation of Sec. 764.2(g) of the EAR. 
When an SED or AES record is presented to the U.S. Government, the 
signer or filer of the SED or AES record represents the following:
    (1) Export of the items described on the SED or AES record is 
authorized under the terms and conditions of a license issued by BXA; is 
in accordance with the terms and conditions of a License Exception; is 
authorized under ``NLR'' as no license is required for the shipment; or 
is not subject to the EAR;
    (2) Statements on the SED or AES record are in conformity with the 
contents of any license issued by BXA, with the possible exception of 
the exporter block in routed transactions; and
    (3) All information shown on the SED or AES record is true, 
accurate, and complete.
    (g) Export control information on the SED or AES record. For each 
item on the SED or AES record, you must show the license authority 
(License number, License Exception, or No License Required (NLR)), the 
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) (when required), and the 
item description in the designated blocks. The item description must be 
stated in Commerce Control List terms. If those terms are inadequate to 
meet Census Bureau requirements, the FTSR requires that you give enough 
additional detail to permit verification of the Schedule B Number (or 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule number). The FTSR also requires separate 
descriptions of items for each Schedule B classification (or Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule number). See 15 CFR 30.6 (separate SED or AES records), 
Sec. 30.7(l) (description of items) and Sec. 30.9 (separation of items 
on the SED) of the FTSR.
    (1) Exports under a license. When exporting under the authority of a 
license, you must enter on the SED or AES record the license number and 
expiration date (the expiration date is only required on paper versions 
of the

[[Page 437]]

SED), the ECCN, and an item description identical to the item 
description on the license.
    (2) Exports under a License Exception. You must enter on any 
required SED or AES record the ECCN and the correct License Exception 
symbol (e.g., LVS, GBS, CIV) for the License Exception(s) under which 
you are exporting. Items temporarily in the United States meeting the 
provisions of License Exception TMP, under Sec. 740.9(b)(3), are 
excepted from this requirement. See also Sec. 740.1(d) of the EAR.
    (3) No License Required (NLR) exports. You must enter on any 
required SED or AES record the ``NLR'' designation when the items to be 
exported are subject to the EAR but not listed on the Commerce Control 
List (i.e., items are classified as EAR99), and when the items to be 
exported are listed on the CCL but do not require a license. In 
addition, you must enter the correct ECCN on any required SED or AES 
record for all items being exported under the NLR provisions that have a 
reason for control other than anti-terrorism (AT). The designator 
``TSPA'' may be used, but is not required, when the export consists of 
technology or software outside the scope of the EAR. See Sec. 734.7 
through Sec. 734.11 of the EAR for TSPA information.
    (h) Power of attorney or other written authorization. In a ``power 
of attorney'' or other written authorization, authority is conferred 
upon an agent to perform certain specified acts or kinds of acts on 
behalf of a principal.
    (1) An agent must obtain a power of attorney or other written 
authorization in the following circumstances:
    (i) An agent that represents a foreign principal party in interest 
in a routed transaction must obtain a power of attorney or other written 
authorization that sets forth his authority; and
    (ii) An agent that applies for a license on behalf of a principal 
party in interest must obtain a power of attorney or other written 
authorization that sets forth the agent's authority to apply for the 
license on behalf of the principal.

    Note to paragraph (h)(1):
    The Bureau of Census Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations impose 
additional requirements for a power of attorney or other written 
authorization. See 15 CFR 30.4(e) of the FTSR.

    (2) This requirement for a power of attorney or other written 
authorization is a legal requirement aimed at ensuring that the parties 
to a transaction negotiate and understand their responsibilities. The 
absence of a power of attorney or other written authorization does not 
prevent BXA from using other evidence to establish the existence of an 
agency relationship for purposes of imposing liability.
    (i) Submission of the SED or AES record. The SED or AES record must 
be submitted to the U.S. Government in the manner prescribed by the 
Bureau of Census Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (15 CFR part 30).

[65 FR 42570, July 10, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 758.2  Automated Export System (AES).

    The Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (FTSR) (15 
CFR 30) contain provisions for filing Shipper's Export Declarations 
(SEDs) electronically using the Automated Export System (AES). In order 
to use AES, you must apply directly to the Census Bureau for 
certification and approval through a Letter of Intent (see 15 CFR 
30.60(b) and Appendix A to part 30 of the FTSR). Four AES filing options 
are available for transmitting shipper's export data. Option 1 is the 
standard paper filing of the SED, while the other three options are 
electronic. Option 2 requires the electronic filing of all information 
required for export prior to export (15 CFR 30.61(a) and 30.63 of the 
FTSR); Option 3 requires the electronic filing of only specified data 
elements prior to export, with complete information transmitted within 5 
working days of exportation (15 CFR 30.61(b) and Appendix B of the 
FTSR); Option 4 is only available for approved filers (approval by 
Census Bureau, U.S. Customs Service, BXA and other agencies) and 
requires no information to be transmitted prior to export, with complete 
information transmitted within 10 working days of exportation (15 CFR 
30.61(c) and 30.62(c) of the FTSR).
    (a) Census' Option 4 application process. Exporters, or agents 
applying on behalf of an exporter, may apply for Option 4 filing 
privileges by submitting

[[Page 438]]

a Letter of Intent to the Census Bureau in accordance with 15 CFR 
30.60(b) and 30.62 of the FTSR. The Census Bureau will distribute the 
Letter of Intent to BXA and other agencies participating in the Option 4 
approval process. Any agency may notify Census that an applicant has 
failed to meet its acceptance standards, and the Census Bureau will 
provide a denial letter to the applicant naming the denying agency. If 
no agency denies the application within 30 days, nor requests an 
extension of time within 30 days, the Census Bureau will provide the 
applicant with an approval letter. See 15 CFR 30.62(b) of the FTSR.
    (b) BXA Option 4 application process. When AES filers wish to use 
Option 4 for exports of items that require a BXA license, those filers 
must seek separate approval directly from BXA by completing a 
questionnaire and certification. (Separate BXA approval is not required 
for the use of Option 4 in connection with exports that do not require a 
BXA license.) The questionnaire and certification should be mailed to: 
U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, The Office 
of Enforcement Analysis, 14th & Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 4065, 
Washington, D.C. 20230.
    (1) Questionnaire. The following questions must be answered based on 
your experiences over the past five years. If the answer to either of 
the questions is ``yes'', it must be followed with a full explanation. 
Answering ``yes'' to either of the questions will not automatically 
prevent your participation in Option 4. BXA will consider the facts of 
each case and any remedial action you have taken to determine whether 
your reliability is sufficient to participate in this program.
    (i) Have you been charged with, convicted of, or penalized for, any 
violation of the EAR or any statute described in Sec. 766.25 of the EAR?
    (ii) Have you been notified by any government official of competent 
authority that you are under investigation for any violation of the EAR 
or any statute described in Sec. 766.25 of the EAR?
    (2) Certification. Each applicant must submit a signed certification 
as set forth in this paragraph. The certification will be subject to 
verification by BXA.

    I (We) certify that I (we) have established adequate internal 
procedures and safeguards to comply with the requirements set forth in 
the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (EAR) 
and Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (FTSR). These procedures and 
safeguards include means for:
    (i) Making a proper determination as to whether a license is 
required for a particular export;
    (ii) Receipt of notification of approval of the export license, if 
required, before the export is made;
    (iii) Compliance with all the terms and conditions of the license, 
License Exception, or NLR provisions of the EAR as applicable;
    (iv) Return of revoked or suspended licenses to BXA in accordance 
with Sec. 750.8(b) of the EAR, if requested;
    (v) Compliance with the destination control statement provisions of 
Sec. 758.6 of the EAR;
    (vi) Compliance with the prohibition against export transactions 
that involve persons who have been denied U.S. export privileges; and
    (vii) Compliance with the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of 
the EAR.
    I (we) agree that my (our) office records and physical space will be 
made available for inspection by the Bureau of the Census, BXA, or the 
U.S. Customs Service, upon request.

    (c) BXA Option 4 evaluation criteria. BXA will consider the grounds 
for denial of Option 4 filing status set forth in 15 CFR 30.62(b)(2) of 
the FTSR, as well as the additional grounds for denial set forth in this 
paragraph.
    (1) Applicants have not been approved for Option 4 filing privileges 
by the Census Bureau or other agency;
    (2) Applicants are denied persons (i.e., persons listed on the 
Denied Persons List in Supplement No. 2 to Part 764 of the EAR); or
    (3) Exports are destined to the countries designated by the 
Secretary of State as supporters of international terrorism under 
Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended. These 
``T-7'' countries currently include Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, 
Cuba, Sudan, and Syria.
    (d) Contacts for assistance. (1) For additional information on the 
AES in general, please contact: Chief Foreign

Sec. 758.3  Responsibilities of parties to the transaction.

    All parties that participate in transactions subject to the EAR must 
comply with the EAR. Parties are free to structure transactions as they 
wish, and to delegate functions and tasks as they deem necessary, as 
long as the transaction complies with the EAR. However, acting through a 
forwarding or other agent, or delegating or redelegating authority, does 
not in and of itself relieve anyone of responsibility for compliance 
with the EAR.
    (a) Export transactions. The U.S. principal party in interest is the 
exporter, except in certain routed transactions. The exporter must 
determine licensing authority (License, License Exception, or NLR), and 
obtain the appropriate license or other authorization. The exporter may 
hire forwarding or other agents to perform various tasks, but doing so 
does not necessarily relieve the exporter of compliance 
responsibilities.
    (b) Routed export transactions. All provisions of the EAR, including 
the end-use and end-user controls found in part 744 of the EAR, and the 
General Prohibitions found in part 736 of the EAR, apply to routed 
export transactions. The U.S. principal party in interest is the 
exporter and must determine licensing authority (License, License 
Exception, or NLR), and obtain the appropriate license or other 
authorization, unless the U.S. principal party in interest obtains from 
the foreign principal party in interest a writing wherein the foreign 
principal party in interest expressly assumes responsibility for 
determining licensing requirements and obtaining license authority, 
making the U.S. agent of the foreign principal party in interest the 
exporter for EAR purposes. One writing may cover multiple transactions 
between the same principals. See Sec. 748.4(a)(3) of the EAR.

    Note to paragraph (b):
    For statistical purposes, the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations 
(15 CFR part 30) have a different definition of ``exporter'' from the 
Export Administration Regulations. Under the FTSR the ``exporter'' will 
always be the U.S. principal party in interest. For purposes of 
licensing responsibility under the EAR, the U.S. agent of the foreign 
principal party in interest may be the ``exporter'' in a routed 
transaction.

    (c) Information sharing requirements. In routed export transactions 
where the foreign principal party in interest assumes responsibility for 
determining and obtaining licensing authority, the U.S. principal party 
in interest must, upon request, provide the foreign principal party in 
interest and its forwarding or other agent with the correct Export 
Control Classification Number (ECCN), or with sufficient technical 
information to determine classification. In addition, the U.S. principal 
party in interest must provide the foreign principal party in interest 
or the foreign principal's agent any information that it knows will 
affect the determination of license authority, see Sec. 758.1(g) of the 
EAR.
    (d) Power of attorney or other written authorization. In routed 
export transactions, a forwarding or other agent that represents the 
foreign principal party in interest, or who applies for a license on 
behalf of the foreign principal party in interest, must obtain a power 
of attorney or other written authorization from the foreign principal 
party in interest to act on its behalf. See Sec. 748.4(b)(2) and 
Sec. 758.1(h) of the EAR.

<R05>
Sec. 758.4  Use of export license.

    (a) License valid for shipment from any port. An export license 
issued by BXA authorizes exports from any port of export in the United 
States unless the license states otherwise. Items that leave the United 
States at one port, cross adjacent foreign territory, and reenter the 
United States at another port before being exported to a foreign 
country, are treated as exports from the last U.S. port of export.
    (b) Shipments against expiring license. Any item requiring a license 
that has

[[Page 440]]

not departed from the final U.S. port of export by midnight of the 
expiration date on an export license may not be exported under that 
license unless the shipment meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) 
or (2) of this section.
    (1) BXA grants an extension; or
    (2) Prior to midnight on the date of expiration on the license, the 
items:
    (i) Were laden aboard the vessel;
    (ii) Were located on a pier ready for loading and not for storage, 
and were booked for a vessel that was at the pier ready for loading; or
    (iii) The vessel was expected to be at the pier for loading before 
the license expired, but exceptional and unforseen circumstances delayed 
it, and BXA or the U.S. Customs Service makes a judgment that undue 
hardship would result if a license extension were required.
    (c) Reshipment of undelivered items. If the consignee does not 
receive an export made under a license because the carrier failed to 
deliver it, the exporter may reship the same or an identical item, 
subject to the same limitations as to quantity and value as described on 
the license, to the same consignee and destination under the same 
license. If an item is to be reshipped to any person other than the 
original consignee, the shipment is considered a new export and requires 
a new license. Before reshipping, satisfactory evidence of the original 
export and of the delivery failure, together with a satisfactory 
explanation of the delivery failure, must be submitted by the exporter 
to the following address: Operations Division, Bureau of Export 
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 2705, 14th Street & 
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

[65 FR 42572, July 10, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 758.5  Conformity of documents and unloading of items.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prevent items 
licensed for export from being diverted while in transit or thereafter. 
It also sets forth the duties of the parties when the items are unloaded 
in a country other than that of the ultimate consignee as stated on the 
export license.
    (b) Conformity of documents. When a license is issued by BXA, the 
information entered on related export control documents (e.g., the SED 
or AES record, bill of lading or air waybill) must be consistent with 
the license.
    (c) Issuance of the bill of lading or air waybill. (1) Ports in the 
country of the ultimate consignee. No person may issue a bill of lading 
or air waybill that provides for delivery of licensed items to any 
foreign port located outside the country of the intermediate or the 
ultimate consignee named on the BXA license and Shipper's Export 
Declaration (SED) or AES electronic equivalent.
    (2) Optional ports of unloading. (i) Licensed items. No person may 
issue a bill of lading or air waybill that provides for delivery of 
licensed items to optional ports of unloading unless all the optional 
ports are within the country of ultimate destination or are included on 
the BXA license and SED or AES electronic equivalent.
    (ii) Unlicensed items. For shipments of items that do not require a 
license, the exporter may designate optional ports of unloading on the 
SED or AES electronic equivalent and other export control documents, so 
long as the optional ports are in countries to which the items could 
also have been exported without a license. See also 15 CFR 30.7(h) of 
the FTSR.
    (d) Delivery of items. No person may deliver items to any country 
other than the country of the intermediate or ultimate consignee named 
on the BXA license and SED or AES record without prior written 
authorization from BXA, except for reasons beyond the control of the 
carrier (such as acts of God, perils of the sea, damage to the carrier, 
strikes, war, political disturbances or insurrection).
    (e) Procedures for unscheduled unloading. (1) Unloading in country 
where no license is required. When items are unloaded in a country to 
which the items could be exported without a license issued by BXA, no 
notification to BXA is required. However, any persons disposing of the 
items must continue to comply with the terms and conditions of any 
License Exception, and with any other relevant provisions of the EAR.
    (2) Unloading in a country where a license is required. (i) When 
items are unloaded in a country to which the items would require a BXA 
license, no person

[[Page 441]]

may effect delivery or entry of the items into the commerce of the 
country where unloaded without prior written approval from BXA. The 
carrier, in ensuring that the items do not enter the commerce of the 
country, may have to place the items in custody, or under bond or other 
guaranty. In addition, the carrier must inform the exporter and BXA of 
the unscheduled unloading in a time frame that will enable the exporter 
to submit its report within 10 days from the date of unscheduled 
unloading. The exporter must within 10 days of the unscheduled unloading 
report the facts to and request authorization for disposition from BXA 
using either: mail, fax, or E-mail. The report to BXA must include:
    (A) A copy of the manifest of the diverted cargo;
    (B) Identification of the place of unloading;
    (C) Statement that explains why the unloading was necessary; and
    (D) A proposal for disposition of the items and a request for 
authorization for such disposition from BXA.
    (ii) Contact information. U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of 
Export Administration, Office of Exporter Services, Room 1093, 14th and 
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230; phone number 202-482-
0436; facsimile number 202-482-3322; and E-Mail address:

<R05>
Sec. 758.6  Destination control statement.

    The Destination Control Statement (DCS) must be entered on the 
invoice and on the bill of lading, air waybill, or other export control 
document that accompanies the shipment from its point of origin in the 
United States to the ultimate consignee or end-user abroad. The person 
responsible for preparation of those documents is responsible for entry 
of the DCS. The DCS is required for all exports from the United States 
of items on the Commerce Control List that are not classified as EAR99, 
unless the export may be made under License Exception BAG or GFT (see 
part 740 of the EAR). At a minimum, the DCS must state: ``These 
commodities, technology or software were exported from the United States 
in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations. Diversion 
contrary to U.S. law is prohibited.''

<R05>
Sec. 758.7  Authority of the Office of Export Enforcement, the Bureau of Export Administration, Customs offices and Postmasters in clearing shipments

    (a) Actions to assure compliance with the EAR. Officials of BXA, the 
Office of Export Enforcement, the U.S. Customs Service and postmasters, 
including post office officials, are authorized and directed to take 
appropriate action to assure compliance with the EAR. This includes 
assuring that:
    (1) Exports without a license issued by BXA are either outside the 
scope of the license requirements of the Export Administration 
Regulations or authorized by a License Exception; and
    (2) Exports purporting to be authorized by licenses issued by BXA 
are, in fact, so authorized and the transaction complies with the terms 
of the license.
    (b) Types of actions. The officials designated in paragraph (a) of 
this section are authorized to take the following types of actions:
    (1) Inspection of items--(i) Purpose of inspection. All items 
declared for export are subject to inspection for the purpose of 
verifying the items specified in the SED, or if there is no SED, the 
bill of lading or other loading document covering the items about to be 
exported, and the value and quantity thereof, and to assure observance 
of the other provisions of the Export Administration Regulations. This 
authority applies to all exports within the scope of the Export 
Administration Act or Export Administration Regulations whether or not 
such exports require a license issued by BXA. The inspection may 
include, but is not limited to, item identification, technical appraisal 
(analysis), or both.
    (ii) Place of inspection. Inspection shall be made at the place of 
lading or where officials authorized to make those inspections are 
stationed for that purpose.
    (iii) Technical identification. Where, in the judgment of the 
official making the inspection, the item cannot be properly identified, 
a sample may be

[[Page 442]]

taken for more detailed examination or for laboratory analysis.
    (A) Obtaining samples. The sample will be obtained by the official 
making the inspection in accordance with the provisions for sampling 
imported merchandise. The size of the sample will be the minimum 
representative amount necessary for identification or analysis. This 
will depend on such factors as the physical condition of the material 
(whether solid, liquid, or gas) and the size and shape of the container.
    (B) Notification to exporter and consignee. When a sample is taken, 
the exporter (or the exporter's agent) and the ultimate consignee will 
be notified by letter from one of the official designated in paragraph 
(a) of this section, showing the port of export, date of sampling, 
export license number (if any) or other authorization, invoice number 
quantity of sample taken, description of item, marks and packing case 
numbers, and manufacturer's number for the item. The original letter 
will be sent to the exporter or the exporter's agent, the duplicate will 
be placed in the container that had been opened, and the triplicate will 
be retained by the inspecting office.
    (C) Disposal of samples. Samples will be disposed of in accordance 
with the U.S. Customs Service procedure for imported commodities.
    (2) Inspection of documents--(i) General. Officials designated in 
paragraph (a) of this section are authorized to require exporters or 
their agents, and owners and operators of exporting carriers or their 
agents, to produce for inspection or copying: invoices, orders, letters 
of credit, inspection reports, packing lists, shipping documents and 
instructions, correspondence, and any other relevant documents, as well 
as furnish other information bearing upon a particular shipment being 
exported or intended to be exported.
    (ii) Cartridge and shell case scrap. When cartridge or shell cases 
are being exported as scrap (whether or not they have been heated, 
flame-treated, mangled, crushed, or cut) from the United States, the 
U.S. Customs Service is authorized to require the exporter to furnish 
information bearing on the identity and relationships of all parties to 
the transaction and produce a copy of the bid offer by the armed 
services in order to assure that the terms of the Export Administration 
Regulations are being met and that the material being shipped is scrap.
    (3) Questioning of individuals. Officials designated in paragraph 
(a) of this section are authorized to question the owner or operator of 
an exporting carrier and the carrier's agent(s), as well as the exporter 
and the exporter's agent(s), concerning a particular shipment exported 
or intended to be exported.
    (4) Prohibiting lading. Officials designated in paragraph (a) of 
this section are authorized to prevent the lading of items on an 
exporting carrier whenever those officials have reasonable cause to 
believe that the export or removal from the United States is contrary to 
the Export Administration Regulations.
    (5) Inspection of exporting carrier. The U.S. Customs Service is 
authorized to inspect and search any exporting carrier at any time to 
determine whether items are intended to be, or are being, exported or 
removed from the United States contrary to the Export Administration 
Regulations. Officials of the Office of Export Enforcement may conduct 
such inspections with the concurrence of the U.S. Customs Service.
    (6) Seizure and detention. Customs officers are authorized, under 
Title 22 of the United States Code, section 401, et seq., to seize and 
detain any items whenever an attempt is made to export such items in 
violation of the Export Administration Regulations, or whenever they 
know or have probable cause to believe that the items are intended to 
be, are being, or have been exported in violation of the EAR. Seized 
items are subject to forfeiture. In addition to the authority of Customs 
officers to seize and detain items, both Customs officials and officials 
of the Office of Export Enforcement are authorized to detain any 
shipment held for review of the SED, or if there is no SED, the bill of 
lading or other loading document covering the items about to be 
exported, or for physical inspection of the items, whenever such action 
is deemed to be necessary to assure compliance with the EAR.

[[Page 443]]

    (7) Preventing departure of carrier. The U.S. Customs Service is 
authorized under Title 22 of the U. S. Code, section 401, et seq., to 
seize and detain, either before or after clearance, any vessel or 
vehicle or air carrier that has been or is being used in exporting or 
attempting to export any item intended to be, being, or having been 
exported in violation of the EAR.
    (8) ordering the unloading. The U.S. Customs Service is authorized 
to unload, or to order the unloading of, items from any exporting 
carrier, whenever the U.S. Customs Service has reasonable cause to 
believe such items are intended to be, or are being, exported or removed 
from the United States contrary to the EAR.
    (9) ordering the return of items. If, after notice that an 
inspection of a shipment is to be made, a carrier departs without 
affording the U.S. Customs Service, Office of Export Enforcement, or BXA 
personnel an adequate opportunity to examine the shipment, the owner or 
operator of the exporting carrier and the exporting carrier's agent(s) 
may be ordered to return items exported on such exporting carrier and 
make them available for inspection.
    (10) Designating time and place for clearance. The U.S. Customs 
Service is authorized to designate times and places at which U.S. 
exports may move by land transportation to countries contiguous to the 
United States.

<R05>
Sec. 758.8  Return or unloading of cargo at direction of BXA, the Office of Export Enforcement or Customs Service.

    (a) Exporting carrier. As used in this section, the term ``exporting 
carrier'' includes a connecting or on-forwarding carrier, as well as the 
owner, charterer, agent, master, or any other person in charge of the 
vessel, aircraft, or other kind of carrier, whether such person is 
located in the United States or in a foreign country.
    (b) ordering return or unloading of shipment. Where there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of the Export 
Administration Regulations has occurred, or will occur, with respect to 
a particular export from the United States, BXA, the Office of Export 
Enforcement, or the U.S. Customs Service may order any person in 
possession or control of such shipment, including the exporting carrier, 
to return or unload the shipment. Such person must, as ordered, either:
    (1) Return the shipment to the United States or cause it to be 
returned or;
    (2) Unload the shipment at a port of call and take steps to assure 
that it is placed in custody under bond or other guaranty not to enter 
the commerce of any foreign country without prior approval of BXA. For 
the purpose of this section, the furnishing of a copy of the order to 
any person included within the definition of exporting carrier will be 
sufficient notice of the order to the exporting carrier.
    (c) Requirements regarding shipment to be unloaded. The provisions 
of Sec. 758.5(b) and (c) of this part, relating to reporting, 
notification to BXA, and the prohibition against unauthorized delivery 
or entry of the item into a foreign country, shall apply also when items 
are unloaded at a port of call, as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (d) Notification. Upon discovery by any person included within the 
term ``exporting carrier,'' as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, 
that a violation of the EAR has occurred or will occur with respect to a 
shipment on board, or otherwise in the possession or control of the 
carrier, such person must immediately notify both:
    (1) The Office of Export Enforcement at the following address: Room 
H-4520, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Ave., 
N.W., Washington D.C. 20230, Telephone: (202) 482 1208, Facsimile: (202) 
482-0964; and
    (2) The person in actual possession or control of the shipment.


<R05>
Sec. 758.9  Other applicable laws and regulations.

    The provisions of this part 758 apply only to exports regulated by 
BXA. Nothing contained in this part 758 shall relieve any person from 
complying with any other law of the United States or rules and 
regulations issued thereunder, including those governing SEDs and 
manifests, or any applicable

Sec. 760.1  Definitions.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Definition of Person. For purposes of this part, the term person 
means any individual, or any association or organization, public or 
private, which is organized, permanently established, resident, or 
registered to do business, in the United States or any foreign country. 
This definition of person includes both the singular and plural and, in 
addition, includes:
    (1) Any partnership, corporation, company, branch, or other form of 
association or organization, whether organized for profit or non-profit 
purposes;
    (2) Any government, or any department, agency, or commission of any 
government;
    (3) Any trade association, chamber of commerce, or labor union;
    (4) Any charitable or fraternal organization; and
    (5) Any other association or organization not specifically listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (b) Definition of ``United States Person''. (1) This part applies to 
United States persons. For purposes of this part, the term United States 
person means any person who is a United States resident or national, 
including individuals, domestic concerns, and ``controlled in fact'' 
foreign subsidiaries, affiliates, or other permanent foreign 
establishments of domestic concerns. This definition of United States 
person includes both the singular and plural and, in addition, includes:
    (i) The government of the United States or any department, agency, 
or commission thereof;
    (ii) The government of any State of the United States, the District 
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any subdivision, department, agency, 
or commission of any such government;
    (iii) Any partnership, corporation, company, association, or other 
entity organized under the laws of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section;
    (iv) Any foreign concern's subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, 
branch, office, or other permanent establishment in any state of the 
United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States; and
    (v) Any domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership, 
affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment 
which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern. (See paragraph (c) 
of this section on ``Definition of 'Controlled in Fact'.'')

[[Page 445]]

    (2) The term domestic concern means any partnership, corporation, 
company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws 
of, any jurisdiction named in paragraph (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of this 
section, or any permanent domestic establishment of a foreign concern.
    (3) The term foreign concern means any partnership, corporation, 
company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws 
of, any jurisdiction other than those named in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or 
(ii) of this section.
    (4) The term United States person does not include an individual 
United States national who is resident outside the United States and who 
is either employed permanently or temporarily by a non-United States 
person or assigned to work as an employee for, and under the direction 
and control of, a non-United States person.

                  Examples of ``United States Person''

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
whether a person is a ``United States person.'' They are illustrative, 
not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. bank A has a branch office in foreign country P. Such 
branch office is a United States person, because it is a permanent 
foreign establishment of a domestic concern.
    (ii) Ten foreign nationals establish a manufacturing plant, A, in 
the United States, incorporating the plant under New York law.
    A is a United States person, because it is a corporation organized 
under the laws of one of the states of the United States.
    (iii) A, a foreign corporation, opens an office in the United States 
for purposes of soliciting U.S. orders. The office is not separately 
incorporated.
    A's U.S. office is a United States person, because it is a permanent 
establishment, in the United States, of a foreign concern.
    (iv) A, a U.S. individual, owns stock in foreign corporation B.
    A is a United States person. However, A is not a ``domestic 
concern,'' because the term ``domestic concern'' does not include 
individuals.
    (v) A, a foreign national resident in the United States, is employed 
by B, a foreign corporation.
    A is a United States person, because he is resident in the United 
States.
    (vi) A, a foreign national, who is resident in a foreign country and 
is employed by a foreign corporation, makes occasional visits to the 
United States, for purposes of exploring business opportunities.
    A is not a United States person, because he is not a United States 
resident or national.
    (vii) A is an association of U.S. firms organized under the laws of 
Pennsylvania for the purpose of expanding trade.
    A is a United States person, because it is an association organized 
under the laws of one of the states of the United States.
    (viii) At the request of country Y, A, an individual employed by 
U.S. company B, is transferred to company C as an employee. C is a 
foreign company owned and controlled by country Y. A, a U.S. national 
who will reside in Y, has agreed to the transfer provided he is able to 
retain his insurance, pension, and other benefits. Accordingly, company 
B has agreed to keep A as an employee in order to protect his employee 
benefits, and company C has agreed to pay for A's salary. At all times 
while he works for C, A will be under C's direction and control.
    A is not a United States person while under C's direction and 
control, because he will be resident outside the United States and 
assigned as an employee to a non-United States person. The arrangement 
designed to protect A's insurance, pension, and other benefits does not 
destroy his status as an employee of C so long as he is under the 
direction and control of C.
    (ix) A, a U.S. citizen, has resided in Europe for three years, where 
he is a self-employed consultant for United States and foreign companies 
in the communications industry.
    A is a United States person, because he is a U.S. national and 
because he is not a resident outside the United States who is employed 
by other than a United States person.

    (c) Definition of ``Controlled in Fact''. (1) This part applies to 
any domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, 
branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is 
controlled in fact by such domestic concern. Control in fact consists of 
the authority or ability of a domestic concern to establish the general 
policies or to control day-to-day operations of its foreign subsidiary, 
partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign 
establishment.
    (2) A foreign subsidiary or affiliate of a domestic concern will be 
presumed to be controlled in fact by that domestic concern, subject to 
rebuttal by competent evidence, when:
    (i) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whether 
directly or indirectly) more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting 
securities of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate;

[[Page 446]]

    (ii) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whether 
directly or indirectly) 25 percent or more of the voting securities of 
the foreign subsidiary or affiliate, if no other person owns or controls 
(whether directly or indirectly) an equal or larger percentage;
    (iii) The foreign subsidiary or affiliate is operated by the 
domestic concern pursuant to the provisions of an exclusive management 
contract;
    (iv) A majority of the members of the board of directors of the 
foreign subsidiary or affiliate are also members of the comparable 
governing body of the domestic concern;
    (v) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the majority of 
the members of the board of directors of the foreign subsidiary or 
affiliate; or
    (vi) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the chief 
operating officer of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate.
    (3) A brokerage firm or other person which holds simple record 
ownership of securities for the convenience of clients will not be 
deemed to control the securities.
    (4) A domestic concern which owns, directly or indirectly, 
securities that are immediately convertible at the option of the holder 
or owner into voting securities is presumed to own or control those 
voting securities.
    (5) A domestic concern's foreign branch office or other 
unincorporated permanent foreign establishment is deemed to be 
controlled in fact by such domestic concern under all circumstances.

                   Examples of ``Controlled in Fact''

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which a foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other 
permanent foreign establishment of a domestic concern is ``controlled in 
fact.'' They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Fifty-one 
percent of the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (ii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Ten percent of 
the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B. A has an exclusive 
management contract with B pursuant to which A is operated by B.
    As long as such contract is in effect, A is presumed to be 
controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be rebutted by competent 
evidence showing that control does not, in fact, lie with B.
    (iii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Ten percent of 
the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B. A has 10 persons on 
its board of directors. Six of those persons are also members of the 
board of directors of U.S. company B.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (iv) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Thirty percent 
of the voting securities of A is owned by U.S. company B and no other 
person owns or controls an equal or larger share.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (v) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. In A's articles 
of incorporation, U.S. company B has been given authority to appoint A's 
board of directors.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (vi) Company A is a joint venture established in a foreign country, 
with equal participation by U.S. company B and foreign company C. U.S. 
Company B has authority to appoint A's chief operating officer.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that B has no authority to appoint A's 
chief operating officer.
    B is not presumed to control A, absent other facts giving rise to a 
presumption of control.
    (viii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. U.S. 
companies B, C, and D each own 20 percent of A's voting securities and 
regularly cast their votes in concert.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B, C, and D, because these 
companies are acting in concert to control A.
    (ix) U.S. bank B located in the United States has a branch office, 
A, in a foreign country. A is not separately incorporated.
    A is deemed to be controlled in fact by B, because A is a branch 
office of a domestic concern.
    (x) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Fifty-one 
percent of the voting stock of A is owned by company B, which is 
incorporated in another foreign country.

[[Page 447]]

Fifty-one percent of the voting stock of B is owned by C, a U.S. 
company.
    Both A and B are presumed to be controlled in fact by C. The 
presumption of C's control over B may be rebutted by competent evidence 
showing that control over B does not, in fact, lie with C. The 
presumption of B's control over A (and thus C's control over A) may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control over A does not, in 
fact, lie with B.
    (xi) B, a U.S. individual, owns 51 percent of the voting securities 
of A, a manufacturing company incorporated and located in a foreign 
country.
    A is not ``controlled in fact'' under this part, because it is not 
controlled by a ``domestic concern.''

    (d) Definition of ``Activities in the Interstate or Foreign Commerce 
of the United States''.

 Activities Involving United States Persons Located in the United States

    (1) For purposes of this part, the activities of a United States 
person located in the United States are in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States if they involve the sale, purchase, or 
transfer of goods or services (including information) between:
    (i) Two or more of the several States (including the District of 
Columbia);
    (ii) Any State (including the District of Columbia) and any 
territory or possession of the United States;
    (iii) Two or more of the territories or possessions of the United 
States; or
    (iv) A State (including the District of Columbia), territory or 
possession of the United States and any foreign country.
    (2) For purposes of this part, the export of goods or services from 
the United States and the import of goods or services into the United 
States are activities in United States commerce. In addition, the action 
of a domestic concern in specifically directing the activities of its 
controlled in fact foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent 
foreign establishment is an activity in United States commerce.
    (3) Activities of a United States person located in the United 
States may be in United States commerce even if they are part of or 
ancillary to activities outside United States commerce. However, the 
fact that an ancillary activity is in United States commerce does not, 
in and of itself, mean that the underlying or related activity is in 
United States commerce.
    (4) Hence, the action of a United States bank located in the United 
States in providing financing from the United States for a foreign 
transaction that is not in United States commerce is nonetheless itself 
in United States commerce. However, the fact that the financing is in 
United States commerce does not, in and of itself, make the underlying 
foreign transaction an activity in United States commerce, even if the 
underlying transaction involves a foreign company that is a United 
States person within the meaning of this part.
    (5) Similarly, the action of a United States person located in the 
United States in providing financial, accounting, legal, t 
ransportation, or other ancillary services to its controlled in fact 
foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment 
in connection with a foreign transaction is in United States commerce. 
But the provision of such ancillary services will not, in and of itself, 
bring the foreign transaction of such subsidiary, affiliate, or 
permanent foreign establishment into United States commerce.

 Activities of Controlled in Fact Foreign Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and 
                 Other Permanent Foreign Establishments

    (6) Any transaction between a controlled in fact foreign subsidiary, 
affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment of a domestic 
concern and a person located in the United States is an activity in 
United States commerce.
    (7) Whether a transaction between such a foreign subsidiary, 
affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment and a person located 
outside the United States is an activity in United States commerce is 
governed by the following rules.

                  Activities in United States Commerce

    (8) A transaction between a domestic concern's controlled in fact 
foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment 
and a person outside the United States, involving goods or services 
(including information but not including ancillary

[[Page 448]]

services) acquired from a person in the United States is in United 
States commerce under any of the following circumstances--
    (i) If the goods or services were acquired for the purpose of 
filling an order from a person outside the United States;
    (ii) If the goods or services were acquired for incorporation into, 
refining into, reprocessing into, or manufacture of another product for 
the purpose of filling an order from a person outside the United States;
    (iii) If the goods or services were acquired for the purpose of 
fulfilling or engaging in any other transaction with a person outside 
the United States; or
    (iv) If the goods were acquired and are ultimately used, without 
substantial alteration or modification, in filling an order from, or 
fulfilling or engaging in any other transaction with, a person outside 
the United States (whether or not the goods were originally acquired for 
that purpose). If the goods are indistinguishable as to origin from 
similar foreign-trade goods with which they have been mingled in a 
stockpile or inventory, the subsequent transaction involving the goods 
is presumed to be in United States commerce unless, at the time of 
filling the order, the foreign-origin inventory on hand was sufficient 
to fill the order.
    (9) For purposes of this section, goods or services are considered 
to be acquired for the purpose of filling an order from or engaging in 
any other transaction with a person outside the United States where:
    (i) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or 
other permanent foreign establishment upon the receipt of an order from 
or on behalf of a customer with the intention that the goods or services 
are to go to the customer;
    (ii) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or 
other permanent foreign establishment to meet the needs of specified 
customers pursuant to understandings with those customers, although not 
for immediate delivery; or
    (iii) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or 
other permanent foreign establishment based on the anticipated needs of 
specified customers.
    (10) If any non-ancillary part of a transaction between a domestic 
concern's controlled foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent 
foreign establishment and a person outside the United States is in 
United States commerce, the entire transaction is in United States 
commerce. For example, if such a foreign subsidiary is engaged in 
filling an order from a non-United States customer both with goods 
acquired from the United States and with goods acquired elsewhere, the 
entire transaction with that customer is in United States commerce.

                Activities Outside United States Commerce

    (11) A transaction between a domestic concern's controlled foreign 
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment and a 
person outside the United States, not involving the purchase, sale, or 
transfer of goods or services (including information) to or from a 
person in the United States, is not an activity in United States 
commerce.
    (12) The activities of a domestic concern's controlled foreign 
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment with 
respect to goods acquired from a person in the United States are not in 
United States commerce where:
    (i) They were acquired without reference to a specific order from or 
transaction with a person outside the United States; and
    (ii) They were further manufactured, incorporated into, refined 
into, or reprocessed into another product.
    (13) The activities of a domestic concern's controlled foreign 
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment with 
respect to services acquired from a person in the United States are not 
in United States commerce where:
    (i) They were acquired without reference to a specific order from or 
transaction with a person outside the United States; or
    (ii) They are ancillary to the transaction with the person outside 
the United States.

[[Page 449]]

    (14) For purposes of this section, services are ancillary services 
if they are provided to a controlled foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or 
other permanent foreign establishment primarily for its own use rather 
than for the use of a third person. These typically include financial, 
accounting, legal,transportation, and other services, whether provided 
by a domestic concern or an unrelated entity.
    (15) Thus, the provision of the project financing by a United States 
bank located in the United States to a controlled foreign subsidiary 
unrelated to the bank is an ancillary service which will not cause the 
underlying transaction to be in United States commerce. By contrast, 
where a domestic concern, on behalf of its controlled foreign 
subsidiary, gives a guaranty of performance to a foreign country 
customer, that is a service provided to the customer and, as such, 
brings that subsidiary's transaction with the customer into United 
States commerce. Similarly, architectural or engineering services 
provided by a domestic concern in connection with its controlled foreign 
subsidiary's construction project in a third country are services passed 
through to the subsidiary's customer and, as such, bring that 
subsidiary's foreign transaction into United States commerce.

                                 General

    (16) Regardless of whether the subsequent disposition of goods or 
services from the United States is in United States commerce, the 
original acquisition of goods or services from a person in the United 
States is an activity in United States commerce subject to this part. 
Thus, if a domestic concern's controlled foreign subsidiary engages in a 
prohibited refusal to do business in stocking its inventory with goods 
from the United States, that action is subject to this part whether or 
not subsequent sales from that inventory are.
    (17) In all the above, goods and services will be considered to have 
been acquired from a person in the United States whether they were 
acquired directly or indirectly through a third party, where the person 
acquiring the goods or services knows or expects, at the time he places 
the order, that they will be delivered from the United States.

                            Letters of Credit

    (18) Implementation of a letter of credit in the United States by a 
United States person located in the United States, including a permanent 
United States establishment of a foreign concern, is an activity in 
United States commerce.
    (19) Implementation of a letter of credit outside the United States 
by a United States person located outside the United States is in United 
States commerce where the letter of credit (a) specifies a United States 
address for the beneficiary, (b) calls for documents indicating shipment 
from the United States, or (c) calls for documents indicating that the 
goods are of United States origin.
    (20) See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part on ``Letters of Credit'' to 
determine the circumstances in which paying, honoring, confirming, or 
otherwise implementing a letter of credit is covered by this part.

  Examples of Activities in the Interstate or Foreign Commerce of the 
                              United States

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which an activity is in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

            United States Person Located in the United States

    (i) U.S. company A exports goods from the United States to a foreign 
country. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, because A is exporting goods 
from the United States.
    (ii) U.S. company A imports goods into the United States from a 
foreign country. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, because A is 
importing goods into the United States.
    (iii) U.S. engineering company A supplies consulting services to its 
controlled foreign subsidiary, B. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, 
because A is exporting services from the United States.
    (iv) U.S. company A supplies consulting services to foreign company 
B. B is unrelated to A or any other U.S. person.
    A's activity is in U.S. commerce even though B, a foreign-owned 
company located outside the United States, is not subject to this part, 
because A is exporting services from the United States.

[[Page 450]]

    (v) Same as (iv), except A is a bank located in the United States 
and provides a construction loan to B.
    A's activity is in U.S. commerce even though B is not subject to 
this part, because A is exporting financial services from the United 
States.
    (vi) U.S. company A issues policy directives from time to time to 
its controlled foreign subsidiary, B, governing the conduct of B's 
activities with boycotting countries.
    A's activity in directing the activities of its foreign subsidiary, 
B, is an activity in U.S. commerce.

     Foreign Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and Other Permanent Foreign 
                   Establishments of Domestic Concerns

    (i) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, purchases 
goods from the United States.
    A's purchase of goods from the United States is in U.S. commerce, 
because A is importing goods from the United States. Whether A's 
subsequent disposition of these goods is in U.S. commerce is irrelevant. 
Similarly, the fact that A purchased goods from the United States does 
not, in and of itself, make any subsequent disposition of those goods an 
activity in U.S. commerce.
    (ii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, receives 
an order from boycotting country Y for construction materials. A places 
an order with U.S. company B for the materials.
    A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, because the 
materials are purchased from the United States for the purpose of 
filling the order from Y.
    (iii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, receives 
an order from boycotting country Y for construction materials. A places 
an order with U.S. company B for some of the materials, and with U.S. 
company C, an unrelated company, for the rest of the materials.
    A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, because the 
materials are purchased from the United States for the purpose of 
filling the order from Y. It makes no difference whether the materials 
are ordered from B or C.
    (iv) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is in the 
wholesale and retail appliance sales business. A purchases finished air 
conditioning units from the United States from time to time in order to 
stock its inventory. A's inventory is also stocked with air conditioning 
units purchased outside the United States. A receives an order for air 
conditioning units from Y, a boycotting country. The order is filled 
with U.S.-origin units in A's inventory.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because its U.S.-origin 
goods are resold without substantial alteration.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that A is in the chemicals distribution 
business. Its U.S.-origin goods are mingled in inventory with foreign-
origin goods.
    A's sale to Y of unaltered goods from its general inventory is 
presumed to be in U.S. commerce unless A can show that at the time of 
the sale the foreign-origin inventory on hand was sufficient to cover 
the shipment to Y.
    (vi) A, a foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, receives an order 
from boycotting country Y for computers. A places an order with U.S. 
company B for some of the components; with U.S. company C, an unrelated 
company, for other components; and with foreign company D for the rest 
of the components. A then assembles the computers and ships them to Y.
    A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, because some 
of the components are acquired from the United States for purposes of 
filling an order from Y.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except A purchases all the components from non-
U.S.sources.
    A's transaction with Y is not an activity in U.S. commerce, because 
it involves no export of goods from the United States. It makes no 
difference whether the technology A uses to manufacture computers was 
originally acquired from its U.S. parent.
    (viii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, 
manufactures computers. A stocks its general components and parts 
inventory with purchases made at times from the United States and at 
times from foreign sources. A receives an order from Y, a boycotting 
country, for computers. A fills that order by manufacturing the 
computers using materials from its general inventory.
    A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce, because the U.S.-
origin components are not acquired for the purpose of meeting the 
anticipated needs of specified customers in Y. It is irrelevant that A's 
operations may be based on U.S.-origin technology.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that in anticipation of the order from 
Y, A orders and receives the necessary materials from the United States.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because the U.S.-origin 
goods were acquired for the purpose of filling an anticipated order from 
Y.
    (x) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, 
manufactures typewriters. It buys typewriter components both from the 
United States and from foreign sources. A sells its output in various 
places throughout the world, including boycotting country Y. Its sales 
to Y vary from year to year, but have averaged approximately 20 percent 
of sales for the past five years. A expects that its sales to Y will 
remain at approximately that level in the years ahead although it has no 
contracts or orders from Y on hand.

[[Page 451]]

    A's sales of typewriters to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the 
U.S. components are not acquired for the purpose of filling an order 
from Y. A general expectancy of future sales is not an ``order'' within 
the meaning of this section.
    (xi) U.S. company A's corporate counsel provides legal advice to B, 
its controlled foreign subsidiary, on the applicability of this Part to 
B's transactions.
    While provision of this legal advice is itself an activity in U.S. 
commerce, it does not, in and of itself, bring B's activities into U.S. 
commerce.
    (xii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is in 
the general construction business. A enters into a contract with 
boycotting country Y to construct a power plant in Y. In preparing 
engineering drawings and specifications, A uses the advice and 
assistance of B.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's services are 
used for purposes of fulfilling the contract with Y. B's services are 
not ancillary services, because the engineering services in connection 
with construction of the power plant are part of the services ultimately 
provided to Y by A.
    (xiii) Same as (xii), except that A gets no engineering advice or 
assistance from B. However, B's corporate counsel provides legal advice 
to A regarding the structure of the transaction. In addition, B's 
corporate counsel draws up the contract documents.
    A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce. The legal services 
provided to A are ancillary services, because they are not part of the 
services provided to Y by A in fulfillment of its contract with Y.
    (xiv) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, enters 
into a contract to construct an apartment complex in boycotting country 
Y. A will fulfill its contract completely with goods and services from 
outside the United States. Pursuant to a provision in the contract, B 
guarantees A's performance of the contract.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's guaranty of 
A's performance involves the acquisition of services from the United 
States for purposes of fulfilling the transaction with Y, and those 
services are part of the services ultimately provided to Y.
    (xv) Same as (xiv), except that the guaranty of A's performance is 
supplied by C, a non-U.S. person located outside the United States. 
However, unrelated to any particular transaction, B from time to time 
provides general financial, legal, and technical services to A.
    A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce, because the services 
acquired from the United States are not acquired for purposes of 
fulfilling the contract with Y.
    (xvi) A, a foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, has a contract with 
boycotting country Y to conduct oil drilling operations in that country. 
In conducting these operations, A from time to time seeks certain 
technical advice from B regarding the operation of the drilling rigs.
    A's contract with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's services are 
sought for purposes of fulfilling the contract with Y and are part of 
the services ultimately provided to Y.
    (xvii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, enters 
into a contract to sell typewriters to boycotting country Y. A is 
located in non-boycotting country P. None of the components are acquired 
from the United States. A engages C, a U.S. shipping company, to 
transport the typewriters from P to Y.
    A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because in carrying A's 
goods, C is providing an ancillary service to A and not a service to Y.
    (xviii) Same as (xvii), except that A's contract with Y calls for 
title to pass to Y in P. In addition, the contract calls for A to engage 
a carrier to make delivery to Y.
    A's sales to Y are in U.S. commerce, because in carrying Y's goods, 
C is providing a service to A which is ultimately provided to Y.
    (xix) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, has 
general product liability insurance with U.S. company C. Foreign-origin 
goods sold from time to time by A to boycotting country Y are covered by 
the insurance policy.
    A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the insurance 
provided by C is an ancillary service provided to A which is not 
ultimately provided to Y.
    (xx) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, 
manufactures automobiles abroad under a license agreement with B. From 
time to time, A sells such goods to boycotting country Y.
    A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the rights conveyed 
by the license are not acquired for the specific purpose of engaging in 
transactions with Y.

    (e) ``Intent''. (1) This part prohibits a United States person from 
taking or knowingly agreeing to take certain specified actions with 
intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign 
boycott.
    (2) A United States person has the intent to comply with, further, 
or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott when such a boycott is at 
least one of the reasons for that person's decision whether to take a 
particular prohibited action. So long as that is at least one of the 
reasons for that person's action, a violation occurs regardless of 
whether the prohibited action is also taken

[[Page 452]]

for non-boycott reasons. Stated differently, the fact that such action 
was taken for legitimate business reasons does not remove that action 
from the scope of this part if compliance with an unsanctioned foreign 
boycott was also a reason for the action.
    (3) Intent is a necessary element of any violation of any of the 
prohibitions under Sec. 760.2. It is not sufficient that one take action 
that is specifically prohibited by this part. It is essential that one 
take such action with intent to comply with, further,or support an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott. Accordingly, a person who inadvertently, 
without boycott intent, takes a prohibited action, does not commit any 
violation of this part.
    (4) Intent in this context means the reason or purpose for one's 
behavior. It does not mean that one has to agree with the boycott in 
question or desire that it succeed or that it be furthered or supported. 
But it does mean that the reason why a particular prohibited action was 
taken must be established.
    (5) Reason or purpose can be proved by circumstantial evidence. For 
example, if a person receives a request to supply certain boycott 
information, the furnishing of which is prohibited by this part, and he 
knowingly supplies that information in response, he clearly intends to 
comply with that boycott request. It is irrelevant that he may disagree 
with or object to the boycott itself. Information will be deemed to be 
furnished with the requisite intent if the person furnishing the 
information knows that it was sought for boycott purposes. On the other 
hand, if a person refuses to do business with someone who happens to be 
blacklisted, but the reason is because that person produces an inferior 
product, the requisite intent does not exist.
    (6) Actions will be deemed to be taken with intent to comply with an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott if the person taking such action knew that 
such action was required or requested for boycott reasons. On the other 
hand, the mere absence of a business relationship with a blacklisted 
person or with or in a boycotted country does not indicate the existence 
of the requisite intent.
    (7) In seeking to determine whether the requisite intent exists, all 
available evidence will be examined.

                         Examples of ``Intent''

    The following examples are intended to illustrate the factors which 
will be considered in determining whether the required intent exists. 
They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. person A does business in boycotting country Y. In 
selecting firms to supply goods for shipment to Y, A chooses supplier B 
because B's products are less expensive and of higher quality than the 
comparable products of supplier C. A knows that C is blacklisted, but 
that is not a reason for A's selection of B.
    A's choice of B rather than C is not action with intent to comply 
with Y's boycott, because C's blacklist status is not a reason for A's 
action.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that A chooses B rather than C in part 
because C is blacklisted by Y.
    Since C's blacklist status is a reason for A's choice, A's action is 
taken with intent to comply with Y's boycott.
    (iii) U.S. person A bids on a tender issued by boycotting country Y. 
A inadvertently fails to notice a prohibited certification which appears 
in the tender document. A's bid is accepted.
    A's action in bidding was not taken with intent to comply with Y's 
boycott, because the boycott was not a reason for A's action.
    (iv) U.S. bank A engages in letter of credit transactions, in favor 
of U.S. beneficiaries, involving the shipments of U.S. goods to 
boycotting country Y. As A knows, such letters of credit routinely 
contain conditions requiring prohibited certifications. A fails to take 
reasonable steps to prevent the implementation of such letters of 
credit. A receives for implementation a letter of credit which in fact 
contains a prohibited condition but does not examine the letter of 
credit to determine whether it contains such a condition.
    Although Y's boycott may not be a specific reason for A's action in 
implementing the letter of credit with a prohibited condition, all 
available evidence shows that A's action was taken with intent to comply 
with the boycott, because A knows or should know that its procedures 
result in compliance with the boycott.
    (v) U.S. bank A engages in letter of credit transactions, in favor 
of U.S. beneficiaries, involving the shipment of U.S. goods to 
boycotting country Y. As A knows, the documentation accompanying such 
letters of credit sometimes contains prohibited certifications. In 
accordance with standard banking practices applicable to A, it does not 
examine such accompanying documentation. A

[[Page 453]]

receives a letter of credit in favor of a U.S. beneficiary. The letter 
of credit itself contains no prohibited conditions. However, the 
accompanying documentation, which A does not examine, does contain such 
a condition.
    All available evidence shows that A's action in implementing the 
letter of credit was not taken with intent to comply with the boycott, 
because A has no affirmative obligation to go beyond applicable standard 
banking practices in implementing letters of credit.
    (vi) A, a U.S. company, is considering opening a manufacturing 
facility in boycotted country X. A already has such a facility in 
boycotting country Y. After exploring the possibilities in X, A 
concludes that the market does not justify the move. A is aware that if 
it did open a plant in X, Y might object because of Y's boycott of X. 
However Y's possible objection is not a reason for A's decision not to 
open a plant in X.
    A's decision not to proceed with the plant in X is not action with 
intent to comply with Y's boycott, because Y's boycott of X is not a 
reason for A's decision.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that after exploring the business 
possibilities in X, A concludes that the market does justify the move to 
X. However, A does not open the plant because of Y's possible objections 
due to Y's boycott of X.
    A's decision not to proceed with the plant in X is action taken with 
intent to comply with Y's boycott, because Y's boycott is a reason for 
A's decision.
    (viii) A, a U.S. chemical manufacturer, receives a ``boycott 
questionnaire'' from boycotting country Y asking, among other things, 
whether A has any plants located in boycotted country X. A, which has 
never supported Y's boycott of X, responds to Y's questionnaire, 
indicating affirmatively that it does have plants in X and that it 
intends to continue to have plants in X.
    A's responding to Y's questionnaire is deemed to be action with 
intent to comply with Y's boycott because A knows that the questionnaire 
is boycott-related. It is irrelevant that A does not also wish to 
support Y's boycott.
    (ix) U.S. company A has a manufacturing facility in boycotted 
country X. A receives an invitation to bid on a construction project in 
boycotting country Y. The invitation states that all bidders must 
complete a boycott questionnaire and send it in with the bid. The 
questionnaire asks for information about A's business relationships with 
X. Regardless of whether A's bid is successful, A intends to continue 
its business in X undiminished and in fact is exploring and intends to 
continue exploring an expansion of its activities in X without regard to 
Y's boycott.
    A may not answer the questionnaire, because, despite A's intentions 
with regard to its business operations in X, Y's request for completion 
of the questionnaire is for boycott purposes and by responding, A's 
action would be taken with intent to comply with Y's boycott.

[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34945, June 1, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 760.2  Prohibitions.

    (a) Refusals to do business.

               Prohibition Against Refusals To Do Business

    (1) No United States person may: refuse, knowingly agree to refuse, 
require any other person to refuse, or knowingly agree to require any 
other person to refuse, to do business with or in a boycotted country, 
with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted 
country, with any national or resident of a boycotted country, or with 
any other person, when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with the 
boycotting country, or a requirement of the boycotting country, or a 
request from or on behalf of the boycotting country.
    (2) Generally, a refusal to do business under this section consists 
of action that excludes a person or country from a transaction for 
boycott reasons. This includes a situation in which a United States 
person chooses or selects one person over another on a boycott basis or 
takes action to carry out another person's boycott-based selection when 
he knows or has reason to know that the other person's selection is 
boycott-based.
    (3) Refusals to do business which are prohibited by this section 
include not only specific refusals, but also refusals implied by a 
course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a specific offer and 
refusal to constitute a refusal to do business; a refusal may occur when 
a United States person has a financial or commercial opportunity and 
declines for boycott reasons to consider or accept it.
    (4) A United States person's use of either a boycott-based list of 
persons with whom he will not deal (a so-called ``blacklist'') or a 
boycott-based list of persons with whom he will deal (a so-called 
``whitelist'') constitutes a refusal to do business.

[[Page 454]]

    (5) An agreement by a United States person to comply generally with 
the laws of the boycotting country with which it is doing business or an 
agreement that local laws of the boycotting country shall apply or 
govern is not, in and of itself, a refusal to do business. Nor, in and 
of itself, is use of a contractual clause explicitly requiring a person 
to assume the risk of loss of non-delivery of his products a refusal to 
do business with any person who will not or cannot comply with such a 
clause. (But see Sec. 760.4 of this part on ``Evasion.'')
    (6) If, for boycott reasons, a United States general manager chooses 
one supplier over another, or enters into a contract with one supplier 
over another, or advises its client to do so, then the general manager's 
actions constitute a refusal to do business under this section. However, 
it is not a refusal to do business under this section for a United 
States person to provide management, procurement, or other pre-award 
services for another person so long as the provision of such pre-award 
services is customary for that firm (or industry of which the firm is a 
part), without regard to the boycotting or non-boycotting character of 
the countries in which they are performed, and the United States person, 
in providing such services, does not act to exclude a person or country 
from the transaction for boycott reasons, or otherwise take actions that 
are boycott-based. For example, a United States person under contract to 
provide general management services in connection with a construction 
project in a boycotting country may compile lists of qualified bidders 
for the client if that service is a customary one and if persons who are 
qualified are not excluded from that list because they are blacklisted.
    (7) With respect to post-award services, if a client makes a 
boycott-based selection, actions taken by the United States general 
manager or contractor to carry out the client's choice are themselves 
refusals to do business if the United States contractor knows or has 
reason to know that the client's choice was boycott-based. (It is 
irrelevant whether the United States contractor also provided pre-award 
services.) Such actions include entering into a contract with the 
selected supplier, notifying the supplier of the client's choice, 
executing a contract on behalf of the client, arranging for inspection 
and shipment of the supplier's goods, or taking any other action to 
effect the client's choice. (But see Sec. 760.3(d) on ``Compliance with 
Unilateral Selection'' as it may apply to post-award services.)
    (8) An agreement is not a prerequisite to a violation of this 
section since the prohibition extends to actions taken pursuant not only 
to agreements but also to requirements of, and requests from or on 
behalf of, a boycotting country.
    (9) Agreements under this section may be either express or implied 
by a course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a direct request 
from a boycotting country for action by a United States person to have 
been taken pursuant to an agreement with or requirement of a boycotting 
country.
    (10) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are 
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott. The mere absence of a business 
relationship with or in the boycotted country, with any business concern 
organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with national(s) or 
resident(s) of the boycotted country, or with any other person does not 
indicate the existence of the required intent.

      Examples of Refusals and Agreements To Refuse To Do Business

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which, in a boycott situation, a refusal to do 
business or an agreement to refuse to do business is prohibited. They 
are illustrative, not comprehensive.

                         Refusals To Do Business

    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, receives an order for its products from 
boycotting country Y. To fill that order, A solicits bids from U.S. 
companies B and C, manufacturers of components used in A's products. A 
does not, however, solicit bids from U.S. companies D

[[Page 455]]

or E, which also manufacture such components, because it knows that D 
and E are restricted from doing business in Y and that their products 
are, therefore, not importable into that country.
    Company A may not refuse to solicit bids from D and E for boycott 
reasons, because to do so would constitute a refusal to do business with 
those persons.
    (ii) A, a U.S. exporter, uses company B, a U.S. insurer, to insure 
the shipment of its goods to all its overseas customers. For the first 
time, A receives an order for its products from boycotting country Y. 
Knowing that B is on the blacklist of Y, A arranges with company C, a 
non-blacklisted U.S. insurer, to insure the shipment of its goods to Y.
    A's action constitutes a refusal to do business with B.
    (iii) A, a U.S. exporter, purchases all its liability insurance from 
company B, a U.S. company that does business in boycotted country X. A 
wishes to expand its operations into country Y, the boycotting country. 
Before doing so, A decides to switch from insurer B to insurer C in 
anticipation of a request from Y that A sever its relations with B as a 
condition of doing business in Y.
    A may not switch insurers for this reason, because doing so would 
constitute a refusal to do business with B.
    (iv) U.S. company A exports goods to boycotting country Y. In 
selecting vessels to transport the goods to Y, A chooses only from among 
carriers which call at ports in Y.
    A's action is not a refusal to do business with carriers which do 
not call at ports in Y.
    (v) A, a U.S. bank with a branch office in boycotting country Y, 
sends representatives to boycotted country X to discuss plans for 
opening a branch office in X. Upon learning of these discussions, an 
official of the local boycott office in Y advises A's local branch 
manager that if A opens an office in X it will no longer be allowed to 
do business in Y. As a result of this notification, A decides to abandon 
its plans to open a branch in X.
    Bank A may not abandon its plans to open a branch in X as a result 
of Y's notification, because doing so would constitute a refusal to do 
business in boycotted country X.
    (vi) A, a U.S. company that manufactures office equipment, has been 
restricted from doing business in boycotting country Y because of its 
business dealings with boycotted country X. In an effort to have itself 
removed from Y's blacklist, A ceases its business in X.
    A's action constitutes a refusal to do business in boycotted country 
X.
    (vii) A, a U.S. computer company, does business in boycotting 
country Y. A decides to explore business opportunities in boycotted 
country X. After careful analysis of possible business opportunities in 
X, A decides, solely for business reasons, not to market its products in 
X.
    A's decision not to proceed is not a refusal to do business, because 
it is not based on boycott considerations. A has no affirmative 
obligation to do business in X.
    (viii) A, a U.S. oil company with operations in boycotting country 
Y, has regularly purchased equipment from U.S. petroleum equipment 
suppliers B, C, and D, none of whom is on the blacklist of Y. Because of 
its satisfactory relationship with B, C, and D, A has not dealt with 
other suppliers, including supplier E, who is blacklisted by Y.
    A's failure affirmatively to seek or secure business with 
blacklisted supplier E is not a refusal to do business with E.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except U.S. petroleum equipment supplier E, a 
company on boycotting country Y's blacklist, offers to supply U.S. oil 
company A with goods comparable to those provided by U.S. suppliers B, 
C, and D. A, because it has satisfactorily, established relationships 
with suppliers B, C, and D, does not accept supplier E's offer.
    A's refusal of supplier E's offer is not a refusal to do business, 
because it is based solely on non-boycott considerations. A has no 
affirmative obligation to do business with E.
    (x) A, a U.S. construction company, enters into a contract to build 
an office complex in boycotting country Y. A receives bids from B and C, 
U.S. companies that are equally qualified suppliers of electrical cable 
for the project. A knows that B is blacklisted by Y and that C is not. A 
accepts C's bid, in part because C is as qualified as the other 
potential supplier and in part because C is not blacklisted.
    A's decision to select supplier C instead of blacklisted supplier B 
is a refusal to do business, because the boycott was one of the reasons 
for A's decision.
    (xi) A, a U.S. general contractor, has been retained to construct a 
highway in boycotting country Y. A circulates an invitation to bid to 
U.S. manufacturers of road-building equipment. One of the conditions 
listed in the invitation to bid is that, in order for A to obtain prompt 
service, suppliers will be required to maintain a supply of spare parts 
and a service facility in Y. A includes this condition solely for 
commercial reasons unrelated to the boycott. Because of this condition, 
however, those suppliers on Y's blacklist do not bid, since they would 
be unable to satisfy the parts and services requirements.
    A's action is not a refusal to do business, because the contractual 
condition was included solely for legitimate business reasons and was 
not boycott-based.
    (xii) Company A, a U.S. oil company, purchases drill bits from U.S. 
suppliers for export to boycotting country Y. In its purchase orders, A 
includes a provision requiring the supplier to make delivery to A's 
facilities in Y and providing that title to the goods does

[[Page 456]]

not pass until delivery has been made. As is customary under such an 
arrangement, the supplier bears all risks of loss, including loss from 
fire, theft, perils of the sea, and inability to clear customs, until 
title passes.
    Insistence on such an arrangement does not constitute a refusal to 
do business, because this requirement is imposed on all suppliers 
whether they are blacklisted or not. (But see Sec. 760.4 on 
``Evasion''.)
    (xiii) A, a U.S. engineering and construction company, contracts 
with a government agency in boycotting country Y to perform a variety of 
services in connection with the construction of a large industrial 
facility in Y. Pursuant to this contract, A analyzes the market of 
prospective suppliers, compiles a suggested bidders list, analyzes the 
bids received, and makes recommendations to the client. The client 
independently selects and awards the contract to supplier C for boycott 
reasons. All of A's services are performed without regard to Y's 
blacklist or any other boycott considerations, and are the type of 
services A provides clients in both boycotting and non-boycotting 
countries.
    A's actions do not constitute a refusal to do business, because, in 
the provision of pre-award services, A has not excluded the other 
bidders and because A customarily provides such services to its clients.
    (xiv) Same as (xiii), except that in compiling a list of prospective 
suppliers, A deletes suppliers he knows his client will refuse to select 
because they are blacklisted. A knows that including the names of 
blacklisted suppliers will neither enhance their chances of being 
selected nor provide his client with a useful service, the function for 
which he has been retained.
    A's actions, which amount to furnishing a so-called ``whitelist'', 
constitute refusals to do business, because A's pre-award services have 
not been furnished without regard to boycott considerations.
    (xv) A, a U.S. construction firm, provides its boycotting country 
client with a permissible list of prospective suppliers, B, C, D, and E. 
The client independently selects and awards the contract to C, for 
boycott reasons, and then requests A to advise C of his selection, 
negotiate the contract with C, arrange for the shipment, and inspect the 
goods upon arrival. A knows that C was chosen by the client for boycott 
reasons.
    A's action in complying with his client's direction is a refusal to 
do business, because A's post-award actions carry out his client's 
boycott-based decision. (Note: Whether A's action comes within the 
unilateral selection exception depends upon factors discussed in 
Sec. 760.3(d) of this part).
    (xvi) Same as (xv), except that A is building the project on a 
turnkey basis and will retain title until completion. The client 
instructs A to contract only with C.
    A's action in contracting with C constitutes a refusal to do 
business, because it is action that excludes blacklisted persons from 
the transaction for boycott reasons. (Note: Whether A's action comes 
within the unilateral selection exception depends upon factors discussed 
in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part).
    (xvii) A, a U.S. exporter of machine tools, receives an order for 
drill presses from boycotting country Y. The cover letter from Y's 
procurement official states that A was selected over other U.S. 
manufacturers in part because A is not on Y's blacklist.
    A's action in filling this order is not a refusal to do business, 
because A has not excluded anyone from the transaction.
    (xviii) A, a U.S. engineering firm under contract to construct a dam 
in boycotting country Y, compiles, on a non-boycott basis, a list of 
potential heavy equipment suppliers, including information on their 
qualifications and prior experience. A then solicits bids from the top 
three firms on its list--B, C, and D--because they are the best 
qualified. None of them happens to be blacklisted. A does not solicit 
bids from E, F, or G, the next three firms on the list, one of whom is 
on Y's blacklist.
    A's decision to solicit bids from only B, C, and D, is not a refusal 
to do business with any person, because the solicited bidders were not 
selected for boycott reasons.
    (xix) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is not 
blacklisted. B meets all other conditions of the letter of credit but 
refuses to certify as to his blacklist status. A refuses to pay B on the 
letter of credit solely because B refuses to certify as to his blacklist 
status.
    A has refused to do business with another person pursuant to a 
boycott requirement or request.
    (xx) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to provide a 
certification from the steamship line that the vessel carrying the goods 
is not blacklisted. B seeks payment from A and meets all other 
conditions of the letter of credit but refuses or is unable to provide 
the certification from the steamship line about the vessel's blacklist 
status. A refuses to pay B on the letter of credit solely because B 
cannot or will not provide the certification.
    A has required another person to refuse to do business pursuant to a 
boycott requirement or request by insisting that B obtain such a 
certificate. (Either A or B may request an amendment to the letter of 
credit substituting a certificate of vessel eligibility, however. See 
Example (xxi) below).
    (xxi) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit from a bank in 
boycotting country Y in favor of U.S. beneficiary B. The letter of 
credit requires B to provide a certification

[[Page 457]]

from the steamship line that the vessel carrying the goods is eligible 
to enter the ports in Y. B seeks payment from A and meets all other 
conditions of the letter of credit. A refuses to pay B solely because B 
cannot or will not provide the certification.
    A has neither refused, nor required another person to refuse, to do 
business with another person pursuant to a boycott requirement or 
request because a request for a vessel eligibility certificate to be 
furnished by the steamship line is not a prohibited condition. (See 
Supplement No. 1 to this part, paragraph (I)(B), ``Shipping 
Certificate''.)
    (xxii) U.S. bank A confirms a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit contains a requirement that B 
certify that he is not blacklisted. B presents the letter of credit to 
U.S. bank C, a correspondent of bank A. B does not present the 
certificate of blacklist status to bank C, but, in accordance with these 
rules, bank C pays B, and then presents the letter of credit and 
documentation to bank A for reimbursement. Bank A refuses to reimburse 
bank C because the blacklist certification of B is not included in the 
documentation.
    A has required another person to refuse to do business with a person 
pursuant to a boycott requirement or request by insisting that C obtain 
the certificate from B.
    (xxiii) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is not 
blacklisted. B fails to provide such a certification when he presents 
the documents to A for payment. A notifies B that the certification has 
not been submitted.
    A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant to a 
boycott requirement by notifying B of the omitted certificate. A may not 
refuse to pay on the letter of credit, however, if B states that B will 
not provide such a certificate.
    (xxiv) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B from the issuing bank for the purpose of confirmation, 
negotiation or payment. The letter of credit requires B to certify that 
he is not blacklisted. A notifies B that it is contrary to the policy of 
A to handle letters of credit containing this condition and that, unless 
an amendment is obtained deleting this condition, A will not implement 
the letter of credit.
    A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant to a 
boycott requirement, because A has indicated its policy against 
implementing the letter of credit containing the term without regard to 
B's ability or willingness to furnish such a certificate.

                   Agreements To Refuse To Do Business

    (i) A, a U.S. construction firm, is retained by an agency of 
boycotting country Y to build a primary school. The proposed contract 
contains a clause stating that A ``may not use goods or services in the 
project that are produced or provided by any person restricted from 
having a business relationship with country Y by reason of Y's boycott 
against country X''.
    A's action in entering into such a contract would constitute an 
agreement to refuse to do business, because it is an agreement to 
exclude blacklisted persons from the transaction. A may, however, 
renegotiate this clause so that it does not contain terms prohibited by 
this part.
    (ii) A, a U.S. manufacturer of commercial refrigerators and 
freezers, receives an invitation to bid from boycotting country Y. The 
tender states that the bidder must agree not to deal with companies on 
Y's blacklist. A does not know which companies are on the blacklist; 
however, A submits a bid without taking exception to the boycott 
conditions. A's bid makes no commitment regarding not dealing with 
certain companies.
    At the point when A submits its bid without taking exception to the 
boycott request in Y's tender, A has agreed to refuse to do business 
with blacklisted persons, because the terms of Y's tender require A to 
agree to refuse to do business.
    (iii) A, a U.S. construction firm, is offered a contract to perform 
engineering and construction services in connection with a project 
located in boycotting country Y. The contract contains a clause stating 
that, in the event of a contract dispute, the laws of Y will apply.
    A may enter into the contract. Agreement that the laws of boycotting 
country Y will control in resolving a contract dispute is not an 
agreement to refuse to do business.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that the contract contains a clause that 
A and its employees will comply with the laws of boycotting country Y. A 
knows that Y has a number of boycott laws.
    Such an agreement is not, in and of itself, an agreement to refuse 
to do business. If, however, A subsequently refuses to do business with 
someone because of the laws of Y, A's action would be a refusal to do 
business.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that the contract contains a clause that A 
and its employees will comply with the laws of boycotting country Y, 
``including boycott laws.''
    A's agreeing, without qualification, to comply with local boycott 
laws constitutes an agreement to refuse to do business.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that A inserts a proviso ``except insofar 
as Y's laws conflict with U.S. laws,'' or words to that effect.
    Such an agreement is not an agreement to refuse to do business.
    (vii) A, a U.S. general contractor, is retained to construct a 
pipeline in boycotting country Y. A provision in the proposed contract 
stipulates that in purchasing equipment, supplies, and services A must 
give

[[Page 458]]

preference to companies located in host country Y.
    A may agree to this contract provision. Agreeing to a ``buy local'' 
contract provision is not an agreement to refuse to do business, because 
A's agreement is not made for boycott reasons.
    (viii) A, a U.S. exporter planning to sell retail goods to customers 
in boycotting country Y, enters into a contract to purchase goods 
wholesale from B, a U.S. appliance manufacturer. A's contract with B 
includes a provision stipulating that B may not use components or 
services of blacklisted companies in the manufacture of its appliances.
    A's contract constitutes a refusal to do business, because it would 
require another person, B, to refuse to do business with other persons 
for boycott reasons. B may not agree to such a contract, because it 
would be agreeing to refuse to do business with other persons for 
boycott reasons.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that A and B reach an implicit 
understanding that B will not use components or services of blacklisted 
companies in the manufacture of goods to be exported to Y. In the 
manufacture of appliances to be sold to A for export to non-boycotting 
countries, B uses components manufactured by blacklisted companies.
    The actions of both A and B constitute agreement to refuse to do 
business. The agreement is implied by their pattern of conduct.
    (x) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y opens a 
letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The letter of credit 
specifies that negotiation of the letter of credit with a bank that 
appears on the country X boycott blacklist is prohibited. U.S. bank A, 
C's correspondent bank, advises B of the letter of credit. B presents 
documentation to bank A seeking to be paid on the letter of credit, 
without amending or otherwise taking exception to the boycott condition.
    B has agreed to refuse to do business with blacklisted banks 
because, by presenting the letter of credit for payment, B has accepted 
all of its terms and conditions.

    (b) Discriminatory actions.

            Prohibition Against Taking Discriminatory Actions

    (1) No United States person may:
    (i) Refuse to employ or otherwise discriminate against any 
individual who is a United States person on the basis of race, religion, 
sex, or national origin;
    (ii) Discriminate against any corporation or other organization 
which is a United States person on the basis of the race, religion, sex, 
or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such 
corporation or organization;
    (iii) Knowingly agree to take any of the actions described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; or
    (iv) Require or knowingly agree to require any other person to take 
any of the actions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the discriminatory action 
is taken by a United States person on its own or in response to an 
agreement with, request from, or requirement of a boycotting country. 
This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United 
States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the 
United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent 
to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.
    (3) The section does not supersede or limit the operation of the 
civil rights laws of the United States.

                   Examples of Discriminatory Actions

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which the taking of particular discriminatory 
actions is prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. construction company A is awarded a contract to build an 
office complex in boycotting country Y. A, believing that employees of a 
particular religion will not be permitted to work in Y because of Y's 
boycott against country X, excludes U.S. persons of that religion from 
consideration for employment on the project.
    A's refusal to consider qualified U.S. persons of a particular 
religion for work on the project in Y constitutes a prohibited boycott-
based discriminatory action against U.S. persons on the basis of 
religion.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract provides that 
``no persons of country X origin are to work on this project.''
    A's agreement constitutes a prohibited boycott-based agreement to 
discriminate against U.S. persons, among others, on the basis of 
national origin.
    (iii) Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract provides 
that ``no persons who are citizens, residents, or nationals of country X 
are to work on this project.''
    A's agreement does not constitute a boycott-based agreement to 
discriminate against U.S. persons on the basis of race, religion, sex, 
or national origin, because the

[[Page 459]]

clause requires exclusion on the basis of citizenship, residency, and 
nationality only.
    (iv) U.S. construction company A enters into a contract to build a 
school in boycotting country Y. Y's representative orally tells A that 
no persons of country X origin are to work on the project.
    A may not comply, because to do so would constitute discrimination 
on the basis of national origin.
    It makes no difference that A learned of Y's requirement orally. It 
makes no difference how A learns about Y's discriminatory requirement.
    (v) Boycotting country Y tenders an invitation to bid on a 
construction project in Y. The tender requires that the successful 
bidder's personnel will be interviewed and that persons of a particular 
religious faith will not be permitted to work on the project. Y's 
requirement is based on its boycott of country X, the majority of whose 
citizens are of that particular faith.
    Agreement to this provision in the tender document by a U.S. person 
would constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-based 
discrimination against U.S. persons of a particular religion.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that the tender specifies that ``women will 
not be allowed to work on this project.''
    Agreement to this provision in the tender by a U.S. person does not 
constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-based 
discrimination, because the restriction against employment of women is 
not boycott-based. Such an agreement may, however, constitute a 
violation of U.S. civil rights laws.
    (vii) A is a U.S. investment banking firm. As a condition of 
participating in an underwriting of securities to be issued by 
boycotting country Y, A is required to exclude investment banks owned by 
persons of a particular faith from participation in the underwriting. 
Y's requirement is based on its boycott of country X, the majority of 
whose citizens are of that particular faith.
    A's agreement to such a provision constitutes a prohibited agreement 
to engage in boycott-based discrimination against U.S. persons on the 
basis of religion. Further, if A requires others to agree to such a 
condition, A would be acting to require another person to engage in such 
discrimination.
    (viii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to certify 
that A will not use a six-pointed star on the packaging of its products 
to be imported into Y. The requirement is part of the enforcement effort 
by Y of its boycott against country X.
    A may not so certify. The six-pointed star is a religious symbol, 
and the certification by A that it will not use such a symbol 
constitutes a statement that A will not ship products made or handled by 
persons of that religion.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that A is asked to certify that no 
symbol of boycotted country X will appear on the packaging of its 
products imported into Y.
    Such a certification conveys no statement about any person's 
religion and, thus, does not come within this prohibition.

    (c) Furnishing information about race, religion, sex, or national 
origin.

Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Race, Religion, Sex, or 
                             National Origin

    (1) No United States person may:
    (i) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national 
origin of any United States person;
    (ii) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national 
origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporation 
or other organization which is a United States person;
    (iii) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, 
religion, sex, or national origin of any United States person; or
    (iv) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, 
religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or 
employee of any corporation or other organization which is a United 
States person.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the information is 
specifically requested or is offered voluntarily by the United States 
person. It shall also apply whether the information requested or 
volunteered is stated in the affirmative or the negative.
    (3) Information about the place of birth of or the nationality of 
the parents of a United States person comes within this prohibition, as 
does information in the form of code words or symbols which could 
identify a United States person's race, religion, sex, or national 
origin.
    (4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are 
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott.

[[Page 460]]

     Examples of the Prohibition Against Furnishing Discriminatory 
                               Information

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which the furnishing of discriminatory information 
is prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. company A receives a boycott questionnaire from boycotting 
country Y asking whether it is owned or controlled by persons of a 
particular faith, whether it has any persons on its board of directors 
who are of that faith, and what the national origin of its president is. 
The information is sought for purposes of enforcing Y's boycott against 
country X, and A knows or has reason to know that the information is 
sought for that reason.
    A may not answer the questionnaire, because A would be furnishing 
information about the religion and national origin of U.S. persons for 
purposes of complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (ii) U.S. company A, located in the United States, is asked by 
boycotting country Y to certify that A has no persons of a particular 
national origin on its board of directors. A knows that Y's purpose in 
asking for the certification is to enforce its boycott against country 
X.
    A may not make such a certification, because A would be furnishing 
information about the national origin of U.S. persons for purposes of 
complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (iii) U.S. company A believes that boycotting country Y will select 
A's bid over those of other bidders if A volunteers that it has no 
shareholders, officers, or directors of a particular national origin. 
A's belief is based on its knowledge that Y generally refuses, as part 
of its boycott against country X, to do business with companies owned, 
controlled, or managed by persons of this particular national origin.
    A may not volunteer this information, because it would be furnishing 
information about the national origin of U.S. persons for purposes of 
complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (iv) U.S. company A has a contract to construct an airport in 
boycotting country Y. Before A begins work, A is asked by Y to identify 
the national origin of its employees who will work on the site. A knows 
or has reason to know that Y is seeking this information in order to 
enforce its boycott against X.
    A may not furnish this information, because A would be providing 
information about the national origin of U.S. persons for purposes of 
complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that in order to assemble its work force on 
site in Y, A sends visa forms to its employees and asks that the forms 
be returned to A for transmittal to Y's consulate or embassy. A, itself, 
furnishes no information about its employees, but merely transmits the 
visa forms back and forth.
    In performing the ministerial function of transmitting visa forms, A 
is not furnishing information about any U.S. person's race, religion, 
sex, or national origin.
    (vi) Same as (iv), except that A is asked by Y to certify that none 
of its employees in Y will be women, because Y's laws prohibit women 
from working.
    Such a certification does not constitute a prohibited furnishing of 
information about any U.S. person's sex, since the reason the 
information is sought has nothing to do with Y's boycott of X.
    (vii) U.S. company A is considering establishing an office in 
boycotting country Y. In order to register to do business in Y, A is 
asked to furnish information concerning the nationalities of its 
corporate officers and board of directors.
    A may furnish the information about the nationalities of its 
officers and directors, because in so doing A would not be furnishing 
information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any 
U.S. person.

    (d) Furnishing information about business relationships with 
boycotted countries or blacklisted persons.

Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Business Relationships 
             With Boycotted Countries or Blacklisted Persons

    (1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to 
furnish information concerning his or any other person's past, present 
or proposed business relationships:
    (i) With or in a boycotted country;
    (ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of a 
boycotted country;
    (iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or
    (iv) With any other person who is known or believed to be restricted 
from having any business relationship with or in a boycotting country.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply:
    (i) Whether the information pertains to a business relationship 
involving a sale, purchase, or supply transaction; legal or commercial 
representation; shipping or other transportation transaction; insurance; 
investment; or any other type of business transaction or relationship; 
and

[[Page 461]]

    (ii) Whether the information is directly or indirectly requested or 
is furnished on the initiative of the United States person.
    (3) This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal 
business information in a commercial context. Normal business 
information may relate to factors such as financial fitness, technical 
competence, or professional experience, and may be found in documents 
normally available to the public such as annual reports, disclosure 
statements concerning securities, catalogs, promotional brochures, and 
trade and business handbooks. Such information may also appear in 
specifications or statements of experience and qualifications.
    (4) Normal business information furnished in a commercial context 
does not cease to be such simply because the party soliciting the 
information may be a boycotting country or a national or resident 
thereof. If the information is of a type which is generally sought for a 
legitimate business purpose (such as determining financial fitness, 
technical competence, or professional experience), the information may 
be furnished even if the information could be used, or without the 
knowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to be 
used, for boycott purposes. However, no information about business 
relationships with blacklisted persons or boycotted countries, their 
residents or nationals, may be furnished in response to a boycott 
request, even if the information is publicly available. Requests for 
such information from a boycott office will be presumed to be boycott-
based.
    (5) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are 
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott.

              Examples Concerning Furnishing of Information

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which the furnishing of information is prohibited. 
They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. contractor A is considering bidding for a contract to build 
a dam in boycotting country Y. The invitation to bid, which appears in a 
trade journal, specifies that each bidder must state that he does not 
have any offices in boycotted country X. A knows or has reason to know 
that the requirement is boycott-based.
    A may not make this statement, because it constitutes information 
about A's business relationships with X.
    (ii) U.S. contractor A is considering bidding for a contract to 
construct a school in boycotting country Y. Each bidder is required to 
submit copies of its annual report with its bid. Since A's annual report 
describes A's worldwide operations, including the countries in which it 
does business, it necessarily discloses whether A has business relations 
with boycotted country X. A has no reason to know that its report is 
being sought for boycott purposes.
    A, in furnishing its annual report, is supplying ordinary business 
information in a commercial context.
    (iii) Same as (ii), except that accompanying the invitation to bid 
is a questionnaire from country Y's boycott office asking each bidder to 
supply a copy of its annual report.
    A may not furnish the annual report despite its public availability, 
because it would be furnishing information in response to a 
questionnaire from a boycott office.
    (iv) U.S. company A is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. For 
reasons unrelated to the boycott, A terminates its business 
relationships with boycotted country X. In exploring other marketing 
areas, A determines that boycotting country Y offers great potential. A 
is requested to complete a questionnaire from a central boycott office 
which inquires about A's business relations with X.
    A may not furnish the information, because it is information about 
A's business relationships with a boycotted country.
    (v) U.S. exporter A is seeking to sell its products to boycotting 
country Y. A is informed by Y that, as a condition of sale, A must 
certify that it has no salesmen in boycotted country X. A knows or has 
reason to know that the condition is boycott-based.
    A may not furnish the certification, because it is information about 
A's business relationships in a boycotted country.
    (vi) U.S. engineering company A receives an invitation to bid on the 
construction of a dam in boycotting country Y. As a condition of the 
bid, A is asked to certify that it does not have any offices in 
boycotted country X. A is also asked to furnish plans for other dams it 
has designed.
    A may not certify that it has no office in X, because this is 
information about its business relationships in a boycotted country. A 
may submit plans for other dams it has designed, because this is 
furnishing normal

[[Page 462]]

business information, in a commercial context, relating to A's technical 
competence and professional experience.
    (vii) U.S. company A, in seeking to expand its exports to boycotting 
country Y, sends a sales representative to Y for a one week trip. During 
a meeting in Y with trade association representatives, A's 
representative desires to explain that neither A nor any companies with 
which A deals has any business relationship with boycotted country X. 
The purpose of supplying such information is to ensure that A does not 
get blacklisted.
    A's representative may not volunteer this information even though A, 
for reasons unrelated to the boycott, does not deal with X, because A's 
representative would be volunteering information about A's business 
relationships with X for boycott reasons.
    (viii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to furnish 
information concerning its business relationships with boycotted country 
X. A, knowing that Y is seeking the information for boycott purposes, 
refuses to furnish the information asked for directly, but proposes to 
respond by supplying a copy of its annual report which lists the 
countries with which A is presently doing business. A does not happen to 
be doing business with X.
    A may not respond to Y's request by supplying its annual report, 
because A knows that it would be responding to a boycott-based request 
for information about its business relationships with X.
    (ix) U.S. company A receives a letter from a central boycott office 
asking A to ``clarify'' A's operations in boycotted country X. A intends 
to continue its operations in X, but fears that not responding to the 
request will result in its being placed on boycotting country Y's 
blacklist. A knows or has reason to know that the information is sought 
for boycott reasons.
    A may not respond to this request, because the information concerns 
its business relationships with a boycotted country.
    (x) U.S. company A, in the course of negotiating a sale of its goods 
to a buyer in boycotting country Y, is asked to certify that its 
supplier is not on Y's blacklist.
    A may not furnish the information about its supplier's blacklist 
status, because this is information about A's business relationships 
with another person who is believed to be restricted from having any 
business relationship with or in a boycotting country.
    (xi) U.S. company A has a manufacturing plant in boycotted country X 
and is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. A is seeking to establish 
operations in Y, while expanding its operations in X. A applies to Y to 
be removed from Y's blacklist. A is asked, in response, to indicate 
whether it has manufacturing facilities in X.
    A may not supply the requested information, because A would be 
furnishing information about its business relationships in a boycotted 
country.
    (xii) U.S. bank A plans to open a branch office in boycotting 
country Y. In order to do so, A is required to furnish certain 
information about its business operations, including the location of its 
other branch offices. Such information is normally sought in other 
countries where A has opened a branch office, and A does not have reason 
to know that Y is seeking the information for boycott reasons.
    A may furnish this information, even though in furnishing it A would 
disclose information about its business relationships in a boycotted 
country, because it is being furnished in a normal business context and 
A does not have reason to know that it is sought for boycott reasons.
    (xiii) U.S. architectural firm A responds to an invitation to submit 
designs for an office complex in boycotting country Y. The invitation 
states that all bidders must include information concerning similar 
types of buildings they have designed. A has not designed such buildings 
in boycotted country X. Clients frequently seek information of this type 
before engaging an architect.
    A may furnish this information, because this is furnishing normal 
business information, in a commercial context, relating to A's technical 
competence and professional experience.
    (xiv) U.S. oil company A distributes to potential customers 
promotional brochures and catalogs which give background information on 
A's past projects. A does not have business dealings with boycotted 
country X. The brochures, which are identical to those which A uses 
throughout the world, list those countries in which A does or has done 
business. In soliciting potential customers in boycotting country Y, A 
desires to distribute copies of its brochures.
    A may do so, because this is furnishing normal business information, 
in a commercial context, relating to professional experience.
    (xv) U.S. company A is interested in doing business with boycotting 
country Y. A wants to ask Y's Ministry of Trade whether, and if so why, 
A is on Y's blacklist or is otherwise restricted for boycott reasons 
from doing business with Y.
    A may make this limited inquiry, because it does not constitute 
furnishing information.
    (xvi) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to certify 
that it is not owned by subjects or nationals of boycotted country X and 
that it is not resident in boycotted country X.
    A may not furnish the certification, because it is information about 
A's business relationships with or in a boycotted country, or with 
nationals of a boycotted country.

[[Page 463]]

    (xvii) U.S. company A, a manufacturer of certain patented products, 
desires to register its patents in boycotting country Y. A receives a 
power of attorney form required to register its patents. The form 
contains a question regarding A's business relationships with or in 
boycotted country X. A has no business relationships with X and knows or 
has reason to know that the information is sought for boycott reasons.
    A may not answer the question, because A would be furnishing 
information about its business relationships with or in a boycotted 
country.
    (xviii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to certify 
that it is not the mother company, sister company, subsidiary, or branch 
of any blacklisted company, and that it is not in any way affiliated 
with any blacklisted company.
    A may not furnish the certification, because it is information about 
whether A has a business relationship with another person who is known 
or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with 
or in a boycotting country.

    (e) Information concerning association with charitable and fraternal 
organizations.

   Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Associations With 
                 Charitable and Fraternal Organizations

    (1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to 
furnish information about whether any person is a member of, has made 
contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the 
activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports a 
boycotted country.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply whether:
    (i) The information concerns association with or involvement in any 
charitable or fraternal organization which (a) has, as one of its stated 
purposes, the support of a boycotted country through financial 
contributions or other means, or (b) undertakes, as a major 
organizational activity, to offer financial or other support to a 
boycotted country;
    (ii) The information is directly or indirectly requested or is 
furnished on the initiative of the United States person; or
    (iii) The information requested or volunteered concerns membership 
in, financial contributions to, or any other type of association with or 
involvement in the activities of such charitable or fraternal 
organization.
    (3) This prohibition does not prohibit the furnishing of normal 
business information in a commercial context as defined in paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are 
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott.

      Examples of Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About 
         Associations With Charitable or Fraternal Organizations

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which the furnishing of information concerning 
associations with charitable or fraternal organizations is prohibited. 
They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. engineering firm A receives an invitation to bid from 
boycotting country Y. The invitation includes a request to supply 
information concerning any association which A's officers have with 
charitable organization B, an organization which is known by A to 
contribute financial support to boycotted country X. A knows or has 
reason to know that the information is sought for boycott reasons.
    A may not furnish the information.
    (ii) U.S. construction company A, in an effort to establish business 
dealings with boycotting country Y, proposes to furnish information to Y 
showing that no members of its board of directors are in any way 
associated with charitable organizations which support boycotted country 
X. A's purpose is to avoid any possibility of its being blacklisted by 
Y.
    A may not furnish the information, because A's purpose in doing so 
is boycott-based. It makes no difference that no specific request for 
the information has been made by Y.
    (iii) A, a citizen of the United States, is applying for a teaching 
position in a school in boycotting country Y. In connection with his 
application, A furnishes a resume which happens to disclose his 
affiliation with charitable organizations. A does so completely without 
reference to Y's boycott and without knowledge of any boycott 
requirement of Y that pertains to A's application for employment.
    The furnishing of a resume by A is not a boycott-related furnishing 
of information about his association with charitable organizations which 
support boycotted country X.


[[Page 464]]


    (f) Letters of credit.

Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit Containing Prohibited 
                       Conditions or Requirements

    (1) No United States person may pay, honor, confirm, or otherwise 
implement a letter of credit which contains a condition or requirement 
compliance with which is prohibited by this part, nor shall any United 
States person, as a result of the application of this section, be 
obligated to pay, honor or otherwise implement such a letter of credit.
    (2) For purposes of this section, ``implementing'' a letter of 
credit includes:
    (i) Issuing or opening a letter of credit at the request of a 
customer;
    (ii) Honoring, by accepting as being a valid instrument of credit, 
any letter of credit;
    (iii) Paying, under a letter of credit, a draft or other demand for 
payment by the beneficiary;
    (iv) Confirming a letter of credit by agreeing to be responsible for 
payment to the beneficiary in response to a request by the issuer;
    (v) Negotiating a letter of credit by voluntarily purchasing a draft 
from a beneficiary and presenting such draft for reimbursement to the 
issuer or the confirmer of the letter of credit; and
    (vi) Taking any other action to implement a letter of credit.
    (3) In the standard international letter of credit transaction 
facilitating payment for the export of goods from the United States, a 
bank in a foreign country may be requested by its customer to issue a 
revocable or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the United States 
exporter. The customer usually requires, and the letter of credit 
provides, that the issuing (or a confirming) bank will make payment to 
the beneficiary against the bank's receipt of the documentation 
specified in the letter of credit. Such documentation usually includes 
commercial and consular invoices, a bill of lading, and evidence of 
insurance, but it may also include other required certifications or 
documentary assurances such as the origin of the goods and information 
relating to the carrier or insurer of the shipment.
    Banks usually will not accept drafts for payment unless the 
documents submitted therewith comply with the terms and conditions of 
the letter of credit.
    (4) A United States person is not prohibited under this section from 
advising a beneficiary of the existence of a letter of credit in his 
favor, or from taking ministerial actions to dispose of a letter of 
credit which it is prohibited from implementing.
    (5) Compliance with this section shall provide an absolute defense 
in any action brought to compel payment of, honoring of, or other 
implementation of a letter of credit, or for damages resulting from 
failure to pay or otherwise honor or implement the letter of credit. 
This section shall not otherwise relieve any person from any obligations 
or other liabilities he may incur under other laws or regulations, 
except as may be explicitly provided in this section.

             Letters of Credit to Which This Section Applies

    (6) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United States person's activities taken with intent to comply with, 
further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. In addition, it 
applies only when the transaction to which the letter of credit applies 
is in United States commerce and the beneficiary is a United States 
person.

        Implementation of Letters of Credit in the United States

    (7) A letter of credit implemented in the United States by a United 
States person located in the United States, including a permanent United 
States establishment of a foreign bank, will be presumed to apply to a 
transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor of a United 
States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a United States 
address for the beneficiary. These presumptions may be rebutted by facts 
which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is 
not a United States person or that the underlying transaction is not in 
United States commerce.
    (8) Where a letter of credit implemented in the United States by a

[[Page 465]]

United States person located in the United States does not specify a 
United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be 
presumed to be other than a United States person. This presumption may 
be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude 
that the beneficiary is a United States person despite the foreign 
address.

      Implementation of Letters of Credit Outside the United States

    (9) A letter of credit implemented outside the United States by a 
United States person located outside the United States will be presumed 
to apply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor 
of a United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a 
United States address for the beneficiary and calls for documents 
indicating shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that 
the goods are of United States origin. These presumptions may be 
rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that 
the beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlying 
transaction is not in United States commerce.
    (10) Where a letter of credit implemented outside the United States 
by a United States person located outside the United States does not 
specify a United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary 
will be presumed to be other than a United States person. In addition, 
where such a letter of credit does not call for documents indicating 
shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that the goods 
are of United States origin, the transaction to which it applies will be 
presumed to be outside United States commerce. The presumption that the 
beneficiary is other than a United States person may be rebutted by 
facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the 
beneficiary is a United States person. The presumption that the 
transaction to which the letter of credit applies is outside United 
States commerce may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the 
bank to conclude that the underlying transaction is in United States 
commerce.

   Examples of the Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which this section applies to the implementation of 
a letter of credit and in which such implementation is prohibited. They 
are illustrative, not comprehensive.

      Implementation of Letters of Credit in United States Commerce

    (i) A, a U.S. bank located in the United States, opens a letter of 
credit in the United States in favor of B, a foreign company located 
outside the United States. The letter of credit specifies a non-U.S. 
address for the beneficiary.
    The beneficiary is presumed to be other than a U.S. person, because 
it does not have a U.S. address. The presumption may be rebutted by 
facts showing that A could reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is a 
U.S. person despite the foreign address.
    (ii) A, a branch of a foreign bank located in the United States, 
opens a letter of credit in favor of B, a foreign company located 
outside the United States. The letter of credit specifies a non-U.S. 
address for the beneficiary.
    The beneficiary is presumed to be other than a U.S.person, because 
it does not have a U.S. address. The presumption may be rebutted by 
facts showing that A could reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is a 
U.S. person despite the foreign address.
    (iii) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States, opens 
a letter of credit in favor of B, a person with a U.S. address. The 
letter of credit calls for documents indicating shipment of goods from 
the United States.
    The letter of credit is presumed to apply to a transaction in U.S. 
commerce and to be in favor of a U.S. beneficiary because the letter of 
credit specifies a U.S. address for the beneficiary and calls for 
documents indicating that the goods will be shipped from the United 
States. These presumptions may be rebutted by facts showing that A could 
reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is not a U.S. person or that 
the underlying transaction is not in U.S. commerce.
    (iv) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States, opens 
a letter of credit which specifies a beneficiary, B, with an address 
outside the United States and calls for documents indicating that the 
goods are of U.S.-origin. A knows or has reason to know that although B 
has an address outside the United States, B is a U.S. person.
    The letter of credit is presumed to apply to a transaction in U.S. 
commerce, because the letter of credit calls for shipment of U.S.-origin 
goods. In addition, the letter of credit is presumed to be in favor of a 
beneficiary who

[[Page 466]]

is a U.S. person, because A knows or has reason to know that the 
beneficiary is a U.S. person despite the foreign address.
    (v) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States, opens a 
letter of credit which specifies a beneficiary with a U.S. address. The 
letter of credit calls for documents indicating shipment of foreign-
origin goods.
    The letter of credit is presumed to be in favor of a U.S. 
beneficiary but to apply to a transaction outside U.S. commerce, because 
it calls for documents indicating shipment of foreign-origin goods. The 
presumption of non-U.S. commerce may be rebutted by facts showing that A 
could reasonably conclude that the underlying transaction involves 
shipment of U.S.-origin goods or goods from the United States.

           Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit

    (i) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y opens a 
letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The letter of credit 
specifies as a condition of payment that B certify that it does not do 
business with boycotted country X. Foreign bank C forwards the letter of 
credit it has opened to U.S. bank A for confirmation.
    A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit, 
because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may not comply.
    (ii) Same as (i), except U.S. bank A desires to advise the 
beneficiary, U.S. company B, of the letter of credit.
    A may do so, because advising the beneficiary of the letter of 
credit (including the term which prevents A from implementing it) is not 
implementation of the letter of credit.
    (iii) Same as (i), except foreign bank C sends a telegram to U.S. 
bank A stating the major terms and conditions of the letter of credit. 
The telegram does not reflect the boycott provision. Subsequently, C 
mails to A documents setting forth the terms and conditions of the 
letter of credit, including the prohibited boycott condition.
    A may not further implement the letter of credit after it receives 
the documents, because they reflect the prohibited boycott condition in 
the letter of credit. A may advise the beneficiary and C of the 
existence of the letter of credit (including the boycott term), and may 
perform any essentially ministerial acts necessary to dispose of the 
letter of credit.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that U.S. company B, based in part on 
information received from U.S. bank A, desires to obtain an amendment to 
the letter of credit which would eliminate or nullify the language in 
the letter of credit which prevents A from paying or otherwise 
implementing it.
    Either company B or bank A may undertake, and the other may 
cooperate and assist in, this endeavor. A could then pay or otherwise 
implement the revised letter of credit, so long as the original 
prohibited boycott condition is of no force or effect.
    (v) Boycotting country Y requests a foreign bank in Y to open a 
letter of credit to effect payment for goods to be shipped by U.S. 
supplier B, the beneficiary of the letter of credit. The letter of 
credit contains prohibited boycott clauses. The foreign bank forwards a 
copy of the letter of credit to its branch office A, in the United 
States.
    A may advise the beneficiary but may not implement the letter of 
credit, because it contains prohibited boycott conditions.
    (vi) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. U.S. 
bank A is asked to implement, for the benefit of B, a letter of credit 
which contains a clause requiring documentation that the goods shipped 
are not of boycotted country X origin.
    A may not implement the letter of credit with a prohibited 
condition, and may accept only a positive certificate of origin as 
satisfactory documentation. (See Sec. 760.3(c) on ``Import and Shipping 
Document Requirements.'')
    (vii) [Reserved]
    (viii) B is a foreign bank located outside the United States. B 
maintains an account with U.S. bank A, located in the United States. A 
letter of credit issued by B in favor of a U.S. beneficiary provides 
that any negotiating bank may obtain reimbursement from A by certifying 
that all the terms and conditions of the letter of credit have been met 
and then drawing against B's account. B notifies A by cable of the 
issuance of a letter of credit and the existence of reimbursement 
authorization; A does not receive a copy of the letter of credit.
    A may reimburse any negotiating bank, even when the underlying 
letter of credit contains a prohibited boycott condition, because A does 
not know or have reason to know that the letter of credit contains a 
prohibited boycott condition.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that foreign bank B forwards a copy of 
the letter of credit to U.S. bank A, which then becomes aware of the 
prohibited boycott clause.
    A may not thereafter reimburse a negotiating bank or in any way 
further implement the letter of credit, because it knows of the 
prohibited boycott condition.
    (x) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. exporter B and 
requests a foreign bank in Y to open a letter of credit in favor of B to 
cover the cost. The letter of credit contains a prohibited boycott 
clause. The foreign bank asks U.S. bank A to advise and confirm the 
letter of credit. Through inadvertence, A does not notice the prohibited 
clause and confirms the letter of credit. A

[[Page 467]]

thereafter notices the clause and then refuses to honor B's draft 
against the letter of credit. B sues bank A for payment.
    A has an absolute defense against the obligation to make payment 
under this letter of credit. (Note: Examples (ix) and (x) do not alter 
any other obligations or liabilities of the parties under appropriate 
law.)
    (xi) [Reserved]
    (xii) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. A 
letter of credit which contains a prohibited boycott clause is opened in 
favor of B by a foreign bank in Y. The foreign bank asks U.S. bank A to 
advise and confirm the letter of credit, which it forwards to A.
    A may advise B that it has received the letter of credit (including 
the boycott term), but may not confirm the letter of credit with the 
prohibited clause.
    (xiii) Same as (xii), except U.S. bank A fails to tell B that it 
cannot process the letter of credit. B requests payment.
    A may not pay. If the prohibited language is eliminated or nullified 
as the result of renegotiation, A may then pay or otherwise implement 
the revised letter of credit.
    (xiv) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is not 
blacklisted.
    A may implement such a letter of credit, but it may not insist that 
the certification be furnished, because by so insisting it would be 
refusing to do business with a blacklisted person in compliance with a 
boycott.
    (xv) A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S. opens a letter of credit in 
favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods to boycotting country 
Y. The letter of credit contains no boycott conditions, but A knows that 
Y customarily requires the seller of goods to certify that it has dealt 
with no blacklisted supplier. A, therefore, instructs B that it will not 
make payment under the letter of credit unless B makes such a 
certification.
    A's action in requiring the certification from B constitutes action 
to require another person to refuse to do business with blacklisted 
persons.
    (xvi) A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S., opens a letter of credit 
in favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods to boycotting 
country Y. The letter of credit contains no boycott conditions, but A 
has actual knowledge that B has agreed to supply a certification to Y 
that it has not dealt with blacklisted firms, as a condition of 
receiving the letter of credit in its favor.
    A may not implement the letter of credit, because it knows that an 
implicit condition of the credit is a condition with which B may not 
legally comply.
    (xvii) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y 
opens a letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The letter 
of credit includes the statement, ``Do not negotiate with blacklisted 
banks.'' C forwards the letter of credit it has opened to U.S. bank A 
for confirmation.
    A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit, 
because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may not comply.

<R05>
Sec. 760.3  Exceptions to prohibitions.

    (a) Import requirements of a boycotting country.

       Compliance With Import Requirements of a Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States person, in supplying goods or services to a 
boycotting country, or to a national or resident of a boycotting 
country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of such 
boycotting country which prohibit the import of:
    (i) Goods or services from the boycotted country;
    (ii) Goods produced or services provided by any business concern 
organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or
    (iii) Goods produced or services provided by nationals or residents 
of the boycotted country.
    (2) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with such 
import requirements whether or not he has received a specific request to 
comply. By its terms, this exception applies only to transactions 
involving imports into a boycotting country. A United States person may 
not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do 
business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a 
boycotted country.
    (3) In taking action within the scope of this exception, a United 
States person is limited in the types of boycott-related information he 
can supply. (See Sec. 760.2(d) of this part on ``Furnishing Information 
About Business Relationships with Boycotted Countries or Blacklisted 
Persons'' and paragraph (c) of this section on ``Import and Shipping 
Document Requirements.'')

 Examples of Compliance With Import Requirements of a Boycotting Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with the

[[Page 468]]

import requirements of a boycotting country is permissible. They are 
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, receives an order from boycotting 
country Y for its products. Country X is boycotted by country Y, and the 
import laws of Y prohibit the importation of goods produced or 
manufactured in X. In filling this type of order, A would usually 
include some component parts produced in X.
    For the purpose of filling this order, A may substitute comparable 
component parts in place of parts produced in X, because the import laws 
of Y prohibit the importation of goods manufactured in X.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that A's contract with Y expressly provides 
that in fulfilling the contract A ``may not include parts or components 
produced or manufactured in boycotted country X.''
    A may agree to and comply with this contract provision, because Y 
prohibits the importation of goods from X. However, A may not furnish 
negative certifications regarding the origin of components in response 
to import and shipping document requirements.
    (iii) A, a U.S. building contractor, is awarded a contract to 
construct a plant in boycotting country Y. A accepts bids on goods 
required under the contract, and the lowest bid is made by B, a business 
concern organized under the laws of X, a country boycotted by Y. Y 
prohibits the import of goods produced by companies organized under the 
laws of X.
    For purposes of this contract, A may reject B's bid and accept 
another, because B's goods would be refused entry into Y because of Y's 
boycott against X.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A also rejects the low bid by B for 
work on a construction project in country M, a country not boycotted by 
Y.
    This exception does not apply, because A's action is not taken in 
order to comply with Y's requirements prohibiting the import of products 
from boycotted country X.
    (v) A, a U.S. management consulting firm, contracts to provide 
services to boycotting country Y. Y requests that A not employ residents 
or nationals of boycotted country X to provide those services.
    A may agree, as a condition of the contract, not to have services 
furnished by nationals or residents of X, because importation of such 
services is prohibited by Y.
    (vi) A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a contract to supply machine 
tools to boycotting country Y. Y insists that the contract contain a 
provision whereby A agrees that none of the machine tools will be 
produced by any business concern owned by nationals of boycotted country 
X, even if the business concern is organized under the laws of a non-
boycotted country.
    A may not agree to this provision, because it is a restriction on 
the import of goods produced by business concerns owned by nationals of 
a boycotted country even if the business concerns themselves are 
organized under the laws of a non-boycotted country.

    (b) Shipment of goods to a boycotting country.

   Compliance With Requirements Regarding the Shipment of Goods to a 
                           Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting 
country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of that country 
which prohibit the shipment of goods:
    (i) On a carrier of the boycotted country; or
    (ii) By a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country 
or the recipient of the shipment.
    (2) A specific request that a United States person comply or agree 
to comply with requirements concerning the use of carriers of a 
boycotted country is not necessary if the United States person knows, or 
has reason to know, that the use of such carriers for shipping goods to 
the boycotting country is prohibited by requirements of the boycotting 
country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country or the 
purchaser of the shipment:
    (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through a 
port of the boycotted country; or
    (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not 
include a port in the boycotted country.
    (3) For purposes of this exception, the term carrier of a boycotted 
country means a carrier which flies the flag of a boycotted country or 
which is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by a boycotted country or 
by nationals or residents of a boycotted country.

 Examples of Compliance With the Shipping Requirements of a Boycotting 
                                 Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with import and shipping document 
requirements of a boycotting country is permissible. They are 
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A is a U.S. exporter from whom boycotting country Y is importing 
goods. Y directs that the goods not pass through a port of boycotted 
country X.

[[Page 469]]

    A may comply with Y's shipping instructions, because they pertain to 
the route of shipment of goods being shipped to Y.
    (ii) A, a U.S. fertilizer manufacturer, receives an order from 
boycotting country Y for fertilizer. Y specifies in the order that A may 
not ship the fertilizer on a carrier of boycotted country X.
    A may comply with this request, because it pertains to the carrier 
of a boycotted country.
    (iii) B, a resident of boycotting country Y, orders textile goods 
from A, a U.S. distributor, specifying that the shipment must not be 
made on a carrier owned or leased by nationals of boycotted country X 
and that the carrier must not pass through a port of country X enroute 
to Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with these requests, because they 
pertain to the shipment of goods to Y on a carrier of a boycotted 
country and the route such shipment will take.
    (iv) Boycotting country Y orders goods from A, a U.S. retail 
merchant. The order specifies that the goods shipped by A ``may not be 
shipped on a carrier registered in or owned by boycotted country X.''
    A may agree to this contract provision, because it pertains to the 
carrier of a boycotted country.
    (v) Boycotting country Y orders goods from A, a U.S. pharmaceutical 
company, and requests that the shipment not pass through a port of 
country P, which is not a country boycotted by Y.
    This exception does not apply in a non-boycotting situation. A may 
comply with the shipping instructions of Y, because in doing so he would 
not violate any prohibition of this part.
    (vi) Boycotting country Y orders goods from A, a U.S. manufacturer. 
The order specifies that goods shipped by A ``must not be shipped on 
vessels blacklisted by country Y''.
    A may not agree to comply with this condition because it is not a 
restriction limited to the use of carriers of the boycotted country.

    (c) Import and shipping document requirements.

     Compliance With Import and Shipping Document Requirements of a 
                           Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting 
country, may comply or agree to comply with import and shipping document 
requirements of that country, with respect to:
    (i) The country or origin of the goods;
    (ii) The name and nationality of the carrier;
    (iii) The route of the shipment;
    (iv) The name, residence, or address of the supplier of the 
shipment;
    (v) The name, residence, or address of the provider of other 
services.
    (2) Such information must be stated in positive, non-blacklisting, 
non-exclusionary terms except for information with respect to the names 
or nationalities of carriers or routes of shipment, which may continue 
to be stated in negative terms in conjunction with shipments to a 
boycotting country, in order to comply with precautionary requirements 
protecting against war risks or confiscation.

  Examples of Compliance With Import and Shipping Document Requirements

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with the import requirements of a 
boycotting country is permissible. They are illustrative, not 
comprehensive.
    (i) Boycotting country Y contracts with A, a U.S. petroleum 
equipment manufacturer, for certain equipment. Y requires that goods 
being imported into Y must be accompanied by a certification that the 
goods being supplied did not originate in boycotted country X.
    A may not supply such a certification in negative terms but may 
identify instead the country of origin of the goods in positive terms 
only.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that Y requires that the shipping 
documentation accompanying the goods specify the country of origin of 
the goods.
    A may furnish the information.
    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) A, a U.S. apparel manufacturer, has contracted to sell certain 
of its products to B, a national of boycotting country Y. The form that 
must be submitted to customs officials of Y requires the shipper to 
certify that the goods contained in the shipment have not been supplied 
by ``blacklisted'' persons.
    A may not furnish the information in negative terms but may certify, 
in positive terms only, the name of the supplier of the goods.
    (v) Same as (iv), except the customs form requires certification 
that the insurer and freight forwarder used are not ``blacklisted.''
    A may not comply with the request but may supply a certification 
stating, in positive terms only, the names of the insurer and freight 
forwarder.
    (vi) A, a U.S. petrochemical manufacturer, executes a sales contract 
with B, a resident

[[Page 470]]

of boycotting country Y. A provision of A's contract with B requires 
that the bill of lading and other shipping documents contain 
certifications that the goods have not been shipped on a ``blacklisted'' 
carrier.
    A may not agree to supply a certification that the carrier is not 
``blacklisted'' but may certify the name of the carrier in positive 
terms only.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires certification 
that the goods will not be shipped on a carrier which flies the flag of, 
or is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by boycotted country X, or 
by nationals or residents of X.
    Such a certification, which is a reasonable requirement to protect 
against war risks or confiscation, may be furnished at any time.
    (viii) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires that the 
shipping documents certify the name of the carrier being used.
    A may, at any time, supply or agree to supply the requested 
documentation regarding the name of the carrier, either in negative or 
positive terms.
    (ix) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires a certification 
that the carrier will not call at a port in boycotted country X before 
making delivery in Y.
    Such a certification, which is a reasonable requirement to protect 
against war risks or confiscation, may be furnished at any time.
    (x) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires that the 
shipping documents indicate the name of the insurer and freight 
forwarder.
    A may comply at any time, because the statement is not required to 
be made in negative or blacklisting terms.
    (xi) A, a U.S. exporter, is negotiating a contract to sell bicycles 
to boycotting country Y. Y insists that A agree to certify that the 
goods will not be shipped on a vessel which has ever called at a port in 
boycotted country X.
    As distinguished from a certification that goods will not be shipped 
on a vessel which will call enroute at a port of boycotted country X, 
such a certification is not a reasonable requirement to protect against 
war risks or confiscation, and, hence, may not be supplied.
    (xii) Same as (xi), except that Y insists that A agree to certify 
that the goods will not be shipped on a carrier that is ineligible to 
enter Y's waters.
    Such a certification, which is not a reasonable requirement to 
protect against war risks or confiscation may not be supplied.

    (d) Unilateral and specific selection.

            Compliance with Unilateral and Specific Selection

    (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply in the 
normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by 
a boycotting country, a national of a boycotting country, or a resident 
of a boycotting country (including a United States person who is a bona 
fide resident of a boycotting country) of carriers, insurers, suppliers 
of services to be performed within the boycotting country, or specific 
goods, provided that with respect to services, it is necessary and 
customary that a not insignificant part of the services be performed 
within the boycotting country. With respect to goods, the items, in the 
normal course of business, must be identifiable as to their source or 
origin at the time of their entry into the boycotting country by (a) 
uniqueness of design or appearance or (b) trademark, trade name, or 
other identification normally on the items themselves, including their 
packaging.
    (2) This exception pertains to what is permissible for a United 
States person who is the recipient of a unilateral and specific 
selection of goods or services to be furnished by a third person. It 
does not pertain to whether the act of making such a selection is 
permitted; that question is covered, with respect to United States 
persons, in paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local 
Law.'' Nor does it pertain to the United States person who is the 
recipient of an order to supply its own goods or services. Nothing in 
this part prohibits or restricts a United States person from filling an 
order himself, even if he is selected by the buyer on a boycott basis 
(e.g., because he is not blacklisted), so long as he does not himself 
take any action prohibited by this part.

           Unilateral and Specific Character of the Selection

    (3) In order for this exception to apply, the selection with which a 
United States person wishes to comply must be unilateral and specific.
    (4) A ``specific'' selection is one which is stated in the 
affirmative and which specifies a particular supplier of goods or 
services.
    (5) A ``unilateral'' selection is one in which the discretion in 
making the selection is exercised by the boycotting country buyer. If 
the United States

[[Page 471]]

person who receives a unilateral selection has provided the buyer with 
any boycott-based assistance (including information for purposes of 
helping the buyer select someone on a boycott basis), then the buyer's 
selection is not unilateral, and compliance with that selection by a 
United States person does not come within this exception.
    (6) The provision of so-called ``pre-selection'' or ``pre-award'' 
services, such as providing lists of qualified suppliers, 
subcontractors, or bidders, does not, in and of itself, destroy the 
unilateral character of a selection, provided such services are not 
boycott-based. Lists of qualified suppliers, for example, must not 
exclude anyone because he is blacklisted. Moreover, such services must 
be of the type customarily provided in similar transactions by the firm 
(or industry of which the firm is a part) as measured by the practice in 
non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries. If such services are not 
customarily provided in similar transactions or such services are 
provided in such a way as to exclude blacklisted persons from 
participating in a transaction or diminish their opportunity for such 
participation, then the services may not be provided without destroying 
the unilateral character of any subsequent selection.

           Selection To Be Made by Boycotting Country Resident

    (7) In order for this exception to be available, the unilateral and 
specific selection must have been made by a boycotting country, or by a 
national or resident of a boycotting country. Such a resident may be a 
United States person. For purposes of this exception, a United States 
person will be considered a resident of a boycotting country only if he 
is a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona fide 
resident of a boycotting country even if such person's residency is 
temporary.
    (8) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a United 
States person is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country include:
    (i) Physical presence in the country;
    (ii) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;
    (iii) Continuity of the residency;
    (iv) Intent to maintain the residency;
    (v) Prior residence in the country;
    (vi) Size and nature of presence in the country;
    (vii) Whether the person is registered to do business or 
incorporated in the country;
    (viii) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and
    (ix) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting 
and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business 
activities.
    Note to paragraph (d)(8) of this section:
    No one of the factors is dispositive. All the circumstances will be 
examined closely to ascertain whether there is, in fact, a bona fide 
residency. Residency established solely for purposes of avoidance of the 
application of this part, unrelated to legitimate business needs, does 
not constitute bona fide residency.
    (9) The boycotting country resident must be the one actually making 
the selection. If a selection is made by a non-resident agent, parent, 
subsidiary, affiliate, home office or branch office of a boycotting 
country resident, it is not a selection by a resident within the meaning 
of this exception.
    (10) A selection made solely by a bona fide resident and merely 
transmitted by another person to a United States person for execution is 
a selection by a bona fide resident within the meaning of this 
exception.

                             Duty of Inquiry

    (11) If a United States person receives, from another person located 
in the United States, what may be a unilateral selection by a boycotting 
country customer, and knows or has reason to know that the selection is 
made for boycott reasons, he has a duty to inquire of the transmitting 
person to determine who actually made the selection. If he knows or has 
reason to know that the selection was made by other than a boycotting 
country, or a national or resident of a boycotting country, he may not 
comply. A course or pattern of conduct which a United States person 
recognizes or should recognize as consistent with boycott restrictions 
will create a duty to inquire.
    (12) If the United States person does not know or have reason to 
know that the selection it receives is boycott-

[[Page 472]]

based, its compliance with such a selection does not offend any 
prohibition and this exception is not needed.

                          Selection of Services

    (13) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of 
certain types of suppliers of services-carriers, insurers, and suppliers 
of services to be performed ``within the boycotting country.'' Services 
to be performed wholly within the United States or wholly within any 
country other than the boycotting country are not covered.
    (14) For purposes of this part, services are to be performed 
``within the boycotting country'' only if they are of a type which would 
customarily be performed by suppliers of those services within the 
country of the recipient of those services, and if the part of the 
services performed within the boycotting country is a necessary and not 
insignificant part of the total services performed.
    (15) What is ``customary and necessary'' for these purposes depends 
on the usual practice of the supplier of the services (or the industry 
of which he is a part) as measured by the practice in non-boycotting as 
well as boycotting countries, except where such practices are instituted 
to accommodate this part.

                           Selection of Goods

    (16) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of 
certain types of goods--goods that, in the normal course of business, 
are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry 
into the boycotting country. The definition of ``specifically 
identifiable goods'' is the same under this section as it is in 
paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local Law.''
    (17) Goods ``specifically identifiable'' in the normal course of 
business are those items which at the time of their entry into a 
boycotting country are identifiable as to source or origin by uniqueness 
of design or appearance; or trademark, trade name, or other 
identification normally on the items themselves, including their 
packaging. Goods are ``specifically identifiable'' in the normal course 
of business if their source or origin is ascertainable by inspection of 
the items themselves, including their packaging, regardless of whether 
inspection takes place. Goods are not considered to be ``specifically 
identifiable'' in the normal course of business if a trademark, trade 
name, or other form of identification not normally present is added to 
the items themselves, including their packaging, to accommodate this 
part.

                                 General

    (18) If a unilateral selection meets the conditions described in 
paragraph (d) of this section, the United States person receiving the 
unilateral selection may comply or agree to comply, even if he knows or 
has reason to know that the selection was boycott-based. However, no 
United States person may comply or agree to comply with any unilateral 
selection if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the 
selection is to effect discrimination against any United States person 
on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin.

           Examples of Compliance With a Unilateral Selection

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
what constitutes a unilateral selection and the circumstances in which 
compliance with such a selection is permissible. They are illustrative, 
not comprehensive.

                    Specific and Unilateral Selection

    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer of road-grading equipment, is asked by 
boycotting country Y to ship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B, a carrier 
which is not blacklisted by Y. A knows or has reason to know that Y's 
selection of B is boycott-based.
    A may comply with Y's request, or may agree to comply as a condition 
of the contract, because the selection is specific and unilateral.
    (ii) A, a U.S. contractor building an industrial facility in 
boycotting country Y is asked by B, a resident of Y, to use C as the 
supplier of air conditioning equipment to be used in the facility. C is 
not blacklisted by country Y. A knows or has reason to know that B's 
request is boycott-based.
    A may comply with B's request, or may agree to comply as a condition 
of the contract, because the selection of C is specific and unilateral.
    (iii) A, a U.S. manufacturer of automotive equipment, is asked by 
boycotting country Y

[[Page 473]]

not to ship its goods to Y on U.S. carriers, B, C, or D. Carriers B, C, 
and D are blacklisted by boycotting country Y. A knows or has reason to 
know that Y's request is boycott-based.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because no 
specific selection of any particular carrier has been made.
    (iv) A, a U.S. exporter shipping goods ordered by boycotting country 
Y, is provided by Y with a list of eligible U.S. insurers from which A 
may choose in insuring the shipment of its goods. A knows or has reason 
to know that the list was compiled on a boycott basis.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request that A choose 
from among the eligible insurers, because no specific selection of any 
particular insurer has been made.
    (v) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, is negotiating to sell aircraft 
to boycotting country Y. During the negotiations, Y asks A to identify 
the company which normally manufactures the engines for the aircraft. A 
responds that they are normally manufactured by U.S. engine manufacturer 
B. B is blacklisted by Y. In making the purchase, Y specifies that the 
engines for the aircraft should be supplied by U.S. engine manufacturer 
C.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's selection of C, because Y's 
selection is unilateral and specific.
    (vi) A, a U.S. construction firm, is retained by an agency of 
boycotting country Y to build a pipeline. Y requests A to suggest 
qualified engineering firms to be used on-site in the construction of 
the pipeline. It is customary for A, regardless of where it conducts its 
operations, to identify qualified engineering firms to its customers so 
that its customers may make their own selection of the firm to be 
engaged. Choice of engineering firm is customarily a prerogative of the 
customer. A provides a list of five engineering firms, B-F, excluding no 
firm because it may be blacklisted, and then confers with and gives its 
recommendations to Y. A recommends C, because C is the best qualified. Y 
then selects B, because C is blacklisted.
    A may comply with Y's selection of B, because the boycott-based 
decision is made by Y and is unilateral and specific. Since A's pre-
award services are of the kind customarily provided in these situations, 
and since they are provided without reference to the boycott, they do 
not destroy the unilateral character of Y's selection.
    (vii) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, has an order to supply a 
certain number of planes to boycotting country Y. In connection with the 
order, Y asks A to supply it with a list of qualified aircraft tire 
manufacturers so that Y can select the tires to be placed on the planes. 
This is a highly unusual request, since, in A's worldwide business 
operations, choice of tires is customarily made by the manufacturer, not 
the customer. Nonetheless, A supplies a list of tire manufacturers, B, 
C, D, and E. Y chooses tire manufacturer B because B is not blacklisted. 
Had A, as is customary, selected the tires, company C would have been 
chosen. C happens to be blacklisted, and A knows that C's blacklist 
status was the reason for Y's selection of B.
    A's provision of a list of tire manufacturers for Y to choose from 
destroys the unilateral character of Y's selection, because such a pre-
selection service is not customary in A's worldwide business operations.
    (viii) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, receives an order from U.S. 
company C, which is located in the United States, for the sale of 
aircraft to company D, a U.S. affiliate of C. D is a bona fide resident 
of boycotting country Y. C instructs A that ``in order to avoid boycott 
problems,'' A must use engines that are manufactured by company B, a 
company that is not blacklisted by Y. Engines built by B are unique in 
design and also bear B's trade name.
    Since A has reason to know that the selection is boycott-based, he 
must inquire of C whether the selection was in fact made by D. If C 
informs A that the selection was made by D, A may comply.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that C initially states that the 
designation was unilaterally and specifically made by D.
    A may accept C's statement without further investigation and may 
comply with the selection, because C merely transmitted D's unilateral 
and specific selection.
    (x) Same as (ix), except that C informs A that it, C, has selected B 
on behalf of or as an agent of its affiliated company resident in the 
boycotting country.
    A may not comply with this selection, because the decision was not 
made by a resident of the boycotting country.
    (xi) A, a U.S. management consulting firm, is advising boycotting 
country Y on the selection of a contracting firm to construct a plant 
for the manufacture of agricultural chemicals. As is customary in its 
business, A compiles a list of potential contractors on the basis of its 
evaluation of the capabilities of the respective candidates to perform 
the job. A has knowledge that company B is blacklisted, but provides Y 
with the names of companies B, C, D, and E, listing them in order of 
their qualifications. Y instructs A to negotiate with C.
    A may comply with Y's instruction, because Y's selection is 
unilateral and specific.
    (xii) A, a U.S. exporter, is asked by boycotting country Y not to 
ship goods on carriers B, C, or D, which are owned by nationals of and 
are registered in country P, a country not boycotted by Y.

[[Page 474]]

    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's request even though the 
selection is not specific, because A does not know or have reason to 
know that the request is boycott-based.

    (Note: In example (xii), A has violated no prohibition, because it 
does not know or have reason to know that Y's instruction is boycott-
based. Therefore, A could not act with the requisite intent to comply 
with the boycott.)

    (xiii) A, a U.S. construction company, receives a contract to 
construct a hotel in boycotting country Y. As part of the contract, A is 
required to furnish Y with lists of qualified suppliers of various 
specifically identifiable items. A compiles lists of various qualified 
suppliers wholly without reference to the boycott, and thereafter Y 
instructs A to negotiate with, enter into contracts with, and arrange 
for delivery from each of the suppliers which Y designates. A knows that 
Y's choices are made on a boycott basis.
    A may comply with Y's selections and carry out these post-award 
services for Y, because Y's selections were unilateral and specific and 
A's pre-award services were provided without reference to Y's boycott.

                  Examples of Boycotting Country Buyer

(The factors in determining whether a United States person is a ``bona 
fide resident'' of a boycotting country are the same as in paragraph (g) 
of this section on ``Compliance with Local Law.'' See also the examples 
in that section.)

    (i) A, a U.S. exporter, is asked by B, a U.S. person who is a bona 
fide resident of boycotting country Y, to ship goods on U.S. carrier C. 
C is not blacklisted by Y, and A knows that B has chosen on a boycott 
basis in order to comply with Y's boycott laws.
    A may comply or agree to comply with B's request, because B is a 
bona fide resident of Y.
    (ii) A is a U.S. computer company whose subsidiary, B, is a bona 
fide resident of boycotting country Y. A receives an order from B for 
specific, identifiable products manufactured by company C in connection 
with a computer which B is installing in Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with B's unilateral and specific 
selection, so long as the discretion was in fact exercised by B, not A.
    (Note: Unilateral selection transactions involving related United 
States persons will be scrutinized carefully to ensure that the 
selection was in fact made by the bona fide resident of the boycotting 
country.)
    (iii) A, a U.S. engineering firm, has chief engineer B as its 
resident engineer on a dam construction site in boycotting country Y. 
B's presence at the site is necessary in order to ensure proper 
supervision of the project. In order to comply with local law, B selects 
equipment supplier C rather than D, who is blacklisted, and directs A to 
purchase certain specific equipment from C for use in the project.
    A may comply with this unilateral selection, because the decision 
was made by a bona fide resident of Y.

(As noted above, unilateral selections involving related United States 
persons will be scrutinized carefully to ensure that the selection was 
in fact made by the bona fide resident of the boycotting country.)

    (iv) B, a branch of U.S. bank A, is located in boycotting country Y. 
B is in need of office supplies and asks the home office in New York to 
make the necessary purchases. A contacts C, a U.S. company in the office 
supply business, and instructs C to purchase various items from certain 
specific companies and ship them directly to B. In order to avoid any 
difficulties for B with respect to Y's boycott laws, A is careful to 
specify only non-blacklisted companies or suppliers. C knows that that 
was A's purpose. C may not comply with A's instruction, because the 
selection of suppliers was not made by a resident of a boycotting 
country.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that A has given standing instructions to B 
that whenever it needs office supplies, it should specify certain 
suppliers designated by A. To avoid running afoul of Y's boycott laws, 
A's designations consist exclusively of non-blacklisted firms. A 
receives an order from B with the suppliers designated in accordance 
with A's instructions.
    A may not comply with B's selection, because the selection was not 
in fact made by a bona fide resident of the boycotting country, but by a 
person located in the United States.

                    Examples of Suppliers of Services

    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is asked by boycotting country Y to ship 
goods to Y on U.S. vessel B, a carrier which is not blacklisted by Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because compliance 
with the unilateral and specific selection of carriers is expressly 
permitted under this exception.
    (ii) A, a U.S. exporter shipping goods ordered by C, a national of 
boycotting country Y, is asked by C to insure the shipment through U.S. 
insurer B.
    A may comply or agree to comply with C's request, because compliance 
with the unilateral and specific selection of an insurer is expressly 
permitted under this exception.
    (iii) A, a U.S. construction company, is hired by C, an agency of 
the government of boycotting country Y, to build a power plant in Y. C 
specifies that A should subcontract the foundation work to U.S. 
contractor B.

[[Page 475]]

Part of the foundation design work will be done by B in the United 
States.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's designation, because a 
necessary and not insignificant part of B's services are to be performed 
within the boycotting country, and such services are customarily 
performed on-site.
    (iv) A, a U.S. contractor, is engaged by boycotting country Y to 
build a power plant. Y specifies that U.S. architectural firm B should 
be retained by A to design the plant. In order to design the plant, it 
is essential that B's personnel visit and become familiar with the site, 
although the bulk of the design and drawing work will be done in the 
United States.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's unilateral and specific 
selection of architectural firm B, because a necessary and not 
insignificant part of B's services are to be performed within Y, and 
such on-site work is customarily involved in the provision of 
architectural services. The fact that the bulk of the actual work may be 
performed in the United States is irrelevant since the part to be 
performed within Y is necessary to B's effective performance.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that Y specifies that the turbine for the 
power plant should be designed by U.S. engineer C. It is neither 
customary nor necessary for C to visit the site in order to do any of 
his work, but C has informed A that he would probably want to visit the 
site in Y if he were selected for the job.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because, in 
the normal course of business, it is neither customary nor necessary for 
engineer C's services to be performed in Y.
    (vi) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, receives a contract from 
boycotting country Y to manufacture jet engines for Y's use. Y specifies 
that the engines should be designed by U.S. industrial engineering firm 
B.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because, in 
the normal course of business, the services will not be performed in Y.
    (vii) U.S. company A has a contract to supply specially designed 
road graders to boycotting country Y. Y has instructed A that it should 
engage engineering firm B in the design work rather than engineering 
firm C, which A normally uses, because C is blacklisted. When A contacts 
B, B informs A that one of B's personnel customarily visits the location 
in which any equipment B designs is used after it is in use, in order to 
determine how good a design job B has done. Such visits are necessary 
from B's point of view to provide a check on the quality of its work, 
and they are necessary from Y's point of view because they make it 
possible for Y to discuss possible design changes should deficiencies be 
detected.
    A may not comply with Y's selection of B, because the services which 
B would perform in Y are an insignificant part of the total services to 
be performed by B.

               Examples of Specifically Identifiable Goods

(The test of what constitutes ``specifically identifiable goods'' under 
this exception also applies to the term ``specifically identifiable 
goods'' as used in paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with 
Local Law.'')

    (i) A, a U.S. contractor, is constructing an apartment complex, on a 
turnkey basis, for boycotting country Y. Y instructs A to use only 
kitchen appliances manufactured by U.S. company B in completing the 
project. The appliances normally bear the manufacturer's name and 
trademark.
    A may comply with Y's selection of B, because Y's unilateral and 
specific selection is of goods identifiable as to source or origin in 
the normal course of business at the time of their entry into Y.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that Y directs A to use lumber manufactured 
only by U.S. company C. In the normal course of business, C neither 
stamps its name on the lumber nor identifies itself as the manufacturer 
on the packaging. In addition, normal export packaging does not identify 
the manufacturer.
    A may not comply with Y's selection, because the goods selected are 
not identifiable by source or origin in the normal course of business at 
the time of their entry into Y.
    (iii) B, a U.S. contractor who is a bona fide resident of boycotting 
country Y, is engaged in building roads. B retains the services of A, a 
U.S. engineering firm, to assist it in procuring construction equipment. 
B directs A to purchase road graders only from manufacturer C because 
other road grader manufacturers which A might use are blacklisted. C's 
road graders normally bear C's insignia.
    A may comply with B's selection of C, because the goods selected are 
identifiable by source or origin in the normal course of business at the 
time of their entry into Y.
    (iv) A, a U.S. company, manufactures computer-operated machine 
tools. The computers are mounted on a separate bracket on the side of 
the equipment and are readily identifiable by brand name imprinted on 
the equipment. There are five or six U.S. manufacturers of such 
computers which will function interchangeably to operate the machine 
tools manufactured by A. B, a resident of boycotting country Y, 
contracts to buy the machine tools manufactured by A on the condition 
that A incorporate, as the computer drive, a computer manufactured by 
U.S. company C. B's designation of C is made to avoid boycott problems 
which could be caused if computers manufactured by some other company 
were used.

[[Page 476]]

    A may comply with B's designation of C, because the goods selected 
are identifiable by source or origin in the normal course of business at 
the time of their entry into Y.
    (v) A, a U.S. wholesaler of electronic equipment, receives an order 
from B, a U.S. manufacturer of radio equipment, who is a bona fide 
resident of boycotting country Y. B orders a variety of electrical 
components and specifies that all transistors must be purchased from 
company C, which is not blacklisted by Y. The transistors requested by B 
do not normally bear the name of the manufacturer; however, they are 
typically shipped in cartons, and C's name and logo appear on the 
cartons.
    A may comply with B's selection, because the goods selected by B are 
identifiable as to source or origin in the normal course of business at 
the time of their entry into Y by virtue of the containers or packaging 
used.
    (vi) A, a U.S. computer manufacturer, receives an order for a 
computer from B, a university in boycotting country Y. B specifies that 
certain integrated circuits incorporated in the computer must be 
supplied by U.S. electronics company C. These circuits are incorporated 
into the computer and are not visible without disassembling the 
computer.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with B's specific selection of 
these components, because they are not identifiable as to their source 
or origin in the normal course of business at the time of their entry 
into Y.
    (vii) A, a U.S. clothing manufacturer, receives an order for shirts 
from B, a retailer resident in boycotting country Y. B specifies that 
the shirts are to be manufactured from cotton produced by U.S. farming 
cooperative C. Such shirts will not identify C or the source of the 
cotton.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with B's designation, because 
the cotton is not identifiable as to source or origin in the normal 
course of business at the time of entry into Y.
    (viii) A, a U.S. contractor, is retained by B, a construction firm 
located in and wholly-owned by boycotting country Y, to assist B in 
procuring construction materials. B directs A to purchase a range of 
materials, including hardware, tools, and trucks, all of which bear the 
name of the manufacturer stamped on the item. In addition, B directs A 
to purchase steel beams manufactured by U.S. company C. The name of 
manufacturer C normally does not appear on the steel itself or on its 
export packaging.
    A may comply with B's selection of the hardware, tools, and trucks, 
because they are identifiable as to source or origin in the normal 
course of business at the time of entry into Y. A may not comply with 
B's selection of steel beams, because the goods are not identifiable as 
to source or origin by trade name, trademark, uniqueness or packaging at 
the time of their entry into Y.

 Example of Discrimination on Basis of Race, Religion, Sex, or National 
                                 Origin

    (i) A, a U.S. paper manufacturer, is asked by boycotting country Y 
to ship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B. Y states that the reason for its 
choice of B is that, unlike U.S. vessel C, B is not owned by persons of 
a particular faith.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because A has 
reason to know that the purpose of the selection is to effect religious 
discrimination against a United States person.

    (e) Shipment and transshipment of exports pursuant to a boycotting 
country's requirements.

 Compliance With a Boycotting Country's Requirements Regarding Shipment 
                      and Transshipment of Exports

    (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with the 
export requirements of a boycotting country with respect to shipments or 
transshipments of exports to:
    (i) A boycotted country;
    (ii) Any business concern of a boycotted country;
    (iii) Any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted 
country; or
    (iv) Any national or resident of a boycotted country.
    (2) This exception permits compliance with restrictions which a 
boycotting country may place on direct exports to a boycotted country; 
on indirect exports to a boycotted country (i.e., those that pass via 
third parties); and on exports to residents, nationals, or business 
concerns of, or organized under the laws of, a boycotted country, 
including those located in third countries.
    (3) This exception also permits compliance with restrictions which a 
boycotting country may place on the route of export shipments when the 
restrictions are reasonably related to preventing the export shipments 
from coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of the boycotted 
country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country or the 
vendor of the shipment:
    (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through the 
boycotted country enroute to its final destination; or

[[Page 477]]

    (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not 
include the boycotted country.
    (4) A United States person may not, under this exception, refuse on 
an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a 
national or resident of a boycotted country.

    Examples of Compliance With a Boycotting Country's Requirements 
             Regarding Shipment or Transshipment of Exports

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with the export requirements of a 
boycotting country is permissible. They are illustrative, not 
comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. petroleum company, exports petroleum products to 20 
countries, including the United States, from boycotting country Y. 
Country Y's export regulations require that products not be exported 
from Y to boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect to the 
export of goods from Y to X.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that Y's export regulations require that 
goods not be exported from boycotting country Y to any business concern 
organized under the laws of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect to the 
export of goods from Y to a business concern organized under the laws of 
X, even if such concern is located in a country not involved in Y's 
boycott of X.
    (iii) B, the operator of a storage facility in country M, contracts 
with A, a U.S. carrier, for the shipment of certain goods manufactured 
in boycotting country Y. A's contract with B contains a provision 
stating that the goods to be transported may not be shipped or 
transshipped to boycotted country X. B informs A that this provision is 
a requirement of C, the manufacturer of goods who is a resident of 
boycotting country Y. Country M is not boycotted by Y.
    A may agree to and comply with this provision, because such a 
provision is required by the export regulations of boycotting country Y 
in order to prevent shipment of Y-origin goods to a country boycotted by 
Y.
    (iv) A, a U.S. petroleum refiner located in the United States, 
purchases crude oil from boycotting country Y. A has a branch operation 
in boycotted country X. Y requires, as a condition of sale, that A agree 
not to ship or transship the crude oil or products refined in Y to A's 
branch in X.
    A may agree to and comply with these requirements, because they are 
export requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from 
being shipped to a boycotted country.
    (v) A, a U.S. company, has a petrochemical plant in boycotting 
country Y. As a condition of securing an export license from Y, A must 
agree that it will not ship or permit transshipment of any of its output 
from the plant in Y to any companies which Y lists as being owned by 
nationals of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to this condition, because it is a restriction designed 
to prevent Y-origin products from being exported to a business concern 
of boycotted country X or to nationals of boycotted country X.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that the condition imposed on A is that Y-
origin goods may not be shipped or permitted to be transshipped to any 
companies which Y lists as being owned by persons whose national origin 
is X.
    A may not agree to this condition, because it is a restriction 
designed to prevent Y-origin goods from being exported to persons of a 
particular national origin rather than to residents or nationals of a 
particular boycotted country.
    (vii) A, a U.S. petroleum company, exports petroleum products to 20 
countries, including the United States, from boycotting country Y. Y 
requires, as a condition of sale, that A not ship the products to be 
exported from Y to or through boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with this requirement because it is an 
export requirement of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from 
coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycotted 
country.
    (viii) Same as (vii), except that boycotting country Y's export 
regulations require that products to be exported from Y not pass through 
a port of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations prohibiting Y-origin 
exports from passing through a port at boycotted country X, because they 
are export requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from 
coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycotted 
country.
    (ix) Same as (vii), except that Y's export regulations require that 
A not transship the exported products ``in or at'' boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect to the 
transshipment of goods ``in or at'' X, because they are export 
requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from coming into 
contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycotted country.

    (f) Immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a 
boycotting country.

[[Page 478]]

Compliance With Immigration, Passport, Visa, or Employment Requirements 
                         of a Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States individual may comply or agree to comply with 
the immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a 
boycotting country, and with requests for information from a boycotting 
country made to ascertain whether such individual meets requirements for 
employment within the boycotting country, provided that he furnishes 
information only about himself or a member of his family, and not about 
any other United States individual, including his employees, employers, 
or co-workers.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a United States individual means a 
person who is a resident or national of the United States. Family means 
immediate family members, including parents, siblings, spouse, children, 
and other dependents living in the individual's home.
    (3) A United States person may not furnish information about its 
employees or executives, but may allow any individual to respond on his 
own to any request for information relating to immigration, passport, 
visa, or employment requirements. A United States person may also 
perform any ministerial acts to expedite processing of applications by 
individuals. These include informing employees of boycotting country 
visa requirements at an appropriate time; typing, translation, messenger 
and similar services; and assisting in or arranging for the expeditious 
processing of applications. All such actions must be undertaken on a 
non-discriminatory basis.
    (4) A United States person may proceed with a project in a 
boycotting country even if certain of its employees or other prospective 
participants in a transaction are denied entry for boycott reasons. But 
no employees or other participants may be selected in advance in a 
manner designed to comply with a boycott.

 Examples of Compliance With Immigration, Passport, Visa, or Employment 
                  Requirements of a Boycotting Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with immigration, passport, visa, 
or employment requirements is permissible. They are illustrative, not 
comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. individual employed by B, a U.S. manufacturer of 
sporting goods with a plant in boycotting country Y, wishes to obtain a 
work visa so that he may transfer to the plant in Y. Country Y's 
immigration laws specify that anyone wishing to enter the country or 
obtain a visa to work in the country must supply information about his 
religion. This information is required for boycott purposes.
    A may furnish such information, because it is required by Y's 
immigration laws.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that A is asked to supply such information 
about other employees of B.
    A may not supply this information, because it is not information 
about himself or his family.
    (iii) A, a U.S. building contractor, has been awarded a construction 
contract to be performed in boycotting country Y. Y's immigration laws 
require that individuals applying for visas must indicate race, 
religion, and place of birth. The information is sought for boycott 
purposes. To avoid repeated rejections of applications for work visas by 
A's employees, A desires to furnish to country Y a list of its 
prospective and current employees and required information about each so 
that Y can make an initial screening.
    A may not furnish such a list, because A would be furnishing 
information about the race, religion, and national origin of its 
employees.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A selects for work on the project 
those of its current employees whom it believes will be granted work 
visas from boycotting country Y.
    A may not make a selection from among its employees in a manner 
designed to comply with the boycott-based visa requirements of Y, but 
must allow all eligible employees to apply for visas. A may later 
substitute an employee who obtains the necessary visa for one who has 
had his application rejected.
    (v) Same as (iii), except that A selects employees for the project 
and then allows each employee individually to apply for his own visa. 
Two employees' applications are rejected, and A then substitutes two 
other employees who, in turn, submit their own visa applications.
    A may take such action, because in so doing A is not acting in 
contravention of any prohibition of this part.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that A arranges for the translation, typing 
and processing of its employees' applications, and transmits all the 
applications to the consulate of boycotting country Y.
    A may take such ministerial actions, because in so doing A is not 
itself furnishing information with respect to race, religion,

[[Page 479]]

sex, or national origin, but is merely transmitting information 
furnished by its individual employees.
    (vii) A, a U.S. contractor, selects U.S. subcontractor B to perform 
certain engineering services in connection with A's project in 
boycotting country Y. The work visa application submitted by the 
employee whom B has proposed as chief engineer of this project is 
rejected by Y because his national origin is of boycotted country X. 
Subcontractor B thereupon withdraws.
    A may continue with the project and select another subcontractor, 
because A is not acting in contravention of any prohibition of this 
part.

    (g) Compliance with local law. (1) This exception contains two 
parts. The first covers compliance with local law with respect to a 
United States person's activities exclusively within a foreign country; 
the second covers compliance with local import laws by United States 
persons resident in a foreign country. Under both parts of this 
exception, local laws are laws of the host country, whether derived from 
statutes, regulations, decrees, or other official sources having the 
effect of law in the host country. This exception is not available for 
compliance with presumed policies or understandings of policies unless 
those policies are reflected in official sources having the effect of 
law.
    (2) Both parts of this exception apply only to United States persons 
resident in a foreign country. For purposes of this exception, a United 
States person will be considered to be a resident of a foreign country 
only if he is a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona 
fide resident of a foreign country even if such person's residency is 
temporary.
    (3)(i) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a 
United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country 
include:
    (A) Physical presence in the country;
    (B) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;
    (C) Continuity of the residency;
    (D) Intent to maintain the residency;
    (E) Prior residence in the country;
    (F) Size and nature of presence in the country;
    (G) Whether the person is registered to do business or incorporated 
in the country;
    (H) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and
    (I) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting and 
non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business 
activities.
    (ii) No one of the factors in paragraph (g)(3) of this section is 
dispositive. All the circumstances involved will be closely examined to 
ascertain whether there is, in fact, bona fide residency. Residency 
established solely for purposes of avoidance of the application of this 
part, unrelated to legitimate business needs, does not constitute bona 
fide residency.

                     Examples of Bona Fide Residency

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which a United States person may be a bona fide 
resident of a foreign country. For purposes of illustration, each 
example discusses only one or two factors, instead of all relevant 
factors. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. radio manufacturer located in the United States, 
receives a tender to bid on a contract to supply radios for a hotel to 
be built in boycotting country Y. After examining the proposal, A sends 
a bid from its New York office to Y.
    A is not a resident of Y, because it is not physically present in Y.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that after receiving the tender, A sends 
its sales representative to Y. A does not usually have sales 
representatives in countries when it bids from the United States, and 
this particular person's presence in Y is not necessary to enable A to 
make the bid.
    A is not a bona fide resident of Y, because it has no legitimate 
business reasons for having its sales representative resident in Y.
    (iii) A, a U.S. bank, wishes to establish a branch office in 
boycotting country Y. In pursuit of that objective, A's personnel visit 
Y to make the necessary arrangements. A intends to establish a permanent 
branch office in Y after the necessary arrangements are made.
    A's personnel in Y are not bona fide residents of Y, because A does 
not yet have a permanent business operation in Y.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except A's personnel are required by Y's laws to 
furnish certain non-discriminatory boycott information in order to 
establish a branch in Y.
    In these limited circumstances, A's personnel may furnish the non-
discriminatory boycott information necessary to establish residency to 
the same extent a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident in that 
country

[[Page 480]]

could. If this information could not be furnished in such limited 
circumstances, the exception would be available only to firms resident 
in a boycotting country before January 18, 1978.
    (v) A, a U.S. construction company, receives an invitation to build 
a power plant in boycotting country Y. After receipt of the invitation, 
A's personnel visit Y in order to survey the site and make necessary 
analyses in preparation for submitting a bid. The invitation requires 
that otherwise prohibited boycott information be furnished with the bid.
    A's personnel in Y are not bona fide residents of Y, because A has 
no permanent business operation in Y. Therefore, A's personnel may not 
furnish the prohibited information.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that A is considering establishing an 
office in boycotting country Y. A's personnel visit Y in order to 
register A to do business in that country. A intends to establish 
ongoing construction operations in Y. A's personnel are required by Y's 
laws to furnish certain non-discriminatory boycott information in order 
to register A to do business or incorporate a subsidiary in Y.
    In these limited circumstances, A's personnel may furnish non-
discriminatory boycott information necessary to establish residency to 
the same extent a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident in that 
country could. If this information could not be furnished in such 
limited circumstances, the exception would be available only to firms 
resident in a boycotting country before January 18, 1978.
    (vii) A, a subsidiary of U.S. oil company B, is located in 
boycotting country Y. A has been engaged in oil explorations in Y for a 
number of years.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because of its pre-existing 
continuous presence in Y for legitimate business reasons.
    (viii) Same as (vii), except that A has just been established in Y 
and has not yet begun operations.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because it is present in Y for 
legitimate business reasons and it intends to reside continuously.
    (ix) U.S. company A is a manufacturer of prefabricated homes. A 
builds a plant in boycotting country Y for purposes of assembling 
components made by A in the United States and shipped to Y.
    A's personnel in Y are bona fide residents of Y, because A's plant 
in Y is established for legitimate business reasons, and it intends to 
reside continuously.
    (x) U.S. company A has its principal place of business in the United 
States. A's sales agent visits boycotting country Y from time to time 
for purposes of soliciting orders.
    A's sales agent is not a bona fide resident of Y, because such 
periodic visits to Y are insufficient to establish a bona fide 
residency.
    (xi) A, a branch office of U.S. construction company B, is located 
in boycotting country Y. The branch office has been in existence for a 
number of years and has been performing various management services in 
connection with B's construction operations in Y.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because of its longstanding presence 
in Y and its conduct of ongoing operations in Y.
    (xii) U.S. construction company A has never done any business in 
boycotting country Y. It is awarded a contract to construct a hospital 
in Y, and preparatory to beginning construction, sends its personnel to 
Y to set up operations.
    A's personnel are bona fide residents of Y, because they are present 
in Y for the purposes of carrying out A's legitimate business purposes; 
they intend to reside continuously; and residency is necessary to 
conduct their business.
    (xiii) U.S. company A manufactures furniture. All its sales in 
foreign countries are conducted from its offices in the United States. 
From time to time A has considered opening sales offices abroad, but it 
has concluded that it is more efficient to conduct sales operations from 
the United States. Shortly after the effective date of this part, A 
sends a sales representative to boycotting country Y to open an office 
in and solicit orders from Y. It is more costly to conduct operations 
from that office than to sell directly from the United States, but A 
believes that if it establishes a residence in Y, it will be in a better 
position to avoid conflicts with U.S. law in its sales to Y.
    A's sales representative is not a bona fide resident of Y, because 
the residency was established to avoid the application of this part and 
not for legitimate business reasons.
    (xiv) Same as (xiii), except that it is in fact more efficient to 
have a sales office in Y. In fact, without a sales office in Y, A would 
find it difficult to explore business opportunities in Y. A is aware, 
however, that residency in Y would permit its sales representative to 
comply with Y's boycott laws.
    A's sales representative is a bona fide resident of Y, because A has 
a legitimate business reason for establishing a sales office in Y.
    (xv) U.S. company B is a computer manufacturer. B sells computers 
and related programming services tailored to the needs of individual 
clients. Because of the complex nature of the product, B must have sales 
representatives in any country where sales are made. B has a sales 
representative, A, in boycotting country Y. A spends two months of the 
year in Y, and the rest of the year in other countries. B has a 
permanent sales office from which A operates while in Y, and the sales 
office is stocked with brochures and other sales materials.

[[Page 481]]

    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because his presence in Y is 
necessary to carry out B's legitimate business purposes; B maintains a 
permanent office in Y; and B intends to continue doing business in Y in 
the future.
    (xvi) A, a U.S. construction engineering company, is engaged by B, a 
U.S. general contracting company, to provide services in connection with 
B's contract to construct a hospital complex in boycotting country Y. In 
order to perform those services, A's engineers set up a temporary office 
in a trailer on the construction site in Y. A's work is expected to be 
completed within six months.
    A's personnel in Y are bona fide residents of Y, because A's on-site 
office is necessary to the performance of its services for B, and 
because A's personnel are continuously there.
    (xvii) A, a U.S. company, sends one of its representatives to 
boycotting country Y to explore new sales possibilities for its line of 
transistor radios. After spending several weeks in Y, A's representative 
rents a post office box in Y, to which all persons interested in A's 
products are directed to make inquiry.
    A is not a bona fide resident of Y, because rental of a post office 
box is not a sufficient presence in Y to constitute residency.
    (xviii) A, a U.S. computer company, has a patent and trademark 
registered in the United States. In order to obtain registration of its 
patent and trademark in boycotting country Y, A is required to furnish 
certain non-discriminatory boycott information.
    A may not furnish the information, because A is not a bona fide 
resident of Y.

    (h) Activities exclusively within a foreign country. (1) Any United 
States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, 
including a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with the 
laws of that country with respect to his activities exclusively within 
that country. These activities include:
    (i) Entering into contracts which provide that local law applies or 
governs, or that the parties will comply with such laws;
    (ii) Employing residents of the host country;
    (iii) Retaining local contractors to perform work within the host 
country;
    (iv) Purchasing or selling goods or services from or to residents of 
the host country; and
    (v) Furnishing information within the host country.
    (2) Activities exclusively within the country do not include 
importing goods or services from outside the host country, and, 
therefore, this part of the exception does not apply to compliance with 
import laws in connection with importing goods or services.

   Examples of Permissible Compliance With Local Law With Respect to 
             Activities Exclusively Within a Foreign Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with local law is permissible. 
They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

             Activities Exclusively Within a Foreign Country

    (i) U.S. construction company A, a bona fide resident of boycotting 
country Y, has a contract to build a school complex in Y. Pursuant to 
Y's boycott laws, the contract requires A to refuse to purchase supplies 
from certain local merchants. While Y permits such merchants to operate 
within Y, their freedom of action in Y is constrained because of their 
relationship with boycotted country X.
    A may enter into the contract, because dealings with local merchants 
are activities exclusively within Y.
    (ii) A, a banking subsidiary of U.S. bank B, is a bona fide resident 
of boycotting country Y. From time to time, A purchases office supplies 
from the United States.
    A's purchase of office supplies is not an activity exclusively 
within Y, because it involves the import of goods from abroad.
    (iii) A, a branch of U.S. bank B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y. Under Y's boycott laws, A is required to supply 
information about whether A has any dealings with boycotted country X. A 
compiles and furnishes the information within Y and does so of its own 
knowledge.
    A may comply with that requirement, because in compiling and 
furnishing the information within Y, based on its own knowledge, A is 
engaging in an activity exclusively within Y.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A is required to supply information 
about B's dealings with X. From its own knowledge and without making any 
inquiry of B, A compiles and furnishes the information.
    A may comply with that requirement, because in compiling and 
furnishing the information within Y, based on its own knowledge, A is 
engaging in an activity exclusively within Y.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that in making its responses, A asks B to 
compile some of the information.
    A may not comply, because the gathering of the necessary information 
takes place partially outside Y.

[[Page 482]]

    (vi) U.S. company A has applied for a license to establish a 
permanent manufacturing facility in boycotting country Y. Under Y's 
boycott law, A must agree, as a condition of the license, that it will 
not sell any of its output to blacklisted foreign firms.
    A may not comply, because the agreement would govern activities of A 
which are not exclusively within Y.

              Discrimination Against United States Persons

    (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y. A manufactures air conditioners in its plant in Y. 
Under Y's boycott laws, A must agree not to hire nationals of boycotted 
country X.
    A may agree to the restriction and may abide by it with respect to 
its recruitment of individuals within Y, because the recruitment of such 
individuals is an activity exclusively within Y. However, A cannot abide 
by this restriction with respect to its recruitment of individuals 
outside Y, because this is not an activity exclusively within Y.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that pursuant to Y's boycott laws, A must 
agree not to hire anyone who is of a designated religion.
    A may not agree to this restriction, because the agreement calls for 
discrimination against U.S. persons on the basis of religion. It makes 
no difference whether the recruitment of the U.S. persons occurs within 
or without Y.
    (Note: The exception for compliance with local law does not apply to 
boycott-based refusals to employ U.S. persons on the basis of race, 
religion, sex, or national origin even if the activity is exclusively 
within the boycotting country.)
    (i) Compliance with local import law. (1) Any United States person 
who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, including a boycotting 
country, may, in importing goods, materials or components into that 
country, comply or agree to comply with the import laws of that country, 
provided that:
    (i) The items are for his own use or for his use in performing 
contractual services within that country; and
    (ii) In the normal course of business, the items are identifiable as 
to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the foreign 
country by:
    (a) Uniqueness of design or appearance; or
    (b) Trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the 
items themselves, including their packaging.
    (2) The factors that will be considered in determining whether a 
United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country are 
those set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. Bona fide residence of 
a United States company's subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent 
establishment in a foreign country does not confer such residence on 
such United States company. Likewise, bona fide residence of a United 
States company's employee in a foreign country does not confer such 
residence on the entire company.
    (3) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign 
country may take action under this exception through an agent outside 
the country, but the agent must act at the direction of the resident and 
not exercise his own discretion. Therefore, if a United States person 
resident in a boycotting country takes action to comply with a 
boycotting country's import law with respect to the importation of 
qualified goods, he may direct his agent in the United States on the 
action to be taken, but the United States agent himself may not exercise 
any discretion.
    (4) For purposes of this exception, the test that governs whether 
goods or components of goods are specifically identifiable is identical 
to the test applied in paragraph (d) of this section on ``Compliance 
With Unilateral and Specific Selection'' to determine whether they are 
identifiable as to their source or origin in the normal course of 
business.
    (5) The availability of this exception for the import of goods 
depends on whether the goods are intended for the United States person's 
own use at the time they are imported. It does not depend upon who has 
title to the goods at the time of importation into a foreign country.
    (6) Goods are for the United States person's own use (including the 
performance of contractual services within the foreign country) if:
    (i) They are to be consumed by the United States person;
    (ii) They are to remain in the United States person's possession and 
to be used by that person;
    (iii) They are to be used by the United States person in performing 
contractual services for another;
    (iv) They are to be further manufactured, incorporated into, refined 
into,

[[Page 483]]

or reprocessed into another product to be manufactured for another; or
    (v) They are to be incorporated into, or permanently affixed as a 
functional part of, a project to be constructed for another.
    (7) Goods acquired to fill an order for such goods from another are 
not for the United States person's own use. Goods procured for another 
are not for one's own use, even if the furnishing of procurement 
services is the business in which the United States person is 
customarily engaged. Nor are goods obtained for simple resale acquired 
for one's own use, even if the United States person is engaged in the 
retail business. Likewise, goods obtained for inclusion in a turnkey 
project are not for one's own use if they are not customarily 
incorporated into, or do not customarily become permanently affixed as a 
functional part of the project.
    (8) This part of the local law exception does not apply to the 
import of services, even when the United States person importing such 
services is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country and is 
importing them for his own use. In addition, this exception is available 
for a United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign 
country only when the individual or entity actually present within that 
country takes action through the exercise of his own discretion.
    (9) Use of this exception will be monitored and continually reviewed 
to determine whether its continued availability is consistent with the 
national interest. Its availability may be limited or withdrawn as 
appropriate. In reviewing the continued availability of this exception, 
the effect that the inability to comply with local import laws would 
have on the economic and other relations of the United States with 
boycotting countries will be considered.
    (10) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign 
country may comply or agree to comply with the host country's import 
laws even if he knows or has reason to know that particular laws are 
boycott-related. However, no United States person may comply or agree to 
comply with any host country law which would require him to discriminate 
against any United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or 
national origin, or to supply information about any United States 
person's race, religion, sex, or national origin.

        Examples of Permissible Compliance With Local Import Law

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with local import law is 
permissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

                   Compliance by a Bona Fide Resident

    (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y and is engaged in oil drilling operations in Y. In 
acquiring certain large, specifically identifiable products for carrying 
out its operations in Y, A chooses only from non-blacklisted firms 
because Y's import laws prohibit the importation of goods from 
blacklisted firms. However, with respect to smaller items, B makes the 
selection on behalf of A and sends them to A in Y.
    A may choose from non-blacklisted firms, because it is a U.S. person 
who is a bona fide resident in Y. However, because B is not resident in 
Y, B cannot make boycott-based selections to conform with Y's import 
laws prohibiting the importation of goods from blacklisted firms.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that after making its choices on the larger 
items, A directs B to carry out its instructions by entering into 
appropriate contracts and making necessary shipping arrangements.
    B may carry out A's instructions provided that A, a bona fide 
resident of Y, has in fact made the choice and B is exercising no 
discretion, but is acting only as A's agent.
    (Note: Such transactions between related companies will be 
scrutinized carefully. A must in fact exercise the discretion and make 
the selections. If the discretion is exercised by B, B would be in 
violation of this part.)
    (iii) U.S. construction company A has a contract to build a school 
in boycotting country Y. A's employees set up operations in Y for 
purposes of commencing construction. A's employees in Y advise A's 
headquarters in the United States that Y's import laws prohibit 
importation of goods manufactured by blacklisted firms. A's headquarters 
then issues invitations to bid only to non-blacklisted firms for certain 
specifically identifiable goods.
    A's headquarters' choice of non-blacklisted suppliers is not a 
choice made by a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident of Y, because 
the discretion in issuing the bids was exercised in the United States, 
not in Y.

[[Page 484]]

    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A's employees in Y actually make the 
decision regarding to whom the bids should be issued.
    The choices made by A's employees are choices made by U.S. persons 
who are bona fide residents of Y, because the discretion in choosing was 
exercised solely in Y.
    (Note: Choices purportedly made by employees of U.S. companies who 
are resident in boycotting countries will be carefully scrutinized to 
ensure that the discretion was exercised entirely in the boycotting 
country.)

                     Specifically Identifiable Goods

    The test and examples as to what constitutes specifically 
identifiable goods are identical to those applicable under paragraph (d) 
of this section on ``Compliance With Unilateral Selection.''

       Imports for U.S. Person's Own Use Within Boycotting Country

    (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y. A plans to import computer operated machine tools 
to be installed in its automobile plant in boycotting country Y. The 
computers are mounted on a separate bracket on the side of the equipment 
and are readily identifiable by brand name. A orders the tools from U.S. 
supplier C and specifies that C must incorporate computers manufactured 
by D, a non-blacklisted company. A would have chosen computers 
manufactured by E, except that E is blacklisted, and Y's import laws 
prohibit the importation of goods manufactured by blacklisted firms.
    A may refuse to purchase E's computers, because A is importing the 
computers for its own use in its manufacturing operations in Y.
    (ii) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y. To meet the needs of its employees in Y, A imports 
certain specifically identifiable commissary items for sale, such as 
cosmetics; and canteen items, such as candy. In selecting such items for 
importation into Y, A chooses items made only by non-blacklisted firms, 
because Y's import laws prohibit importation of goods from blacklisted 
firms.
    A may import these items only from non-blacklisted firms, because 
the importation of goods for consumption by A's employees is an 
importation for A's own use.
    (iii) A, a U.S. construction company which is a bona fide resident 
of boycotting country Y, has a contract to build a hospital complex for 
the Ministry of Health in Y. Under the contract, A will be general 
manager of the project with discretion to choose all subcontractors and 
suppliers. The complex is to be built on a turnkey basis, with A 
retaining title to the property and bearing all financial risk until the 
complex is conveyed to Y. In choosing specifically identifiable goods 
for import, such as central air conditioning units and plate glass, A 
excludes blacklisted suppliers in order to comply with Y's import laws. 
These goods are customarily incorporated into, or permanently affixed as 
a functional part of, the project.
    A may refuse to deal with blacklisted suppliers of specifically 
identifiable goods, because importation of goods by a general contractor 
to be incorporated into a construction project in Y is an importation of 
goods for A's own use.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that, in addition, in choosing U.S. 
architects and engineers to work on the project, A excludes blacklisted 
firms, because Y's import laws prohibit the use of services rendered by 
blacklisted persons.
    A may not refuse to deal with blacklisted architectural or 
engineering firms, because this exception does not apply to the import 
of services. It is irrelevant that, at some stage, the architectural or 
engineering drawings or plans may be brought to the site in Y. This 
factor is insufficient to transform such services into ``goods'' for 
purposes of this exception.
    (v) Same as (iii), except that the project is to be completed on a 
``cost plus'' basis, with Y making progress payments to A at various 
stages of completion.
    A may refuse to deal with blacklisted suppliers of specifically 
identifiable goods, because the importation of goods by A to be 
incorporated in a project A is under contract to complete is an 
importation of goods for its own use. The terms of payment are 
irrelevant.
    (vi) A, a U.S. construction company which is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y, has a contract for the construction of an office 
building in Y on a turnkey basis. In choosing goods to be used or 
included in the office complex, A orders wallboard, office partitions, 
and lighting fixtures from non-blacklisted manufacturers. A likewise 
orders desks, office chairs, typewriters, and office supplies from non-
blacklisted manufacturers.
    Because they are customarily incorporated into or permanently 
affixed as a functional part of an office building, the wallboard, 
office partitions, and lighting fixtures are for A's own use, and A may 
select non-blacklisted suppliers of these goods in order to comply with 
Y's import laws. Because they are not customarily incorporated into or 
permanently affixed to the project, the desks, office chairs, 
typewriters, and office supplies are not for A's own use, and A may not 
make boycott-based selections of the suppliers of these goods.
    (vii) A, a U.S. company engaged in the business of selling 
automobiles, is a bona

[[Page 485]]

fide resident of boycotting country Y. In ordering automobiles from time 
to time for purposes of stocking its inventory, A purchases from U.S. 
manufacturer B, but not U.S. manufacturer C, because C is blacklisted. 
Retail sales are subsequently made from this inventory.
    A's import of automobiles from B is not an import for A's own use, 
because the importation of items for general inventory in a retail sales 
operation is not an importation for one's own use.
    (viii) A, a U.S. company engaged in the manufacture of 
pharmaceutical products, is a bona fide resident of boycotting country 
Y. In importing chemicals for incorporation into the pharmaceutical 
products, A purchases from U.S. supplier B, but not U.S. supplier C, 
because C is blacklisted.
    A may import chemicals from B rather than C, because the importation 
of specifically identifiable items for incorporation into another 
product is an importation for one's own use.
    (ix) A, a U.S. management company which is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y, has a contract with the Ministry of Education in Y 
to purchase supplies for Y's school system. From time to time, A 
purchases goods from abroad for delivery to various schools in Y.
    A's purchase of goods for Y's school system does not constitute an 
importation of goods for A's own use, because A is acting as a 
procurement agent for another. A, therefore, cannot make boycott-based 
selections of suppliers of such school supplies.
    (x) A, a U.S. company which is a bona fide resident of boycotting 
country Y, has a contract to make purchases for Y in connection with a 
construction project in Y. A is not engaged in the construction of, or 
in any other activity in connection with, the project. A's role is 
merely to purchase goods for Y and arrange for their delivery to Y.
    A is not purchasing goods for its own use, because A is acting as a 
procurement agent for Y. A, therefore, cannot make boycott selections of 
suppliers of such goods.
    (xi) A, a U.S. company which is a bona fide resident of boycotting 
country Y, imports specifically identifiable goods into Y for exhibit by 
A at a trade fair in Y. In selecting goods for exhibit, A excludes items 
made by blacklisted firms.
    A's import of goods for its exhibit at a trade fair constitutes an 
import for A's own use. However, A may not sell in Y those goods it 
imported for exhibit.
    (xii) A is a bona fide resident of boycotting countries Y and Z. In 
compliance with Y's boycott laws, A chooses specifically identifiable 
goods for its oil drilling operations in Y and Z by excluding 
blacklisted suppliers. The goods are first imported into Y. Those 
purchased for A's use in Z are then transshipped to Z.
    In selecting those goods for importation into Y, A is making an 
import selection for its own use, even though A may use some of the 
imported goods in Z. Further, the subsequent shipment from Y to Z of 
those goods purchased for use in Z is an import into Z for A's own use.

Sec. 760.4  Evasion.

    (a) No United States person may engage in any transaction or take 
any other action, either independently or through any other person, with 
intent to evade the provisions of this part. Nor may any United States 
person assist another United States person to violate or evade the 
provisions of this part.
    (b) The exceptions set forth in Sec. 760.3(a) through (i) do not 
permit activities or agreements (express or implied by a course of 
conduct, including a pattern of responses) which are otherwise 
prohibited by this part and which are not within the intent of such 
exceptions. However, activities within the coverage and intent of the 
exceptions set forth in this part do not constitute evasion regardless 
of how often such exceptions are utilized.
    (c) Use of any artifice, device or scheme which is intended to place 
a person at a commercial disadvantage or impose on him special burdens 
because he is blacklisted or otherwise restricted for boycott reasons 
from having a business relationship with or in a boycotting country will 
be regarded as evasion for purposes of this part.
    (d) Unless permitted under one of the exceptions, use of risk of 
loss provisions that expressly impose a financial risk on another 
because of the import laws of a boycotting country may constitute 
evasion. If they are introduced after January 18, 1978, their use will 
be presumed to constitute evasion. This presumption may be rebutted by a 
showing that such a provision is in customary usage without distinction 
between boycotting and non-boycotting countries and that there is a 
legitimate non-boycott reason for its use. On the other hand, use of 
such a provision by a United States person subsequent to January 18, 
1978 is presumed not to constitute evasion if the provision had

[[Page 486]]

been customarily used by that person prior to January 18, 1978.
    (e) Use of dummy corporations or other devices to mask prohibited 
activity will also be regarded as evasion. Similarly, it is evasion 
under this part to divert specific boycotting country orders from a 
United States parent to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of complying 
with prohibited boycott requirements. However, alteration of a person's 
structure or method of doing business will not constitute evasion so 
long as the alteration is based on legitimate business considerations 
and is not undertaken solely to avoid the application of the 
prohibitions of this part. The facts and circumstances of an arrangement 
or transaction will be carefully scrutinized to see whether appearances 
conform to reality.

                                Examples

    The following examples are intended to give guidance to persons in 
determining circumstances in which this section will apply. They are 
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. insurance company, receives a request from boycotting 
country Y asking whether it does business in boycotted country X. 
Because furnishing such information is prohibited, A declines to answer 
and as a result is placed on Y's blacklist. The following year, A's 
annual report contains new information about A's worldwide operations, 
including a list of all countries in which A does business. A then mails 
a copy of its annual report, which has never before contained such 
information, to officials of the government of country Y.
    Absent some business justification unrelated to the boycott for 
changing the annual report in this fashion, A's action constitutes 
evasion of this part.
    (ii) A, a U.S. construction firm resident in boycotting country Y, 
orders lumber from U.S. company B. A unilaterally selects B in part 
because U.S. lumber producer C is blacklisted by Y and C's products are 
therefore not importable. In placing its order with B, A requests that B 
stamp its name or logo on the lumber so that A ``can be certain that it 
is, in fact, receiving B's products.'' B does not normally so stamp its 
lumber, and A's purpose in making the request is to appear to fit within 
the unilateral selection exception of this part.
    Absent additional facts justifying A's action, A's action 
constitutes evasion of this part.
    (iii) A, a U.S. company, has been selling sewing machines to 
boycotting country Y for a number of years. A receives a request for a 
negative certificate of origin from a new customer. A is aware that 
furnishing such certificates are prohibited; therefore, A arranges to 
have all future shipments run through a foreign corporation in a third 
country which will affix the necessary negative certificate before 
forwarding the machines on to Y.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a device 
to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    (iv) A, a U.S. company, has been selling calculators to distributor 
B in country C for a number of years and routinely supplies positive 
certificates of origin. A receives an order from country Y which 
requires negative certificates of origin. A arranges to make all future 
sales to distributor B in country C. A knows B will step in and make the 
sales to Y which A would otherwise have made directly. B will make the 
necessary negative certifications. A's warranty, which it will continue 
to honor, runs to the purchaser in Y.
    A's action constitutes evasion, because the diverting of orders to B 
is a device to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    (v) A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a long-term contract with 
boycotting country Y to meet all Y's medical supply needs. Y informs A 
that before such a contract can be concluded, A must complete Y's 
boycott questionnaire. A knows that it is prohibited from answering the 
questionnaire so it arranges for a local agent in Y to supply the 
necessary information.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a device 
to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    (vi) A, a U.S. contractor which has not previously dealt with 
boycotting country Y, is awarded a construction contract by Y. Because 
it is customary in the construction industry for a contractor to 
establish an on-site facility for the duration of the project, A 
establishes such an office, which satisfies the requirements for bona 
fide residency. Thereafter, A's office in Y takes a number of actions 
permitted under the compliance with local law exception.
    A's actions do not constitute evasion, because A's facility in Y was 
established for legitimate business reasons.
    (vii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is 
located in non-boycotting country M. A and B both make machine tools for 
sale in their respective marketing regions. B's marketing region 
includes boycotting country Y. After assessing the requirements of this 
part, B decides that it can no longer make machines for sale in Y. 
Instead, A decides to expand its facilities in M in order to service the 
Y market.
    The actions of A and B do not constitute evasion, because there is a 
legitimate business reason for their actions. It is irrelevant that the 
effect may be to place sales which

[[Page 487]]

would otherwise have been subject to this part beyond the reach of this 
part.
    (viii) A, a U.S. manufacturer, from time to time receives purchase 
orders from boycotting country Y which A fills from its plant in the 
United States. A knows that it is about to receive an order from Y which 
contains a request for a certification which A is prohibited from 
furnishing under this part. In order to permit the certification to be 
made, A diverts the purchase order to its foreign subsidiary.
    A's diversion of the purchase order constitutes evasion of this 
part, because it is a device to mask prohibited activity carried out on 
A's behalf.
    (ix) A, a U.S. company, is engaged in assembling drilling rigs for 
shipment to boycotting country Y. Because of potential difficulties in 
securing entry into Y of materials supplied by blacklisted firms, A 
insists that blacklisted firms take a 15 percent discount on all 
materials which they supply to A. As a result, no blacklisted firms are 
willing to transact with A.
    A's insistence on the discount for materials supplied by blacklisted 
firms constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a device or scheme 
which is intended to place a special burden on blacklisted firms because 
of Y's boycott.
    (x) Same as (ix), except that shortly after January 18, 1978, A, a 
U.S. company, insists that its suppliers sign contracts which provide 
that even after title passes from the supplier to A, the supplier will 
bear the risk of loss and indemnify A if goods which the supplier has 
furnished are denied entry into Y for boycott reasons.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a device 
or scheme which is intended to place a special burden on blacklisted 
persons because of Y's boycott.
    (xi) Same as (x), except that A customarily insisted on such an 
arrangement with its supplier prior to January 18, 1978.
    A's action is presumed not to constitute evasion, because use of 
this contractual arrangement was customary for A prior to January 18, 
1978.
    (xii) A, a U.S. company, has a contract to supply automobile sub-
assembly units to boycotting country Y. Shortly after January 18, 1978, 
A insists that its suppliers sign contracts which provide that even 
after title passes to A, the supplier will bear the risk of loss and 
indemnify A if goods which the supplier has furnished are denied entry 
into boycotting country Y for any reason.
    A's insistence on this arrangement is presumed to constitute 
evasion, because it is a device which is intended to place a special 
burden on blacklisted firms because of Y's boycott. The presumption may 
be rebutted by competent evidence showing that use of such an 
arrangement is customary without regard to the boycotting or non-
boycotting character of the country to which it relates and that there 
is a legitimate non-boycott business reason for its use.
    (xiii) Same as (vii), except that A requires that all suppliers make 
in-country delivery.
    A's action does not constitute evasion, because it is an ordinary 
commercial practice to require in-country delivery of goods.
    (xiv) Same as (xii), except that A requires that title remain with 
the supplier until delivery in Y has been made.
    A's action does not constitute evasion, because it is ordinary 
commercial practice to require that title remain with the supplier until 
delivery has been made. This example is distinguishable from example 
(xii), because in example (xii) A had insisted on an extraordinary 
arrangement designed to require that the risk of loss remain with the 
supplier even after title had passed to A.
    (xv) U.S. bank A is contacted by U.S. company B to finance B's 
transaction with boycotting country Y. Payment will be effected through 
a letter of credit in favor of B at its U.S. address. A knows that the 
letter of credit will contain restrictive boycott conditions which would 
bar its implementation by A if the beneficiary were a U.S. person. A 
advises B of the boycott condition and suggests to B that the 
beneficiary should be changed to C, a shell corporation in non-
boycotting country M. The beneficiary is changed accordingly.
    The actions of both A and B constitute evasion of this part, because 
the arrangement is a device to mask prohibited activities.
    (xvi) Same as (xv), except that U.S. company B, the beneficiary of 
the letter of credit, arranges to change the beneficiary to B's foreign 
subsidiary so that A can implement the letter of credit. A knows that 
this has been done.
    A's implementation of the letter of credit in the face of its 
knowledge of B's action constitutes evasion of this part, because A's 
action is part of a device to mask prohibited activity by both parties.
    (xvii) U.S. bank A, located in the United States, is contacted by 
foreign company B to finance B's transaction with boycotting country Y. 
B is a controlled subsidiary of a U.S. company. The transaction which is 
to be financed with a letter of credit payable to B at its foreign 
address, requires B to certify that none of its board members are of a 
particular religious faith. Since B cannot legally furnish the 
certificate, it asks A to convey the necessary information to Y through 
A's bank branch in Y. Such information would be furnished wholly outside 
the letter of credit transaction.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is 
undertaken to assist B's violation of this part.
    (xviii) U.S. bank A is asked by foreign corporation B to implement a 
letter of credit in

[[Page 488]]

favor of B so that B might perform under its long-term contract with 
boycotting country Y. Under the terms of the letter of credit, B is 
required to certify that none of its suppliers is blacklisted. A knows 
that it cannot implement a letter of credit with this condition, so it 
tells B to negotiate the elimination of this requirement from the letter 
of credit and instead supply the certification to Y directly.
    A's suggestion to B that it provide the negative certification to Y 
directly constitutes evasion of this part, because A is taking an action 
through another person to mask prohibited activity on A's part.

<R05>
Sec. 760.5  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Scope of reporting requirements. (1) A United States person who 
receives a request to take any action which has the effect of furthering 
or supporting a restrictive trade practice or boycott fostered or 
imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the United 
States or against any United States person must report such request to 
the Department of Commerce in accordance with the requirements of this 
section. Such a request may be either written or oral and may include a 
request to furnish information or enter into or implement an agreement. 
It may also include a solicitation, directive, legend or instruction 
that asks for information or that asks that a United States person take 
or refrain from taking a particular action. Such a request shall be 
reported regardless of whether the action requested is prohibited or 
permissible under this part, except as otherwise provided by this 
section.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a request received by a United 
States person is reportable if he knows or has reason to know that the 
purpose of the request is to enforce, implement, or otherwise further, 
support, or secure compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott or 
restrictive trade practice.
    (i) A request received by a United States person located in the 
United States is reportable if it is received in connection with a 
transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the 
United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(1) through (5) and (18) 
of this part.
    (ii) A request received by a United States person located outside 
the United States (that is, a foreign subsidiary, partnership, 
affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment 
which is controlled in fact by any domestic concern, as determined under 
Sec. 760.1(c) of this part) is reportable if it is received in 
connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(6) 
through (17) and (19) of this part.
    (iii) A request such as a boycott questionnaire, unrelated to a 
particular transaction or activity, received by any United States person 
is reportable when such person has or anticipates a business 
relationship with or in a boycotting country involving the sale, 
purchase or transfer of goods or services (including information) in the 
interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under 
Sec. 760.1(d) of this part.
    (3) These reporting requirements apply to all United States persons. 
They apply whether the United States person receiving the request is an 
exporter, bank or other financial institution, insurer, freight 
forwarder, manufacturer, or any other United States person subject to 
this part.
    (4) The acquisition of information about a boycotting country's 
boycott requirements through the receipt or review of books, pamphlets, 
legal texts, exporters' guidebooks and other similar publications does 
not constitute receipt of a reportable request for purposes of this 
section. In addition, a United States person who receives an unsolicited 
invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott request has 
not received a reportable request for purposes of this section where he 
does not respond to the invitation to bid or other proposal.
    (5) Because of the use of certain terms for boycott and non-boycott 
purposes; because of Congressional mandates to provide clear and precise

[[Page 489]]

guidelines in areas of inherent uncertainty; and because of the 
Department's commitment to minimize paperwork and reduce the cost of 
reporting where it will not impair the Department's ability to continue 
to monitor foreign boycotts, the following specific requests are not 
reportable:
    (i) A request to refrain from shipping goods on a carrier which 
flies the flag of a particular country or which is owned, chartered, 
leased or operated by a particular country or by nationals or residents 
of a particular country, or a request to certify to that effect.
    (ii) A request to ship goods via a prescribed route, or a request to 
refrain from shipping goods via a proscribed route, or a request to 
certify to either effect.
    (iii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification 
regarding the country of origin of goods.
    (iv) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification 
regarding the name of the supplier or manufacturer of the goods shipped 
or the name of the provider of services.
    (v) A request to comply with the laws of another country except 
where the request expressly requires compliance with that country's 
boycott laws.
    (vi) A request to an individual to supply information about himself 
or a member of his family for immigration, passport, visa, or employment 
purposes.
    (vii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification 
indicating the destination of exports or confirming or otherwise 
indicating that such cargo will be unloaded or discharged at a 
particular destination.
    (viii) A request to supply a certificate by the owner, master, 
charterer, or any employee thereof, that a vessel, aircraft, truck or 
any other mode of transportation is eligible, otherwise eligible, 
permitted, or allowed to enter, or not restricted from entering, a 
particular port, country, or group of countries pursuant to the laws, 
rules, or regulations of that port, country, or group of countries.
    (ix) A request to supply a certificate from an insurance company 
stating that the insurance company has a duly authorized agent or 
representative within a boycotting country and/or the name and address 
of such agent.
    (x) A request to comply with a term or condition of a transaction 
that provides that the vendor bear the risk of loss and indemnify the 
purchaser if the vendor's goods are denied entry into a country for any 
reason (``risk of loss clause'') if such clause was in use by the 
purchaser prior to January 18, 1978.
    (6) No United States person may engage in any transaction or take 
any other action, either independently or through any other person, with 
intent to evade the provisions of this part.
    (7) From time to time the Department will survey domestic concerns 
for purposes of determining the worldwide scope of boycott requests 
received by their controlled foreign subsidiaries and affiliates with 
respect to their activities outside United States commerce. This 
pertains to requests which would be reportable under this section but 
for the fact that the activities to which the requests relate are 
outside United States commerce. The information requested will include 
the number and nature of non-reportable boycott requests received, the 
action(s) requested, the actions(s) taken in response and the countries 
in which the requests originate. The results of such surveys, including 
the names of those surveyed, will be made public.
    (b) Manner of reporting. (1) Each reportable request must be 
reported. However, if more than one document (such as an invitation to 
bid, purchase order, or letter of credit) containing the same boycott 
request is received as part of the same transaction, only the first such 
request need be reported. Individual shipments against the same purchase 
order or letter of credit are to be treated as part of the same 
transaction. Each different boycott request associated with a given 
transaction must be reported, regardless of how or when the request is 
received.
    (2) Each United States person actually receiving a reportable 
request must report that request. However, such person may designate 
someone else to report on his behalf. For example, a United States 
company, if authorized, may report on behalf of its controlled foreign 
subsidiary or affiliates; a freight forwarder, if authorized,

[[Page 490]]

may report on behalf of the exporter; and a bank, if authorized, may 
report on behalf of the beneficiary of a letter of credit. If a person 
designated to report a request received by another receives an identical 
request directed to him in connection with the same transaction, he may 
file one report on behalf of himself and the other person.
    (3) Where a person is designated to report on behalf of another, the 
person receiving the request remains liable for any failure to report or 
for any representations made on his behalf. Further, anyone reporting on 
behalf of another is not relieved of his own responsibility for 
reporting any boycott request which he receives, even if it is an 
identical request in connection with the same transaction.
    (4) Reports must be submitted in duplicate to: Report Processing 
Staff, Office of Antiboycott Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Room 6098, Washington, D.C. 20230. Each submission must be made in 
accordance with the following requirements:
    (i) Where the person receiving the request is a United States person 
located in the United States, each report of requests must be postmarked 
by the last day of the month following the calendar quarter in which the 
request was received (e.g., April 30 for the quarter consisting of 
January, February, and March).
    (ii) Where the person receiving the request is a United States 
person located outside the United States, each report of requests must 
be postmarked by the last day of the second month following the calendar 
quarter in which the request was received (e.g., May 31 for the quarter 
consisting of January, February, and March).
    (5) At the reporting person's option, reports may be submitted on 
either a single transaction form (Form BXA-621P, Report of Restrictive 
Trade Practice or Boycott Request Single Transaction (revised 10-89)) or 
on a multiple transaction form (Form BXA-6051P, Report of Request for 
Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott Multiple Transactions (revised 10-
89)). Use of the multiple transaction form permits the reporting person 
to provide on one form all required information relating to as many as 
75 reportable requests received within any single reporting period.
    (6) Reports, whether submitted on the single transaction form or on 
the multiple transaction form, must contain entries for every applicable 
item on the form, including whether the reporting person intends to take 
or has taken the action requested. If the reporting person has not 
decided what action he will take by the time the report is required to 
be filed, he must later report the action he decides to take within 10 
business days after deciding. In addition, anyone filing a report on 
behalf of another must so indicate and identify that other person.
    (7) Each report of a boycott request must be accompanied by two 
copies of the relevant page(s) of any document(s) in which the request 
appears. Reports may also be accompanied by any additional information 
relating to the request as the reporting person desires to provide 
concerning his response to the request.
    (8) Records containing information relating to a reportable boycott 
request, including a copy of any document(s) in which the request 
appears, must be maintained by the recipient for a five-year period 
after receipt of the request. The Department may require that these 
materials be submitted to it or that it have access to them at any time 
within that period. (See part 762 of the EAR for additional 
recordkeeping requirements.)
    (c) Disclosure of information. (1) Reports of requests received on 
or after October 7, 1976, as well as any accompanying documents filed 
with the reports, have been and will continue to be made available for 
public inspection and copying, except for certain proprietary 
information. With respect to reports of requests received on or after 
August 1, 1978, if the person making the report certifies that a United 
States person to whom the report relates would be placed at a 
competitive disadvantage because of the disclosure of information 
regarding the quantity, description, or value of any articles, 
materials, and supplies, including related technical data and other 
information, whether contained in a report or in any accompanying 
document(s), such information will not be publicly

[[Page 491]]

disclosed except upon failure by the reporting entity to edit the public 
inspection copy of the accompanying document(s) as provided by paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that 
the disclosure would not place the United States person involved at a 
competitive disadvantage or that it would be contrary to the national 
interest to withhold the information. In the event the Secretary of 
Commerce considers making such a determination concerning competitive 
disadvantage, appropriate notice and an opportunity for comment will be 
given before any such proprietary information is publicly disclosed. In 
no event will requests of reporting persons to withhold any information 
contained in the report other than that specified in this paragraph be 
honored.
    (2) Because a copy of any document(s) accompanying the report will 
be made available for public inspection and copying, one copy must be 
submitted intact and another copy must be edited by the reporting entity 
to delete the same information which it certified in the report would 
place a United States person at a competitive disadvantage if disclosed. 
In addition, the reporting entity may delete from this copy information 
that is considered confidential and that is not required to be contained 
in the report (e.g., information related to foreign consignee). This 
copy should be conspicuously marked with the legend ``Public Inspection 
Copy.'' With respect to documents accompanying reports received by the 
Department on or after July 1, 1979, the public inspection copy will be 
made available as submitted whether or not it has been appropriately 
edited by the reporting entity as provided by this paragraph.
    (3) Reports and accompanying documents which are available to the 
public for inspection and copying are located in the BXA Freedom of 
Information Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of 
Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20230. Requests to inspect such documents should be addressed to that 
facility.
    (4) The Secretary of Commerce will periodically transmit summaries 
of the information contained in the reports to the Secretary of State 
for such action as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Commerce, may deem appropriate for carrying out the 
policies in section 8(b)(2) of the Export Administration Act of 1979.

                                Examples

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
what is reportable. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycotting country 
Y and is asked by Y to certify that it is not blacklisted by Y's boycott 
office.
    The request to A is reportable, because it is a request to A to 
comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (ii) A, a U.S. manufacturing company, receives an order for tractors 
from boycotting country Y. Y's order specifies that the tires on the 
tractors be made by B, another U.S. company. A believes Y has specified 
B as the tire supplier because otherwise A would have used tires made by 
C, a blacklisted company, and Y will not take shipment of tractors 
containing tires made by blacklisted companies.
    A must report Y's request for tires made by B, because A has reason 
to know that B was chosen for boycott reasons.
    (iii) Same as (ii), except A knows that Y's request has nothing to 
do with the boycott but simply reflects Y's preference for tires made by 
B.
    Y's request is not reportable, because it is unrelated to Y's 
boycott.
    (iv) Same as (ii), except A neither knows nor has reason to know why 
Y has chosen B.
    Y's request is not reportable, because A neither knows nor has 
reason to know that Y's request is based on Y's boycott.
    (v) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a 
resident of boycotting country Y. A is a general contractor. After being 
supplied by A with a list of competent subcontractors, A's customer 
instructs A to use subcontractor C on the project. A believes that C was 
chosen because, among other things, the other listed subcontractors are 
blacklisted.
    The instruction to A by its customer that C be used on the project 
is reportable, because it is a request to comply with Y's boycott 
requirements.
    (vi) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is 
located in non-boycotting country P. A receives an order for washing 
machines from boycotting country Y. Y instructs A that a negative 
certificate of origin must accompany the shipment. The washing machines 
are made wholly in P, without U.S. components.

[[Page 492]]

    Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate of origin is 
not reportable, because the transaction to which it relates is not in 
U.S. commerce.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that A obtains components from the United 
States for the purpose of filling the order from Y. Y's instruction to A 
regarding the negative certificate of origin is reportable, because the 
transaction to which it relates is in U.S. commerce.
    (viii) A, a U.S. construction company, receives in the mail an 
unsolicited invitation to bid on a construction project in boycotting 
country Y. The invitation to bid requires those who respond to certify 
that they do not have any plants or branch offices in boycotted country 
X. A does not respond.
    A's receipt of the unsolicited invitation to bid is not reportable, 
because the request does not relate to any present or anticipated 
business of A with or in Y.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that A receives a boycott questionnaire 
from a central boycott office. A does not do business in any of the 
boycotting countries involved, and does not anticipate doing any 
business in those countries. A does not respond.
    A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is not reportable, because 
it does not relate to any present or anticipated business by A with or 
in a boycotting country.
    (x) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is seeking markets in which to expand 
its exports. A sends a representative to boycotting country Y to explore 
Y's potential as a market for A's products. A's representative discusses 
its products but does not enter into any contracts on that trip. A does, 
however, hope that sales will materialize in the future. Subsequently, A 
receives a boycott questionnaire from Y.
    A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, because the 
request relates to A's anticipated business with or in a boycotting 
country. For purposes of determining whether a report is required, it 
makes no difference whether A responds to the questionnaire, and it 
makes no difference that actual sales contracts are not in existence or 
do not materialize.
    (xi) Same as (x), except that A's representative enters into a 
contract to sell A's products to a buyer in boycotting country Y. 
Subsequently, A receives a boycott questionnaire from Y.
    A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, because it 
relates to A's present business with or in a boycotting country. For 
purposes of determining whether a report is required, it makes no 
difference whether A responds to the questionnaire.
    (xii) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, purchases an exporter's guidebook 
which includes the import requirements of boycotting country Y. The 
guidebook contains descriptions of actions which U.S. exporters must 
take in order to make delivery of goods to Y.
    A's acquisition of the guidebook is not reportable, because he has 
not received a request from anyone.
    (xiii) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for the shipment of 
goods to boycotting country Y at the request of B, a U.S. exporter. B 
asks A to assume responsibility to assure that the documentation 
accompanying the shipment is in compliance with Y's import requirements. 
A examines an exporters' guidebook, determines that Y's import 
regulations require a certification that the insurer of the goods is not 
blacklisted and asks U.S. insurer C for such a certification.
    B's request to A is reportable by A, because it constitutes a 
request to comply with Y's boycott as of the time A takes action to 
comply with Y's boycott requirements in response to the request. A's 
request to C is reportable by C.
    (xiv) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for the shipment of 
U.S. goods to boycotting country Y. The manufacturer supplies A with all 
the necessary documentation to accompany the shipment. Among the 
documents supplied by the manufacturer is his certificate that he 
himself is not blacklisted. A transmits the documentation supplied by 
the manufacturer.
    A's action in merely transmitting documents received from the 
manufacturer is not reportable, because A has received no request to 
comply with Y's boycott.
    (xv) Same as (xiv), except that A is asked by U.S. exporter B to 
assume the responsibility to assure that the necessary documentation 
accompanies the shipment whatever that documentation might be. B 
forwards to A a letter of credit which requires that a negative 
certificate of origin accompany the bill of lading. A supplies a 
positive certificate of origin.
    Both A and B must report receipt of the letter of credit, because it 
contains a request to both of them to comply with Y's boycott.
    (xvi) Same as (xiv), except that the manufacturer fails to supply a 
required negative certificate of origin, and A is subsequently asked by 
a consular official of Y to see to it that the certificate is supplied. 
A supplies a positive certificate of origin.
    The consular official's request to A is reportable by A, because A 
was asked to comply with Y's boycott requirements by supplying the 
negative certificate of origin.
    (xvii) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycotting 
country Y. Arrangements have been made for freight forwarder B to handle 
the shipment and secure all necessary shipping certifications. B notes 
that the letter of credit requires that the manufacturer supply a 
negative certificate of origin and B asks A to do so. A supplies a 
positive certificate of origin.

[[Page 493]]

    B's request to A is reportable by A, because A is asked to comply 
with Y's boycott requirements by providing the negative certificate.
    (xviii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a 
resident of boycotting country Y. A is engaged in oil exploration and 
drilling operations in Y. In placing orders for drilling equipment to be 
shipped from the United States, A, in compliance with Y's laws, selects 
only those suppliers who are not blacklisted.
    A's action in choosing non-blacklisted suppliers is not reportable, 
because A has not received a request to comply with Y's boycott in 
making these selections.
    (xix) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is 
seeking permission to do business in boycotting country Y. Before being 
granted such permission, A is asked to sign an agreement to comply with 
Y's boycott laws.
    The request to A is reportable, because it is a request that 
expressly requires compliance with Y's boycott law and is received in 
connection with A's anticipated business in Y.
    (xx) A, a U.S. bank, is asked by a firm in boycotting country Y to 
confirm a letter of credit in favor of B, a U.S. company. The letter of 
credit calls for a certificate from B that the goods to be supplied are 
not produced by a firm blacklisted by Y. A informs B of the letter of 
credit, including its certification condition, and sends B a copy.
    B must report the certification request contained in the letter of 
credit, and A must report the request to confirm the letter of credit 
containing the boycott condition, because both are being asked to comply 
with Y's boycott.
    (xxi) Same as (xx), except that the letter of credit calls for a 
certificate from the beneficiary that the goods will not be shipped on a 
vessel that will call at a port in boycotted country X before making 
delivery in Y.
    The request is not reportable, because it is a request of a type 
deemed by this section to be in common use for non-boycott purposes.
    (xxii) A, a U.S. company, receives a letter of credit from 
boycotting country Y stating that on no condition may a bank blacklisted 
by Y be permitted to negotiate the credit.
    A's receipt of the letter of credit is reportable, because it 
contains a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxiii) A, a U.S. bank, receives a demand draft from B, a U.S. 
company, in connection with B's shipment of goods to boycotting country 
Y. The draft contains a directive that it is valid in all countries 
except boycotted country X.
    A's receipt of the demand draft is reportable, because it contains a 
request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxiv) A, a U.S. exporter, receives an order from boycotting country 
Y. On the order is a legend that A's goods, invoices, and packaging must 
not bear a six-pointed star or other symbol of boycotted country X.
    A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains a 
request to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxv) Same as (xxiv), except the order contains a statement that 
goods exported must not represent part of war reparations to boycotted 
country X.
    A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains a 
request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxvi) A, a U.S. contractor, is negotiating with boycotting country 
Y to build a school in Y. During the course of the negotiations, Y 
suggests that one of the terms of the construction contract be that A 
agree not to import materials produced in boycotted country X. It is A's 
company policy not to agree to such a contractual clause, and A suggests 
that instead it agree that all of the necessary materials will be 
obtained from U.S. suppliers. Y agrees to A's suggestion and a contract 
is executed.
    A has received a reportable request, but, for purposes of reporting, 
the request is deemed to be received when the contract is executed.
    (xxvii) Same as (xxvi), except Y does not accept A's suggested 
alternative clause and negotiations break off.
    A's receipt of Y's request is reportable. For purposes of reporting, 
it makes no difference that A was not successful in the negotiations. 
The request is deemed to be received at the time the negotiations break 
off.
    (xxviii) A, a U.S. insurance company, is insuring the shipment of 
drilling equipment to boycotting country Y. The transaction is being 
financed by a letter of credit which requires that A certify that it is 
not blacklisted by Y. Freight forwarder B asks A to supply the 
certification in order to satisfy the requirements of the letter of 
credit.
    The request to A is reportable by A, because it is a request to 
comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxix) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is engaged from time-to-time in 
supplying drilling rigs to company B in boycotting country Y. B insists 
that its suppliers sign contracts which provide that, even after title 
passes from the supplier to B, the supplier will bear the risk of loss 
and indemnify B if goods which the supplier has furnished are denied 
entry into Y for whatever reason. A knows or has reason to know that 
this contractual provision is required by B because of Y's boycott, and 
that B has been using the provision since 1977. A receives an order from 
B which contains such a clause.
    B's request is not reportable by A, because the request is deemed to 
be not reportable by these regulations if the provision was in use by B 
prior to January 18, 1978.

[[Page 494]]

    (xxx) Same as (xxix), except that A does not know when B began using 
the provision.
    Unless A receives information from B that B introduced the term 
prior to January 18, 1978, A must report receipt of the request.
    (xxxi) A, a U.S. citizen, is a shipping clerk for B, a U.S. 
manufacturing company. In the course of his employment, A receives an 
order for goods from boycotting country Y. The order specifies that none 
of the components of the goods is to be furnished by blacklisted firms.
    B must report the request received by its employee, A, acting in the 
scope of his employment. Although A is a U.S. person, such an individual 
does not have a separate obligation to report requests received by him 
in his capacity as an employee of B.
    (xxxii) U.S. exporter A is negotiating a transaction with boycotting 
country Y. A knows that at the conclusion of the negotiations he will be 
asked by Y to supply certain boycott-related information and that such a 
request is reportable. In an effort to forestall the request and thereby 
avoid having to file a report, A supplies the information in advance.
    A is deemed to have received a reportable request.
    (xxxiii) A, a controlled foreign affiliate of U.S. company B, 
receives an order for computers from boycotting country Y and obtains 
components from the United States for the purpose of filling the order. 
Y instructs A that a negative certificate of origin must accompany the 
shipment.
    Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate of origin is 
reportable by A. Moreover, A may designate B or any other person to 
report on its behalf. However, A remains liable for any failure to 
report or for any representations made on its behalf.
    (xxxiv) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting country Y, 
receives a request from the customer in Y to state on the bill of lading 
that the vessel is allowed to enter Y's ports. The request further 
states that a certificate from the owner or master of the vessel to that 
effect is acceptable.
    The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportable 
because it is a request of a type deemed to be not reportable by these 
regulations. (A may not make such a statement on the bill of lading 
himself, if he knows or has reason to know it is requested for a boycott 
purpose.)
    (xxxv) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting country Y, 
receives a request from the customer in Y to furnish a certificate from 
the owner of the vessel that the vessel is permitted to call at Y's 
ports.
    The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportable 
because it is a request of a type deemed to be not reportable by these 
regulations.
    (xxxvi) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting country Y, 
receives a request from the customer in Y to furnish a certificate from 
the insurance company indicating that the company has a duly authorized 
representative in country Y and giving the name of that representative.
    The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportable if 
it was received after the effective date of these rules, because it is a 
request of a type deemed to be not reportable by these regulations.

[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34948, June 1, 2000]

              Supplement No. 1 to Part 760--Interpretations

    It has come to the Department's attention that some U.S. persons are 
being or may be asked to comply with new boycotting country requirements 
with respect to shipping and insurance certifications and certificates 
of origin. It has also come to the Department's attention that some U.S. 
persons are being or may be asked to agree to new contractual provisions 
in connection with certain foreign government or foreign government 
agency contracts. In order to maximize its guidance with respect to 
section 8 of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 
U.S.C. app. 2407) and part 760 of the EAR, the Department hereby sets 
forth its views on these certifications and contractual clauses.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Department originally issued this interpretation pursuant to 
the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1979 (Public Law 95-52) and 
the regulations on restrictive trade practices and boycotts (15 CFR part 
369) published on January 25, 1978 (43 FR 3508) and contained in the 15 
CFR edition revised as of January 1, 1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            I. Certifications

    Sec. 760.2(d) of this part prohibits a U.S. person from furnishing 
or knowingly agreeing to furnish:
    ``Information concerning his or any other person's past, present or 
proposed business relationships:
    (i) With or in a boycotted country;
    (ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of a 
boycotted country;
    (iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or
    (iv) With any other person who is known or believed to be restricted 
from having any business relationship with or in a boycotting country.''
    This prohibition, like all others under part 760, applies only with 
respect to a U.S. person's activities in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are 
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an

[[Page 495]]

unsanctioned foreign boycott. (Sec. 760.2(d)(5) of this part.)
    This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal business 
information in a commercial context. ( Sec. 760.2(d)(3) of this part). 
Normal business information furnished in a commercial context does not 
cease to be such simply because the party soliciting the information may 
be a boycotting country or a national or resident thereof. If the 
information is of a type which is generally sought for a legitimate 
business purpose (such as determining financial fitness, technical 
competence, or professional experience), the information may be 
furnished even if the information could be used, or without the 
knowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to be 
used, for boycott purposes. (Sec. 760.2(d)(4) of this part).
    The new certification requirements and the Department's 
interpretation of the applicability of part 760 thereto are as follows:
    A. Certificate of origin. A certificate of origin is to be issued by 
the supplier or exporting company and authenticated by the exporting 
country, attesting that the goods exported to the boycotting country are 
of purely indigenous origin, and stating the name of the factory or the 
manufacturing company. To the extent that the goods as described on the 
certificate of origin are not solely and exclusively products of their 
country of origin indicated thereon, a declaration must be appended to 
the certificate of origin giving the name of the supplier/manufacturer 
and declaring:
    ``The undersigned, ____________, does hereby declare on behalf of 
the above-named supplier/manufacturer, that certain parts or components 
of the goods described in the attached certificate of origin are the 
products of such country or countries, other than the country named 
therein as specifically indicated hereunder:

    Country of Origin and Percentage of Value of Parts or Components 
                       Relative to Total Shipment

1.______________________________________________________________________
2.______________________________________________________________________
3.______________________________________________________________________
Dated:__________________________________________________________________
Signature_______________________________________________________________
    Sworn to before me, this ________ day of ____________, 19 ____. 
Notary Seal.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that furnishing a positive 
certificate of origin, such as the one set out above, falls within the 
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance with 
the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. 
See Sec. 760.3(c) of this part and examples (i) and (ii) thereunder.
    B. Shipping certificate. A certificate must be appended to the bill 
of lading stating: (1) Name of vessel; (2) Nationality of vessel; and 
(3) Owner of vessel, and declaring:
    ``The undersigned does hereby declare on behalf of the owner, 
master, or agent of the above-named vessel that said vessel is not 
registered in the boycotted country or owned by nationals or residents 
of the boycotted country and will not call at or pass through any 
boycotted country port enroute to its boycotting country destination.
    ``The undersigned further declares that said vessel is otherwise 
eligible to enter into the ports of the boycotting country in conformity 
with its laws and regulations.
    Sworn to before me, this ________ day of __________, 19 ____. Notary 
Seal.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that furnishing a certificate, such 
as the one set out above, stating: (1) The name of the vessel, (2) The 
nationality of the vessel, and (3) The owner of the vessel and further 
declaring that the vessel: (a) Is not registered in a boycotted country, 
(b) Is not owned by nationals or residents of a boycotted country, and 
(c) Will not call at or pass through a boycotted country port enroute to 
its destination in a boycotting country falls within the exception 
contained in Sec. 760.3(c) for compliance with the import and shipping 
document requirements of a boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c) and 
examples (vii), (viii), and (ix) thereunder.
    It is also the Department's position that the owner, charterer, or 
master of a vessel may certify that the vessel is ``eligible'' or 
``otherwise eligible'' to enter into the ports of a boycotting country 
in conformity with its laws and regulations. Furnishing such a statement 
pertaining to one's own eligibility offends no prohibition under this 
part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f), example (xiv).
    On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declaration that a 
vessel is ``eligible'' or ``otherwise eligible'' to enter the ports of 
the boycotting country necessarily conveys the information that the 
vessel is not blacklisted or otherwise restricted from having a business 
relationship with the boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c) examples 
(vi), (xi), and (xii). Where a person other than the vessel's owner, 
charterer, or master furnishes such a statement, that is tantamount to 
his furnishing a statement that he is not doing business with a 
blacklisted person or is doing business only with non-blacklisted 
persons. Therefore, it is the Department's position that furnishing such 
a certification (which does not reflect customary international 
commercial practice) by anyone other than the owner, charterer, or 
master of a vessel would fall within the prohibition set forth in 
Sec. 760.2(d) unless it is clear from all the facts and circumstances 
that the certification is not required for a boycott reason. See 
Sec. 760.2(d)(3) and (4). See also part A.,

``Permissible Furnishing of Information,'' of Supplement No. 5 to this 
part.
    C. Insurance certificate. A certificate must be appended to the 
insurance policy stating: (1) Name of insurance company; (2) Address of 
its principal office; and (3) Country of its incorporation, and 
declaring:
    ``The undersigned, ________________, does hereby certify on behalf 
of the above-named insurance company that the said company has a duly 
qualified and appointed agent or representative in the boycotting 
country whose name and address appear below:
    Name of agent/representative and address in the boycotting country.
    Sworn to before me this ________ day of ____________, 19____. Notary 
Seal.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that furnishing the name of the 
insurance company falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) 
for compliance with the import and shipping document requirements of a 
boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c)(1)(v) and examples (v) and (x) 
thereunder. In addition, it is the Department's position that furnishing 
a certificate, such as the one set out above, stating the address of the 
insurance company's principal office and its country of incorporation 
offends no prohibition under this part 760 unless the U.S. person 
furnishing the certificate knows or has reason to know that the 
information is sought for the purpose of determining that the insurance 
company is neither headquartered nor incorporated in a boycotted 
country. See Sec. 760.2(d)(1)(i).
    It is also the Department's position that the insurer, himself, may 
certify that he has a duly qualified and appointed agent or 
representative in the boycotting country and may furnish the name and 
address of his agent or representative. Furnishing such a statement 
pertaining to one's own status offends no prohibition under this part 
760. See Sec. 760.2(f), example (xiv).
    On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declaration that 
an insurer ``has a duly qualified and appointed agent or 
representative'' in the boycotting country necessarily conveys the 
information that the insurer is not blacklisted or otherwise restricted 
from having a business relationship with the boycotting country. See 
Sec. 760.3(c), example (v). Therefore, it is the Department's position 
that furnishing such a certification by anyone other than the insurer 
would fall within the prohibition set forth in Sec. 760.2(d) unless it 
is clear from all the facts and circumstances that the certification is 
not required for a boycott reason. See Sec. 760.2(d)(3) and (4).

                         II. Contractual Clauses

    The new contractual requirements and the Department's interpretation 
of the applicability of part 760 thereto are as follows:
    A. Contractual clause regarding import laws of boycotting country. 
``In connection with the performance of this contract the Contractor/
Supplier acknowledges that the import and customs laws and regulations 
of the boycotting country shall apply to the furnishing and shipment of 
any products or components thereof to the boycotting country. The 
Contractor/Supplier specifically acknowledges that the aforementioned 
import and customs laws and regulations of the boycotting country 
prohibit, among other things, the importation into the boycotting 
country of products or components thereof: (1) Originating in the 
boycotted country; (2) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by companies 
organized under the laws of the boycotted country; and (3) Manufactured, 
produced, or furnished by nationals or residents of the boycotted 
country.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the one 
set out in the first sentence above, that the import and customs 
requirements of a boycotting country shall apply to the performance of a 
contract does not, in and of itself, offend any prohibition under this 
part 760. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) and example (iii) under ``Examples of 
Agreements To Refuse To Do Business.'' It is also the Department's 
position that an agreement to comply generally with the import and 
customs requirements of a boycotting country does not, in and of itself, 
offend any prohibition under this part 760. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) and 
examples (iv) and (v) under ``Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do 
Business.'' In addition, it is the Department's position that an 
agreement, such as the one set out in the second sentence above, to 
comply with the boycotting country's import and customs requirements 
prohibiting the importation of products or components: (1) Originating 
in the boycotted country; (2) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by 
companies organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or (3) 
Manufactured, produced, or furnished by nationals or residents of the 
boycotted country falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(a) 
for compliance with the import requirements of a boycotting country. See 
Sec. 760.3(a) and example (ii) thereunder.
    The Department notes that a United States person may not furnish a 
negative certification regarding the origin of goods or their components 
even though the certification is furnished in response to the import and 
shipping document requirements of the

[[Page 497]]

boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c) and examples (i) and (ii) 
thereunder, and Sec. 760.3(a) and example (ii) thereunder.
    B. Contractual clause regarding unilateral and specific selection. 
``The Government of the boycotting country (or the First Party), in its 
exclusive power, reserves its right to make the final unilateral and 
specific selection of any proposed carriers, insurers, suppliers of 
services to be performed within the boycotting country, or of specific 
goods to be furnished in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
this contract.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the one 
set out above, falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of 
this part for compliance with unilateral selections. However, the 
Department notes that whether a U.S. person may subsequently comply or 
agree to comply with any particular selection depends upon whether that 
selection meets all the requirements contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this 
part for compliance with unilateral selections. For example, the 
particular selection must be unilateral and specific, particular goods 
must be specifically identifiable as to their source or origin at the 
time of their entry into the boycotting country, and all other 
requirements contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part must be observed.

              Supplement No. 2 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The Department hereby sets forth its views on whether the furnishing 
of certain shipping and insurance certificates in compliance with 
boycotting country requirements violates the provisions of section 8 of 
the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2407) 
and part 760 of the EAR,<SUP>1</SUP> as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Department originally issued this interpretation on April 
21, 1978 (43 FR 16969) pursuant to the Export Administration Amendments 
Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-52) and the regulations on restrictive trade 
practices and boycotts (15 CFR part 369) published on January 25, 1978 
(43 FR 3508) and contained in the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 
1, 1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) ``The owner, charterer or master of a vessel may certify that 
the vessel is `eligible' or `otherwise eligible' to enter into the ports 
of a boycotting country in conformity with its laws and regulations;''
    (ii) ``The insurer, himself, may certify that he has a duly 
qualified and appointed agent or representative in the boycotting 
country and may furnish the name and address of his agent or 
representative.''
    Furnishing such certifications by anyone other than:
    (i) The owner, charterer or master of a vessel, or
    (ii) The insurer would fall within the prohibition set forth in 
Sec. 760.2(d) of this part, ``unless it is clear from all the facts and 
circumstances that these certifications are not required for a boycott 
reason.'' See Sec. 760.2(d) (3) and (4) of this part.
    The Department has received from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia a 
clarification that the shipping and insurance certifications are 
required by Saudi Arabia in order to:
    (i) Demonstrate that there are no applicable restrictions under 
Saudi laws or regulations pertaining to maritime matters such as the age 
of the ship, the condition of the ship, and similar matters that would 
bar entry of the vessel into Saudi ports; and
    (ii) Facilitate dealings with insurers by Saudi Arabian importers 
whose ability to secure expeditious payments in the event of damage to 
insured goods may be adversely affected by the absence of a qualified 
agent or representative of the insurer in Saudi Arabia. In the 
Department's judgment, this clarification constitutes sufficient facts 
and circumstances to demonstrate that the certifications are not 
required by Saudi Arabia for boycott reasons.
    On the basis of this clarification, it is the Department's position 
that any United States person may furnish such shipping and insurance 
certificates required by Saudi Arabia without violating Sec. 760.2(d) of 
this part. Moreover, under these circumstances, receipts of requests for 
such shipping and insurance certificates from Saudi Arabia are not 
reportable.
    It is still the Department's position that furnishing such a 
certificate pertaining to one's own eligibility offends no prohibition 
under part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example (xiv). However, 
absent facts and circumstances clearly indicating that the 
certifications are required for ordinary commercial reasons as 
demonstrated by the Saudi clarification, furnishing certifications about 
the eligibility or blacklist status of any other person would fall 
within the prohibition set forth in Sec. 760.2(d) of this part, and 
receipts of requests for such certifications are reportable.
    It also remains the Department's position that where a United States 
person asks an insurer or carrier of the exporter's goods to self-
certify, such request offends no prohibition under this part. However, 
where a United States person asks anyone other than an insurer or 
carrier of the exporter's goods to self-certify, such requests will be 
considered by the Department as evidence of the requesting person's 
refusal to do business with those persons who cannot or will not

[[Page 498]]

furnish such a self-certification. For example, if an exporter-
beneficiary of a letter of credit asks his component suppliers to self-
certify, such a request will be considered as evidence of his refusal to 
do business with those component suppliers who cannot or will not 
furnish such a self-certification.
    The Department wishes to emphasize that notwithstanding the fact 
that self-certifications are permissible, it will closely scrutinize the 
activities of all United States persons who provide such self-
certifications, including insurers and carriers, to determine that such 
persons have not taken any prohibited actions or entered into any 
prohibited agreements in order to be able to furnish such 
certifications.

[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34949, June 1, 2000]

              Supplement No. 3 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Pursuant to Article 2, Annex II of the Peace Treaty between Egypt 
and Israel, Egypt's participation in the Arab economic boycott of Israel 
was formally terminated on January 25, 1980. On the basis of this 
action, it is the Department's position that certain requests for 
information, action or agreement which were considered boycott-related 
by implication now cannot be presumed boycott-related and thus would not 
be prohibited or reportable under the Regulations. For example, a 
request that an exporter certify that the vessel on which it is shipping 
its goods is eligible to enter Arab Republic of Egypt ports has been 
considered a boycott-related request that the exporter could not comply 
with because Egypt has a boycott in force against Israel (see 43 FR 
16969, April 21, 1978 or the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1, 
1979). Such a request after January 25, 1980 would not be presumed 
boycott-related because the underlying boycott requirement/basis for the 
certification has been eliminated. Similarly, a U.S. company would not 
be prohibited from complying with a request received from Egyptian 
government officials to furnish the place of birth of employees the 
company is seeking to take to Egypt, because there is no underlying 
boycott law or policy that would give rise to a presumption that the 
request was boycott-related.
    U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their face 
boycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance or 
support of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to the 
Regulations, irrespective of the country or origin. For example, 
requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'', ``Israel 
boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases or words 
indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriate 
provisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.

              Supplement No. 4 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The question has arisen how the definition of U.S. commerce in the 
antiboycott regulations (15 CFR part 760) applies to a shipment of 
foreign-made goods when U.S.-origin spare parts are included in the 
shipment. Specifically, if the shipment of foreign goods falls outside 
the definition of U.S. commerce, will the inclusion of U.S.-origin spare 
parts bring the entire transaction into U.S. commerce?
    Section 760.1(d)(12) provides the general guidelines for determining 
when U.S.-origin goods shipped from a controlled in fact foreign 
subsidiary are outside U.S. commerce. The two key tests of that 
provision are that the goods were ``(i) * * * acquired without reference 
to a specific order from or transaction with a person outside the United 
States; and (ii) * * * further manufactured, incorporated into, refined 
into, or reprocessed into another product.'' Because the application of 
these two tests to spare parts does not conclusively answer the U.S. 
commerce question, the Department is presenting this clarification.
    In the cases brought to the Department's attention, an order for 
foreign-origin goods was placed with a controlled in fact foreign 
subsidiary of a United States company. The foreign goods contained 
components manufactured in the United States and in other countries, and 
the order included a request for extras of the U.S. manufactured 
components (spare parts) to allow the customer to repair the item. Both 
the foreign manufactured product and the U.S. spare parts were to be 
shipped from the general inventory of the foreign subsidiary. Since the 
spare parts, if shipped by themselves, would be in U.S. commerce as that 
term is defined in the Regulations, the question was whether including 
them with the foreign manufactured item would bring the entire shipment 
into U.S. commerce. The Department has decided that it will not and 
presents the following specific guidance.
    As used above, the term ``spare parts'' refers to parts of the 
quantities and types normally and customarily ordered with a product and 
kept on hand in the event they are needed to assure prompt repair of the 
product. Parts, components or accessories that improve or change the 
basic operations or design characteristics, for example, as to accuracy, 
capability or productivity, are not spare parts under this definition.
    Inclusion of U.S.-origin spare parts in a shipment of products which 
is otherwise outside U.S. commerce will not bring the transaction into 
U.S. commerce if the following conditions are met:

[[Page 499]]

    (I) The parts included in the shipment are acquired from the United 
States by the controlled in fact foreign subsidiary without reference to 
a specific order from or transaction with a person outside the United 
States;
    (II) The parts are identical to the corresponding United States-
origin parts which have been manufactured, incorporated into or 
reprocessed into the completed product;
    (III) The parts are of the quantity and type normally and 
customarily ordered with the completed product and kept on hand by the 
firm or industry of which the firm is a part to assure prompt repair of 
the product; and
    (IV) The parts are covered by the same order as the completed 
product and are shipped with or at the same time as the original 
product.
    The Department emphasizes that unless each of the above conditions 
is met, the inclusion of United States-origin spare parts in an order 
for a foreign-manufactured or assembled product will bring the entire 
transaction into the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States 
for purposes of part 760.

              Supplement No. 5 to Part 760--Interpretation

                A. Permissible Furnishing of Information

    The information outlined below may be furnished in response to 
boycott-related requests from boycotting countries or others. This 
information is, in the view of the Department, not prohibited by the 
Regulations. Thus, a person does not have to qualify under any of the 
exceptions to be able to make the following statements. Such statements 
can be made, however, only by the person indicated and under the 
circumstances described. These statements should not be used as a point 
of departure or analogy for determining the permissibility of other 
types of statements. The Department's view that these statements are not 
contrary to the prohibitions contained in antiboycott provisions of the 
Regulations is limited to the specific statement in the specific context 
indicated.
    1. A U.S. person may always provide its own name, address, place of 
incorporation (``nationality''), and nature of business.
    2. A U.S. person may state that it is not on a blacklist, or 
restricted from doing business in a boycotting country. A company may 
not make that statement about its subsidiaries or affiliates--only about 
itself. A U.S. person may not say that there is no reason for it to be 
blacklisted. To make that statement would provide directly or by 
implication information that may not be provided. A U.S. person may 
inquire about the reasons it is blacklisted if it learns that it is on a 
blacklist (see Sec. 760.2(d) of this part example (xv)).
    3. A U.S. person may describe in detail its past dealings with 
boycotting countries; may state in which boycotting countries its 
trademarks are registered; and may specify in which boycotting countries 
it is registered or qualified to do business. In general, a U.S. person 
is free to furnish any information it wishes about the nature and extent 
of its commercial dealings with boycotting countries.
    4. A U.S. person may state that many U.S. firms or individuals have 
similar names and that it believes that it may be confused with a 
similarly named entity. A U.S. person may not state that it does or does 
not have an affiliation or relationship with such similarly named 
entity.
    5. A U.S. person may state that the information requested is a 
matter of public record in the United States. However, the person may 
not direct the inquirer to the location of that information, nor may the 
U.S. person provide or cause to be provided such information.

B. Availability of the Compliance With Local Law Exception to Establish 
                            a Foreign Branch

    Section 760.3(g), the Compliance With Local Law exception, permits 
U.S. persons, who are bona fide residents of a boycotting country, to 
take certain limited, but otherwise prohibited, actions, if they are 
required to do so in order to comply with local law.
    Among these actions is the furnishing of non-discriminatory 
information. Examples (iv) through (vi) under ``Examples of Bona Fide 
Residency'' indicate that a company seeking to become a bona fide 
resident within a boycotting country may take advantage of the exception 
for the limited purpose of furnishing information required by local law 
to obtain resident status. Exactly when and how this exception is 
available has been the subject of a number of inquiries. It is the 
Department's view that the following conditions must be met for a non-
resident company to be permitted to furnish otherwise prohibited 
information for the limited purpose of seeking to become a bona fide 
resident:
    1. The company must have a legitimate business reason for seeking to 
establish a branch or other resident operation in the boycotting 
country. (Removal from the blacklist does not constitute such a reason.)
    2. The local operation it seeks to establish must be similar or 
comparable in nature and operation to ones the company operates in other 
parts of the world, unless local law or custom dictates a significantly 
different form.
    3. The person who visits the boycotting country to furnish the 
information must be the official whose responsibility ordinarily

[[Page 500]]

includes the creation and registration of foreign operations (i.e., the 
chairman of the board cannot be flown in to answer boycott questions 
unless the chairman of the board is the corporate official who 
ordinarily goes into a country to handle foreign registrations).
    4. The information provided must be that which is ordinarily known 
to the person establishing the foreign branch. Obviously, at the time of 
establishment, the foreign branch will have no information of its own 
knowledge. Rather, the information should be that which the responsible 
person has of his own knowledge, or that he would have with him as 
incidental and necessary to the registration and establishment process. 
As a general rule, such information would not include such things as 
copies of agreements with boycotted country concerns or detailed 
information about the person's dealings with blacklisted concerns.
    5. It is not necessary that documents prepared in compliance with 
this exception be drafted or executed within the boycotting country. The 
restrictions on the type of information which may be provided and on who 
may provide it apply regardless of where the papers are prepared or 
signed.

[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34949, June 1, 2000]

              Supplement No. 6 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The antiboycott regulations prohibit knowing agreements to comply 
with certain prohibited requests and requirements of boycotting 
countries, regardless of how these terms are stated. Similarly, the 
reporting rules require that a boycott related ``solicitation, 
directive, legend or instruction that asks for information or that asks 
that a United States person take or refrain from taking a particular 
action'' be reported. Questions have frequently arisen about how 
particular requirements in the form of directive or instructions are 
viewed under the antiboycott regulations, and we believe that it will 
add clarity to the regulations to provide a written interpretation of 
how three of these terms are treated under the law. The terms in 
question appear frequently in letters of credit, but may also be found 
on purchase orders or other shipping or sale documents. They have been 
brought to the attention of the Department by numerous persons. The 
terms are, or are similar to, the following: (1) Goods of boycotted 
country origin are prohibited; (2) No six-pointed stars may be used on 
the goods, packing or cases; (3) Neither goods nor packing shall bear 
any symbols prohibited in the boycotting country.
    (a) Goods of boycotted country origin prohibited. This term is very 
common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may also appear from time-
to-time in invitations to bid, contracts, or other trade documents. It 
imposes a condition or requirement compliance with which is prohibited, 
but permitted by an exception under the Regulations (see Sec. 760.2(a) 
and Sec. 760.3(a)). It is reportable by those parties to the letter of 
credit or other transaction that are required to take or refrain from 
taking some boycott related action by the request. Thus the bank must 
report the request because it is a term or condition of the letter of 
credit that it is handling, and the exporter-beneficiary must report the 
request because the exporter determines the origin of the goods. The 
freight forwarder does not have to report this request because the 
forwarder has no role or obligation in selecting the goods. However, the 
freight forwarder would have to report a request to furnish a 
certificate that the goods do not originate in or contain components 
from a boycotted country. See Sec. 760.5, examples (xii)-(xvii).
    (b) No six-pointed stars may be used on the goods, packing or cases. 
This term appears from time-to-time on documents from a variety of 
countries. The Department has taken the position that the six-pointed 
star is a religious symbol. See Sec. 760.2(b), example (viii) of this 
part. Agreeing to this term is prohibited by the Regulations and not 
excepted because it constitutes an agreement to furnish information 
about the religion of a U.S. person. See Sec. 760.2(c) of this part. If 
a person proceeds with a transaction in which this is a condition at any 
stage of the transaction, that person has agreed to the condition in 
violation of the Regulations. It is not enough to ignore the condition. 
Exception must affirmatively be taken to this term or it must be 
stricken from the documents of the transaction. It is reportable by all 
parties to the transaction that are restricted by it. For example, 
unlike the situation described in (a) above, the freight forwarder would 
have to report this request because his role in the transaction would 
involve preparation of the packing and cases. The bank and exporter 
would both have to report, of course, if it were a term in a letter of 
credit. Each party would be obligated affirmatively to seek an amendment 
or deletion of the term.
    (c) Neither goods nor packaging shall bear any symbols prohibited in 
the boycotting country. This term appears from time-to-time in letters 
of credit and shipping documents from Saudi Arabia. In our view, it is 
neither prohibited, nor reportable because it is not boycott-related. 
There is a wide range of symbols that are prohibited in Saudi Arabia for 
a variety of reasons, many having to do with that nation's cultural and 
religious beliefs. On this basis, we do not interpret the

[[Page 501]]

term to be boycott related. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) and Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(v) 
of this part.

[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34949, June 1, 2000]

              Supplement No. 7 to Part 760--Interpretation

                    Prohibited Refusal To Do Business

    When a boycotting country rejects for boycott-related reasons a 
shipment of goods sold by a United States person, the United States 
person selling the goods may return them to its inventory or may re-ship 
them to other markets (the United States person may not return them to 
the original supplier and demand restitution). The U.S. person may then 
make a non-boycott based selection of another supplier and provide the 
goods necessary to meet its obligations to the boycotting customer in 
that particular transaction without violating Sec. 760.2(a) of this 
part. If the United States person receives another order from the same 
boycotting country for similar goods, the Department has determined that 
a boycott-based refusal by a United States person to ship goods from the 
supplier whose goods were previously rejected would constitute a 
prohibited refusal to do business under Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. The 
Department will presume that filling such an order with alternative 
goods is evidence of the person's refusal to deal with the original 
supplier.
    The Department recognizes the limitations this places on future 
transactions with a boycotting country once a shipment of goods has been 
rejected. Because of this, the Department wishes to point out that, when 
faced with a boycotting country's refusal to permit entry of the 
particular goods, a United States person may state its obligation to 
abide by the requirements of United States law and indicate its 
readiness to comply with the unilateral and specific selection of goods 
by the boycotting country in accordance with Sec. 760.3(d). That section 
provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
    ``A United States person may comply or agree to comply in the normal 
course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a 
boycotting country * * * of * * * specific goods, * * * provided that * 
* * with respect to goods, the items, in the normal course of business, 
are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry 
into the boycotting country by (a) uniqueness of design or appearance or 
(b) trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the items 
themselves, including their packaging.''
    The Department wishes to emphasize that the unilateral selection 
exception in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part will be construed narrowly, and 
that all its requirements and conditions must be met, including the 
following:

--Discretion for the selection must be exercised by a boycotting 
country; or by a national or resident of a boycotting country;
--The selection must be stated in the affirmative specifying a 
particular supplier of goods;
--While a permissible selection may be boycott based, if the United 
States person knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the 
selection is to effect discrimination against any United States person 
on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin, the person may 
not comply under any circumstances.

    The Department cautions United States persons confronted with the 
problem or concern over the boycott-based rejection of goods shipped to 
a boycotting country that the adoption of devices such as ``risk of 
loss'' clauses, or conditions that make the supplier financially liable 
if his or her goods are rejected by the boycotting country for boycott 
reasons are presumed by the Department to be evasion of the statute and 
regulations, and as such are prohibited by Sec. 760.4 of this part, 
unless adopted prior to January 18, 1978. See Sec. 760.4(d) of this 
part.

              Supplement No. 8 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Definition of Interstate or Foreign Commerce of the United States

    When United States persons (as defined by the antiboycott 
regulations) located within the United States purchase or sell goods or 
services located outside the United States, they have engaged in an 
activity within the foreign commerce of the United States. Although the 
goods or services may never physically come within the geographic 
boundaries of the several states or territories of the United States, 
legal ownership or title is transferred from a foreign nation to the 
United States person who is located in the United States. In the case of 
a purchase, subsequent resale would also be within United States 
commerce.
    It is the Department's view that the terms ``sale'' and ``purchase'' 
as used in the regulations are not limited to those circumstances where 
the goods or services are physically transferred to the person who 
acquires title. The EAR define the activities that serve as the 
transactional basis for U.S. commerce as those involving the ``sale, 
purchase, or transfer'' of goods or services. In the Department's view, 
as used in the antiboycott regulations, ``transfer'' contemplates 
physical movement of the goods or services between the several states or 
territories and a foreign country, while ``sale'' and ``purchase'' 
relate to the movement of ownership or title.

[[Page 502]]

    This interpretation applies only to those circumstances in which the 
person located within the United States buys or sells goods or services 
for its own account. Where the United States person is engaged in the 
brokerage of foreign goods, i.e., bringing foreign buyers and sellers 
together and assisting in the transfer of the goods, the sale or 
purchase itself would not ordinarily be considered to be within U.S. 
commerce. The brokerage service, however, would be a service provided 
from the United States to the parties and thus an activity within U.S. 
commerce and subject to the antiboycott laws. See Sec. 760.1(d)(3).
    The Department cautions that United States persons who alter their 
normal pattern of dealing to eliminate the passage of ownership of the 
goods or services to or from the several states or territories of the 
United States in order to avoid the application of the antiboycott 
regulations would be in violation of Sec. 760.4 of this part.

              Supplement No. 9 to Part 760--Interpretation

     Activities Exclusively Within a Boycotting Country--Furnishing 
                               Information

    Sec. 760.3(h) of this part provides that a United States person who 
is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country may comply with the laws 
of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively within 
the boycotting country. Among the types of conduct permitted by this 
exception is ``furnishing information within the host country'' 
Sec. 760.3(h)(1)(v) of this part. For purposes of the discussion which 
follows, the Department is assuming that the person in question is a 
bona fide resident of the boycotting country as defined in 
Sec. 760.3(g), and that the information to be provided is required by 
the laws or regulations of the boycotting country, as also defined in 
Sec. 760.3(g) of this part. The only issue this interpretation addresses 
is under what circumstances the provision of information is ``an 
activity exclusively within the boycotting country.''
    The activity of ``furnishing information'' consists of two parts, 
the acquisition of the information and its subsequent transmittal. Under 
the terms of this exception, the information may not be acquired outside 
the country for the purpose of responding to the requirement for 
information imposed by the boycotting country. Thus, if an American 
company which is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country is 
required to provide information about its dealings with other U.S. 
firms, the company may not ask its parent corporation in the United 
States for that information, or make any other inquiry outside the 
boundaries of the boycotting country. The information must be provided 
to the boycotting country authorities based on information or knowledge 
available to the company and its personnel located within the boycotting 
country at the time the inquiry is received. See Sec. 760.3, (h) of this 
part, examples (iii), (iv), and (v). Much of the information in the 
company's possession (transaction and corporate records) may have 
actually originated outside the boycotting country, and much of the 
information known to the employees may have been acquired outside the 
boycotting country. This will not cause the information to fall outside 
the coverage of this exception, if the information was sent to the 
boycotting country or acquired by the individuals in normal commercial 
context prior to and unrelated to a boycott inquiry or purpose. It 
should be noted that if prohibited information (about business relations 
with a boycotted country, for example) has been forwarded to the 
affiliate in the boycotting country in anticipation of a possible 
boycott inquiry from the boycotting country government, the Department 
will not regard this as information within the knowledge of the bona 
fide resident under the terms of the exception. However, if the bona 
fide resident possesses the information prior to receipt of a boycott-
related inquiry and obtained it in a normal commercial context, the 
information can be provided pursuant to this exception notwithstanding 
the fact that, at some point, the information came into the boycotting 
country from the outside.
    The second part of the analysis of ``furnishing information'' deals 
with the limitation on the transmittal of the information. It can only 
be provided within the boundaries of the boycotting country. The bona 
fide resident may only provide the information to the party that the 
boycotting country law requires (directly or through an agent or 
representative within the country) so long as that party is located 
within the boycotting country. This application of the exception is 
somewhat easier, since it is relatively simple to determine if the 
information is to be given to somebody within the country.
    Note that in discussing what constitutes furnishing information 
``exclusively within'' the boycotting country, the Department does not 
address the nature of the transaction or activity that the information 
relates to. It is the Department's position that the nature of the 
transaction, including the inception or completion of the transaction, 
is not material in analyzing the availability of this exception.
    For example, if a shipment of goods imported into a boycotting 
country is held up at the time of entry, and information from the bona 
fide resident within that country is legally required to free those 
goods, the fact

[[Page 503]]

that the information may relate to a transaction that began outside the 
boycotting country is not material. The availability of the exception 
will be judged based on the activity of the bona fide resident within 
the country. If the resident provides that information of his or her own 
knowledge, and provides it to appropriate parties located exclusively 
within the country, the exception permits the information to be 
furnished.
    Factual variations may raise questions about the application of this 
exception and the effect of this interpretation. In an effort to 
anticipate some of these, the Department has set forth below a number of 
questions and answers. They are incorporated as a part of this 
interpretation.
    1. Q. Under this exception, can a company which is a U.S. person and 
a bona fide resident of the boycotting country provide information to 
the local boycott office?
    A. Yes, if local law requires the company to provide this 
information to the boycott office and all the other requirements are 
met.
    2. Q. If the company knows that the local boycott office will 
forward the information to the Central Boycott Office, may it still 
provide the information to the local boycott office?
    A. Yes, if it is required by local law to furnish the information to 
the local boycott office and all the other requirements are met. The 
company has no control over what happens to the information after it is 
provided to the proper authorities. (There is obvious potential for 
evasion here, and the Department will examine such occurrences closely.)
    3. Q. Can a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident of Syria furnish 
information to the Central Boycott Office in Damascus?
    A. No, unless the law in Syria specifically requires information to 
be provided to the Central Boycott Office the exception will not apply. 
Syria has a local boycott office responsible for enforcing the boycott 
in that country.
    4. Q. If a company which is a U.S. person and a bona fide resident 
of the boycotting country has an import shipment held up in customs of 
the boycotting country, and is required to provide information about the 
shipment to get it out of customs, may the company do so?
    A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. The act of 
furnishing the information is the activity taking place exclusively 
within the boycotting country. The fact that the information is provided 
corollary to a transaction that originates or terminates outside the 
boycotting country is not material.
    5. Q. If the U.S. person and bona fide resident of the boycotting 
country is shipping goods out of the boycotting country, and is required 
to certify to customs officials of the country at the time of export 
that the goods are not of Israeli origin, may he do so even though the 
certification relates to an export transaction?
    A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. See number 4 above.

[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34950, June 1, 2000]

              Supplement No. 10 to Part 760--Interpretation

    (a) The words ``Persian Gulf'' cannot appear on the document.
    This term is common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may be 
found in letters of credit from Bahrain. Although more commonly 
appearing in letters of credit, the term may also appear in other trade 
documents.
    It is the Department's view that this term reflects a historical 
dispute between the Arabs and the Iranians over geographic place names 
which in no way relates to existing economic boycotts. Thus, the term is 
neither prohibited nor reportable under the Regulations.
    (b) Certify that goods are of U.S.A. origin and contain no foreign 
parts.
    This term appears periodically on documents from a number of Arab 
countries. It is the Department's position that the statement is a 
positive certification of origin and, as such, falls within the 
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance with 
the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. 
Even though a negative phrase is contained within the positive clause, 
the phrase is a non-exclusionary, non-blacklisting statement. In the 
Department's view, the additional phrase does not affect the permissible 
status of the positive certificate, nor does it make the request 
reportable Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(iii) of this part.
    (c) Legalization of documents by any Arab consulate except Egyptian 
Consulate permitted.
    This term appears from time to time in letters of credit but also 
may appear in various other trade documents requiring legalization and 
thus is not prohibited, and a request to comply with the statement is 
not reportable. Because a number of Arab states do not have formal 
diplomatic relations with Egypt, they do not recognize Egyptian embassy 
actions. The absence of diplomatic relations is the reason for the 
requirement. In the Department's view this does not constitute an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott or embargo against Egypt under the terms of 
the Export Administration Act. Thus the term is not prohibited, and a 
request to comply with the statement is not reportable.

              Supplement No. 11 to Part 760--Interpretation

               Definition of Unsolicited Invitation to Bid

    Sec. 760.5(a)(4) of this part states in part:
    ``In addition, a United States person who receives an unsolicited 
invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott request has 
not received a reportable request for purposes of this section where he 
does not respond to the invitation to bid or other proposal.''
    The Regulations do not define ``unsolicited'' in this context. Based 
on review of numerous situations, the Department has developed certain 
criteria that it applies in determining if an invitation to bid or other 
proposal received by a U.S. person is in fact unsolicited.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if, during a commercially 
reasonable period of time preceding the issuance of the invitation, a 
representative of the U.S. person contacted the company or agency 
involved for the purpose of promoting business on behalf of the company.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has advertised 
the product or line of products that are the subject of the invitation 
in periodicals or publications that ordinarily circulate to the country 
issuing the invitation during a commercially reasonable period of time 
preceding the issuance of the invitation.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has sold the 
same or similar products to the company or agency issuing the invitation 
within a commercially reasonable period of time before the issuance of 
the current invitation.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has 
participated in a trade mission to or trade fair in the country issuing 
the invitation within a commercially reasonable period of time before 
the issuance of the invitation.
    Under Sec. 760.5(a)(4) of this part, the invitation is regarded as 
not reportable if the U.S. person receiving it does not respond. The 
Department has determined that a simple acknowledgment of the invitation 
does not constitute a response for purposes of this rule. However, an 
acknowledgment that requests inclusion for future invitations will be 
considered a response, and a report is required.
    Where the person in receipt of an invitation containing a boycott 
term or condition is undecided about a response by the time a report 
would be required to be filed under the regulations, it is the 
Department's view that the person must file a report as called for in 
the Regulations. The person filing the report may indicate at the time 
of filing that he has not made a decision on the boycott request but 
must file a supplemental report as called for in the regulations at the 
time a decision is made (Sec. 760.5(b)(6)).

[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34950, June 1, 2000]

              Supplement No. 12 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The Department has taken the position that a U.S. person as defined 
by Sec. 760.1(b) of this part may not make use of an agent to furnish 
information that the U.S. person is prohibited from furnishing pursuant 
to Sec. 760.2(d) of this part.
    Example (v) under Sec. 760.4 of this part (Evasion) provides:
    ``A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a long-term contract with 
boycotting country Y to meet all of Y's medical supply needs. Y informs 
A that before such a contract can be concluded, A must complete Y's 
boycott questionnaire. A knows that it is prohibited from answering the 
questionnaire so it arranges for a local agent in Y to supply the 
necessary information.''
    ``A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a 
device to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.''
    This interpretation deals with the application of the Regulations to 
a commercial agent registration requirement imposed by the government of 
Saudi Arabia. The requirement provides that nationals of Saudi Arabia 
seeking to register in Saudi Arabia as commercial agents or 
representatives of foreign concerns must furnish certain boycott-related 
information about the foreign concern prior to obtaining approval of the 
registration.
    The requirement has been imposed by the Ministry of Commerce of 
Saudi Arabia, which is the government agency responsible for regulation 
of commercial agents and foreign commercial registrations. The Ministry 
requires the agent or representative to state the following:
    ``Declaration: I, the undersigned, hereby declare, in my capacity as 
(blank) that (name and address of foreign principal) is not presently on 
the blacklist of the Office for the Boycott of Israel and that it and 
all its branches, if any, are bound by the decisions issued by the 
Boycott Office and do not (1) participate in the capital of, (2) license 
the manufacture of any products or grant trademarks or tradeware license 
to, (3) give experience or technical advice to, or (4) have any other 
relationship with other companies which are prohibited to be dealt with 
by the Boycott Office. Signed (name of commercial agent/representative/
distributor).''
    It is the Department's view that under the circumstances 
specifically outlined in this interpretation relating to the nature of 
the requirement, a U.S. person will not be held responsible for a 
violation of this part when

[[Page 505]]

such statements are provided by its commercial agent or representative, 
even when such statements are made with the full knowledge of the U.S. 
person.
    Nature of the requirement. For a boycott-related commercial 
registration requirement to fall within the coverage of this 
interpretation it must have the following characteristics:
    1. The requirement for information imposed by the boycotting country 
applies to a national or other subject of the boycotting country 
qualified under the local laws of that country to function as a 
commercial representative within that country;
    2. The registration requirement relates to the registration of the 
commercial agent's or representative's authority to sell or distribute 
goods within the boycotting country acquired from the foreign concern;
    3. The requirement is a routine part of the registration process and 
is not applied selectively based on boycott-related criteria;
    4. The requirement applies only to a commercial agent or 
representative in the boycotting country and does not apply to the 
foreign concern itself; and
    5. The requirement is imposed by the agency of the boycotting 
country responsible for regulating commercial agencies.
    The U.S. person whose agent is complying with the registration 
requirement continues to be subject to all the terms of the Regulations, 
and may not provide any prohibited information to the agent for purposes 
of the agent's compliance with the requirement.
    In addition, the authority granted to the commercial agent or 
representative by the U.S. person must be consistent with standard 
commercial practices and not involve any grants of authority beyond 
those incidental to the commercial sales and distributorship 
responsibilities of the agent.
    Because the requirement does not apply to the U.S. person, no 
reporting obligation under Sec. 760.5 of this part would arise.
    This interpretation, like all others issued by the Department 
discussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the Export 
Administration Regulations, should be read narrowly. Circumstances that 
differ in any material way from those discussed in this notice will be 
considered under the applicable provisions of the Regulations. Persons 
are particularly advised not to seek to apply this interpretation to 
circumstances in which U.S. principals seek to use agents to deal with 
boycott-related or potential blacklisting situations.

[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34950, June 1, 2000]

              Supplement No. 13 to Part 760--Interpretation

                                 Summary

    This interpretation considers boycott-based contractual language 
dealing with the selection of suppliers and subcontractors. While this 
language borrows terms from the ``unilateral and specific selection'' 
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(d), it fails to meet the requirements 
of that exception. Compliance with the requirements of the language 
constitutes a violation of the regulatory prohibition of boycott-based 
refusals to do business.

                          Regulatory Background

    Section 760.2(a) of this part prohibits U.S. persons from refusing 
or knowingly agreeing to refuse to do business with other persons when 
such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with, requirement of, or 
request of a boycotting country. That prohibition does not extend to the 
performance of management, procurement or other pre-award services, 
however, notwithstanding knowledge that the ultimate selection may be 
boycott-based. To be permissible such services: (1) Must be customary 
for the firm or industry involved and (2) must not exclude others from 
the transaction or involve other actions based on the boycott. See 
Sec. 760.2(a)(6) of this part, ``Refusals to Do Business'', and example 
(xiii).
    A specific exception is also made in the Regulations for compliance 
(and agreements to comply) with a unilateral and specific selection of 
suppliers or subcontractors by a boycotting country buyer. See 
Sec. 760.3(d) of this part. In Supplement No. 1 to part 760, the 
following form of contractual language was said to fall within that 
exception for compliance with unilateral and specific selection:
    ``The Government of the boycotting country (or the First Party), in 
its exclusive power, reserves its right to make the final unilateral and 
specific selection of any proposed carriers, insurers, suppliers of 
services to be performed within the boycotting country, or of specific 
goods to be furnished in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
this contract.''
    The Department noted that the actual steps necessary to comply with 
any selection made under this agreement would also have to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 760.3(d) to claim the benefit of that exception. In 
other words, the discretion in selecting would have to be exercised 
exclusively by the boycotting country customer and the selection would 
have to be stated in the affirmative, naming a particular supplier. See 
Sec. 760.3(d) (4) and (5) of this part.

[[Page 506]]

               Analysis of Additional Contractual Language

    The Office of Antiboycott Compliance has learned of the introduction 
of a contractual clause into tender documents issued by boycotting 
country governments. This clause is, in many respects, similar to that 
dealt with in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, but several critical 
differences exist.
    The clause states:

                 Boycott of [Name of Boycotted Country]

    In connection with the performance of this Agreement, Contractor 
acknowledges that the import and customs laws and regulations of 
boycotting country apply to the furnishing and shipment of any products 
or components thereof to boycotting country. The Contractor specifically 
acknowledges that the aforementioned import and customs laws and 
regulations of boycotting country prohibit, among other things, the 
importation into boycotting country of products or components thereof: 
(A) Originating in boycotted country; (B) Manufactured, produced and 
furnish by companies organized under the laws of boycotted country; and 
(C) Manufactured, produced or furnished by Nationals or Residents of 
boycotted country.
    The Government, in its exclusive power, reserves its right to make 
the final unilateral and specific selection of any proposed Carriers, 
Insurers, Suppliers of Services to be performed within boycotting 
country or of specific goods to be furnished in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of this Contract.
    To assist the Government in exercising its right under the preceding 
paragraph, Contractor further agrees to provide a complete list of names 
and addresses of all his Sub-Contractors, Suppliers, Vendors and 
Consultants and any other suppliers of the service for the project.
    The title of this clause makes clear that its provisions are 
intended to be boycott-related. The first paragraph acknowledges the 
applicability of certain boycott-related requirements of the boycotting 
country's laws in language reviewed in part 760, Supplement No. 1, Part 
II.B. and found to constitute a permissible agreement under the 
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(a) of this part for compliance with 
the import requirements of a boycotting country. The second and third 
paragraphs together deal with the procedure for selecting subcontractors 
and suppliers of services and goods and, in the context of the clause as 
a whole, must be regarded as motivated by boycott considerations and 
intended to enable the boycotting country government to make boycott-
based selections, including the elimination of blacklisted 
subcontractors and suppliers.
    The question is whether the incorporation into these paragraphs of 
some language from the ``unilateral and specific selection'' clause 
approved in Supplement No. 1 to part 760 suffices to take the language 
outside Sec. 760.2(a) of this part's prohibition on boycott-based 
agreements to refuse to do business. While the first sentence of this 
clause is consistent with the language discussed in Supplement No. 1 to 
part 760, the second sentence significantly alters the effect of this 
clause. The effect is to draw the contractor into the decision-making 
process, thereby destroying the unilateral character of the selection by 
the buyer. By agreeing to submit the names of the suppliers it plans to 
use, the contractor is agreeing to give the boycotting country buyer, 
who has retained the right of final selection, the ability to reject, 
for boycott-related reasons, any supplier the contractor has already 
chosen. Because the requirement appears in the contractual provision 
dealing with the boycott, the buyer's rejection of any supplier whose 
name is given to the buyer pursuant to this provision would be presumed 
to be boycott-based. By signing the contract, and thereby agreeing to 
comply with all of its provisions, the contractor must either accept the 
buyer's rejection of any supplier, which is presumed to be boycott-based 
because of the context of this provision, or breach the contract.
    In these circumstances, the contractor's method of choosing its 
subcontractors and suppliers, in anticipation of the buyer's boycott-
based review, cannot be considered a permissible pre-award service 
because of the presumed intrusion of boycott-based criteria into the 
selection process. Thus, assuming all other jurisdictional requirements 
necessary to establish a violation of part 760 are met, the signing of 
the contract by the contractor constitutes a violation of Sec. 760.2(a) 
of this part because he is agreeing to refuse to do business for boycott 
reasons.
    The apparent attempt to bring this language within the exception for 
compliance with unilateral and specific selections is ineffective. The 
language does not place the discretion to choose suppliers in the hands 
of the boycotting country buyer but divides this discretion between the 
buyer and his principal contractor. Knowing that the buyer will not 
accept a boycotted company as supplier or subcontractor, the contractor 
is asked to use his discretion in selecting a single supplier or 
subcontractor for each element of the contract. The boycotting country 
buyer exercises discretion only through accepting or rejecting the 
selected supplier or contractor as its boycott policies require. In 
these circumstances it cannot be said that the buyer is exercising right 
of unilateral and specific selection which meets the criteria of 
Sec. 760.3(d). For this reason, agreement to the contractual language 
discussed here would constitute an agreement to refuse to do business 
with any person rejected by the

[[Page 507]]

buyer and would violate Sec. 760.2(a) of this part.

[61 FR 12862, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 65 FR 34950, June 1, 2000]

              Supplement No. 14 to Part 760--Interpretation

    (a) Contractual clause concerning import, customs and boycott laws 
of a boycotting country.
    The following language has appeared in tender documents issued by a 
boycotting country:
    ``Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that the import, 
Customs and boycott laws, rules and regulations of [name of boycotting 
country] apply in importing to [name of boycotting country].''
    ``Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that under these laws, 
rules and regulations, it is prohibited to import into [name of the 
boycotting country] any products or parts thereof that originated in 
[name of boycotted country]; were manufactured, produced or imported by 
companies formed under the laws of [name of boycotted country]; or were 
manufactured, produced or imported by nationals or residents of [name of 
boycotted country].''
    Agreeing to the above contractual language is a prohibited agreement 
to refuse to do business, under Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. The first 
paragraph requires broad acknowledgment of the application of the 
boycotting country's boycott laws, rules and regulations. Unless this 
language is qualified to apply only to boycott restrictions with which 
U.S. persons may comply, agreement to it is prohibited. See 
Sec. 760.2(a) of this part, examples (v) and (vi) under ``Agreements to 
Refuse to Do Business.''
    The second paragraph does not limit the scope of the boycott 
restrictions referenced in the first paragraph. It states that the 
boycott laws include restrictions on goods originating in the boycotted 
country; manufactured, produced or supplied by companies organized under 
the laws of the boycotted country; or manufactured, produced or supplied 
by nationals or residents of the boycotted country. Each of these 
restrictions is within the exception for compliance with the import 
requirements of the boycotting country (Sec. 760.3(a) of this part). 
However, the second paragraph's list of restrictions is not exclusive. 
Since the boycott laws generally include more than what is listed and 
permissible under the antiboycott law, U.S. persons may not agree to the 
quoted clause. For example, a country's boycott laws may prohibit 
imports of goods manufactured by blacklisted firms. Except as provided 
by Sec. 760.3(g) of this part, agreement to and compliance with this 
boycott restriction would be prohibited under the antiboycott law.
    The above contractual language is distinguished from the contract 
clause determined to be permissible in supplement 1, Part II, A, by its 
acknowledgment that the boycott requirements of the boycotting country 
apply. Although the first sentence of the Supplement 1 clause does not 
exclude the possible application of boycott laws, it refers only to the 
import and customs laws of the boycotting country without mentioning the 
boycott laws as well. As discussed fully in Supplement No. 1 to part 
760, compliance with or agreement to the clause quoted there is, 
therefore, permissible.
    The contract clause quoted above, as well as the clause dealt with 
in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, part II, A, is reportable under 
Sec. 760.5(a)(1) of this part.
    (b) Letter of credit terms removing blacklist certificate 
requirement if specified vessels used.
    The following terms frequently appear on letters of credit covering 
shipment to Iraq:
    ``Shipment to be effected by Iraqi State Enterprise for Maritime 
Transport Vessels or by United Arab Shipping Company (SAB) vessels, if 
available.''
    ``If shipment is effected by any of the above company's [sic] 
vessels, black list certificate or evidence to that effect is not 
required.''
    These terms are not reportable and compliance with them is 
permissible.
    The first sentence, a directive to use Iraqi State Enterprise for 
Maritime Transport or United Arab Shipping vessels, is neither 
reportable nor prohibited because it is not considered by the Department 
to be boycott-related. The apparent reason for the directive is Iraq's 
preference to have cargo shipped on its own vessels (or, as in the case 
of United Arab Shipping, on vessels owned by a company in part 
established and owned by the Iraqi government). Such ``cargo 
preference'' requirements, calling for the use of an importing or 
exporting country's own ships, are common throughout the world and are 
imposed for non-boycott reasons. (See Sec. 760.2(a) of this part, 
example (vii) AGREEMENTS TO REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS.)
    In contrast, if the letter of credit contains a list of vessels or 
carriers that appears to constitute a boycott-related whitelist, a 
directive to select a vessel from that list would be both reportable and 
prohibited. When such a directive appears in conjunction with a term 
removing the blacklist certificate requirement if these vessels are 
used, the Department will presume that beneficiaries, banks and any 
other U.S. person receiving the letter of credit know that there is a 
boycott-related purpose for the directive.
    The second sentence of the letter of credit language quoted above 
does not, by itself, call for a blacklist certificate and is not 
therefore, reportable. If a term elsewhere on

[[Page 508]]

the letter of credit imposes a blacklist certificate requirement, then 
that other term would be reportable.
    (c) Information not related to a particular transaction in U.S. 
commerce.
    Under Sec. 760.2 (c), (d) and (e), of this part U.S. persons are 
prohibited, with respect to their activities in U.S. commerce, from 
furnishing certain information. It is the Department's position that the 
required nexus with U.S. commerce is established when the furnishing of 
information itself occurs in U.S. commerce. Even when the furnishing of 
information is not itself in U.S. commerce, however, the necessary 
relationship to U.S. commerce will be established if the furnishing of 
information relates to particular transactions in U.S. commerce or to 
anticipated transactions in U.S. commerce. See, e.g. Sec. 760.2(d), 
examples (vii), (ix) and (xii) of this part.
    The simplest situation occurs where a U.S. person located in the 
United States furnishes information to a boycotting country. The 
transfer of information from the United States to a foreign country is 
itself an activity in U.S. commerce. See Sec. 760.1(d)(1)(iv) of this 
part. In some circumstances, the furnishing of information by a U.S. 
person located outside the United States may also be an activity in U.S. 
commerce. For example, the controlled foreign subsidiary of a domestic 
concern might furnish to a boycotting country information the subsidiary 
obtained from the U.S.-located parent for that purpose. The subsidiary's 
furnishing would, in these circumstances, constitute an activity in U.S. 
commerce. See Sec. 760.1(d)(8) of this part.
    Where the furnishing of information is not itself in U.S. commerce, 
the U.S. commerce requirement may be satisfied by the fact that the 
furnishing is related to an activity in U.S. foreign or domestic 
commerce. For example, if a shipment of goods by a controlled-in-fact 
foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company to a boycotting country gives rise 
to an inquiry from the boycotting country concerning the subsidiary's 
relationship with another firm, the Department regards any responsive 
furnishing of information by the subsidiary as related to the shipment 
giving rise to the inquiry. If the shipment is in U.S. foreign or 
domestic commerce, as defined by the regulations, then the Department 
regards the furnishing to be related to an activity in U.S. commerce and 
subject to the antiboycott regulations, whether or not the furnishing 
itself is in U.S. commerce.
    In some circumstances, the Department may regard a furnishing of 
information as related to a broader category of present and prospective 
transactions. For example, if a controlled-in-fact foreign subsidiary of 
a U.S. company is requested to furnish information about its commercial 
dealings and it appears that failure to respond will result in its 
blacklisting, any responsive furnishing of information will be regarded 
by the Department as relating to all of the subsidiary's present and 
anticipated business activities with the inquiring boycotting country. 
Accordingly, if any of these present or anticipated business activities 
are in U.S. commerce, the Department will regard the furnishing as 
related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycott 
regulations.
    In deciding whether anticipated business activities will be in U.S. 
commerce, the Department will consider all of the surrounding 
circumstances. Particular attention will be given to the history of the 
U.S. person's business activities with the boycotting country and 
others, the nature of any activities occurring after a furnishing of 
information occurs and any relevant economic or commercial factors which 
may affect these activities.
    For example, if a U.S. person has no activities with the boycotting 
country at present but all of its other international activities are in 
U.S. commerce, as defined by the Regulations, then the Department is 
likely to regard any furnishing of information by that person for the 
purpose of securing entry into the boycotting country's market as 
relating to anticipated activities in U.S. commerce and subject to the 
antiboycott regulations. Similarly, if subsequent to the furnishing of 
information to the boycotting country for the purpose of securing entry 
into its markets, the U.S. person engages in transactions with that 
country which are in U.S. commerce, the Department is likely to regard 
the furnishing as related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to 
the antiboycott regulations.

              Supplement No. 15 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Section 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) of this part prohibits United States 
persons from furnishing certain types of information with intent to 
comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott against 
a country friendly to the United States. The Department has been asked 
whether prohibited information may be transmitted--that is, passed to 
others by a United States person who has not directly or indirectly 
authored the information--without such transmission constituting a 
furnishing of information in violation of Sec. 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) 
of this part. Throughout this interpretation, ``transmission'' is 
defined as the passing on by one person of information initially 
authored by another. The Department believes that there is no 
distinction in the EAR between transmitting (as defined above) and

[[Page 509]]

furnishing prohibited information under the EAR and that the 
transmission of prohibited information with the requisite boycott intent 
is a furnishing of information violative of the EAR. At the same time, 
however, the circumstances relating to the transmitting party's 
involvement will be carefully considered in determining whether that 
party intended to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned 
foreign boycott.
    The EAR does not deal specifically with the relationship between 
transmitting and furnishing. However, the restrictions in the EAR on 
responses to boycott-related conditions, both by direct and indirect 
actions and whether by primary parties or intermediaries, indicate that 
U.S. persons who simply transmit prohibited information are to be 
treated the same under the EAR as those who both author and furnish 
prohibited information. This has been the Department's position in 
enforcement actions it has brought.
    The few references in the EAR to the transmission of information by 
third parties are consistent with this position. Two examples, both 
relating to the prohibition against the furnishing of information about 
U.S. persons' race, religion, sex, or national origin (Sec. 760.2(c) of 
this part), deal explicitly with transmitting information. These 
examples (Sec. 760.2(c) of this part, example (v), and Sec. 760.3(f) of 
this part, example (vi)) show that, in certain cases, when furnishing 
certain information is permissible, either because it is not within a 
prohibition or is excepted from a prohibition, transmitting it is also 
permissible. These examples concern information that may be furnished by 
individuals about themselves or their families. The examples show that 
employers may transmit to a boycotting country visa applications or 
forms containing information about an employee's race, religion, sex, or 
national origin if that employee is the source of the information and 
authorizes its transmission. In other words, within the limits of 
ministerial action set forth in these examples, employees' actions in 
transmitting information are protected by the exception available to the 
employee. The distinction between permissible and prohibited behavior 
rests not on the definitional distinction between furnishing and 
transmitting, but on the excepted nature of the information furnished by 
the employee. The information originating from the employee does not 
lose its excepted character because it is transmitted by the employer.
    The Department's position regarding the furnishing and transmission 
of certificates of one's own blacklist status rests on a similar basis 
and does not support the contention that third parties may transmit 
prohibited information authored by another. Such self-certifications do 
not violate any prohibitions in the EAR (see Supplement Nos. 1(I)(B), 2, 
and 5(A)(2); Sec. 760.2(f), example (xiv)). It is the Department's 
position that it is not prohibited for U.S. persons to transmit such 
self-certifications completed by others. Once again, because furnishing 
the self-certification is not prohibited, third parties who transmit the 
self-certifications offend no prohibition. On the other hand, if a third 
party authored information about another's blacklist status, the act of 
transmitting that information would be prohibited.
    A third example in the EAR (Sec. 760.5, example (xiv) of this part), 
which also concerns a permissible transmission of boycott-related 
information, does not support the theory that one may transmit 
prohibited information authored by another. This example deals with the 
reporting requirements in Sec. 760.5 of this part--not the 
prohibitions--and merely illustrates that a person who receives and 
transmits a self-certification has not received a reportable request.
    It is also the Department's position that a U.S. person violates the 
prohibitions against furnishing information by transmitting prohibited 
information even if that person has received no reportable request in 
the transaction. For example, where documents accompanying a letter of 
credit contain prohibited information, a negotiating bank that transmits 
the documents, with the requisite boycott intent, to an issuing bank has 
not received a reportable request, but has furnished prohibited 
information.
    While the Department does not regard the suggested distinction 
between transmitting and furnishing information as meaningful, the facts 
relating to the third party's involvement may be important in 
determining whether that party furnished information with the required 
intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign 
boycott. For example, if it is a standard business practice for one 
participant in a transaction to obtain and pass on, without examination, 
documents prepared by another party, it might be difficult to maintain 
that the first participant intended to comply with a boycott by passing 
on information contained in the unexamined documents. Resolution of such 
intent questions, however, depends upon an analysis of the individual 
facts and circumstances of the transaction and the Department will 
continue to engage in such analysis on a case-by-case basis.
    This interpretation, like all others issued by the Department 
discussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the EAR, should 
be read narrowly. Circumstances that differ in any material way from 
those discussed in this interpretation will be considered under the 
applicable provisions of the Regulations.

              Supplement No. 16 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Pursuant to Articles 5, 7, and 26 of the Treaty of Peace between the 
State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and implementing 
legislation enacted by Jordan, Jordan's participation in the Arab 
economic boycott of Israel was formally terminated on August 16, 1995.
    On the basis of this action, it is the Department's position that 
certain requests for information, action or agreement from Jordan which 
were considered boycott-related by implication now cannot be presumed 
boycott-related and thus would not be prohibited or reportable under the 
regulations. For example, a request that an exporter certify that the 
vessel on which it is shipping its goods is eligible to enter Hashemite 
Kingdom of Jordan ports has been considered a boycott-related request 
that the exporter could not comply with because Jordan has had a boycott 
in force against Israel. Such a request from Jordan after August 16, 
1995 would not be presumed boycott-related because the underlying 
boycott requirement/basis for the certification has been eliminated. 
Similarly, a U.S. company would not be prohibited from complying with a 
request received from Jordanian government officials to furnish the 
place of birth of employees the company is seeking to take to Jordan 
because there is no underlying boycott law or policy that would give 
rise to a presumption that the request was boycott-related.
    U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their face 
boycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance or 
support of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to the 
regulations, irrespective of the country of origin. For example, 
requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'', ``Israel 
boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases or words 
indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriate 
provisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.

Sec. 762.4  Original records required.

    The regulated person must maintain the original records in the form 
in which that person receives or creates them unless that person meets 
all of the conditions of Sec. 762.5 of this part relating to 
reproduction of records. If the original record does not meet the 
standards of legibility and readability described in Sec. 762.5 of this 
part and the regulated person intends to rely on that record to meet the 
recordkeeping requirements of the EAR, that person must retain the 
original record.


<R05>
Sec. 762.5  Reproduction of original records.

    (a) The regulated person may maintain reproductions instead of the 
original records provided all of the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section are met.
    (b) In order to maintain the records required by Sec. 762.2 of this 
part, the regulated persons defined in Sec. 762.1 of this part may use 
any photographic, photostatic, miniature photographic, micrographic, 
automated archival storage, or other process that completely, 
accurately, legibly and durably reproduces the original records (whether 
on paper, microfilm, or through electronic digital storage techniques). 
The process must meet all of the following requirements, which are 
applicable to all systems:
    (1) The system must be capable of reproducing all records on paper.
    (2) The system must record and be able to reproduce all marks, 
information, and other characteristics of the original record, including 
both obverse and reverse sides of paper documents in legible form.
    (3) When displayed on a viewer, monitor, or reproduced on paper, the 
records must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability. (For 
purposes of this section, legible and legibility mean the quality of a 
letter or numeral that enable the observer to identify it positively and 
quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readable and 
readability mean the quality of a group of letters or numerals being 
recognized as complete words or numbers.)
    (4) The system must preserve the initial image (including both 
obverse and reverse sides of paper documents) and record all changes, 
who made them and when they were made. This information must be stored 
in such a manner that none of it may be altered once it is initially 
recorded.
    (5) The regulated person must establish written procedures to 
identify the individuals who are responsible for the operation, use and 
maintenance of the system.
    (6) The regulated person must establish written procedures for 
inspection and quality assurance of records in the

[[Page 513]]

system and document the implementation of those procedures.
    (7) The system must be complete and contain all records required to 
be kept by this part or the regulated person must provide a method for 
correlating, identifying and locating records relating to the same 
transaction(s) that are kept in other record keeping systems.
    (8) The regulated person must keep a record of where, when, by whom, 
and on what equipment the records and other information were entered 
into the system.
    (9) Upon request by the Office of Export Enforcement, the Office of 
Antiboycott Compliance, or any other agency of competent jurisdiction, 
the regulated person must furnish, at the examination site, the records, 
the equipment and, if necessary, knowledgeable personnel for locating, 
reading, and reproducing any record in the system.
    (c) Requirements applicable to systems based on the storage of 
digital images. For systems based on the storage of digital images, the 
system must provide accessibility to any digital image in the system. 
With respect to records of transactions, including those involving 
restrictive trade practices or boycott requirements or requests. The 
system must be able to locate and reproduce all records relating to a 
particular transaction based on any one of the following criteria:
    (1) The name(s) of the parties to the transaction;
    (2) Any country(ies) connected with the transaction; or
    (3) A document reference number that was on any original document.
    (d) Requirements applicable to a system based on photographic 
processes. For systems based on photographic, photostatic, or miniature 
photographic processes, the regulated person must maintain a detailed 
index of all records in the system that is arranged in such a manner as 
to allow immediate location of any particular record in the system.


<R05>
Sec. 762.6  Period of retention.

    (a) Five year retention period. All records required to be kept by 
the EAR must be retained for five years from the latest of the following 
times:
    (1) The export from the United States of the item involved in the 
transaction to which the records pertain or the provision of financing, 
transporting or other service for or on behalf of end-users of 
proliferation concern as described in Secs. 736.2(b)(7) and 744.6 of the 
EAR;
    (2) Any known reexport, transshipment, or diversion of such item;
    (3) Any other termination of the transaction, whether formally in 
writing or by any other means; or
    (4) In the case of records of pertaining to transactions involving 
restrictive trade practices or boycotts described in part 760 of the 
EAR, the date the regulated person receives the boycott-related request 
or requirement.
    (b) Destruction or disposal of records. If the Bureau of Export 
Administration or any other government agency makes a formal or informal 
request for a certain record or records, such record or records may not 
be destroyed or disposed of without the written authorization of the 
agency concerned. This prohibition applies to records pertaining to 
voluntary disclosures made to BXA in accordance with 
Sec. 765.5(c)(4)(ii) and other records even if such records have been 
retained for a period of time exceeding that required by paragraph (a) 
of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 762.7  Producing and inspecting records.

    (a) Persons located in the United States. Persons located in the 
United States may be asked to produce records that are required to be 
kept by any provision of the EAR, or any license, order, or 
authorization issued thereunder and to make them available for 
inspection and copying by any authorized agent, official, or employee of 
the Bureau of Export Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, or any 
other agency of the U.S. Government, without any charge or expense to 
such agent, official, or employee. The Office of Export Enforcement and 
the Office of Antiboycott Compliance encourage voluntary cooperation 
with such requests. When voluntary cooperation is not forthcoming, the 
Office of Export Enforcement and the Office of Antiboycott Compliance 
are authorized

[[Page 514]]

to issue subpoenas requiring persons to appear and testify, or produce 
books, records, and other writings. In instances where a person does not 
comply with a subpoena, the Department of Commerce may petition a 
district court to have a subpoena enforced.
    (b) Persons located outside of the United States. Persons located 
outside of the United States that are required to keep records by any 
provision of the EAR or by any license, order, or authorization issued 
thereunder shall produce all records or reproductions of records 
required to be kept, and make them available for inspection and copying 
upon request by an authorized agent, official, or employee of the Bureau 
of Export Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, or a Foreign Service 
post, or by any other accredited representative of the U.S. Government, 
without any charge or expense to such agent, official or employee.

<R05>
Sec. 764.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. This part specifies conduct that constitutes a 
violation of the Export Administration Act (EAA) and/or the Export 
Administration Regulations (EAR) and the sanctions that may be imposed 
for such violations. Antiboycott violations are described in part 760 of 
the EAR, and the violations and sanctions specified in part 764 also 
apply to conduct relating to part 760, unless otherwise stated. This 
part describes administrative sanctions that may be imposed by the 
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA). This part also describes criminal 
sanctions that may be imposed by a United States court and other 
sanctions that are neither administrative nor criminal. Information is 
provided on how to report and disclose violations. Finally, this part 
identifies protective administrative measures that BXA may take in the 
exercise of its regulatory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 764.2  Violations.

    (a) Engaging in prohibited conduct. No person may engage in any 
conduct prohibited by or contrary to, or refrain from engaging in any 
conduct required by, the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or 
authorization issued thereunder.
    (b) Causing, aiding, or abetting a violation. No person may cause or 
aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, procure, or permit the doing of any 
act prohibited, or the omission of any act required, by the EAA, the 
EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder.
    (c) Solicitation and attempt. No person may solicit or attempt a 
violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization 
issued thereunder.
    (d) Conspiracy. No person may conspire or act in concert with one or 
more persons in any manner or for any purpose to bring about or to do 
any act that constitutes a violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, 
license or authorization issued thereunder.
    (e) Acting with knowledge of a violation. No person may order, buy, 
remove, conceal, store, use, sell, loan, dispose of, transfer, 
transport, finance, forward, or otherwise service, in whole or in part, 
any item exported or to be exported from the United States, or that is 
otherwise subject to the EAR, with knowledge that a violation of the 
EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, 
has

[[Page 515]]

occurred, is about to occur, or is intended to occur in connection with 
the item.
    (f) Possession with intent to export illegally. No person may 
possess any item controlled for national security or foreign policy 
reasons under sections 5 or 6 of the EAA:
    (1) With intent to export or reexport such item in violation of the 
EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder; 
or
    (2) With knowledge or reason to believe that the item would be so 
exported or reexported.
    (g) Misrepresentation and concealment of facts. (1) No person may 
make any false or misleading representation, statement, or

United States agency, or indirectly through any other person:
    (i) In the course of an investigation or other action subject to the 
EAR; or
    (ii) In connection with the preparation, submission, issuance, use,

or
    (iii) For the purpose of or in connection with effecting an export, 
reexport or other activity subject to the EAR.
    (2) All representations, statements, and certifications made by any 
person are deemed to be continuing in effect. Every person who has made 
any representation, statement, or certification must notify BXA and any 
other relevant agency, in writing, of any change of any material fact or 
intention from that previously represented, stated, or certified, 
immediately upon receipt of any information that would lead a reasonably 
prudent person to know that a change of material fact or intention has 
occurred or may occur in the future.
    (h) Evasion. No person may engage in any transaction or take any 
other action with intent to evade the provisions of the EAA, the EAR, or 
any order, license or authorization issued thereunder.
    (i) Failure to comply with reporting, recordkeeping requirements. No 
person may fail or refuse to comply with any reporting or recordkeeping 
requirement of the EAR or of any order, license or authorization issued

    (k) Acting contrary to the terms of a denial order. No person may 
take any action that is prohibited by a denial order. See 
Sec. 764.3(a)(2) of this part.

[61 FR 12902, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25469, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 764.3  Sanctions.

    (a) Administrative.\1\ Violations of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, 
license or authorization issued thereunder are subject to the 
administrative sanctions described in this section and to any other 
liability, sanction, or penalty available under law. The protective 
administrative measures that are described in Sec. 764.6 of this part 
are distinct from administrative sanctions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In the event that any part of the EAR is not under the authority 
of the EAA, sanctions shall be limited to those provided for by such 
other authority, but the provisions of this part and of part 766 of the 
EAR shall apply insofar as not inconsistent with that other authority.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Civil penalty. (i) A civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 may be 
imposed for each violation, except that a civil penalty not to exceed 
$100,000 may be imposed for each violation involving national security 
controls imposed under section 5 of the EAA.
    (ii) The payment of any civil penalty may be made a condition, for a 
period not exceeding one year after the imposition of such penalty, to 
the granting, restoration, or continuing validity of any export license, 
License Exception, permission, or privilege granted or to be granted to 
the person upon whom such penalty is imposed.
    (iii) The payment of any civil penalty may be deferred or suspended 
in whole or in part during any probation period that may be imposed. 
Such deferral or suspension shall not bar the collection of the penalty 
if the conditions of the

[[Page 516]]

deferral, suspension, or probation are not fulfilled.
    (2) Denial of export privileges. An order may be issued that 
restricts the ability of the named persons to engage in export and 
reexport transactions involving items subject to the EAR, or that 
restricts access by named persons to items subject to the EAR. An order 
denying export privileges may be imposed either as a sanction for a 
violation specified in this part or as a protective administrative 
measure described in Sec. 764.6(c) or (d) of this part. An order denying 
export privileges may suspend or revoke any or all outstanding licenses 
issued under the EAR to a person named in the denial order or in which 
such person has an interest, may deny or restrict exports and reexports 
by or to such person of any item subject to the EAR, and may restrict 
dealings in which that person may benefit from any export or reexport of 
such items. The standard terms of a denial order are set forth in 
Supplement No. 1 to this part. A non-standard denial order, narrower in 
scope, may be issued. Authorization to engage in actions otherwise 
prohibited by a denial order may be given by the Office of Exporter 
Services, in consultation with the Office of Export Enforcement, 
following application by a person named in the denial order or by a 
person seeking permission to deal with a named person.
    (3) Exclusion from practice. Any person acting as an attorney, 
accountant, consultant, freight forwarder, or in any other 
representative capacity for any license application or other matter 
before BXA may be excluded by order from any or all such activities 
before BXA.
    (b) Criminal.\2\ (1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, whoever knowingly violates or conspires to or attempts 
to violate the EAA, EAR, or any order or license issued thereunder, 
shall be fined not more than five times the value of the exports or 
reexports involved or $50,000, whichever is greater, or imprisoned not 
more than five years, or both.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ In the event that any part of the EAR is not under the authority 
of the EAA, sanctions shall be limited to those provided for by such 
other authority or by 18 U.S.C. 3571, a criminal code provision that 
establishes a maximum criminal fine for a felony that is the greater of 
the amount provided by the statute that was violated, or an amount not 
more than $500,000 for an organization. The Federal Sentencing 
Guidelines found in Sec. 2M5.1 of Appendix 4 to Title 18 of the United 
States Code apply, to the extent followed by the court, to sentencing 
for convictions for violating the EAA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Willful violations. (i) Whoever willfully violates or conspires 
to or attempts to violate any provision of the EAA, the EAR, or any 
order or license issued thereunder, with knowledge that the exports 
involved will be used for the benefit of, or that the destination or 
intended destination of items involved is, any controlled country or any 
country to which exports or reexports are controlled for foreign policy 
purposes, except in the case of an individual, shall be fined not more 
than five times the value of the export or reexport involved or 
$1,000,000, whichever is greater; and, in the case of an individual, 
shall be fined not more than $250,000, or imprisoned not more than 10 
years, or both.
    (ii) Any person who is issued a license under the EAA or the EAR for 
the export or reexport of any items to a controlled country and who, 
with knowledge that such export or reexport is being used by such 
controlled country for military or intelligence gathering purposes 
contrary to the conditions under which the license was issued, willfully 
fails to report such use to the Secretary of Defense, except in the case 
of an individual, shall be fined not more than five times the value of 
the exports or reexports involved or $1,000,000, whichever is greater; 
and in the case of an individual, shall be fined not more than $250,000, 
or imprisoned not more than five years or both.
    (iii) Any person who possesses any item with the intent to export or 
reexport such item in violation of an export control imposed under 
sections 5 or 6 of the EAA, the EAR, or any order or license issued 
thereunder, or knowing or having reason to believe that the item would 
be so exported or reexported, shall, in the case of a violation of an 
export control imposed under section 5 of the EAA (or the EAR, or any 
order

[[Page 517]]

or license issued thereunder with respect to such control), be subject 
to the penalties set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and 
shall in the case of a violation of an export control imposed under 
section 6 of the EAA (or the EAR, or any order or license issued 
thereunder with respect to such control), be subject to the penalties 
set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (iv) Any person who takes any action with intent to evade the 
provisions of the EAA, the EAR, or any order or license issued 
thereunder, shall be subject to the penalties set forth in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, except that in the case of an evasion of an 
export control imposed under sections 5 or 6 of the EAA (or the EAR, or 
any order or license issued thereunder with respect to such control), 
such person shall be subject to the penalties set forth in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Other criminal sanctions. Conduct that constitutes a violation 
of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued 
thereunder, or that occurs in connection with such a violation, may also 
be prosecuted under other provisions of law, including 18 U.S.C. 371 
(conspiracy), 18 U.S.C. 1001 (false statements), 18 U.S.C. 1341, 1343, 
and 1346 (mail and wire fraud), and 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 (money 
laundering).
    (c) Other sanctions. Conduct that violates the EAA, the EAR, or any 
order, license or authorization issued thereunder, and other conduct 
specified in the EAA may be subject to sanctions or other measures in 
addition to criminal and administrative sanctions under the EAA or EAR. 
These include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Statutory sanctions. Statutorily-mandated sanctions may be 
imposed on account of specified conduct related to weapons 
proliferation. Such statutory sanctions are not civil or criminal 
penalties, but restrict imports and procurement (See section 11A of the 
EAA, Multilateral Export Control Violations, and section 11C of the EAA, 
Chemical and Biological Weapons Proliferation), or restrict export 
licenses (See section 11B of the EAA, Missile Proliferation Violations, 
and the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992).
    (2) Other sanctions and measures--(i) Seizure and forfeiture. Items 
that have been, are being, or are intended to be, exported or shipped 
from or taken out of the United States in violation of the EAA, the EAR, 
or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, are subject to 
being seized and detained as are the vessels, vehicles, and aircraft 
carrying such items. Seized items are subject to forfeiture. (50 U.S.C. 
app. 2411(g); 22 U.S.C. 401.)
    (ii) Cross-debarment. (A) The Department of State may deny licenses 
or approvals for the export or reexport of defense articles and defense 
services controlled under the Arms Export Control Act to persons 
indicted or convicted of specified criminal offenses, including 
violations of the EAA, or to persons denied export privileges by BXA or 
another agency. (22 CFR 126.7(a) and 127.11(a).)
    (B) The Department of Defense, among other agencies, may suspend the 
right of any person to contract with the United States Government based 
on export control violations. (Federal Acquisition Regulations 9.407-2.)

[61 FR 12902, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25469, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 764.4  Reporting of violations.

    (a) Where to report. If a person learns that an export control 
violation of the EAR has occurred or may occur, that person may notify:

Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Export Administration,U.S. 
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room 
H-4520, Washington, D.C. 20230, Tel: (202) 482-1208, Facsimile: (202) 
482-0964


or, for violations of part 760 of the EAR:

Office of Antiboycott Compliance, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room 
H-6099C, Washington, D.C. 20230, Tel: (202) 482-2381, Facsimile: (202) 
482-0913.

    (b) Failure to report violations. Failure to report potential 
violations may result in the unwarranted issuance of licenses or exports 
without the required licenses to the detriment of the interests of the 
United States.

[[Page 518]]

    (c) Reporting requirement distinguished. The reporting provisions in 
paragraph (a) of this section are not ``reporting requirements'' within 
the meaning of Sec. 764.2(i) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 764.5  Voluntary self-disclosure.

    (a) General policy. BXA strongly encourages disclosure to OEE if you 
believe that you may have violated the EAR, or any order, license or 
authorization issued thereunder. Voluntary self-disclosure is a 
mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, 
will be sought by OEE.
    (b) Limitations. (1) The provisions of this section do not apply to 
disclosures of violations relating to part 760 of the EAR.
    (2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is 
provided to OEE for its review in determining whether to take 
administrative action under part 766 of the EAR for violations of the 
export control provisions of the EAR.
    (3) The provisions of this section apply only when information is 
received by OEE for review prior to the time that OEE, or any other 
agency of the United States Government, has learned the same or 
substantially similar information from another source and has commenced 
an investigation or inquiry in connection with that information.
    (4) While voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in 
determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by 
OEE, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors 
in a case. The weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solely 
within the discretion of OEE, and the mitigating effect of voluntary 
self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. Voluntary 
self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to the 
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. In such a case, OEE 
would notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary self-disclosure, 
but the consideration of that factor is within the discretion of the 
Department of Justice.
    (5) A firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under this 
section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the full 
knowledge and authorization of the firm's senior management.
    (6) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied 
on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or 
protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or 
entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter.
    (c) Information to be provided. (1) General. Any person wanting to 
disclose information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure 
should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify OEE as soon as 
possible after violations are discovered, and then conduct a thorough 
review of all export-related transactions where violations are 
suspected.
    (2) Initial notification. (i) The initial notification should be in 
writing and be sent to one of the addresses in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of this 
part. The notification should include the name of the person making the 
disclosure and a brief description of the suspected violations. The 
notification should describe the general nature and extent of the 
violations. If the person making the disclosure subsequently completes 
the narrative account required by Sec. 764.5(c)(3) of this part, the 
disclosure will be deemed to have been made on the date of the initial 
notification for purposes of Sec. 764.5(b)(3) of this part.
    (ii) OEE recognizes that there may be situations where it will not 
be practical to make an initial notification in writing. For example, 
written notification may not be practical if a shipment leaves the 
United States without the required license, yet there is still an 
opportunity to prevent acquisition of the items by unauthorized persons. 
In such situations, OEE should be contacted promptly at one of the 
offices listed in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of this part.
    (3) Narrative account. After the initial notification, a thorough 
review should be conducted of all export-related transactions where 
possible violations are suspected. OEE recommends that the review cover 
a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification. If 
your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing to discover 
violations that may later become the subject of an investigation. Any 
violations not voluntarily disclosed do not

[[Page 519]]

receive consideration under this section. However, the failure to make 
such disclosures will not be treated as a separate violation unless some 
other section of the EAR or other provision of law requires disclosure. 
Upon completion of the review, OEE should be furnished with a narrative 
account that sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that 
their nature and gravity can be assessed. The narrative account should 
also describe the nature of the review conducted and measures that may 
have been taken to minimize the likelihood that violations will occur in 
the future. The narrative account should include:
    (i) The kind of violation involved, for example, a shipment without 
the required license or dealing with a party denied export privileges;
    (ii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred;
    (iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and 
organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities 
giving rise to the violations;
    (iv) License numbers;
    (v) The description, quantity, value in U.S. dollars and ECCN or 
other classification of the items involved; and
    (vi) A description of any mitigating circumstances.
    (4) Supporting documentation. (i) The narrative account should be 
accompanied by copies of documents that explain and support it, 
including:
    (A) Licensing documents such as licenses, license applications, 
import certificates and end-user statements;
    (B) Shipping documents such as Shipper's Export Declarations, air 
waybills and bills of lading; and
    (C) Other documents such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and other 
evidence of written or oral communications, internal memoranda, purchase 
orders, invoices, letters of credit and brochures.
    (ii) Any relevant documents not attached to the narrative account 
must be retained by the person making the disclosure until OEE requests 
them, or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been 
made. After a final decision, the documents should be maintained in 
accordance with the recordkeeping rules in part 762 of the EAR.
    (5) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that 
all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-
disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge 
and belief. Certifications made by a corporation or other organization 
should be signed by an official of the corporation or other organization 
with the authority to do so. Section 764.2(g) of this part, relating to 
false or misleading representations, applies in connection with the 
disclosure of information under this section.
    (6) oral presentations. OEE believes that oral presentations are 
generally not necessary to augment the written narrative account and 
supporting documentation. If the person making the disclosure believes 
otherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with the 
disclosure.
    (7) Where to make voluntary self-disclosures. The information 
constituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondence 
pertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure may be submitted to:

Office of Export Enforcement, Director, Intelligence Division, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 70, Washington, D.C. 20044

    (d) Action by the Office of Export Enforcement. After OEE has been 
provided with the required narrative and supporting documentation, it 
will acknowledge the disclosure by letter, provide the person making the 
disclosure with a point of contact, and take whatever additional action, 
including further investigation, it deems appropriate. As quickly as the 
facts and circumstances of a given case permit, OEE may take any of the 
following actions:
    (1) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts 
disclosed, it plans to take no action;
    (2) Issue a warning letter;
    (3) Issue a proposed charging letter pursuant to Sec. 766.18 of the 
EAR and attempt to settle the matter;
    (4) Issue a charging letter pursuant to Sec. 766.3 of the EAR if a 
settlement is not reached; and/or
    (5) Refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal 
prosecution.
    (e) Criteria. For purposes of determining what administrative action 
to take and what sanctions, if any, to seek, the fact that a voluntary 
self-disclosure has been made will be a mitigating factor. OEE will take 
that factor into account along with other mitigating and aggravating 
factors when determining what, if any, administrative sanctions should 
be imposed. The factors that OEE will consider are in its sole 
discretion, but may include:
    (1) The extent to which the purpose of the control is undermined by 
the transaction;
    (2) Whether the transaction would have been authorized had proper 
application been made;
    (3) The quantity and value of the items involved;
    (4) Why the violations occurred. For example, OEE may consider 
whether the violations were intentional or inadvertent; the degree to 
which the person responsible for the violation making the disclosure was 
familiar with the EAR; and whether the violator has been the subject of 
prior administrative or criminal action under the EAA or the EAR;
    (5) Whether, as a result of the information provided, OEE is able to 
prevent any items exported illegally from reaching unauthorized persons 
or destinations;
    (6) The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation;
    (7) Whether the person has instituted or improved an internal 
compliance program to reduce the likelihood of future violations.
    (f) Treatment of unlawfully exported items after voluntary self-
disclosure. (1) Any person taking certain actions with knowledge that a 
violation of the EAA or the EAR has occurred has violated Sec. 764.2(e) 
of this part. Any person who has made a voluntary self-disclosure knows 
that a violation may have occurred. Therefore, at the time that a 
voluntary self-disclosure is made, the person making the disclosure may 
request permission from BXA to engage in the activities described in 
Sec. 764.2(e) of this part that would otherwise be prohibited. If the 
request is granted by the Office of Exporter Services in consultation 
with OEE, future activities with respect to those items that would 
otherwise violate Sec. 764.2(e) of this part will not constitute 
violations. However, even if permission is granted, the person making 
the voluntary self-disclosure is not absolved from liability for any 
violations disclosed nor relieved of the obligation to obtain any 
required reexport authorizations.
    (2) A license to reexport items that are the subject of a voluntary 
self-disclosure, and that have been exported contrary to the provisions 
of the EAA or the EAR, may be requested from BXA in accordance with the 
provisions of part 748 of the EAR. If the applicant

[[Page 521]]

for reexport authorization knows that the items are the subject of a 
voluntary self-disclosure, the request should state that a voluntary 
self-disclosure was made in connection with the export of the 
commodities for which reexport authorization is sought.

of the EAA.

 Supplement No. 1 to Part 764--Standard Terms of Orders Denying Export 
                               Privileges

    (a) General. Orders denying export privileges may be ``standard'' or 
``non-standard.'' This supplement specifies terms of the standard order 
denying export privileges. All denial orders are published in the 
Federal Register. The failure by any person to comply with any denial 
order is a violation of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). 
(See General Prohibition Four at Sec. 736.2(b)(4) of the EAR; 
Sec. 764.2(k) of this part.) All persons whose export privileges are 
denied by any form of denial order are identified on the Denied Persons 
List (Supplement No. 2 to this part), with an indication of whether an 
order is standard or non-standard denoted in the ``Terms of order'' 
column. The Denied Persons List also tells you where each denial order 
can be found in the Federal Register. Reference should be made to the 
text of the denial order, as published in the Federal Register, to learn 
the scope of any denial order, including any non-standard denial order.
    Denial orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, are to be construed, 
insofar as possible, as having the same scope and effect as the standard 
denial order.
    The introduction to each denial order shall be specific to that 
order, and shall include: (1) The name and address of any denied persons 
and any related persons subject to the denial order; (2) the basis for 
the denial order, such as final decision following charges of violation, 
settlement agreement, Sec. 11(h) of the EAA, or temporary denial order 
request; (3) the period of denial, the effective date of the order, 
whether and for how long any portion of the denial of export privileges 
is suspended, and any conditions of probation; and (4) whether any or 
all outstanding licenses issued under the EAR to the person(s) named in 
the denial order or in which such person(s) has an interest, are 
suspended or revoked.
    (b) Standard text. The standard denial order shall provide:
    ``It is therefore ordered:
    First, that [the denied person(s)] may not, directly or indirectly, 
participate in any way in any transaction involving any commodity, 
software or technology (hereinafter collectively referred to as 
``item'') exported or to be exported from the United States that is 
subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), or in any other 
activity subject to the EAR, including, but not limited to:
    A. Applying for, obtaining, or using any license, License Exception, 
or export control document;
    B. Carrying on negotiations concerning, or ordering, buying, 
receiving, using, selling, delivering, storing, disposing of, 
forwarding, transporting, financing, or otherwise servicing in any way, 
any transaction involving any item exported or to be exported from the 
United States that is subject to the EAR, or in any other activity 
subject to the EAR; or
    C. Benefiting in any way from any transaction involving any item 
exported or to be exported from the United States that is subject to the 
EAR, or in any other activity subject to the EAR.
    Second, that no person may, directly or indirectly, do any of the 
following:
    A. Export or reexport to or on behalf of the denied person any item 
subject to the EAR;
    B. Take any action that facilitates the acquisition or attempted 
acquisition by a denied person of the ownership, possession, or control 
of any item subject to the EAR that has been or will be exported from 
the United States, including financing or other support activities 
related to a transaction whereby a denied person acquires or attempts to 
acquire such ownership, possession or control;
    C. Take any action to acquire from or to facilitate the acquisition 
or attempted acquisition from the denied person of any item

[[Page 522]]

subject to the EAR that has been exported from the United States;
    D. Obtain from the denied person in the United States any item 
subject to the EAR with knowledge or reason to know that the item will 
be, or is intended to be, exported from the United States; or
    E. Engage in any transaction to service any item subject to the EAR 
that has been or will be exported from the United States and which is 
owned, possessed or controlled by a denied person, or service any item, 
of whatever origin, that is owned, possessed or controlled by a denied 
person if such service involves the use of any item subject to the EAR 
that has been or will be exported from the United States. For purposes 
of this paragraph, servicing means installation, maintenance, repair, 
modification or testing.
    Third, that, after notice and opportunity for comment as provided in 
Sec. 766.23 of the EAR, any person, firm, corporation, or business 
organization related to the denied person by affiliation, ownership, 
control, or position of responsibility in the conduct of trade or 
related services may also be made subject to the provisions of this 
order.
    Fourth, that this order does not prohibit any export, reexport, or 
other transaction subject to the EAR where the only items involved that 
are subject to the EAR are the foreign-produced direct product of U.S.-
origin technology.
    This order, which constitutes the final agency action in this 
matter, is effective immediately.''

            Supplement No. 2 to Part 764--Denied Persons List

    (a) General. (1) The Denied Persons List identifies those persons 
denied export privileges by the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) 
pursuant to the terms of an order. Part A of the Denied Persons List 
lists all denied persons in alphabetical order and provides 
supplementary information, while Part B lists all denied persons by 
geographic area. Part A of the Denied Persons List is organized into 
five columns, including the name and address of the denied person, the 
effective and expiration dates of the order, a brief description of the 
terms of the order, and a citation to the Federal Register where the 
terms of the order can be located. Reference should always be made to 
the text of a denial order when using the Denied Persons List.
    (2) Denial orders issued subsequent to March 25, 1996, shall be 
identified in part A as being standard or non-standard, and denial 
orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, shall be construed, insofar as 
possible, as having the same scope and effect as the standard denial 
order. Non-standard orders are denoted by the phrase ``non-standard'' in 
the ``Terms of order'' column in part A, standard orders are denoted by 
the word ``standard,'' and orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, are 
denoted by the same brief description entered at the time of issuance. 
Standard orders denying export privileges contain the standard terms set 
forth in Supplement No. 1 to part 764.
    (3) You are responsible for ensuring that you take no action 
involving items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) 
that is contrary to the terms of a denial order.
    (b) Related persons. Related persons who are denied export 
privileges subsequent to [the effective date of the interim EAR] shall 
appear in part A of the Denied Persons List with a note identifying the 
denied persons to whom they are related in the column entitled ``Terms 
of order.''
    (c) Publication. New and amended denial orders are published in the 
Federal Register as they are issued. This publication constitutes 
official notice to the public.
    (d) Updates and availability. (1) As a convenience for the public, 
issuance of denial orders is announced in Export Administration 
Bulletins. Part A of the Denied Persons List is also available 
electronically on two bulletin boards of Department of Commerce 
agencies, Fedworld (National Technical Information Service) and the 
Economic Bulletin Board (Economics and Statistics Administration).

<R05>
Sec. 766.1  Scope.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. This part describes the procedures for imposing 
administrative sanctions for violations of the Export Administration Act 
of 1979, as amended (the EAA), the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR), or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. Parts 
760 and 764 of the EAR specify those actions that constitute violations, 
and part 764 describes the sanctions that apply. In addition to 
describing the procedures for imposing sanctions, this part describes 
the procedures for imposing temporary denial orders to prevent imminent 
violations of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization 
issued thereunder. This part also describes the procedures for taking 
the discretionary protective administrative action of denying the export 
privileges of persons who have been convicted of violating any of the 
statutes, including the EAA, listed in section 11(h) of the EAA. Nothing 
in this part shall be construed as applying to or limiting other 
administrative or enforcement action relating to the EAA or the EAR, 
including the exercise of any investigative authorities conferred by the 
EAA. This part does not confer any procedural rights or impose any 
requirements based on the Administrative Procedure Act for proceedings 
charging violations under the EAA, except as expressly provided for in 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 766.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following definitions apply:
    Administrative law judge. The person authorized to conduct hearings 
in administrative enforcement proceedings brought under the EAA or to 
hear appeals from the imposition of temporary denial orders. The term 
``judge'' may be used for brevity when it is clear that the reference is 
to the administrative law judge.
    Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, 
Bureau of Export Administration.
    Bureau of Export Administration (BXA). Bureau of Export 
Administration, United States Department of Commerce, and all of its

Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Office of Export Enforcement, and 
the Office of Exporter Services.
    Final decision. A decision or order assessing a civil penalty, 
denial of export privileges or other sanction, or otherwise disposing of 
or dismissing a case, which is not subject to further review under this 
part, but which is subject to collection proceedings or judicial review 
in an appropriate Federal district court as authorized by law.
    Initial decision. A decision of the administrative law judge in 
proceedings involving violations relating to part 760 of the EAR, which 
is subject to appellate review by the Under Secretary for Export 
Administration, but which becomes the final decision in the absence of 
such an appeal.
    Party. BXA and any person named as a respondent under this part.
    Recommended decision. A decision of the administrative law judge in 
proceedings involving violations other than those relating to part 760

Commerce for Export Administration, who issues a written order 
affirming, modifying or vacating the recommended decision.
    Respondent. Any person named as the subject of a charging letter,

<R05>
Sec. 766.3  Institution of administrative enforcement proceedings.

    (a) Charging letters. The Director of the Office of Export 
Enforcement <SUP>1</SUP> (OEE) or the Director of the Office of 
Antiboycott Compliance (OAC), as appropriate, may begin administrative 
enforcement proceedings under this part by issuing a charging letter in 
the name of BXA. The charging letter shall constitute the formal 
complaint and will state that there is reason to believe that a 
violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization 
issued thereunder, has occurred. It will set forth the essential facts 
about the alleged violation, refer to the specific regulatory or other 
provisions involved, and give notice of the sanctions available under 
part 764 of the EAR. The charging letter will inform the respondent that 
failure to answer the charges as provided in Sec. 766.6 of this part 
will be treated as a default under Sec. 766.7 of this part, that the 
respondent is entitled to a hearing if a written demand for one is 
requested with the answer, and that the respondent may be represented by 
counsel, or by other authorized representative who has a power of 
attorney to represent the respondent. A copy of the charging letter 
shall be filed with the administrative law judge, which filing shall 
toll the running of the applicable statute of limitations. Charging 
letters may be amended or supplemented at any time before an answer is 
filed, or, with permission of the administrative law judge, afterwards. 
BXA may unilaterally withdraw charging letters at any time, by notifying 
the respondent and the administrative law judge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ By agreement with the Director of the Office of Strategic 
Industries and Economic Resource Administration, the Director of the 
Office of Export Enforcement enforces short supply controls imposed 
under section 7 of the EAA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Notice of issuance of charging letter instituting administrative 
enforcement proceeding. A respondent shall be notified of the issuance 
of a charging letter, or any amendment or supplement thereto:
    (1) By mailing a copy by registered or certified mail addressed to 
the respondent at the respondent's last known address;
    (2) By leaving a copy with the respondent or with an officer, a 
managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment 
or by law to receive service of process for the respondent; or
    (3) By leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion 
who resides at the respondent's last known dwelling.
    (4) Delivery of a copy of the charging letter, if made in the manner 
described in paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, shall be evidenced 
by a certificate of service signed by the person making such service, 
stating the method of service and the identity of the person with whom 
the charging letter was left. The certificate of service shall be filed 
with the administrative law judge.
    (c) Date. The date of service of notice of the issuance of a 
charging letter instituting an administrative enforcement proceeding, or 
service of notice of the issuance of a supplement or amendment to a 
charging letter, is the date of its delivery, or of its attempted 
delivery if delivery is refused.


<R05>
Sec. 766.4  Representation.

    A respondent individual may appear and participate in person, a 
corporation by a duly authorized officer or employee, and a partnership 
by a partner. If a respondent is represented by counsel, counsel shall 
be a member in good standing of the bar of any State, Commonwealth or 
Territory of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, or be 
licensed to practice law in the country in which counsel resides if not 
the United States. A respondent personally, or through counsel or other 
representative, shall file a notice of appearance with the 
administrative law judge. BXA will be represented by the Office of Chief 
Counsel for Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 766.5  Filing and service of papers other than charging letter.

    (a) Filing. All papers to be filed shall be addressed to ``EAR 
Administrative Enforcement Proceedings,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Room H-6716,

[[Page 525]]

14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, or 
such other place as the administrative law judge may designate. Filing 
by United States mail, first class postage prepaid, by express or 
equivalent parcel delivery service, or by hand delivery, is acceptable. 
Filing by mail from a foreign country shall be by airmail. In addition, 
the administrative law judge may authorize filing of papers by facsimile 
or other electronic means, provided that a hard copy of any such paper 
is subsequently filed. A copy of each paper filed shall be 
simultaneously served on each party.
    (b) Service. Service shall be made by personal delivery or by 
mailing one copy of each paper to each party in the proceeding. Service 
by delivery service or facsimile, in the manner set forth in paragraph 
(a) of this section, is acceptable. Service on BXA shall be addressed to 
the Chief Counsel for Export Administration, Room H-3839, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20230. Service on a respondent shall be to the address 
to which the charging letter was sent or to such other address as 
respondent may provide. When a party has appeared by counsel or other 
representative, service on counsel or other representative shall 
constitute service on that party.
    (c) Date. The date of filing or service is the day when the papers 
are deposited in the mail or are delivered in person, by delivery 
service, or by facsimile.
    (d) Certificate of service. A certificate of service signed by the 
party making service, stating the date and manner of service, shall 
accompany every paper, other than the charging letter, filed and served 
on parties.
    (e) Computing period of time. In computing any period of time 
prescribed or allowed by this part or by order of the administrative law 
judge or the Under Secretary, the day of the act, event, or default from 
which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. 
The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a 
Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure), in which case the period runs until 
the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a 
legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are 
excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or 
allowed is seven days or less.


<R05>
Sec. 766.6  Answer and demand for hearing.

    (a) When to answer. The respondent must answer the charging letter 
within 30 days after being served with notice of the issuance of a 
charging letter instituting an administrative enforcement proceeding, or 
within 30 days of notice of any supplement or amendment to a charging 
letter, unless time is extended under Sec. 766.16 of this part.
    (b) Contents of answer. The answer must be responsive to the 
charging letter and must fully set forth the nature of the respondent's 
defense or defenses. The answer must admit or deny specifically each 
separate allegation of the charging letter; if the respondent is without 
knowledge, the answer must so state and will operate as a denial. 
Failure to deny or controvert a particular allegation will be deemed an 
admission of that allegation. The answer must also set forth any 
additional or new matter the respondent believes supports a defense or 
claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense not specifically set 
forth in the answer shall be deemed waived, and evidence thereon may be 
refused, except for good cause shown.
    (c) Demand for hearing. If the respondent desires a hearing, a 
written demand for one must be submitted with the answer. Any demand by 
BXA for a hearing must be filed with the administrative law judge within 
30 days after service of the answer. Failure to make a timely written 
demand for a hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the party's right to a 
hearing, except for good cause shown. If no party demands a hearing, the 
matter will go forward in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 766.15 of this part.
    (d) English language required. The answer, all other papers, and all 
documentary evidence must be submitted in English, or translations into 
English

[[Page 526]]

must be filed and served at the same time.


<R05>
Sec. 766.7  Default.

    (a) General. Failure of the respondent to file an answer within the 
time provided constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear 
and contest the allegations in the charging letter. In such event, the 
administrative law judge, on BXA's motion and without further notice to 
the respondent, shall find the facts to be as alleged in the charging 
letter and render an initial or recommended decision containing findings 
of fact and appropriate conclusions of law and issue or recommend an 
order imposing appropriate sanctions. The decision and order shall be 
subject to review by the Under Secretary in accordance with the 
applicable procedures set forth in Sec. 766.21 or Sec. 766.22 of this 
part.
    (b) Petition to set aside default--(1) Procedure. Upon petition 
filed by a respondent against whom a default order has been issued, 
which petition is accompanied by an answer meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 766.6(b) of this part, the Under Secretary may, after giving all 
parties an opportunity to comment, and for good cause shown, set aside 
the default and vacate the order entered thereon and remand the matter 
to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.
    (2) Time limits. A petition under this section must be made within 
one year of the date of entry of the order which the petition seeks to 
have vacated.


<R05>
Sec. 766.8  Summary decision.

    At any time after a proceeding has been initiated, a party may move 
for a summary decision disposing of some or all of the issues. The 
administrative law judge may render an initial or recommended decision 
and issue or recommend an order if the entire record shows, as to the 
issue(s) under consideration:
    (a) That there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and
    (b) That the moving party is entitled to a summary decision as a 
matter of law.


<R05>
Sec. 766.9  Discovery.

    (a) General. The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary 
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the 
subject matter of the pending proceeding. The provisions of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure relating to discovery apply to the extent 
consistent with this part and except as otherwise provided by the 
administrative law judge or by waiver or agreement of the parties. The 
administrative law judge may make any order which justice requires to 
protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or 
undue burden or expense. These orders may include limitations on the 
scope, method, time and place of discovery, and provisions for 
protecting the confidentiality of classified or otherwise sensitive 
information.
    (b) Interrogatories and requests for admission or production of 
documents. A party may serve on any party interrogatories, requests for 
admission, or requests for production of documents for inspection and 
copying, and a party concerned may apply to the administrative law judge 
for such enforcement or protective order as that party deems warranted 
with respect to such discovery. The service of a discovery request shall 
be made at least 20 days before the scheduled date of the hearing unless 
the administrative law judge specifies a shorter time period. Copies of 
interrogatories, requests for admission and requests for production of 
documents and responses thereto shall be served on all parties, and a 
copy of the certificate of service shall be filed with the 
administrative law judge. Matters of fact or law of which admission is 
requested shall be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in 
the request (at least 10 days after service, or within such additional 
time as the administrative law judge may allow), the party to whom the 
request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement 
either denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested 
or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party to whom the request 
is directed cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters.

[[Page 527]]

    (c) Depositions. Upon application of a party and for good cause 
shown, the administrative law judge may order the taking of the 
testimony of any person by deposition and the production of specified 
documents or materials by the person at the deposition. The application 
shall state the purpose of the deposition and set forth the facts sought 
to be established through the deposition.
    (d) Enforcement. The administrative law judge may order a party to 
answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or things or 
to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a 
party does not comply with such an order, the administrative law judge 
may make a determination or enter any order in the proceeding as the 
judge deems reasonable and appropriate. The judge may strike related 
charges or defenses in whole or in part or may take particular facts 
relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or refused 
to respond as being established for purposes of the proceeding in 
accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In 
addition, enforcement by a district court of the United States may be 
sought under section 12(a) of the EAA.


<R05>
Sec. 766.10  Subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. Upon the application of any party, supported by a 
satisfactory showing that there is substantial reason to believe that 
the evidence would not otherwise be available, the administrative law 
judge will issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of 
witnesses and the production of such books, records or other documentary 
or physical evidence for the purpose of the hearing, as the judge deems 
relevant and material to the proceedings, and reasonable in scope.
    (b) Service. Subpoenas issued by the administrative law judge may be 
served in any of the methods set forth in Sec. 766.5(b) of this part.
    (c) Timing. Applications for subpoenas must be submitted at least 10 
days before the scheduled hearing or deposition, unless the 
administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown, that 
extraordinary circumstances warrant a shorter time.


<R05>
Sec. 766.11  Matter protected against disclosure.

    (a) Protective measures. It is often necessary for BXA to receive 
and consider information and documents that are sensitive from the 
standpoint of national security, foreign policy, business 
confidentiality, or investigative concern, and that are to be protected 
against disclosure. Accordingly, and without limiting the discretion of 
the administrative law judge to give effect to any other applicable 
privilege, it is proper for the administrative law judge to limit 
discovery or introduction of evidence or to issue such protective or 
other orders as in the judge's judgment may be consistent with the 
objective of preventing undue disclosure of the sensitive documents or 
information. Where the administrative law judge determines that 
documents containing the sensitive matter need to be made available to a 
respondent to avoid prejudice, the judge may direct BXA to prepare an 
unclassified and nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents. The 
administrative law judge may compare the extract or summary with the 
original to ensure that it is supported by the source document and that 
it omits only so much as must remain classified or undisclosed. The 
summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.
    (b) Arrangements for access. If the administrative law judge 
determines that this procedure is unsatisfactory and that classified or 
otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the record in order to 
avoid prejudice to a party, the judge may provide the parties 
opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a representative 
to have access to such matter without compromising sensitive 
information. Such arrangements may include obtaining security 
clearances, obtaining a national interest determination under section 
12(c) of the EAA, or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive 
information and documents subject to assurances against further 
disclosure, including a protective order, if necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 766.12  Prehearing conference.

    (a) The administrative law judge, on the judge's own motion or on 
request of

[[Page 528]]

a party, may direct the parties to participate in a prehearing 
conference, either in person or by telephone, to consider:
    (1) Simplification of issues;
    (2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;
    (3) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid 
unnecessary proof; or
    (4) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the 
proceedings.
    (b) The administrative law judge may order the conference 
proceedings to be recorded electronically or taken by a reporter, 
transcribed and filed with the judge.
    (c) If a prehearing conference is impracticable, the administrative 
law judge may direct the parties to correspond with the judge to achieve 
the purposes of such a conference.
    (d) The administrative law judge will prepare a summary of any 
actions agreed on or taken pursuant to this section. The summary will 
include any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 766.13  Hearings.

    (a) Scheduling. The administrative law judge, by agreement with the 
parties or upon notice to all parties of not less than 30 days, will 
schedule a hearing. All hearings will be held in Washington, D.C., 
unless the administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown, 
that another location would better serve the interests of justice.
    (b) Hearing procedure. Hearings will be conducted in a fair and 
impartial manner by the administrative law judge, who may limit 
attendance at any hearing or portion thereof to the parties, their 
representatives and witnesses if the judge deems this necessary or 
advisable in order to protect sensitive matter (see Sec. 766.11 of this 
part) from improper disclosure. The rules of evidence prevailing in 
courts of law do not apply, and all evidentiary material deemed by the 
administrative law judge to be relevant and material to the proceeding 
and not unduly repetitious will be received and given appropriate 
weight.
    (c) Testimony and record. Witnesses will testify under oath or 
affirmation. A verbatim record of the hearing and of any other oral 
proceedings will be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, 
transcribed and filed with the administrative law judge. A respondent 
may examine the transcript and may obtain a copy by paying any 
applicable costs. Upon such terms as the administrative law judge deems 
just, the judge may direct that the testimony of any person be taken by 
deposition and may admit an affidavit or declaration as evidence, 
provided that any affidavits or declarations have been filed and served 
on the parties sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit a party 
to file and serve an objection thereto on the grounds that it is 
necessary that the affiant or declarant testify at the hearing and be 
subject to cross-examination.
    (d) Failure to appear. If a party fails to appear in person or by 
counsel at a scheduled hearing, the hearing may nevertheless proceed, 
and that party's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the 
hearing or any proceedings or action taken thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 766.14  Interlocutory review of rulings.

    (a) At the request of a party, or on the judge's own initiative, the 
administrative law judge may certify to the Under Secretary for review a 
ruling that does not finally dispose of a proceeding, if the 
administrative law judge determines that immediate review may hasten or 
facilitate the final disposition of the matter.
    (b) Upon certification to the Under Secretary of the interlocutory 
ruling for review, the parties will have 10 days to file and serve 
briefs stating their positions, and five days to file and serve replies, 
following which the Under Secretary will decide the matter promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 766.15  Proceeding without a hearing.

    If the parties have waived a hearing, the case will be decided on 
the record by the administrative law judge. Proceeding without a hearing 
does not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts 
supporting their

[[Page 529]]

charges or defenses. Affidavits or declarations, depositions, 
admissions, answers to interrogatories and stipulations may supplement 
other documentary evidence in the record. The administrative law judge 
will give each party reasonable opportunity to file rebuttal evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 766.16  Procedural stipulations; extension of time.

    (a) Procedural stipulations. Unless otherwise ordered, a written 
stipulation agreed to by all parties and filed with the administrative 
law judge will modify any procedures established by this part.
    (b) Extension of time. (1) The parties may extend any applicable 
time limitation, by stipulation filed with the administrative law judge 
before the time limitation expires.
    (2) The administrative law judge may, on the judge's own initiative 
or upon application by any party, either before or after the expiration 
of any applicable time limitation, extend the time within which to file 
and serve an answer to a charging letter or do any other act required by 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 766.17  Decision of the administrative law judge.

    (a) Predecisional matters. Except for default proceedings under 
Sec. 766.7 of this part, the administrative law judge will give the 
parties reasonable opportunity to submit the following, which will be 
made a part of the record:
    (1) Exceptions to any ruling by the judge or to the admissibility of 
evidence proffered at the hearing;
    (2) Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (3) Supporting legal arguments for the exceptions and proposed 
findings and conclusions submitted; and
    (4) A proposed order.
    (b) Decision and order. After considering the entire record in the 
proceeding, the administrative law judge will issue a written decision.
    (1) Initial decision. For proceedings charging violations relating 
to part 760 of the EAR, the decision rendered shall be an initial 
decision. The decision will include findings of fact, conclusions of 
law, and findings as to whether there has been a violation of the EAA, 
the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. If 
the administrative law judge finds that the evidence of record is 
insufficient to sustain a finding that a violation has occurred with 
respect to one or more charges, the judge shall order dismissal of the 
charges in whole or in part, as appropriate. If the administrative law 
judge finds that one or more violations have been committed, the judge 
may issue an order imposing administrative sanctions, as provided in 
part 764 of the EAR. The decision and order shall be served on each 
party, and shall become effective as the final decision of the 
Department 30 days after service, unless an appeal is filed in 
accordance with Sec. 766.21 of this part.
    (2) Recommended decision. For proceedings not involving violations 
relating to part 760 of the EAR, the decision rendered shall be a 
recommended decision. The decision will include recommended findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and findings as to whether there has been a 
violation of the EAA, the EAR or any order, license or authorization 
issued thereunder. If the administrative law judge finds that the 
evidence of record is insufficient to sustain a recommended finding that 
a violation has occurred with respect to one or more charges, the judge 
shall recommend dismissal of any such charge. If the administrative law 
judge finds that one or more violations have been committed, the judge 
shall recommend an order imposing administrative sanctions, as provided 
in part 764 of the EAR, or such other action as the judge deems 
appropriate. The administrative law judge shall immediately certify the 
record, including the original copy of the recommended decision and 
order, to the Under Secretary for review in accordance with Sec. 766.22 
of this part. The administrative law judge shall also immediately serve 
the recommended decision on all parties. Because of the time limits 
established in the EAA for review by the Under Secretary, service upon 
parties shall be by personal delivery, express mail or other overnight 
carrier.
    (c) Suspension of sanctions. Any order imposing administrative 
sanctions may provide for the suspension of the sanction imposed, in 
whole or in part

[[Page 530]]

and on such terms of probation or other conditions as the administrative 
law judge or the Under Secretary may specify. Any suspension order may 
be modified or revoked by the signing official upon application of BXA 
showing a violation of the probationary terms or other conditions, after 
service on the respondent of notice of the application in accordance 
with the service provisions of Sec. 766.3 of this part, and with such 
opportunity for response as the responsible signing official in his/her 
discretion may allow. A copy of any order modifying or revoking the 
suspension shall also be served on the respondent in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 766.3 of this part.
    (d) Time for decision. Administrative enforcement proceedings not 
involving violations relating to part 760 of the EAR shall be concluded, 
including review by the Under Secretary under Sec. 766.22 of this part, 
within one year of the submission of a charging letter, unless the 
administrative law judge, for good cause shown, extends such period. The 
charging letter will be deemed to have been submitted to the 
administrative law judge on the date the respondent files an answer or 
on the date BXA files a motion for a default order pursuant to 
Sec. 766.7(a) of this part, whichever occurs first.


<R05>
Sec. 766.18  Settlement.

    (a) Cases may be settled before service of a charging letter. In 
cases in which settlement is reached before service of a charging 
letter, a proposed charging letter will be prepared, and a settlement 
proposal consisting of a settlement agreement and order will be 
submitted to the Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the 
Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify 
the parties and the case will proceed as though no settlement proposal 
had been made. If the Assistant Secretary approves the proposal, he/she 
will issue an appropriate order, and no action will be required by the 
administrative law judge.
    (b) Cases may also be settled after service of a charging letter. 
(1) If the case is pending before the administrative law judge, the 
judge shall stay the proceedings for a reasonable period of time, 
usually not to exceed 30 days, upon notification by the parties that 
they have entered into good faith settlement negotiations. The 
administrative law judge may, in his/her discretion, grant additional 
stays. If settlement is reached, a proposal will be submitted to the 
Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the Assistant 
Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order, 
and notify the administrative law judge that the case is withdrawn from 
adjudication. If the Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, 
he/she will notify the parties and the case will proceed to adjudication 
by the administrative law judge as though no settlement proposal had 
been made.
    (2) If the case is pending before the Under Secretary under 
Sec. 766.21 or Sec. 766.22 of this part, the parties may submit a 
settlement proposal to the Under Secretary for approval and signature. 
If the Under Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an 
appropriate order. If the Under Secretary does not approve the proposal, 
the case will proceed to final decision in accordance with Sec. 766.21 
or Sec. 766.22 of this part, as appropriate.
    (c) Any order disposing of a case by settlement may suspend the 
administrative sanction imposed, in whole or in part, on such terms of 
probation or other conditions as the signing official may specify. Any 
such suspension may be modified or revoked by the signing official, in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 766.17(c) of this part.
    (d) Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing any 
administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving the 
claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought under this 
part. This reflects the fact that BXA has neither the authority nor the 
responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or otherwise 
disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility are 
vested in the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.
    (e) Cases that are settled may not be reopened or appealed.


<R05>
Sec. 766.19  Reopening.

    The respondent may petition the administrative law judge within one 
year of the date of the final decision, except

[[Page 531]]

where the decision arises from a default judgment or from a settlement, 
to reopen an administrative enforcement proceeding to receive any 
relevant and material evidence which was unknown or unobtainable at the 
time the proceeding was held. The petition must include a summary of 
such evidence, the reasons why it is deemed relevant and material, and 
the reasons why it could not have been presented at the time the 
proceedings were held. The administrative law judge will grant or deny 
the petition after providing other parties reasonable opportunity to 
comment. If the proceeding is reopened, the administrative law judge may 
make such arrangements as the judge deems appropriate for receiving the 
new evidence and completing the record. The administrative law judge 
will then issue a new initial or recommended decision and order, and the 
case will proceed to final decision and order in accordance with 
Sec. 766.21 or Sec. 766.22 of this part, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 766.20  Record for decision and availability of documents.

    (a) General. The transcript of hearings, exhibits, rulings, orders, 
all papers and requests filed in the proceedings and, for purposes of 
any appeal under Sec. 766.21 of this part or review under Sec. 766.22 of 
this part, the decision of the administrative law judge and such 
submissions as are provided for by Secs. 766.21 and 766.22 of this part, 
will constitute the record and the exclusive basis for decision. When a 
case is settled after the service of a charging letter, the record will 
consist of any and all of the foregoing, as well as the settlement 
agreement and the order. When a case is settled before service of a 
charging letter, the record will consist of the proposed charging 
letter, the settlement agreement and the order.
    (b) Restricted access. On the judge's own motion, or on the motion 
of any party, the administrative law judge may direct that there be a 
restricted access portion of the record for any material in the record 
to which public access is restricted by law or by the terms of a 
protective order entered in the proceedings. A party seeking to restrict 
access to any portion of the record is responsible for submitting, at 
the time specified in Sec. 766.20(c)(2) of this part, a version of the 
document proposed for public availability that reflects the requested 
deletion. The restricted access portion of the record will be placed in 
a separate file and the file will be clearly marked to avoid improper 
disclosure and to identify it as a portion of the official record in the 
proceedings. The administrative law judge may act at any time to permit 
material that becomes declassified or unrestricted through passage of 
time to be transferred to the unrestricted access portion of the record.
    (c) Availability of documents--(1) Scope. (i) For proceedings 
started on or after October 12, 1979, all charging letters, answers, 
initial and recommended decisions, and orders disposing of a case will 
be made available for public inspection in the BXA Freedom of 
Information Records Inspection Facility, U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Room H-6624, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20230. The complete record for decision, as defined in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section will be made available on request. In addition, 
all decisions of the Under Secretary on appeal pursuant to Sec. 766.22 
of this part and those final orders providing for denial, suspension or 
revocation of export privileges shall be published in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) For proceedings started before October 12, 1979, the public 
availability of the record for decision will be governed by the 
applicable regulations in effect when the proceedings were begun.
    (2) Timing--(i) Antiboycott cases. For matters relating to part 760 
of the EAR, documents are available immediately upon filing, except for 
any portion of the record for which a request for segregation is made. 
Parties that seek to restrict access to any portion of the record under 
paragraph (b) of this section must make such a request, together with 
the reasons supporting the claim of confidentiality, simultaneously with 
the submission of material for the record.
    (ii) Other cases. In all other cases, documents will be available 
only after the final administrative disposition of the case. In these 
cases, parties desiring to restrict access to any portion of

[[Page 532]]

the record under paragraph (b) of this section must assert their claim 
of confidentiality, together with the reasons for supporting the claim, 
before the close of the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 766.21  Appeals.

    (a) Grounds. For proceedings charging violations relating to part 
760 of the EAR, a party may appeal to the Under Secretary from an order 
disposing of a proceeding or an order denying a petition to set aside a 
default or a petition for reopening, on the grounds:
    (1) That a necessary finding of fact is omitted, erroneous or 
unsupported by substantial evidence of record;
    (2) That a necessary legal conclusion or finding is contrary to law;
    (3) That prejudicial procedural error occurred, or
    (4) That the decision or the extent of sanctions is arbitrary, 
capricious or an abuse of discretion. The appeal must specify the 
grounds on which the appeal is based and the provisions of the order 
from which the appeal is taken.
    (b) Filing of appeal. An appeal from an order must be filed with the 
Office of the Under Secretary for Export Administration, Bureau of 
Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-3898, 14th 
Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, within 30 
days after service of the order appealed from. If the Under Secretary 
cannot act on an appeal for any reason, the Under Secretary will 
designate another Department of Commerce official to receive and act on 
the appeal.
    (c) Effect of appeal. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the 
operation of any order, unless the order by its express terms so 
provides or unless the Under Secretary, upon application by a party and 
with opportunity for response, grants a stay.
    (d) Appeal procedure. The Under Secretary normally will not hold 
hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals. A full written statement 
in support of the appeal must be filed with the appeal and be 
simultaneously served on all parties, who shall have 30 days from 
service to file a reply. At his/her discretion, the Under Secretary may 
accept new submissions, but will not ordinarily accept those submissions 
filed more than 30 days after the filing of the reply to the appellant's 
first submission.
    (e) Decisions. The decision will be in writing and will be 
accompanied by an order signed by the Under Secretary giving effect to 
the decision. The order may either dispose of the case by affirming, 
modifying or reversing the order of the administrative law judge or may 
refer the case back to the administrative law judge for further 
proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 766.22  Review by Under Secretary.

    (a) Recommended decision. For proceedings not involving violations 
relating to part 760 of the EAR, the administrative law judge shall 
immediately refer the recommended decision and order to the Under 
Secretary. Because of the time limits provided under the EAA for review 
by the Under Secretary, service of the recommended decision and order on 
the parties, all papers filed by the parties in response, and the final 
decision of the Under Secretary must be by personal delivery, facsimile, 
express mail or other overnight carrier. If the Under Secretary cannot 
act on a recommended decision and order for any reason, the Under 
Secretary will designate another Department of Commerce official to 
receive and act on the recommendation.
    (b) Submissions by parties. Parties shall have 12 days from the date 
of issuance of the recommended decision and order in which to submit 
simultaneous responses. Parties thereafter shall have eight days from 
receipt of any response(s) in which to submit replies. Any response or 
reply must be received within the time specified by the Under Secretary.
    (c) Final decision. Within 30 days after receipt of the recommended 
decision and order, the Under Secretary shall issue a written order 
affirming, modifying or vacating the recommended decision and order of 
the administrative law judge. If he/she vacates the recommended decision 
and order, the Under Secretary may refer the case back to the 
administrative law judge for further proceedings. Because of the time 
limits, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily be limited to the 
written record for decision, including

[[Page 533]]

the transcript of any hearing, and any submissions by the parties 
concerning the recommended decision.
    (d) Delivery. The final decision and implementing order shall be 
served on the parties and will be publicly available in accordance with 
Sec. 766.20 of this part.
    (e) Appeals. The charged party may appeal the Under Secretary's 
written order within 15 days to the United States Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. Sec. 2412(c)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 766.23  Related persons.

    (a) General. In order to prevent evasion, certain types of orders 
under this part may be made applicable not only to the respondent, but 
also to other persons then or thereafter related to the respondent by 
ownership, control, position of responsibility, affiliation, or other 
connection in the conduct of trade or business. Orders that may be made 
applicable to related persons include those that deny or affect export 
privileges, including temporary denial orders, and those that exclude a 
respondent from practice before BXA.
    (b) Procedures. If BXA has reason to believe that a person is 
related to the respondent and that an order that is being sought or that 
has been issued should be made applicable to that person in order to 
prevent evasion of the order, BXA shall, except in an ex parte 
proceeding under Sec. 766.24(a) of this part, give that person notice in 
accordance with Sec. 766.5(b) of this part and an opportunity to oppose 
such action. If the official authorized to issue the order against the 
respondent finds that the order should be made applicable to that person 
in order to prevent evasion of the order that official shall issue or 
amend the order accordingly.
    (c) Appeals. Any person named by BXA in an order as related to the 
respondent may file an appeal with the administrative law judge. The 
sole issues to be raised and ruled on in any such appeal are whether the 
person so named is related to the respondent and whether the order is 
justified in order to prevent evasion. The recommended decision and 
order of the administrative law judge shall be reviewed by the Under 
Secretary in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 766.22 of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 766.24  Temporary denials.

    (a) General. The procedures in this section apply to temporary 
denial orders issued on or after July 12, 1985. For temporary denial 
orders issued on or before July 11, 1985, the proceedings will be 
governed by the applicable regulations in effect at the time the 
temporary denial orders were issued. Without limiting any other action 
BXA may take under the EAR with respect to any application, order, 
license or authorization issued under the EAA, BXA may ask the Assistant 
Secretary to issue a temporary denial order on an ex parte basis to 
prevent an imminent violation, as defined in this section, of the EAA, 
the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. The 
temporary denial order will deny export privileges to any person named 
in the order as provided for in Sec. 764.3(a)(2) of the EAR.
    (b) Issuance. (1) The Assistant Secretary may issue an order 
temporarily denying to a person any or all of the export privileges 
described in part 764 of the EAR upon a showing by BXA that the order is 
necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of the 
EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder.
    (2) The temporary denial order shall define the imminent violation 
and state why it was issued without a hearing. Because all denial orders 
are public, the description of the imminent violation and the reasons 
for proceeding on an ex parte basis set forth therein shall be stated in 
a manner that is consistent with national security, foreign policy, 
business confidentiality, and investigative concerns.
    (3) A violation may be ``imminent'' either in time or in degree of 
likelihood. To establish grounds for the temporary denial order, BXA may 
show either that a violation is about to occur, or that the general 
circumstances of the matter under investigation or case under criminal 
or administrative charges demonstrate a likelihood of future violations. 
To indicate the likelihood of future violations, BXA may

[[Page 534]]

show that the violation under investigation or charges is significant, 
deliberate, covert and/or likely to occur again, rather than technical 
or negligent, and that it is appropriate to give notice to companies in 
the United States and abroad to cease dealing with the person in U.S.-
origin items in order to reduce the likelihood that a person under 
investigation or charges continues to export or acquire abroad such 
items, risking subsequent disposition contrary to export control 
requirements. Lack of information establishing the precise time a 
violation may occur does not preclude a finding that a violation is 
imminent, so long as there is sufficient reason to believe the 
likelihood of a violation.
    (4) The temporary denial order will be issued for a period not 
exceeding 180 days.
    (5) Notice of the issuance of a temporary denial order on an ex 
parte basis shall be given in accordance with Sec. 766.5(b) of this part 
upon issuance.
    (c) Related persons. A temporary denial order may be made applicable 
to related persons in accordance with Sec. 766.23 of this part.
    (d) Renewal. (1) If, no later than 20 days before the expiration 
date of a temporary denial order, BXA believes that renewal of the 
denial order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent 
violation, BXA may file a written request setting forth the basis for 
its belief, including any additional or changed circumstances, asking 
that the Assistant Secretary renew the temporary denial order, with 
modifications, if any are appropriate, for an additional period not 
exceeding 180 days. BXA's request shall be delivered to the respondent, 
or any agent designated for this purpose, in accordance with 
Sec. 766.5(b) of this part, which will constitute notice of the renewal 
application.
    (2) Non-resident respondents. To facilitate timely notice of renewal 
requests, a respondent not a resident of the United States may designate 
a local agent for this purpose and provide written notification of such 
designation to BXA in the manner set forth in Sec. 766.5(b) of this 
part.
    (3) Hearing. (i) A respondent may oppose renewal of a temporary 
denial order by filing with the Assistant Secretary a written 
submission, supported by appropriate evidence, to be received not later 
than seven days before the expiration date of such order. For good cause 
shown, the Assistant Secretary may consider submissions received not 
later than five days before the expiration date. The Assistant Secretary 
ordinarily will not allow discovery; however, for good cause shown in 
respondent's submission, he/she may allow the parties to take limited 
discovery, consisting of a request for production of documents. If 
requested by the respondent in the written submission, the Assistant 
Secretary shall hold a hearing on the renewal application. The hearing 
shall be on the record and ordinarily will consist only of oral 
argument. The only issue to be considered on BXA's request for renewal 
is whether the temporary denial order should be continued to prevent an 
imminent violation as defined herein.
    (ii) Any person designated as a related person may not oppose 
issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order, but may file an 
appeal in accordance with Sec. 766.2(3)(c) of this part.
    (iii) If no written opposition to BXA's renewal request is received 
within the specified time, the Assistant Secretary may issue the order 
renewing the temporary denial order without a hearing.
    (4) A temporary denial order may be renewed more than once.
    (e) Appeals--(1) Filing. (i) A respondent may, at any time, file an 
appeal of the initial or renewed temporary denial order with the 
administrative law judge.
    (ii) The filing of an appeal shall stay neither the effectiveness of 
the temporary denial order nor any application for renewal, nor will it 
operate to bar the Assistant Secretary's consideration of any renewal 
application.
    (2) Grounds. A respondent may appeal on the grounds that the finding 
that the order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an 
imminent violation is unsupported.
    (3) Appeal procedure. A full written statement in support of the 
appeal must be filed with the appeal together with appropriate evidence, 
and be simultaneously served on BXA, which shall have seven days from 
receipt to

[[Page 535]]

file a reply. Service on the administrative law judge shall be addressed 
to the Office of the Administrative Law Judge, U.S. Department of 
Commerce, Room H-6716, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20230. Service on BXA shall be as set forth in 
Sec. 766.5(b) of this part. The administrative law judge normally will 
not hold hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals.
    (4) Recommended Decision. Within 10 working days after an appeal is 
filed, the administrative law judge shall submit a recommended decision 
to the Under Secretary, and serve copies on the parties, recommending 
whether the issuance or the renewal of the temporary denial order should 
be affirmed, modified or vacated.
    (5) Final decision. Within five working days after receipt of the 
recommended decision, the Under Secretary shall issue a written order 
accepting, rejecting or modifying the recommended decision. Because of 
the time constraints, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily be 
limited to the written record for decision, including the transcript of 
any hearing. The issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order shall 
be affirmed only if there is reason to believe that the temporary denial 
order is required in the public interest to prevent an imminent 
violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or other 
authorization issued under the EAA. The Under Secretary's written order 
is final and is not subject to judicial review, except as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) Delivery. A copy of any temporary denial order issued or renewed 
and any final decision on appeal shall be published in the Federal 
Register and shall be delivered to BXA and to the respondent, or any 
agent designated for this purpose, and to any related person in the same 
manner as provided in Sec. 766.5 of this part for filing for papers 
other than a charging letter.
    (g) Judicial review. A respondent temporarily denied export 
privileges by order of the Under Secretary may appeal to the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia pursuant to 50 
U.S.C. app. Sec. 2412(d)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 766.25  Administrative action denying export privileges.

    (a) General. The Director of the Office of Exporter Services, in 
consultation with the Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, may 
deny the export privileges of any person who has been convicted of a 
violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license, or authorization 
issued thereunder; any regulation, license or order issued under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706); 18 
U.S.C. 793, 794 or 798; section 4(b) of the Internal Security Act of 
1950 (50 U.S.C. 783(b)), or section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act 
(22 U.S.C. 2778).
    (b) Procedure. Upon notification that a person has been convicted of 
a violation of one or more of the provisions specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Director of the Office of Exporter Services, in 
consultation with the Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, will 
determine whether to deny such person export privileges, including but 
not limited to applying for, obtaining, or using any license, License 
Exception, or export control document; or participating in or benefiting 
in any way from any export or export-related transaction subject to the 
EAR. Before taking action to deny a person export privileges under this 
section, the Director of the Office of Exporter Services will provide 
the person written notice of the proposed action and an opportunity to 
comment through a written submission, unless exceptional circumstances 
exist. In reviewing the response, the Director of the Office of Exporter 
Services will consider any relevant or mitigating evidence why these 
privileges should not be denied. Upon final determination, the Director 
of the Office of Exporter Services will notify by letter each person 
denied export privileges under this section.
    (c) Criteria. In determining whether and for how long to deny U.S. 
export privileges to a person previously convicted of one or more of the 
statutes set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Director of the 
Office of Exporter Services may take into consideration any relevant 
information, including, but not limited to, the seriousness of the 
offense involved in the criminal prosecution, the nature and

[[Page 536]]

duration of the criminal sanctions imposed, and whether the person has 
undertaken any corrective measures.
    (d) Duration. Any denial of export privileges under this section 
shall not exceed 10 years from the date of the conviction of the person 
who is subject to the denial.
    (e) Effect. Any person denied export privileges under this section 
will be considered a ``person denied export privileges'' for purposes of 
Sec. 736.2(b)(4) (General Prohibition 4--Engage in actions prohibited by 
a denial order) and Sec. 764.2(k) of the EAR.
    (f) Publication. The name and address(es) of any person denied 
export privileges under this section will be published as described in 
Supplement No. 2 to part 764 of the EAR, noting that such action was 
taken pursuant to this section and section 11(h) of the EAA.
    (g) Appeal. An appeal of an action under this section will be 
pursuant to part 756 of the EAR.
    (h) Applicability to related person. The Director of the Office of 
Exporter Services, in consultation with the Director of the Office of 
Export Enforcement, may take action in accordance with Sec. 766.23 of 
this part to make applicable to related persons an order that is being 
sought or that has been issued under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 768.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Authority. Pursuant to sections 5(f) and 5(h) of the Export 
Administration Act (EAA), the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export 
Administration directs the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) in 
gathering and analyzing all the evidence necessary for the Secretary to 
determine foreign availability.
    (b) Scope. This part applies only to the extent that items are 
controlled for national security purposes. This part does not apply to 
encryption items that were formerly controlled on the U.S. Munitions 
List and that were transferred to the Commerce Control List consistent 
with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the 
Presidential Memorandum of that date, which shall not be subject to any 
mandatory foreign availability review procedures.
    (c) Types of programs. There are two general programs of foreign 
availability:
    (1) Foreign availability to controlled countries. In this category 
are denied license assessments (see Secs. 768.4(b) and 768.7 of this 
part) and decontrol assessments (see Secs. 768.4(c) and 768.7 of this 
part).
    (2) Foreign availability to non-controlled countries. In this 
category are denied license assessments, decontrol assessments, and 
evaluations of eligibility for expedited licensing (see Sec. 768.8 of 
this part).
    (d) Definitions. The following are definitions of terms used in this 
part 768:
    Allegation. See foreign availability submission.

[[Page 537]]

    Assessment. An evidentiary analysis that BXA conducts concerning the 
foreign availability of a given item based on the assessment criteria, 
data gathered by BXA, and the data and recommendations submitted by the 
Departments of Defense and State and other relevant departments and 
agencies, TAC committees, and industry.
    Assessment criteria. Statutorily established criteria that must be 
assessed for the Secretary to make a determination with respect to 
foreign availability. They are, available-in-fact, from a non-U.S. 
source, in sufficient quantity so as to render the control ineffective, 
and of comparable quality. (See Sec. 768.6 of this part).
    Available-in-fact. An item is available-in-fact to a country if it 
is produced within the country or if it may be obtained by that country 
from a third country. Ordinarily, items will not be considered 
available-in-fact to non-controlled countries if the items are available 
only under a validated national security license or a comparable 
authorization from a country that maintains export controls on such 
items cooperatively with the United States.
    Claimant. Any party who makes a foreign availability submission, 
excluding TACs.
    Comparable quality. An item is of comparable quality to an item 
controlled under the EAR if it possesses the characteristics specified 
in the Commerce Control List (CCL) for that item and is alike in key 
characteristics that include, but are not limited to: (1) Function; (2) 
technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4) maintainability 
and service life; and (5) any other attribute relevant to the purpose 
for which the control was placed on the item.
    Controlled countries. Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, 
Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cuba, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Laos, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, North Korea, Romania, 
Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and the 
People's Republic of China.
    Decontrol. Removal of license requirements under the EAR.
    Decontrol assessment. An assessment of the foreign availability of 
an item to a country or countries for purposes of determining whether 
decontrol is warranted. Such assessments may be conducted after BXA 
receives a foreign availability submission or a TAC certification, or by 
the Secretary's own initiative.
    Denied license assessment. A foreign availability assessment 
conducted as a result of a claimant's allegation of foreign availability 
for an item (or items) that BXA has denied or has issued a letter of 
intent to deny a license. If the Secretary determines that foreign 
availability exists, BXA's approval of a license will be limited to the 
items, countries, and quantities in the allegation.
    Determination. The Secretary's decision that foreign availability 
within the meaning of the EAA does or does not exist. (See Sec. 768.7 of 
this part).
    Expedited licensing procedure eligibility evaluation. An evaluation 
that BXA initiates for the purpose of determining whether an item is 
eligible for the expedited licensing procedure. (See Sec. 768.8 of this 
part).
    Expedited licensing procedures. Under expedited licensing 
procedures, BXA reviews and processes a license application for the 
export of an eligible item to a non-controlled country within statutory 
time limits. Licenses are deemed approved unless BXA denies within the 
statutory time limits (See Sec. 768.8 of this part).
    Foreign availability submission (FAS). An allegation of foreign 
availability a claimant makes, supported by reasonable evidence, and 
submits to BXA. (See Sec. 768.5 of this part).
    Item. Any commodity, software, or technology.
    Items eligible for non-controlled country expedited licensing 
procedures. The items described in Supplement No. 2 to this part 768 are 
eligible for the expedited license procedures (See Sec. 768.8 of this 
part).
    National Security Override (NSO). A Presidential decision to 
maintain export controls on an item notwithstanding its foreign 
availability as determined under the EAA. The President's decision is 
based on his/her determination that the absence of the

[[Page 538]]

controls would prove detrimental to the national security of the United 
States. Once the President makes such a decision, the President must 
actively pursue negotiations to eliminate foreign availability with the 
governments of the sources of foreign availability. (See Sec. 768.7 of 
this part).
    Non-controlled countries. Any country not defined as a controlled 
country by this section.
    Non-U.S. source/foreign source. A person located outside the 
jurisdiction of the United States (as defined in part 772 of the EAR).
    Reasonable evidence. Relevant information that is credible.
    Reliable evidence. Relevant information that is credible and 
dependable.
    Secretary. As used in this part, the Secretary refers to the 
Secretary of Commerce or his/her designee.
    Similar quality. An item is of similar quality to an item that is 
controlled under the EAR if it is substantially alike in key 
characteristics that may include, but are not limited to: (1) Function; 
(2) technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4) 
maintainability and service life; and (5) any other attribute relevant 
to the purpose for which the control was placed on the item.
    Sufficient quantity. The amount of an item that would render the 
U.S. export control, or the denial of the license in question, 
ineffective in achieving its purpose. For a controlled country, it is 
the quantity that meets the military needs of that country so that U.S. 
exports of the item to that country would not make a significant 
contribution to its military potential.
    Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). A Committee created under 
section 5(h) of the EAA that advises and assists the Secretary of 
Commerce, the Secretary of Defense, and any other department, agency, or 
official of the Government of the United States to which the President 
delegates authority under the EAA on export control matters related to 
specific areas of controlled items.
    TAC certification. A statement that a TAC submits to BXA, supported 
by reasonable evidence, documented as in a FAS, that foreign 
availability to a controlled country exists for an item that falls 
within the TAC's area of technical expertise.

[61 FR 12915, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68585, Dec. 30, 1996; 
62 FR 25469, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 768.2  Foreign availability described.

    (a) Foreign availability. Foreign availability exists when the 
Secretary determines that an item is comparable in quality to an item 
subject to U.S. national security export controls, and is available-in-
fact to a country, from a non-U.S. source, in sufficient quantities to 
render the U.S. export control of that item or the denial of a license 
ineffective. For a controlled country, such control or denial is 
``ineffective'' when maintaining such control or denying a specific 
license would not restrict the availability of items that would make a 
significant contribution to the military potential of the controlled 
country or combination of countries detrimental to the national security 
of the United States (see sections 5(a) and 3(2)(A) of the EAA.)
    (b) Types of foreign availability. There are two types of foreign 
availability:
    (1) Foreign availability to a controlled country; and
    (2) Foreign availability to a non-controlled country.
    (Note to paragraph (b) of this section:
    See Sec. 768.7 of this part for delineation of the foreign 
availability assessment procedures, and Sec. 768.6 of this part for the 
criteria used in determining foreign availability)


<R05>
Sec. 768.3  Foreign availability assessment.

    (a) Foreign availability assessment. A foreign availability 
assessment is an evidentiary analysis that BXA conducts to assess the 
foreign availability of a given item according to the assessment 
criteria, based on data submitted by a claimant, the data gathered by 
BXA, and the data and recommendations submitted by the Departments of 
Defense and State and other relevant departments and agencies, TAC 
committees, and industry. BXA uses the results of the analysis in 
formulating its recommendation to the Secretary on whether foreign 
availability exists for a given item. If the Secretary determines that 
foreign availability exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item

[[Page 539]]

for national security reasons or approve the license in question if 
there is no foreign policy reason to deny the license, unless the 
President exercises a National Security Override (see Sec. 768.7 of this 
part). The effect of any such determination on the effectiveness of 
foreign policy controls may be considered independent of this part.
    (b) Types of assessments. There are two types of foreign 
availability assessments:
    (1) Denied license assessment; and
    (2) Decontrol assessment.
    (c) Expedited licensing procedures. See Sec. 768.8 of this part for 
the evaluation of eligibility of an item for the expedited licensing 
procedures.

[61 FR 12915, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68585, Dec. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 768.4  Initiation of an assessment.

    (a) Assessment request. To initiate an assessment, each claimant or 
TAC must submit a FAS or a TAC Certification to BXA. TACs are authorized 
to certify foreign availability only to controlled countries. Claimants 
can allege foreign availability for either controlled or non-controlled 
countries.
    (b) Denied license assessment. A claimant whose license application 
BXA has denied, or for which it has issued a letter of intent to deny on 
national security grounds, may request that BXA initiate a denied 
license assessment by submitting a Foreign Availability Submission (FAS) 
within 90 days after denial of the license. As part of its submission, 
the claimant must request that the specified license application be 
approved on the grounds of foreign availability. The evidence must 
relate to the particular export as described on the license application 
and to the alleged comparable item. If foreign availability is found, 
the Secretary will approve the license for the specific items, 
countries, and quantities listed on the application. The denied license 
assessment procedure, however, is not intended to result in the removal 
of the U.S. export control on an item by incrementally providing a 
country with amounts that, taken together, would constitute a sufficient 
quantity of an item. The Secretary will not approve on foreign 
availability grounds a denied license if the approval of such license 
would itself render the U.S. export control ineffective in achieving its 
purpose. In the case of a positive determination, the Secretary will 
determine whether a decontrol assessment is warranted. If so, then BXA 
will initiate a decontrol assessment.
    (c) Decontrol assessment. (1) Any claimant may at any time request 
that BXA initiate a decontrol assessment by a FAS to BXA alleging 
foreign availability to any country or countries.
    (2) A TAC may request that BXA initiate a decontrol assessment at 
any time by submitting a TAC Certification to BXA that there is foreign 
availability to a controlled country for items that fall within the area 
of the TAC's technical expertise.
    (3) The Secretary, on his/her own initiative, may initiate a 
decontrol assessment.
    (d) BXA mailing address. All foreign availability submissions and 
TAC certifications should be submitted to: Department of Commerce, 
Bureau of Export Administration, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, 
NW, Room 3877, Washington, DC 20230.


<R05>
Sec. 768.5  Contents of foreign availability submissions and Technical Advisory Committee certifications.

    (a) All foreign availability submissions must contain, in addition 
to information on product or technology alleged to be available from 
foreign sources, at least:
    (1) The name of the claimant;
    (2) The claimant's mailing and business address;
    (3) The claimant's telephone number; and
    (4) A contact point and telephone number.
    (b) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications should 
contain as much evidence as is available to support the claim, 
including, but not limited to:
    (1) Product names and model designations of the items alleged to be 
comparable;
    (2) Extent to which the alleged comparable item is based on U.S. 
technology;
    (3) Names and locations of the non-U.S. sources and the basis for 
claiming

[[Page 540]]

that the item is a non-U.S. source item;
    (4) Key performance elements, attributes, and characteristics of the 
items on which a qualitative comparison may be made;
    (5) Non-U.S. source's production quantities and/or sales of the 
alleged comparable items and marketing efforts;
    (6) Estimated market demand and the economic impact of the control;
    (7) Product names, model designations, and value of U.S. controlled 
parts and components incorporated in the items alleged to be comparable; 
and
    (8) The basis for the claim that the item is available-in-fact to 
the country or countries for which foreign availability is alleged.
    (c) Supporting evidence of foreign availability may include, but is 
not limited to, the following:
    (1) Foreign manufacturers' catalogs, brochures, operation or 
maintenance manuals;
    (2) Articles from reputable trade and technical publications;
    (3) Photographs;
    (4) Depositions based on eyewitness accounts; and
    (5) Other credible evidence.

    Note to paragraph (c) of this section:
    See Supplement No. 1 to part 768 for additional examples of 
supporting evidence.

    (d) Upon receipt of a FAS or TAC certification, BXA will review it 
to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the belief 
that foreign availability may exist. If BXA determines the FAS or TAC 
certification is lacking in supporting evidence, BXA will seek 
additional evidence from appropriate sources, including the claimant or 
TAC. BXA will initiate the assessment when it determines that it has 
sufficient evidence that foreign availability may exist. Claimant and 
TAC certified assessments will be deemed to be initiated as of the date 
of such determination.
    (e) Claimants and TACs are advised to review the foreign 
availability assessment criteria described in Sec. 768.6 of this part 
and the examples of evidence described in Supplement No. 1 to part 768 
when assembling supporting evidence for inclusion in the FAS or TAC 
certification.


<R05>
Sec. 768.6  Criteria.

    BXA will evaluate the evidence contained in a FAS or TAC 
certification and all other evidence gathered in the assessment process 
in accordance with certain criteria that must be met before BXA can 
recommend a positive determination to the Secretary. The criteria are 
defined in Sec. 768.1(d) of this part. In order to initiate an 
assessment, each FAS and TAC certification should address each of these 
criteria. The criteria are statutorily prescribed and are:
    (a) Available-in-fact;
    (b) Non-U.S. source;
    (c) Sufficient quantity; and
    (d) Comparable quality.


<R05>
Sec. 768.7  Procedures.

    (a) Initiation of an assessment. (1) Once BXA accepts a FAS or TAC 
certification of foreign availability, BXA will notify the claimant or 
TAC that it is initiating the assessment.
    (2) BXA will publish a Federal Register notice of the initiation of 
any assessment.
    (3) BXA will notify the Departments of Defense and State, the 
intelligence community, and any other departments, agencies and their 
contractors that may have information concerning the item on which BXA 
has initiated an assessment. Each such department, agency, and 
contractor shall provide BXA all relevant information concerning the 
item. BXA will invite interested departments and agencies to participate 
in the assessment process (See paragraph (e) of this section).
    (b) Data gathering. BXA will seek and consider all available 
information that bears upon the presence or absence of foreign 
availability, including but not limited to that evidence described in 
Sec. 768.5 (b) and (c) of this part. As soon as BXA initiates the 
assessment, it will seek evidence relevant to the assessment, including 
an analysis of the military needs of a selected country or countries, 
technical analysis, and intelligence information from the Departments of 
Defense and State, and other U.S. agencies. Evidence is particularly 
sought from: industry sources

[[Page 541]]

worldwide; other U.S. organizations; foreign governments; commercial, 
academic and classified data bases; scientific and engineering research 
and development organizations; and international trade fairs.
    (c) Analysis. BXA will conduct its analysis by evaluating whether 
the reasonable and reliable evidence that is relevant to each of the 
foreign availability criteria provides a sufficient basis to recommend a 
determination that foreign availability does or does not exist.
    (d) Recommendation and determination. (1) Upon completion of each 
assessment, BXA, on the basis of its analysis, will recommend that the 
Secretary make a determination either that there is or that there is not 
foreign availability, whichever the evidence supports. The assessment 
upon which BXA bases its recommendation will accompany the 
recommendation to the Secretary.
    (2) BXA will recommend on the basis of its analysis that the 
Secretary determine that foreign availability exists to a country when 
the available evidence demonstrates that an item of comparable quality 
is available-in-fact to the country, from non-U.S. sources, in 
sufficient quantity so that continuation of the existing national 
security export control, or denial of the license application in 
question on national security grounds, would be ineffective in achieving 
its purpose. For a controlled country, such control or denial is 
``ineffective'' when comparable items are available-in-fact from foreign 
sources in sufficient quantities so that maintaining such control or 
denying a license would not be effective in restricting the availability 
of items that would make a significant contribution to the military 
potential of any country or combination of countries detrimental to the 
national security of the United States.
    (3) The Secretary will make the determination of foreign 
availability on the basis of the BXA assessment and recommendation; the 
Secretary's determination will take into account the evidence provided 
to BXA, the recommendations of the Secretaries of Defense and State and 
any other interested agencies, and any other information that the 
Secretary considers relevant.
    (4) For all decontrol and denied license assessments (under section 
5(f)(3) of the EAA) initiated by a FAS, the Secretary will make a 
determination within 4 months of the initiation of the assessment and 
will notify the claimant. The Secretary will submit positive 
determinations for review to the appropriate departments and agencies.
    (5) The deadlines for determinations based on self-initiated and 
TAC-initiated assessments are different from the deadlines for claimant-
initiated assessments (see paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this 
section).
    (e) Interagency review. BXA will notify all appropriate U.S. 
agencies and Departments upon the initiation of an assessment and will 
invite their participation in the assessment process. BXA will provide 
all interested agencies and departments an opportunity to review source 
material, draft analyses and draft assessments immediately upon their 
receipt or production. For claimant-initiated assessments, BXA will 
provide a copy of all positive recommendations and assessments to 
interested agencies and departments for their review following the 
Secretary's determination of foreign availability. For self-initiated 
and TAC-initiated assessments, BXA will provide all interested agencies 
an opportunity to review and comment on the assessment.
    (f) Notification. (1) No later than 5 months after the initiation of 
an assessment based on a FAS (claimant assessments), the Secretary will 
inform the claimant in writing and will submit for publication in the 
Federal Register a notice that:
    (i) Foreign availability exists, and
    (A) The requirement of a license has been removed or the license 
application in question has been approved; or
    (B) The President has determined that for national security purposes 
the export controls must be maintained or the license application must 
be denied, notwithstanding foreign availability, and that appropriate 
steps to eliminate the foreign availability are being initiated; or
    (C) In the case of an item controlled multilaterally under the 
former COCOM regime, the U.S. Government

[[Page 542]]

will conduct any necessary consultations concerning the proposed 
decontrol or approval of the license with the former COCOM regime for a 
period of up to 4 months from the date of the publication of the 
determination in the Federal Register (the U.S. Government may remove 
the license requirement for exports to non-controlled countries pending 
completion of the former COCOM regime review process); or
    (ii) Foreign availability does not exist.
    (2) For all TAC certification assessments, the Secretary will make a 
foreign availability determination within 90 days following initiation 
of the assessment. BXA will prepare and submit a report to the TAC and 
to the Congress stating that:
    (i) The Secretary has found foreign availability and has removed the 
license requirement; or
    (ii) The Secretary has found foreign availability, but has 
recommended to the President that negotiations be undertaken to 
eliminate the foreign availability; or
    (iii) The Secretary has not found foreign availability.
    (3) There is no statutory deadline for assessments self-initiated by 
the Secretary or for the resulting determination. However, BXA will make 
every effort to complete such assessments and determinations promptly.
    (g) Foreign availability to controlled countries. When the Secretary 
determines that an item controlled for national security reasons is 
available to a controlled country and the President does not issue a 
National Security Override (NSO), BXA will submit the determination to 
the Department of State, along with a draft proposal for the 
multilateral decontrol of the item or for the former COCOM regime 
approval of the license. The Department of State will submit the 
proposal or the license for former COCOM regime review. The former COCOM 
regime will have up to 4 months for review of the proposal.
    (h) Foreign availability to non-controlled countries. If the 
Secretary determines that foreign availability to non-controlled 
countries exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for export to 
all non-controlled countries where it is found to be available, or 
approve the license in question, unless the President exercises a 
National Security Override.
    (i) Negotiations to eliminate foreign availability. (1) The 
President may determine that an export control must be maintained 
notwithstanding the existence of foreign availability. Such a 
determination is called a National Security Override (NSO) and is based 
on the President's decision that the absence of the control would prove 
detrimental to the United States national security. Unless extended (as 
described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section), an NSO is effective for 
6 months. Where the President invokes an NSO, the U.S. Government will 
actively pursue negotiations with the government of any source country 
during the 6 month period to eliminate the availability.
    (2) There are two types of National Security Overrides:
    (i) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting from 
an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(f) of the EAA (claimant 
and self-initiated assessments); and
    (ii) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting 
from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(h) of the EAA (TAC-
certification assessments).
    (3) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 
5(f) of the EAA, the Secretary of any agency may recommend that the 
President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls or 
deny the license notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.
    (4) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 
5(h) of the EAA, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend that the 
President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls 
notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.
    (5) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under 
section 5(f) of the EAA, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of 
the House of Representatives will be notified of the initiation of the 
required negotiations. The notice will include an explanation

[[Page 543]]

of the national security interest that necessitates the retention of 
controls.
    (6) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under 
section 5(f) of the EAA, BXA will publish notices in the Federal 
Register consisting of:
    (i) The Secretary's determination of foreign availability;
    (ii) The President's decision to exercise the NSO;
    (iii) A concise statement of the basis for the President's decision; 
and
    (iv) An estimate of the economic impact of the decision.
    (7) The 6 month effective period for an NSO may be extended up to an 
additional 12 months if, prior to the end of the 6 months, the President 
certifies to Congress that the negotiations are progressing, and 
determines that the absence of the controls would continue to be 
detrimental to the United States national security.
    (8) After the conclusion of negotiations, BXA will retain the 
control only to the extent that foreign availability is eliminated. If 
foreign availability is not eliminated, BXA will decontrol the item by 
removing the requirement for a license for the export of the item to the 
destinations covered by the assessment. To the extent that the 
negotiations are successful and the foreign availability is eliminated, 
BXA will remove the license requirement for the export of the item to 
any country that has agreed to eliminate foreign availability.
    (j) Changes in foreign availability. If BXA becomes aware of 
conditions, including new evidence, that affect a previous determination 
that foreign availability exists or does not exist, BXA may review the 
conditions. If BXA finds that the foreign availability previously 
determined no longer exists, or that foreign availability not earlier 
found now does exist, BXA will make a recommendation to the Secretary of 
Commerce for the appropriate changes in the control. The Secretary of 
Commerce will make a determination, and BXA will publish a Federal 
Register notice of the determination.


<R05>
Sec. 768.8  Eligibility of expedited licensing procedures for non-controlled countries.

    (a) BXA determines the eligibility of an item for expedited 
licensing procedures on the basis of an evaluation of the foreign 
availability of the item. Eligibility is specific to the items and the 
countries to which they are found to be available.
    (b) BXA will initiate an eligibility evaluation:
    (1) On its own initiative;
    (2) On receipt of a FAS; or
    (3) On receipt of a TAC certification.
    (c) Upon initiation of an eligibility evaluation following receipt 
of either a FAS or TAC certification, BXA will notify the claimant or 
TAC of the receipt and initiation of an evaluation and publish a Federal 
Register notice of the initiation of the evaluation.
    (d) The criteria for determining eligibility for expedited licensing 
procedures are:
    (1) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified
    non-controlled country from a foreign source;
    (2) The item must be of a quality similar to that of the U.S.-
controlled item; and
    (3) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified non-
controlled country without effective restrictions.
    (e) Within 30 days of initiation of the evaluation, the Secretary of 
Commerce will make a determination of foreign availability on the basis 
of the BXA evaluation and recommendation, taking into consideration the 
evidence the Secretaries of Defense, State, and other interested 
agencies provide to BXA and any other information that the Secretary 
considers relevant.
    (f) Within 30 days of the receipt of the FAS or TAC certification, 
BXA will publish the Secretary's determination in the Federal Register, 
that the item will or will not be eligible for expedited licensing 
procedures to the stated countries and, where appropriate, amend 
Supplement No. 2 to part 768.
    (g) Following completion of a self-initiated evaluation, BXA will be 
notified of the Secretary's determination

[[Page 544]]

and, where appropriate, Supplement No. 2 to part 768 will be amended.
    (h) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications to 
initiate an expedited licensing procedure evaluation must be clearly 
designated on their face as a request for expedited licensing procedure 
and must specify the items, quantities and countries alleged eligible. 
Submissions and certifications should be sent to: Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, 14th Street and Pennsylvania 
Avenue, NW., Room 3877, Washington, DC 20230.


<R05>
Sec. 768.9  Appeals of negative foreign availability determinations.

    Appeals of negative determinations will be conducted according to 
the standards and procedures described in part 756 of the EAR. A 
Presidential decision (NSO) to deny a license or continue controls 
notwithstanding a determination of foreign availability is not subject 
to appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 768.10  Removal of controls on less sophisticated items.

    Where the Secretary has removed national security controls on an 
item for foreign availability reasons, the Secretary will also remove 
controls on similar items that are controlled for national security 
reasons and whose functions, technological approach, performance 
thresholds, and other attributes that form the basis for national 
security export controls do not exceed the technical parameters of the 
item that BXA has decontrolled for foreign availability reasons.

     Supplement No. 1 to Part 768--Evidence of Foreign Availability

    This supplement provides a list of examples of evidence that the 
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) has found to be useful in 
conducting assessments of foreign availability. A claimant submitting 
evidence supporting a claim of foreign availability should review this 
list for suggestions as evidence is collected. Acceptable evidence 
indicating possible foreign availability is not limited to these 
examples, nor is any one of these examples, usually, in and of itself, 
necessarily sufficient to meet a foreign availability criterion. A 
combination of several types of evidence for each criterion usually is 
required. A Foreign Availability Submission (FAS) should include as much 
evidence as possible on all four of the criteria listed below. BXA 
combines the submitted evidence with the evidence that it collects from 
other sources. BXA evaluates all evidence, taking into account factors 
that may include, but are not limited to: Information concerning the 
source of the evidence, corroborative or contradictory indications, and 
experience concerning the reliability or reasonableness of such 
evidence. BXA will assess all relevant evidence to determine whether 
each of the four criteria has been met. Where possible, all information 
should be in writing. If information is based on third party 
documentation, the submitter should provide such documentation to BXA. 
If information is based on oral statements a third party made, the 
submitter should provide a memorandum of the conversation to BXA if the 
submitter cannot obtain a written memorandum from the source. BXA will 
amend this informational list as it identifies new examples of evidence.
    (a) Examples of evidence of foreign availability:
    The following are intended as examples of evidence that BXA will 
consider in evaluating foreign availability. BXA will evaluate all 
evidence according to the provisions in Sec. 768.7(c) of this part in 
order for it to be used in support of a foreign availability 
determination. This list is illustrative only.
    (1) Available-in-fact:
    (i) Evidence of marketing of an item in a foreign country (e.g., an 
advertisement in the media of the foreign country that the item is for

<R05>


Sec.
770.1  Introduction.
770.2  Item interpretations.
770.3  Interpretations related to exports of technology and software to 
          destinations in Country Group D:1.

    Authority: 50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; E.O. 
13222, 66 FR 44025, August 22, 2001.


<R05>
Sec. 770.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. This part provides commodity, technology, and 
software interpretations. These interpretations clarify the scope of 
controls where such scope is not readily apparent from the Commerce 
Control List (CCL) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) and 
other provisions of the Export Administration Regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 770.2  Item interpretations.

    (a) Interpretation 1: Anti-friction bearing or bearing systems and 
specially designed parts. (1) Anti-friction bearings or bearing systems 
shipped as spares or

[[Page 546]]

replacements are classified under Export Control Classification Numbers 
(ECCNs) 2A001, 2A002, 2A003, 2A004, 2A005, and 2A006 (ball, roller, or 
needle-roller bearings and parts). This applies to separate shipments of 
anti-friction bearings or bearing systems and anti-friction bearings or 
bearing systems shipped with machinery or equipment for which they are 
intended to be used as spares or replacement parts.
    (2) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system physically 
incorporated in a segment of a machine or in a complete machine prior to 
shipment loses its identity as a bearing. In this scenario, the machine 
or segment of machinery containing the bearing is the item subject to 
export control requirements.
    (3) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system not incorporated in a 
segment of a machine prior to shipment, but shipped as a component of a 
complete unassembled (knocked-down) machine, is considered a component 
of a machine. In this scenario, the complete machine is the item subject 
to export license requirements.
    (b) Interpretation 2: Classification of ``parts'' of machinery, 
equipment, or other items--(1) An assembled machine or unit of equipment 
is being exported. In instances where one or more assembled machines or 
units of equipment are being exported, the individual component parts 
that are physically incorporated into the machine or equipment do not 
require a license. The license or general exception under which the 
complete machine or unit of equipment is exported will also cover its 
component parts, provided that the parts are normal and usual components 
of the machine or equipment being exported, or that the physical 
incorporation is not used as a device to evade the requirement for a 
license.
    (2) Parts are exported as spares, replacements, for resale, or for 
stock. In instances where parts are exported as spares, replacements, 
for resale, or for stock, a license is required only if the appropriate 
entry for the part specifies that a license is required for the intended 
destination.
    (c) Interpretation 3: Wire or cable cut to length. (1) Wire or cable 
may be included as a component of a system or piece of equipment, 
whether or not the wire or cable is cut to length and whether or not it 
is fitted with connectors at one or both ends, so long as it is in 
normal quantity necessary to make the original installation of the 
equipment and is necessary to its operation.
    (2) Wire or cable exported as replacement or spares, or for further 
manufacture is controlled under the applicable wire or cable ECCN only. 
This includes wire or cable, whether or not cut to length or fitted with 
connectors at one or both ends.
    (d) Interpretation 4: Telecommunications equipment and systems. 
Control equipment for paging systems (broadcast radio or selectively 
signalled receiving systems) is defined as circuit switching equipment 
in Category 5 of the CCL.
    (e) Interpretation 5: Numerical control systems--(1) Classification 
of ``Numerical Control'' Units. ``Numerical control'' units for machine 
tools, regardless of their configurations or architectures, are 
controlled by their functional characteristics as described in ECCN 
2B001.a. ``Numerical control'' units include computers with add-on 
``motion control boards''. A computer with add-on ``motion control 
boards'' for machine tools may be controlled under ECCN 2B001.a even 
when the computer alone without ``motion control boards'' is not subject 
to licensing requirements under Category 4 and the ``motion control 
boards'' are not controlled under ECCN 2B001.b.
    (2) Export documentation requirement. (i) When preparing a license 
application for a numerical control system, the machine tool and the 
control unit are classified separately. If either the machine tool or 
the control unit requires a license, then the entire unit requires a 
license. If either a machine tool or a control unit is exported 
separately from the system, the exported component is classified on the 
license application without regard to the other parts of a possible 
system.
    (ii) When preparing the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), a system 
being shipped complete (i.e., machine and control unit), should be 
reported under the Schedule B number for each machine. When either a 
control unit or a machine is shipped separately, it

[[Page 547]]

should be reported under the Schedule B number appropriate for the 
individual item being exported.
    (f) Interpretation 6: Parts, accessories, and equipment exported as 
scrap. Parts, accessories, or equipment that are being shipped as scrap 
should be described on the SED in sufficient detail to be identified 
under the proper ECCN. When commodities declared as parts, accessories, 
or equipment are shipped in bulk, or are otherwise not packaged, packed, 
or sorted in accordance with normal trade practices, the Customs Officer 
may require evidence that the shipment is not scrap. Such evidence may 
include, but is not limited to, bills of sale, orders and correspondence 
indicating whether the commodities are scrap or are being exported for 
use as parts, accessories, or equipment.
    (g) Interpretation 7: Scrap arms, ammunition, and implements of war. 
Arms, ammunition, and implements of war, as defined in the U.S. 
Munitions List, and are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of 
State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), except for the following, which 
are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce:
    (1) Cartridge and shell cases that have been rendered useless beyond 
the possibility of restoration to their original identity by means of 
excessive heating, flame treatment, mangling, crushing, cutting, or by 
any other method are ``scrap''.
    (2) Cartridge and shell cases that have been sold by the armed 
services as ``scrap'', whether or not they have been heated, flame-
treated, mangled, crushed, cut, or reduced to scrap by any other method.
    (3) Other commodities that may have been on the U.S. Munitions List 
are ``scrap'', and therefore under the jurisdiction of the Department of 
Commerce, if they have been rendered useless beyond the possibility of 
restoration to their original identity only by means of mangling, 
crushing, or cutting. When in doubt as to whether a commodity covered by 
the Munitions List has been rendered useless, exporters should consult 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State, 
Washington, DC 20520, or the Exporter Counseling Division, Office of 
Exporter Services, Room 1099A, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, 
DC 20230, before reporting a shipment as metal scrap.
    (h) Interpretation 8: Military automotive vehicles and parts for 
such vehicles--(1) Military automotive vehicles. (i) For purposes of 
U.S. export controls, military automotive vehicles ``possessing or built 
to current military specifications differing materially from normal 
commercial specifications'' may include, but are not limited to, the 
following characteristics:
    (A) Special fittings for mounting ordnance or military equipment;
    (B) Bullet-proof glass;
    (C) Armor plate;
    (D) Fungus preventive treatment;
    (E) Twenty-four volt electrical systems;
    (F) Shielded electrical system (electronic emission suppression); or
    (G) Puncture-proof or run-flat tires.
    (ii) Automotive vehicles fall into two categories.
    (A) Military automotive vehicles on the Munitions List, new and 
used. Automotive vehicles in this category are primarily combat 
(fighting) vehicles, with or without armor and/or armament, ``designed 
for specific fighting function.'' These automotive vehicles are licensed 
for export by the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 
130).
    (B) Military automotive vehicles not on the U.S. Munitions List, new 
and used. Automotive vehicles in this category are primarily transport 
vehicles designed for non-combat military purposes (transporting cargo, 
personnel and/or equipment, and/or for to wing other vehicles and 
equipment over land and roads in close support of fighting vehicles and 
troops). These automotive vehicles are licensed for export by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce.
    (iii) Parts for military automotive vehicles. Functional parts are 
defined as those parts making up the power train of the vehicles, 
including the electrical system, the cooling system, the fuel system, 
and the control system (brake and steering mechanism), the front and 
rear axle assemblies including the wheels, the chassis frame, springs 
and shock absorbers. Parts specifically designed for military automotive 
vehicles on the Munitions List are licensed

[[Page 548]]

for export by the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 
130).
    (iv) General instructions. Manufacturers of non-Munitions List 
automotive vehicles and/or parts will know whether their products meet 
the conditions described in this paragraph (h). Merchant exporters and 
other parties who are not sure whether their products (automotive 
vehicles and/or parts) meet these conditions should check with their 
suppliers for the required information before making a shipment under 
general exception or submitting an application to BXA for a license.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (i) Interpretation 9: Aircraft, parts, accessories and components. 
Aircraft, parts, accessories, and components defined in Categories VIII 
and IX of the Munitions List are under the export licensing authority of 
the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130). All other 
aircraft, and parts, accessories and components therefor, are under the 
export licensing authority of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The 
following aircraft, parts, accessories and components are under the 
licensing authority of the U.S. Department of Commerce:
    (1) Any aircraft (except an aircraft that has been demilitarized, 
but including aircraft specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section) 
that conforms to a Federal Aviation Agency type certificate in the 
normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, or restricted category, provided 
such aircraft has not been equipped with or modified to include military 
equipment, such as gun mounts, turrets, rocket launchers, or similar 
equipment designed for military combat or military training purposes.
    (2) Only the following military aircraft, demilitarized (aircraft 
not specifically equipped, reequipped, or modified for military 
operations):
    (i) Cargo, bearing designations ``C-45 through C-118 inclusive,'' 
and ``C-121'';
    (ii) Trainers, bearing a ``T'' designation and using piston engines;
    (iii) Utility, bearing a ``U'' designation and using piston engines;
    (iv) Liaison, bearing an ``L'' designation; and
    (v) Observation, bearing an ``O'' designation and using piston 
engines.
    (3) All reciprocating engines.
    (4) Other aircraft engines not specifically designed or modified for 
military aircraft.
    (5) Parts, accessories, and components (including propellers), 
designed exclusively for aircraft and engines described in paragraphs 
(i)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3), and (i)(4) of this section.
    (6) General purpose parts, accessories, and components usable 
interchangeably on either military or civil aircraft.
    (j) Interpretation 10: Civil aircraft inertial navigation equipment. 
(1) The Department of Commerce has licensing jurisdiction over exports 
and reexports to all destinations of inertial navigation systems, 
inertial navigation equipment, and specially designed components 
therefor for ``civil aircraft''.
    (2) The Department of State, retains jurisdiction over all software 
and technology for inertial navigation systems and navigation equipment, 
and specially designed components therefor, for shipborne use,

    (l) Interpretation 12: Computers. (1) Digital computers or computer 
systems classified under ECCN 4A003.a, .b, or .c, that qualify for ``No 
License Required'' (NLR) must be evaluated on the basis of CTP alone, to 
the exclusion of all other technical parameters. Computers controlled in 
this entry for MT reasons are not eligible for License Exception CTP 
regardles of the CTP of the computer. Digital computers or computer 
systems classified under ECCN 4A003.a, .b, or .c that qualify for 
License Exception CTP must be evaluated on the basis of CTP, to the 
exclusion of all other technical parameters, except for parameters of 
Missile Technology concern, or ECCN 4A003.e (equipment performing 
analog-to-digital conversions exceeding the limits in ECCN 3A001.a.5.a). 
This License Exception does not authorize the export or reexport of 
computers controlled for MT purposes regardless of the CTP. Assemblies 
performing analog-to-digital conversions are evaluated under Category 
3--Electronics, ECCN 3A001.a.5.a.
    (2) Related equipment classified under ECCN 4A003.d, .e, .f, or .g 
may be exported or reexported under License Exceptions GBS or CIV. When 
related equipment is exported or reexported as part of a computer 
system, NLR or License Exception CTP is available for the computer 
system and the related equipment, as appropriate.
    (m) Interpretation 13: Encryption software controlled for EI 
reasons. Encryption software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 
may be pre-loaded on a laptop and exported under the tools of trade 
provision of License Exception TMP or the personal use exemption under 
License Exception BAG,

[[Page 552]]

subject to the terms and conditions of such License Exceptions. This 
provision replaces the personal use exemption of the International 
Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR) that existed for such software prior 
to December 30, 1996. Neither License Exception TMP nor License 
Exception BAG contains a reporting requirement.
    (n) Interpretation 14: Encryption commodity and software reviews. 
Classification of encryption commodities or software is required to 
determine eligibility for certain licensing mechanisms (see 
Secs. 740.13(e) and 740.17 of the EAR) and exports to subsidiaries of 
U.S. companies (see Sec. 740.17(b)(1) of the EAR). Note that subsequent 
bundling, patches, upgrades or releases, including name changes, may be 
exported or reexported under the applicable provisions of the EAR 
without further review as long as the functional encryption capacity of 
the originally reviewed product has not been modified or enhanced. This 
does not extend to products controlled under a different category on the 
CCL.

Sec. 770.3  Interpretations related to exports of technology and software to destinations in Country Group D:1.

    (a) Introduction. This section is intended to provide you additional 
guidance on how to determine whether your technology or software would 
be eligible for a License Exception, may be exported under NLR, or 
require a license, for export to Country Group D:1.
    (b) Scope of licenses. The export of technology and software under a 
license is authorized only to the extent specifically indicated on the 
face of the license. The only technology and software related to 
equipment exports that may be exported without a license is technology 
described in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR; operating technology 
and software described in Sec. 740.13(a) of the EAR; sales technology 
described in Sec. 740.13(b) of the EAR; and software updates described 
in Sec. 740.13(c) of the EAR.
    (c) Commingled technology and software. (1) U.S.-origin technology 
does not lose its U.S.-origin when it is redrawn, used, consulted, or 
otherwise commingled abroad in any respect with other technology of any 
other origin. Therefore, any subsequent or similar technical data 
prepared or engineered abroad for the design, construction, operation, 
or maintenance of any plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is 
based on or utilizes any U.S.-origin technology, is subject to the EAR 
in the same manner as the original U.S.-origin technology, including 
license requirements, unless the commingled technology is not subject to 
the EAR by reason of the de minimis exclusions described in Sec. 734.4 
of the EAR.
    (2) U.S.-origin software that is incorporated into or commingled 
with foreign-origin software does not lose its U.S.-origin. Such 
commingled software is subject to the EAR is the same manner as the 
original U.S.-origin software, including license requirements, unless 
the commingled software is not subject to the EAR by reason of the de 
minimis exclusions described in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR.
    (d) Certain License Exception. The following questions and answers 
are intended to further clarify the scope of technology and software 
eligible for a License Exception.
    (1)(i) Question 1. (A) Our engineers, in installing or repairing 
equipment, use techniques (experience as well as proprietary knowledge 
of the internal componentry or specifications of the equipment) that 
exceed what is provided in the standard manuals or instructions 
(including training) given to the customer. In some cases, it is also a 
condition of the license that such information provided to the customer 
be constrained to the minimum necessary for normal installation, 
maintenance and operation situations.
    (B) Can we send an engineer (with knowledge and experience) to the 
customer site to perform the installation or repair, under the 
provisions of License Exception TSU for operation technology and 
software described in Sec. 740.13(a) of the EAR, if it is understood 
that he is restricted by our normal business practices to performing

[[Page 553]]

the work without imparting the knowledge or technology to the customer 
personnel?
    (ii) Answer 1. Export of technology includes release of U.S.-origin 
data in a foreign country, and ``release'' includes ``application to 
situations abroad of personal knowledge or technical experience acquired 
in the United States.'' As the release of technology in the 
circumstances described here would exceed that permitted under the 
License Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in 
Sec. 740.13(a) of the EAR, a license would be required even though the 
technician could apply the data without disclosing it to the customer.
    (2)(i) Question 2. We plan, according to our normal business 
practices, to train customer engineers to maintain equipment that we 
have exported under a license, License Exception, or NLR. The training 
is contractual in nature, provided for a fee, and is scheduled to take 
place in part in the customer's facility and in part in the U.S. Can we 
now proceed with this training at both locations under a License 
Exception?
    (ii) Answer 2. (A) Provided that this is your normal training, and 
involves technology contained in your manuals and standard instructions 
for the exported equipment, and meets the other requirements of License 
Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in 
Sec. 740.13(a), the training may be provided within the limits of those 
provisions of License Exception TSU. The location of the training is not 
significant, as the export occurs at the time and place of the actual 
transfer or imparting of the technology to the customer's engineers.
    (B) Any training beyond that covered under the provisions of License 
Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in 
Sec. 740.13(a), but specifically represented in your license application 
as required for this customer installation, and in fact authorized on 
the face of the license or a separate technology license, may not be 
undertaken while the license is suspended or revoked.

Sec. 774.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) maintains 
the Commerce Control List (CCL) that includes items (commodities, 
software, and technology) subject to the authority of BXA. The CCL does 
not include those items exclusively controlled for

[[Page 579]]

export by another department or agency of the U.S. Government. In 
instances where other agencies administer controls over related items, 
entries in the CCL will contain a reference to these controls. Those 
items subject to the EAR but not specified on the CCL are identified by 
the designator ``EAR99''. See Sec. 734.2(a) of the EAR for items that 
are ``subject to the EAR''. You should consult part 738 of the EAR for 
an explanation of the organization of the CCL and its relationship to 
the Country Chart.
    The CCL is contained in Supplement No. 1 to this part, and 
Supplement No. 2 to this part contains the General Technology and 
Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.

paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Note 2, are controlled by this ECCN 
and are subject to the following licensing requirements (mixtures that 
contain less than the concentrations of precursor and intermediate 
chemicals specified in this Note 2 are controlled by ECCN 1C995):
    a. A license is required for shipments to all destinations, 
including Canada, for mixtures containing any amount of the following 
Schedule 1 chemicals, unless the mixture contains less than 0.5% 
aggregate quantities

[[Page 615]]

(by weight) of these chemicals as unavoidable by-products or impurities 
(i.e., the Schedule 1 chemicals are not intentionally produced or 
added): 0-Ethyl-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonite (QL) 
(C.A.S.57856-11-8), Ethylphosphonyl difluoride (C.A.S.753-98-0) and 
Methylphosphonyl difluoride (C.A.S.676-99-3).
    b. A license is required when at least one of the following 
chemicals constitutes 30 percent or more of the weight of the mixture, 
for shipments to States Parties to the CWC (destinations listed in 
Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) that are not in Country Group 
A:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), or more than 10 
percent of the weight of the mixture, for shipments to all other 
destinations: Arsenic trichloride (C.A.S.7784-34-1), Benzilic acid 
(C.A.S.76-93-7), Diethyl ethylphosphonate (C.A.S.78-38-6), Diethyl 
methylphosphonite (C.A.S.15715-41-0), Diethyl-N,N-
dimethylphosphoroamidate (C.A.S.2404-03-7), N,N-Diisopropyl-beta-
aminoethane thiol (C.A.S.5842-07-9), N,N-Diisopropyl-2-aminoethyl 
chloride hydrochloride (C.A.S.4261-68-1), N,N-Diisopropyl-beta-
aminoethanol (C.A.S.96-80-0), N,N-Diisopropyl-beta-aminoethyl chloride 
(C.A.S.96-79-7), Dimethyl ethylphosphonate (C.A.S.6163-75-3), Dimethyl 
methylphosphonate (C.A.S.756-79-6), Ethylphosphonous dichloride 
[Ethylphosphinyl dichloride] (C.A.S.1498-40-4), Ethylphosphonus 
difluoride [Ethylphosphinyl difluoride] (C.A.S.430-78-4), 
Ethylphosphonyl dichloride (C.A.S.1066-50-8), Methylphosphonous 
dichloride [Methylphosphinyl dichloride] (C.A.S.676-83-5), 
Methylphosphonous difluoride [Methylphosphinyl difluoride] (C.A.S.753-
59-3), Methylphosphonyl dichloride (C.A.S.676-97-1), Pinacolyl alcohol 
(C.A.S.464-07-3), 3-Quinuclidinol (C.A.S.1619-34-7), and Thiodiglycol 
(C.A.S.111-48-8) (Related ECCN: 1C995);
    c. A license is required for shipments to destinations that are not 
in Country Group A:3 (Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) when at 
least one of all other chemicals in the List of Items Controlled under 
ECCN 1C350 constitutes 30 percent or more of the weight of the mixture 
(related ECCN: 1C995); and
    d. A license is not required under this entry for mixtures when the 
controlled chemical is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged 
for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are classified as 
EAR99.

    Note to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled 
chemicals:
    a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for 
the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations;
    b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by 
weight, of components in a chemical mixture, include all components of 
the mixture, including those that act as solvents;

    c. Example.

31% chemical listed in paragraph c. of Note 2. (destined to a State not 
          Party to the CWC)
39% chemical not listed in Note 2
30% Solvent
100% Mixture

31/100 = 31% chemical listed in paragraph c. of Note 2.

    In this example, a license and an End-Use Certificate are required 
because a chemical listed in paragraph c. of Note 2 constitutes 30 
percent or more of the weight of the mixture and the destination is a 
State not Party to the CWC.
    3. COMPOUNDS: Compounds created with any chemicals identified in 
this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without 
obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also 
identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth 
elsewhere in the EAR.
    4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food 
testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this 
ECCN 1C350 as CWC Schedule 2 or 3 chemicals are excluded from the scope 
of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C995. (Note that replacement 
reagents for such kits are controlled by ECCN 1C350 if the reagents 
contain one or more of the precursor or intermediate chemicals 
identified in this ECCN in concentrations equal to or greater than those 
specified for mixtures in License Requirements Note 2 for this ECCN.)

    Technical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a ``mixture'' is 
defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more 
components that do not react together under normal storage conditions.
    2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (Item 
25 in List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and 
aqueous phases, and hydrates.

                          License Requirements

    Reason for Control: CW
    Control(s)
    CW applies to entire entry. The Commerce Country Chart is not 
designed to determine licensing requirements for items controlled for CW 
reasons. A license is required to export CWC Schedule 2 chemicals 
(1C355.a) to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in 
Supplement No. 2 to part 745). A license is required to export CWC 
Schedule 3 chemicals (1C355.b) to States not Party to the CWC, unless an 
End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is 
obtained by the exporter, prior to export. (See Sec. 742.18 of the EAR 
for license requirements and policies for chemicals and precursors 
controlled for CW reasons.)
    License Requirements Notes:
    1. MIXTURES: Mixtures that contain precursor and intermediate 
chemicals controlled by this entry, in the concentrations specified in 
paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Note 1, are subject to the following 
requirements.
    a. Mixtures are controlled under this entry when at least one of the 
chemicals controlled under 1C355.a constitutes more than 10 percent of 
the weight of the mixture, except for mixtures containing PFIB, which 
are controlled under this entry when PFIB constitutes more than 1 
percent of the weight of the mixture.
    b. Mixtures are controlled under this entry when at least one of the 
chemicals controlled under 1C355.b constitutes 30 percent or more of the 
weight of the mixture.
    c. Mixtures containing chemicals identified in this entry are not 
controlled by ECCN 1C355 when the controlled chemical is a normal 
ingredient in consumer goods packaged

[[Page 619]]

for retail sale for personal use or packaged for individual use. Such 
consumer goods are classified as EAR99.

    Note to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of CW-controlled 
chemicals:
    a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for 
the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations;
    b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by 
weight, of components in a chemical mixture, include all components of 
the mixture, including those that act as solvents;

    c. Example.

30% chemical listed in 1C355.b.
20% chemical not listed in 1C355.b
50% Solvent
100% Mixture

30/100 = 30% chemical listed in 1C355.b.

    In this example, the mixture is controlled under this entry, because 
a chemical listed in 1C355.b constitutes 30 percent or more of the 
weight of the mixture.
    2. COMPOUNDS: Compounds created with any chemicals identified in 
this ECCN 1C355 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without 
obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also 
identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth 
elsewhere in the EAR.

    Technical Notes: For purposes of this entry, a ``mixture'' is 
defined as a solid, liquid, or gaseous product made up of two or more 
components that do not react together under normal storage conditions.

    Technical Note to Table on Deposition Techniques: Processes 
specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows:

    a. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface 
modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, ``composite'', 
dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous 
reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate 
resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound 
material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical 
reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow 
discharge plasma, or ``laser'' irradiation.

    Note 1: CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-
of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal 
decomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.
    Note 2: Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.
    Note 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are 
produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack 
cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in 
contact with the powder mixture.
    b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is an 
overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 
0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the 
coating material. This process results in the condensation, or 
deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned 
substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the 
coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary 
modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or 
plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common 
modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-
process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings 
can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as 
follows:
    1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the 
material which forms the coating;
    2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive 
heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a 
controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;
    3. ``Laser'' Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave 
``laser'' beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;
    4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the 
material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on 
the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled 
motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized 
plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the 
cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used 
for non line-of-sight deposition.
    Note: This definition does not include random cathodic arc 
deposition with non-biased substrates.

    5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process 
in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be 
deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to 
facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The 
introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the 
process

[[Page 655]]

chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of 
optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary 
modifications of the process.
    c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay 
coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a 
pack), that consists of:
    1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminum, 
chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);
    2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and
    3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina.

    Note: The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort 
which is heated to between 1,030 K (757  deg.C) to 1,375 K (1,102 
deg.C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating.

    d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun 
(spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or 
wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, 
whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying 
constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma 
spraying.

    Note 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.
    Note 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 
750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20  deg.C) at 0.1 MPa.

    e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay 
coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic 
binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either 
spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat 
treatment to obtain the desired coating.
    f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a 
momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by 
an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). 
The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target 
surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately 
positioned substrate.

    Note 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive 
sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and 
rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter 
deposition used to permit vaporization of non-metallic coating 
materials.
    Note 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to 
activate the deposition.

    g. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in 
which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a 
potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the 
substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is 
performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapor deposition or 
sputter deposition.

Related Controls: This entry does not control detonators using only 
primary explosives, such as lead azide.
Related Definition: The detonators of concern all utilize a small 
electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire or foil) that explosively 
vaporizes when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through 
it. In nonslapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical 
detonation in a contacting high-explosive material such as PETN 
(Pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive 
vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper 
across a gap and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a 
chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by a magnetic 
force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a 
slapper-type detonator. Also, the word initiator is sometimes used in 
place of the word detonator.
Items: a. Electrically driven explosive detonators, the following:

    a.1. Exploding bridge (EB);
    a.2. Exploding bridge wire (EBW);
    a.3. Slapper;
    a.4. Exploding foil initiators (EFI);

                  Outline of ``CTP'' calculation method

    ``CTP'' is a measure of computational performance given in Mtops. In 
calculating the ``CTP'' of an aggregation of ``CEs'' the following three 
steps are required:
    1. Calculate the effective calculating rate R for each ``CE'';
    2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effective calculating 
rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance (TP) for each ``CE'';
    3. If there is more than one ``CE'', combine the TPs, resulting in a 
``CTP'' for the aggregation.
    Details for these steps are given in the following sections.

    Note 1: For aggregations of multiple ``CEs'' that have both shared 
and unshared memory subsystems, the calculation of ``CTP'' is completed 
hierarchically, in two steps: first, aggregate the groups of ``CEs'' 
sharing memory; second, calculate the ``CTP'' of the groups using the 
calculation method for multiple ``CEs'' not sharing memory.

    Note 2: ``CEs'' that are limited to input/output and peripheral 
functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display 
controllers) are not aggregated into the ``CTP'' calculation.

    The following table shows the method of calculating the Effective 
Calculating Rate R for each ``CE'':
    Step 1: The effective calculating rate R

    Note W: For a pipelined ``CE'' capable of executing up to one 
arithmetic or logic operation every clock cycle after the pipeline is 
full, a pipelined rate can be established. The effective calculating 
rate (R) for such a ``CE'' is the faster of the pipelined rate or non-
pipelined execution rate.

    Note X: For a ``CE'' that performs multiple operations of a specific 
type in a single cycle (e.g., two additions per cycle or two identical 
logic operations per cycle), the execution time t is given by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JY99.002

    ``CEs'' that perform different types of arithmetic or logic 
operations in a single machine cycle are to be treated as multiple 
separate ``CEs'' performing simultaneously (e.g., a ``CE'' performing an 
addition and a multiplication in one cycle is to be treated as two 
``CEs'', the first performing an addition in one cycle and the second 
performing a multiplication in one cycle). If a single ``CE'' has both 
scalar function and vector function, use the shorter execution time 
value.

    Note Y: For the ``CE'' that does not implement FP add or FP 
multiply, but that performs FP divide:

[[Page 688]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JY99.003

    If the ``CE'' implements FP reciprocal but not FP add, FP multiply 
or FP divide, then
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JY99.004

    If none of the specified instructions is implemented, the effective 
FP rate is 0.

    Note Z: In simple logic operations, a single instruction performs a 
single logic manipulation of no more than two operands of given lengths. 
In complex logic operations, a single instruction performs multiple 
logic manipulations to produce one or more results from two or more 
operands.
    Rates should be calculated for all supported operand lengths 
considering both pipelined operations (if supported), and non-pipelined 
operations using the fastest executing instruction for each operand 
length based on:
    1. Pipelined or register-to-register operations. Exclude 
extraordinarily short execution times generated for operations on a 
predetermined operand or operands (for example, multiplication by 0 or 
1). If no register-to-register operations are implemented, continue with 
(2).
    2. The faster of register-to-memory or memory-to-register 
operations; if these also do not exist, then continue with (3).
    3. Memory-to-memory.
    In each case above, use the shortest execution time certified by the 
manufacturer.
    Step 2: TP for each supported operand length WL
    Adjust the effective rate R (or R) by the word length adjustment L 
as follows:
P = R * L, where L = (1/3 + WL/96)

    Note: The word length WL used in these calculations is the operand 
length in bits. (If an operation uses operands of different lengths, 
select the largest word length.) The combination of a mantissa ALU and 
an exponent ALU of a floating point processor or unit is considered to 
be one ``CE'' with a Word Length (WL) equal to the number of bits in the 
data representation (typically 32 or 64) for purposes of the ``CTP'' 
calculation.

    This adjustment is not applied to specialized logic processors that 
do not use XOR instructions. In this case TP = R.
    Select the maximum resulting value of TP for:
    Each XP-only ``CE'' (R<INF>xp</INF>);
    Each FP-only ``CE'' (R<INF>fp</INF>);
    Each combined FP and XP ``CE'' (R);
    Each simple logic processor not implementing any of the specified 
arithmetic operations; and
    Each special logic processor not using any of the specified 
arithmetic or logic operations.
    Step 3: ``CTP'' for aggregations of ``CEs'', including CPUs.
    For a CPU with a single ``CE'', ``CTP'' = TP (for ``CEs'' performing 
both fixed and floating point operations TP = max (TP<INF>fp</INF>, 
TP<INF>xp</INF>))
    ``CTP'' for aggregations of multiple ``CEs'' operating 
simultaneously is calculated as follows:

    Note 1: For aggregations that do not allow all of the ``CEs'' to run 
simultaneously, the possible combination of ``CEs'' that provides the 
largest ``CTP'' should be used. The TP of each contributing ``CE'' is to 
be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the 
``CTP'' of the combination is derived.

    N.B.: To determine the possible combinations of simultaneously 
operating ``CEs'',

[[Page 689]]

generate an instruction sequence that initiates operations in multiple 
``CEs'', beginning with the slowest ``CE'' (the one needing the largest 
number of cycles to complete its operation) and ending with the fastest 
``CE''. At each cycle of the sequence, the combination of ``CEs'' that 
are in operation during that cycle is a possible combination. The 
instruction sequence must take into account all hardware and/or 
architectural constraints on overlapping operations.

    Note 2: A single integrated circuit chip or board assembly may 
contain multiple ``CEs''.

    Note 3: Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the 
computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel or simultaneous 
operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.

    Note 4: ``CTP'' values are not to be aggregated for ``CE'' 
combinations (inter)connected by ``Local Area Networks'', Wide Area 
Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any 
communication interconnection implemented by ``software''.

    Note 5: ``CTP'' values must be aggregated for multiple ``CEs'' 
specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operating 
simultaneously and sharing memory,-or multiple memory/''CE''-
combinations operating simultaneously utilizing specially designed 
hardware.

    This aggregation does not apply to ``electronic assemblies'' 
described by 4A003.c.

``CTP''=TP<INF>1</INF>+C<INF>2</INF>*TP<INF>2</INF>+...+C<INF>n</INF>*TP<INF>n,</INF>


Where the TPs are ordered by value, with TP<INF>1</INF> being the 
highest, TP<INF>2</INF> being the second highest, ..., and 
TP<INF>n</INF> being the lowest. C<INF>i</INF> is a coefficient 
determined by the strength of the interconnection between ``CEs'', as 
follows:
    For multiple ``CEs'' operating simultaneously and sharing memory:

    C<INF>2</INF>=C<INF>3</INF>=C<INF>4</INF>=...=C<INF>n</INF>=0.75

    Note 1: When the ``CTP'' calculated by the above method does not 
exceed 194 Mtops, the following formula may be used to calculate 
C<INF>i</INF>:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JY99.005

Where m=the number of ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' sharing access.
    provided:
    1. The TP<INF>1</INF> of each ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' does not 
exceed 30 Mtops;
    2. The ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' share access to main memory 
(excluding cache memory) over a single channel; and
    3. Only one ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' can have use of the channel 
at any given time.
    N.B.: This does not apply to items controlled under Category 3.

    Note 2: ``CEs'' share memory if they access a common segment of 
solid state memory. This memory may include cache memory, main memory or 
other internal memory. Peripheral memory devices such as disk drives, 
tape drives or RAM disks are not included.

    For Multiple ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' not sharing memory, 
interconnected by one or more data channels:
<ls-thn-eq>C<INF>i</INF>=0.75*k<INF>i</INF> (i=2,..., 32) (see Note 
          below)
    =0.60*k<INF>i</INF> (i=33,..., 64)
    =0.45*k<INF>i</INF> (i=65,..., 256)
    =0.30 * k<INF>i</INF> (i >256)
    The value of C<INF>i</INF> is based on the number of ``CE''s, not 
the number of nodes.

<ls-thn-eq>Where k<INF>i</INF>=min (S<INF>i</INF>/K<INF>r,</INF> 1), and
<ls-thn-eq>K<INF>r</INF>=normalizing factor of 20 MByte/s.
<ls-thn-eq>S<INF>i</INF> = sum of the maximum data rates (in units of 
          MByte/s) for all data channels connected to the i<SUP>th</SUP> 
          ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' sharing memory.

    When calculating a C<INF>i</INF> for a group of ``CEs'', the number 
of the first ``CE'' in a group determines the proper limit for 
C<INF>i</INF>. For example, in an aggregation of groups consisting of 3 
``CEs'' each, the 22nd group will contain ``CE''<INF>64</INF>, 
``CE''<INF>65</INF> and ``CE''<INF>66</INF>. The proper limit for 
C<INF>i</INF> for this group is 0.60.
    Aggregation (of ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'') should be from the 
fastest-to-slowest; i.e.: TP<INF>1</INF><gr-thn-eq>TP<INF>2</INF> 
<gr-thn-eq>....<gr-thn-eq> TP<INF>n</INF>, and
    in the case of TP<INF>i</INF>=TP<INF>i+1</INF>, from the largest to 
smallest; i.e.: C<INF>i</INF><gr-thn-eq>C<INF>i+1</INF>

    Note: The k<INF>i</INF> factor is not to be applied to ``CEs'' 2 to 
12 if the TP<INF>i</INF> of the ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' is more than 
50 Mtops; i.e., C<INF>i</INF> for ``CEs'' 2 to 12 is 0.75.

Related Definition: (1) Maintenance Level I: The failure of an inertial 
navigation unit is detected on the aircraft by indications from the 
Control and Display Unit (CDU) or by the status message from the 
corresponding sub-system. By following the manufacturer's manual, the 
cause of the failure may be localized at the level of the malfunctioning 
line replaceable unit (LRU). The operator then removes the LRU and 
replaces it with a spare. (2) Maintenance Level II: The defective LRU is 
sent to the maintenance workshop (the manufacturer's or that of the 
operator responsible for level II maintenance). At the maintenance 
workshop, the malfunctioning LRU is tested by various appropriate means 
to verify and localize the defective shop replaceable assembly (SRA) 
module responsible for the failure. This SRA is removed and replaced by 
an operative spare. The defective SRA (or possibly the complete LRU) is 
then shipped to the manufacturer. Maintenance Level II does not include 
the removal of controlled accelerometers or gyro sensors from the SRA.
Items: The list of items controlled is contained in the ECCN heading.

license applications for the export of commercial communications 
satellites will be processed by the State Department, Office of Defense 
Trade Controls. Retransfer of jurisdiction for commercial communications 
satellites and related items shall not affect the validity of any export 
license issued by the Department of Commerce prior to March 15, 1999, or 
of any export license application filed under the Export Administration 
Regulations on or before March 14, 1999, and subsequently issued by the 
Department of Commerce. Commercial communications satellites licensed by 
the Department of Commerce, including those already exported, remain 
subject to the EAR and all terms and conditions of issued export 
licenses until their stated expiration date. All licenses issued by the 
Department of Commerce for commercial communications satellites, 
including licenses issued after March 15, 1999, remain subject to SI 
controls throughout the validity of the license. Effective March 15, 
1999, Department of State jurisdiction shall apply to any instance where 
a replacement license would normally be required from the Department of 
Commerce. Transferring registration or operational control to any 
foreign person of any item controlled by this entry must be authorized 
on a license issued by the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade 
Controls. This requirement applies whether the item is physically 
located in the United States or abroad. (4.) All other ``spacecraft'' 
not controlled under 9A004 and their payloads, and specifically designed

   Supplement No. 2 to Part 774--General Technology and Software Notes

    1. General Technology Note. The export of ``technology'' that is 
``required'' for the ``development'', ``production'', or ``use'' of 
items on the Commerce Control List is controlled according to the 
provisions in each Category.
    ``Technology'' ``required'' for the ``development'', ``production'', 
or ``use'' of a controlled product remains controlled even when 
applicable to a product controlled at a lower level.
    License Exception TSU is available for ``technology'' that is the 
minimum necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance 
(checking), and repair of those products that are eligible for License 
Exceptions or that are exported under a license.

    N.B.: This does not allow release under a License Exception of the 
repair ``technology'' controlled by 1E002.e, 1E002.f, 7E003, or 8E002.a.

    N.B.: The minimum necessary excludes ``development'' or 
``production'' technology and permits ``use'' technology only to the 
extent ``required'' to ensure safe and efficient use of the product. 
Individual ECCNs may further restrict export of ``minimum necessary'' 
information.

    II. General Software Note. License Exception TSU (``mass market'' 
software) is available to all destinations, except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, 
Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, for release of software that is 
generally available to the public by being:
    a. Sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction, by 
means of:
    1. Over the counter transactions;
    2. Mail order transactions; or
    3. Telephone call transactions; and
    b. Designed for installation by the user without further substantial 
support by the supplier.
