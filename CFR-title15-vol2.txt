                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 301.1  General provisions.

    (a) Purpose. This part sets forth the regulations of the Department 
of Commerce and the Department of the Treasury applicable to the duty-
free importation of scientific instruments and apparatus by public or 
private nonprofit institutions.
    (b) Background. (1) The Agreement on the importation of Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Materials (Florence Agreement; ``the 
Agreement'') is a multinational treaty, contracted to by approximately 
89 countries, which seeks to further the cause of peace through the 
freer exchange of ideas and knowledge across national boundaries, 
primarily by eliminating tariffs on certain educational, scientific and 
cultural materials.
    (2) Annex D of the Agreement provides that scientific instruments 
and apparatus intended exclusively for educational purposes or pure 
scientific research use by qualified nonprofit institutions shall enjoy 
duty-free entry if instruments or apparatus of equivalent scientific 
value are not being manufactured in the country of importation.
    (3) Pub. L. 89-651, the Educational, Scientific, and Cultural 
Materials Importation Act of 1966 (19 U.S.C. 1202; ``the Act''), 
implements the Agreement in the United States. Section 6(c) of the Act 
gives effect to Annex D of the Agreement. This section added tariff item 
851.60 to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) to provide 
for the duty-free importation of instruments and apparatus ``entered for 
the use of any nonprofit institution, whether public or private, 
established for educational or scientific purposes * * * if no 
instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value for the purposes 
for which the instrument or apparatus is intended to be used is being 
manufactured in the United States.'' Headnote 1 to Schedule 8, part 4, 
TSUS, was amended by Pub. L. 89-651 and provides for the use, 
disposition and transfer of articles and their repair components 
accorded duty-free entry under tariff items 851.60 and 851.65, 
respectively, and Headnote 6, added by Pub. L. 89-651, sets forth the 
duty-free procedures and responsibilities.
    (c) Summary of statutory procedures and requirements. (1) Headnote 1 
provides, among other things, that articles covered by tariff items 
851.60 (scientific instruments and apparatus) and 851.65 (repair 
components therefor) must be exclusively for the use of the institutions 
involved and not for distribution, sale or other commercial use within 
five years after being entered. These articles may be transferred by a 
qualified nonprofit institution to another such institution without duty 
liability being incurred. However, if such article is transferred other 
than as provided by the preceding sentence, or is used for commercial 
purposes within five years after having been entered, duty shall be 
assessed in accordance with the procedures established in Headnote 1.
    (2) Pursuant to Headnote 6 an institution desiring to enter an 
instrument or apparatus under tariff item 851.60 TSUS must file an 
application with the

[[Page 8]]

Secretary of the Treasury (U.S. Customs Service) in accordance with 
these regulations. If the application is made in accordance with the 
regulations, notice of the application is published in the Federal 
Register to provide an opportunity for interested persons and government 
agencies to present views. The application is reviewed by the Secretary 
of Commerce (Director, Statutory Import Programs Staff) whose decision 
as to whether or not duty-free entry may be accorded the instrument is 
published in the Federal Register. An appeal of the final decision may 
be filed with the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, on 
questions of law only, within 20 days after publication of the decision 
in the Federal Register.
    (3) Repair components for instruments or apparatus admitted duty-
free under tariff item 851.60 require no application and may be entered 
duty-free in accordance with the procedures prescribed in Sec. 301.10.
    (d) Authority and delegations. The Act authorizes the Secretaries of 
Commerce and the Treasury to prescribe joint regulations to carry out 
their functions under Headnote 6, TSUS. The Secretary of the Treasury 
has delegated authority to the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and 
Operations, who has retained rulemaking authority and further delegated 
administration of the regulations to the Commissioner of the U.S. 
Customs Service. The authority of the Secretary of Commerce has been 
delegated to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration 
who has retained rulemaking authority and further delegated 
administration of the regulations to the Director of the Statutory 
Import Programs Staff.
[47 FR 32517, July 28, 1982; 47 FR 34368, Aug. 9, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 301.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of these regulations and the forms used to 
implement them:
    (a) Director means the Director of the Statutory Import Programs 
Staff, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.
    (b) Customs means the U.S. Customs Service and the ``The 
Commissioner'' means Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, or the 
official(s) designated to act on the Commissioner's behalf.
    (c) Customs Port or the Port means the port where a particular claim 
has been or will be made for duty-free entry of a scientific instrument 
or apparatus under tariff item 851.60.
    (d) Entry means entry of an instrument into the Customs territory of 
the United States for consumption or withdrawal of an instrument from a 
Customs bonded warehouse for consumption.
    (e) United States includes only the several States, the District of 
Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (f) Instrument means only instruments and apparatus classifiable 
under the tariff items specified in headnote 6(a) of part 4 of Schedule 
8. A combination of basic instrument or apparatus and accompanying 
accessories shall be treated as a single instrument provided that, under 
normal commercial practice, such combination is considered to be a 
single instrument and provided further that the applicant has ordered 
or, upon favorable action on its application, firmly intends to order 
the combination as a unit. Unless the context indicates otherwise, 
instrument or apparatus shall mean a foreign ``instrument or apparatus'' 
for which duty-free entry is sought under tariff item 851.60. Spare 
parts typically ordered and delivered with an instrument are also 
considered part of an instrument for purposes of these regulations. The 
term ``instruments'' shall not include:
    (1) Materials or supplies used in the operation of instruments and 
apparatus such as paper, cards, tapes, ink, recording materials, 
expendable laboratory materials, apparatus that loses identity or is 
consumed by usage or other materials or supplies.
    (2) Ordinary equipment for use in building construction or 
maintenance; or equipment for use in supporting activities of the 
institution, such as its administrative offices, machine shops, 
libraries, centralized computer facilities, eating facilities, or 
religious facilities; or support equipment such as copying machines, 
glass working apparatus and film processors.

[[Page 9]]

    (3) General purpose equipment such as air conditioners, electric 
typewriters, electric drills, refrigerators.
    (4) General-purpose computers. Accessories to computers which are 
not eligible for duty-free treatment are also ineligible. Scientific 
instruments containing embedded computers which are to be used in a 
dedicated process or in instrument control, as opposed to general data 
processing or computation, are, however, eligible for duty-free 
consideration.
    (5) Instruments initially imported solely for testing or review 
purposes which were entered under bond under tariff item 864.30, subject 
to the provisions of Headnote 1(a) of subpart C, part 5, schedule 8 TSUS 
and must be exported or destroyed within the time period specified in 
that headnote.
    (g) Domestic instrument means an instrument which is manufactured in 
the United States. A domestic instrument need not be made exclusively of 
domestic components or accessories.
    (h) Accessory has the meaning which it has under normal commercial 
usage. An accessory, whether part of an instrument or an attachment to 
an instrument, adds to the capability of an instrument. An accessory for 
which duty-free entry is sought under item 851.60 shall be the subject 
of a separate application when it is not an accompanying accessory.
    (i) Accompanying accessory means an accessory for an instrument that 
is listed as an item in the same purchase order and that is necessary 
for accomplishment of the purposes for which the instrument is intended 
to be used.
    (j) Ancillary equipment means an instrument which may be 
functionally related to the foreign instrument but is not operationally 
linked to it. Examples of ancillary equipment are vacuum evaporators or 
ultramicrotomes, which can be used to prepare specimens for electron 
microscopy. Further, equipment which is compatible with the foreign 
instrument, but is also clearly compatible with similar domestic 
instruments, such as automatic sampling equipment sold for use with a 
variety of mass spectrometers, will be treated as ancillary equipment. A 
separate application will be required for ancillary equipment even if 
ordered with the basic instrument.
    (k) Components of an instrument means parts or assemblies of parts 
which are substantially less than the instrument to which they relate. A 
component enables an instrument to function at a specified minimum 
level, while an accessory adds to the capability of an instrument. 
Applications shall not be accepted for components of instruments that 
did not enter duty-free under tariff item 851.60 or for components of 
instruments being manufactured or assembled by a commercial firm or 
entity in the U.S. In determining whether an item is a component 
ineligible for duty-free consideration or an accessory eligible for such 
consideration, Customs shall take into account such factors as the 
item's complexity, novelty, degree of integration and pertinency to the 
research purposes to be performed by the instrument as a whole.
    (l) Produced for stock means an instrument which is manufactured, on 
sale and available from a stock.
    (m) Produced on order means an instrument which a manufacturer lists 
in current catalog literature and is able and willing to produce and 
have available without unreasonable delay to the applicant.
    (n) Custom-made means an instrument which a manufacturer is willing 
and able to make to purchaser's specifications. Instruments resulting 
from a development effort are treated as custom-made for the purposes of 
these regulations. Also, a special-order variant of a produced on order 
instrument, with significant modifications specified by the applicant, 
may be treated as custom-made.
    (o) Same general category means the category in which an instrument 
is customarily classified in trade directories and product-source lists, 
e.g., scanning electron microscope, mass spectrometer, light microscope, 
x-ray spectrometer.
    (p) Comparable domestic instrument means a domestic instrument 
capable or potentially capable of fulfilling the applicant's technical 
requirements or intended uses, whether or not in the same general 
category as the foreign instrument.

[[Page 10]]

    (q) Specifications means the particulars of the structural, 
operational and performance characteristics or capabilities of a 
scientific instrument.
    (r) Guaranteed specifications are those specifications which are an 
explicit part of the contractual agreement between the buyer and the 
seller (or which would become part of the agreement if the buyer 
accepted the seller's offer), and refer only to the minimum and 
routinely achievable performance levels of the instrument under 
specified conditions. If a capability is listed or quoted as a range 
(e.g., ``5 to 10 angstroms'') or as a minimum that may be exceeded 
(e.g., ``5 angstroms or better''), only the inferior capability may be 
considered the guaranteed specification. Evidence that specifications 
are ``guaranteed'' will normally consist of their being printed in a 
brochure or other descriptive literature of the manufacturer; being 
listed in a purchase agreement upon which the purchase is conditioned; 
or appearing in a manufacturer's formal response to a request for quote. 
If, however, no opportunity to submit a bid was afforded the domestic 
manufacturer or if, for any other reason, comparable guaranteed 
specifications of the foreign and domestic instruments do not appear on 
the record, other evidence relating to a manufacturer's ability to 
provide an instrument with comparable specifications may, at the 
discretion of the Director, be considered in the comparison of the 
foreign and domestic instruments' capabilities.
    (s) Pertinent specifications are those specifications necessary for 
the accomplishment of the specific scientific research and/or science-
related educational purposes described by the applicant. Specifications 
of features (even if guaranteed) which afford greater convenience, 
satisfy personal preferences, accommodate institutional commitments or 
limitations, or assure lower costs of acquisition, installation, 
operation, servicing or maintenance are not pertinent. For example, a 
design feature, such as a small number of knobs or controls on an 
instrument primarily designed for research purposes, would be a 
convenience. The ability to fit an instrument into a small room, when 
the required operations could be performed in a larger room, would be 
either a cost consideration or a matter of convenience and not a 
pertinent specification. In addition, mere difference in design (which 
would, for example, broaden the educational experience of students but 
not provide superior scientific capability) would not be pertinent. 
Also, unless the applicant demonstrates it is necessary for the 
accomplishment of its specific scientific purposes, the terms does not 
extend to such characteristics as size, weight, appearance, durability, 
reliability, complexity or (simplicity), ease of operation, ease of 
maintenance, productivity, versatility, ``state of the art'' design, 
specific design, or other such characteristics.

<R05>
Sec. 301.3  Application for duty-free entry of scientific instruments.

    (a) Who may apply. An applicant for duty-free entry of an instrument 
under tariff item 851.60 must be a public or private nonprofit 
institution which is established for educational or scientific purposes 
and which has placed a bona fide order or has a firm intention to place 
a bona fide order for a foreign instrument within 60 days following a 
favorable decision on the institution's application.
    (b) Application forms. Applications must be made on form ITA-338P 
which may be obtained from the Statutory Import Programs Staff, 
International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Washington, DC 20230, or from the various District Offices of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
under control number 0625-0037.)
    (c) Where to apply. Applications must be filed with the U.S. Customs 
Service, Department of the Treasury, at the address specified on page 1 
of the form.
    (d) Five copies of the form, including relevant supporting 
documents, must be submitted. One copy of the form shall be signed in 
the original by the person in the applicant institution under whose 
direction and control the foreign instrument will be used and who is 
familiar with the intended uses

[[Page 11]]

of the instrument. The remaining four copies of the form may be copies 
of the original. Attachments should be fully identified and referenced 
to the question(s) on the form to which they relate.
    (e) A single application (in the requisite number of copies) may be 
submitted for any quantity of the same type or model of foreign 
instrument provided that the entire quantity is intended to be used for 
the same purposes and provided that all units are included on a single 
purchase order. A separate application shall be submitted for each 
different type or model or variation in the type or model of instrument 
for which duty-free entry is sought even if covered by a single purchase 
order. Orders calling for multiple deliveries of the same type or model 
of instrument over a substantial period of time may, at the discretion 
of the Director, require multiple applications.
    (f) Failure to answer completely all questions on the form in 
accordance with the instructions on the form or to supply the requisite 
number of copies of the form and supporting documents may result in 
delays in processing of the application while the deficiencies are 
remedied, return of the application without processing, or denial of the 
application without prejudice to resubmission. Any questions on these 
regulations or the application form should be addressed to the Director.

Sec. 301.4  Processing of applications by the Department of the Treasury (U.S. Customs Service).

    (a) Review and determination. The Commissioner shall date each 
application when received by Customs. If the application appears to be 
complete, the Commissioner shall determine:
    (1) Whether the institution is a nonprofit private or public 
institution established for research and educational purposes and 
therefore authorized to import instruments into the U.S. under tariff 
item 851.60. In making this determination the Commissioner will 
generally review the application to determine if the applicant has 
attached a copy of the letter from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
granting the institution nonprofit status (exemption from Federal income 
tax) under section 501(c)(3) of the IRS Code or will determine if the 
institution is listed in a current edition of ``Cumulative List of 
Exempt Organizations'';
    (2) Whether the instrument falls within the classes of instruments 
eligible for duty-free entry consideration under tariff item 851.60 (For 
eligible classes see Headnote 6(a), part 4, Schedule 8, TSUS); and
    (3) Whether the instrument which is the subject of the application 
is intended for the exclusive use of the applicant institution and is 
not intended to be used for commercial purposes. For the purposes of 
this section, commercial uses would include, but not necessarily be 
limited to: Distribution or sale of the instrument by the applicant 
institution; any use by, or for the primary benefit of, a commercial 
entity; or use of the instrument for demonstration purposes in return 
for a fee or other valuable consideration. In making the above 
determination, the Commissioner may consider, among other things, 
whether the results of any research to be performed with the instrument 
will be fully and timely made available to the public. For the purposes 
of this section, use of an instrument for the treatment of patients is 
considered noncommercial.

If any of the Commissioner's determinations is in the negative, the 
application shall be found to be outside the scope of the Act and shall 
be returned to the applicant with a statement of the reason(s) for such 
findings.

    (b) Forwarding of applications to the Department of Commerce. If the 
Commissioner finds the application to be within the scope of the Act and 
these regulations, the Commissioner shall (1) assign a number to the 
application and (2) forward one copy to the Secretary of the Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS), and two copies, including the one 
that has been signed in the original, to the Director. The Commissioner 
shall retain one copy and return the remaining copy to the applicant 
stamped ``Accepted for Transmittal to the Department of Commerce.'' The 
applicant shall file the stamped copy of the form with the Port when 
formal entry of the article is made. If entry has already occurred

[[Page 12]]

under a claim of tariff item 851.60, the applicant (directly or through 
his/her agent) shall at the earliest possible date supply the stamped 
copy to the Port. Further instructions for entering instruments are 
contained in Sec. 301.8 of the regulations.
[47 FR 32517, July 28, 1982; 47 FR 34368, Aug. 9, 1982, as amended at 50 
FR 11501, Mar. 22, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 301.5  Processing of applications by the Department of Commerce.

    (a) Public notice and opportunity to present views. (1) Within 10 
days of receipt of an application from the Commissioner, the Director 
shall make a copy available for public inspection during ordinary 
business hours of the Department of Commerce. Unless the Director 
determines that an application has deficiencies which preclude 
consideration on its merits (e.g., insufficient description of intended 
purposes to rule on the scientific equivalency of the foreign instrument 
and potential domestic equivalents), he shall publish in the Federal 
Register a notice of the receipt of the application to afford all 
interested persons a reasonable opportunity to present their views with 
respect to the question ``whether an instrument or apparatus of 
equivalent scientific value for the purpose for which the article is 
intended to be used is being manufactured in the United States.'' The 
notice will include the application number, the name and address of the 
applicant, a description of the instrument(s) for which duty-free entry 
is requested, the name of the foreign manufacturer and a brief summary 
of the applicant's intended purposes extracted from the applicant's 
answer to question 7 of the application. In addition, the notice shall 
specify the date the application was accepted by the Commissioner for 
transmittal to the Department of Commerce.
    (2) If the Director determines that an application is incomplete or 
is otherwise deficient, he may request the applicant to supplement the 
application, as appropriate, prior to publishing the notice of 
application in the Federal Register. Supplemental information/material 
requested under this provision shall be supplied to the Director in two 
copies within 20 days of the date of the request and shall be subject to 
the certification contained in Question 11 of the form. Failure to 
provide the requested information on time shall result in a denial of 
the application without prejudice to resubmission.
    (3) Requirement for presentation of views (comments) by interested 
persons. Any interested person or government agency may make written 
comments to the Director with respect to the question whether an 
instrument of equivalent scientific value, for the purposes for which 
the foreign instrument is intended to be used, is being manufactured in 
the United States. Except for comments specified in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, comments should be in the form of supplementary answers to 
the applicable questions on the application form. Comments must be 
postmarked no later than 20 days from the date on which the notice of 
application is published in the Federal Register. In order to be 
considered, comments and related attachments must be submitted to the 
Director in duplicate; shall state the name, affiliation and address of 
the person submitting the comment; and shall specify the application to 
which the comment applies. In order to preserve the right to appeal the 
Director's decision on a particular application pursuant to Sec. 301.6 
of these regulations, a domestic manufacturer or other interested person 
must make timely comments on the application. Separate comments should 
be supplied on each application in which a person has an interest. 
However, brochures, pamphlets, printed specifications and the like, 
included with previous comments, if properly identified, may be 
incorporated by reference in subsequent comments. If the Director knows 
of the availability of a domestic instrument which may be comparable to 
the foreign instrument, he may: (i) Require the applicant to compare the 
domestic instrument with the foreign instrument; or (ii) compare the two 
instruments whether or not comments are received from a domestic 
manufacturer on the specific application.
    (4) Comments by domestic manufacturers. Comments of domestic 
manufacturers opposing the granting of an application should:

[[Page 13]]

    (i) Specify the domestic instrument considered to be scientifically 
equivalent to the foreign article for the applicant's specific intended 
purposes and include documentation of the domestic instrument's 
guaranteed specifications and date of availability.
    (ii) Show that the specifications claimed by the applicant in 
response to question 8 to be pertinent to the intended purpose can be 
equaled or exceeded by those of the listed domestic instrument(s) 
whether or not it has the same design as the foreign instrument; that 
the applicant's alleged pertinent specifications should not be 
considered pertinent within the meaning of Sec. 301.2(s) of the 
regulations for the intended purposes of the instrument described in 
response to question 7 of the application; or that the intended purposes 
for which the instrument is to be used do not qualify the instrument for 
duty-free consideration under the Act.
    (iii) Where the comments regarding paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and 
(a)(4)(ii) of this section relate to a particular accessory or optional 
device offered by a domestic manufacturer, cite the type, model or other 
catalog designation of the accessory device and include the 
specification therefor in the comments.
    (iv) Where the justification for duty-free entry is based on 
excessive delivery time, show whether:
    (A) The domestic instrument is as a general rule either produced for 
stock, produced on order, or custom-made and;
    (B) An instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value to the 
article, for the purposes described in response to question 7, could 
have been produced and delivered to the applicant within a reasonable 
time following the receipt of the order.
    (v) Indicate whether the applicant afforded the domestic 
manufacturer an opportunity to furnish an instrument or apparatus of 
equivalent scientific value to the article for the purposes described in 
response to question 7 and, if such be the case, whether the applicant 
submitted a formal invitation to bid that included the technical 
requirements of the applicant.
    (5) Untimely comments. Comments must be made on a timely basis to 
ensure their consideration by the Director and the technical 
consultants, and to preserve the commenting person's right to appeal the 
Director's decision on an application. The Director, in his discretion, 
may entertain comments filed untimely to the extent that they contain 
factual information, as opposed to arguments, explanations or 
recommendations.
    (6) Provision of general comments. A domestic manufacturer who does 
not wish to oppose duty-free entry of a particular application, but who 
desires to apprise the Director of the availability and capabilities of 
its instrument(s), may at any time supply documentation to the Director 
without reference to a particular application. Such documentation shall 
be routinely taken into account by the Director when applications 
involving comparable foreign instruments are received. The provision of 
general comments does not preserve the commentor's right to appeal the 
Director's decision on a particular application.
    (7) Provision of application to domestic manufacturers. To 
facilitate timely comments, the Director may furnish copies of certain 
applications to domestic manufacturers who intend to comment on 
applications, provided:
    (i) The manufacturer requests the service in writing;
    (ii) The manufacturer provides copies of current company literature 
regarding the domestic instrument and its guaranteed capabilities; and
    (iii) The manufacturer identifies the specific models or types of 
comparable foreign instrument(s) that it proposes to comment on. The 
Director may furnish for comment copies of the appropriate applications 
to the domestic manufacturer until the firm requests that the service be 
discontinued, provided the firm utilizes the service to supply written 
comments on applications. If the recipient of the service fails to avail 
itself of the opportunity to comment on appropriate applications for a 
period of one year, the Director may at his discretion discontinue the 
service. For reasons of cost and administrative burden, the service may 
be discontinued at the discretion of the Director. In such case the 
Director shall notify all recipients

[[Page 14]]

of the service in writing of such discontinuance.
    (b) Additions to the record. The Director may solicit from the 
applicant or from foreign or domestic manufacturers, and agents thereof, 
or any other person or Government agency considered by the Director to 
have competence on any issue pertaining to an application, any 
additional information the Director deems necessary to the rendering of 
a decision. The Director may attach such conditions and time limitations 
deemed appropriate upon the provision of such information and may draw 
appropriate inferences from a person's failure to provide the requested 
information.
    (c) Advice from technical consultants.
    (1) The Director shall consider any written advice from the 
Secretary of HHS, or his delegate, on the question whether a domestic 
instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instrument, for 
the purposes for which the instrument is intended to be used, is being 
manufactured in the United States.
    (2) After the comment period has ended (Sec. 301.5(a)(3)), the 
complete application and any comments received and related information 
are forwarded to the appropriate technical consultants for their written 
advice.
    (3) The technical consultants are requested to provide their written 
recommendation within 30 days of the date of transmittal. The technical 
consultants relied upon for advice may include, but are not limited to, 
the National Institutes of Health (delegated the function by the 
Secretary of HHS), the National Bureau of Standards and the National 
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
    (d) Criteria for the determinations of the Department of Commerce--
(1) Scientific equivalency. (i) The determination of scientific 
equivalency shall be based on a comparison of the pertinent 
specifications of the foreign instrument with similar pertinent 
specifications of comparable domestic instruments (see Sec. 301.2(s) for 
the definition of pertinent specification). Ordinarily, the Director 
will consider only those performance characteristics which are 
``guaranteed specifications'' within the meaning of Sec. 301.2(r) of 
this part. In no event, however, shall the Director consider performance 
capabilities superior to the manufacturer's guaranteed specifications or 
their equivalent. In making the comparison the Director may consider a 
reasonable combination of domestic instruments that combines two or more 
functions into an integrated unit if the combination of domestic 
instruments is capable of accomplishing the purposes for which the 
foreign instrument is intended to be used. If the Director finds that a 
domestic instrument possesses all of the pertinent specifications of the 
foreign instrument, he shall find that there is being manufactured in 
the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific value for such 
purposes as the foreign instrument is intended to be used. If the 
Director finds that the foreign instrument possesses one or more 
pertinent specifications not possessed by the comparable domestic 
instrument(s), the Director shall find that there is not being 
manufactured in the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific 
value to the foreign instrument for such purposes as the foreign 
instrument is intended to be used.
    (ii) Programs that may be undertaken at some unspecified future date 
shall not be considered in the Director's comparison. In making the 
comparison, the Director shall consider only the instrument and 
accompanying accessories described in the application and determined 
eligible by the U.S. Customs Service. The Director shall not consider 
the planned purchase of additional accessories or the planned conversion 
of the article at some unspecified future time for such programs.
    (iii) In order for the Director to make a determination with respect 
to the ``scientific equivalency'' of the foreign and domestic 
instruments, the applicant's intended purposes must include either 
scientific research or science-related educational programs. Instruments 
used exclusively for nonscientific purposes have no scientific value, 
thereby precluding the requisite finding by the Director with respect to 
``whether an instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value to 
such article, for the purposes for which the article is intended to be 
used, is being

[[Page 15]]

manufactured in the United States.'' In such cases the Director shall 
deny the application for the reason that the instrument has no 
scientific value for the purposes for which it is intended to be used. 
Examples of nonscientific purposes would be the use of an instrument in 
routine diagnosis or patient care and therapy (as opposed to clinical 
research); in teaching a nonscientific trade (e.g., printing, 
shoemaking, metalworking or other types of vocational training); in 
teaching nonscientific courses (e.g., music, home economics, journalism, 
drama); in presenting a variety of subjects or merely for presenting 
coursework, whether or not science related (e.g., video tape editors, 
tape recorders, projectors); and in conveying cultural information to 
the public (e.g., a planetarium in the Smithsonian Institution).
    (2) Manufactured in the United States. An instrument shall be 
considered as being manufactured in the United States if it is 
customarily ``produced for stock,'' ``produced on order'' or ``custom-
made'' within the United States. In determining whether a U.S. 
manufacturer is able and willing to produce an instrument, and have it 
available without unreasonable delay, the normal commercial practices 
applicable to the production and delivery of instruments of the same 
general category shall be taken into account, as well as other factors 
which in the Director's judgment are reasonable to take into account 
under the circumstances of a particular case. For example, in 
determining whether a domestic manufacturer is able to produce a custom-
made instrument, the Director may take into account the production 
experience of the domestic manufacturer including (i) the types, 
complexity and capabilities of instruments the manufacturer has 
produced, (ii) the extent of the technological gap between the 
instrument to which the application relates and the manufacturer's 
customary products, (iii) the manufacturer's technical skills, (iv) the 
degree of saturation of the manufacturer's production capability, and 
(v) the time required by the domestic manufacturer to produce the 
instrument to the purchaser's specification. Whether or not the domestic 
manufacturer has field tested or demonstrated the instrument will not, 
in itself, enter into the decision regarding the manufacturer's ability 
to manufacture an instrument. Similarly, in determining whether a 
domestic manufacturer is willing to produce an instrument, the Director 
may take into account the nature of the bid process, the manufacturer's 
policy toward manufacture of the product(s) in question, the minimum 
size of the manufacturer's production runs, whether the manufacturer has 
bid similar instruments in the past, etc. Also, if a domestic 
manufacturer was formally requested to bid an instrument, without 
reference to cost limitations and within a leadtime considered 
reasonable for the category of instrument involved, and the domestic 
manufacturer failed formally to respond to the request, for the purposes 
of this section the domestic manufacturer would not be considered 
willing to have supplied the instrument.
    (3) Burden of proof. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant 
to demonstrate that no instrument of equivalent scientific value for the 
purposes for which the foreign instrument is to be used is being 
manufactured in the United States. Evidence of applicant favoritism 
towards the foreign manufacturer (advantages not extended to domestic 
firms, such as additional lead time, know-how, methods, data on 
pertinent specifications or intended uses, results of research or 
development, tools, jigs, fixtures, parts, materials or test equipment) 
may be, at the Director's discretion, grounds for rejecting the 
application.
    (4) Excessive delivery time. Duty-free entry of the instrument shall 
be considered justified without regard to whether there is being 
manufactured in the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific 
value for the intended purposes if excessive delivery time for the 
domestic instrument would seriously impair the accomplishment of the 
applicant's intended purposes. For purposes of this section, (i) except 
when objective and convincing evidence is presented that, at the time of 
order, the actual delivery time

[[Page 16]]

would significantly exceed quoted delivery time, no claim of excessive 
delivery time may be made unless the applicant has afforded the domestic 
manufacturer an opportunity to quote and the delivery time for the 
domestic instrument exceeds that for the foreign instrument; and (ii) 
failure by the domestic manufacturer to quote a specific delivery time 
shall be considered a non-responsive bid (see Sec. 301.5(d)(2)). In 
determining whether the difference in delivery times cited by the 
applicant justifies duty-free entry on the basis of excessive delivery 
time, the Director shall take into account (A) the normal commercial 
practice applicable to the production of the general category of 
instrument involved; (B) the efforts made by the applicant to secure 
delivery of the instruments (both foreign and domestic) in the shortest 
possible time; and (C) such other factors as the Director finds relevant 
under the circumstances of a particular case.
    (e) Denial without prejudice to resubmission (DWOP). The Director 
may, at any stage in the processing of an application by the Department 
of Commerce, DWOP an application if the application contains any 
deficiency which, in the Director's judgment, prevents a determination 
on its merits. The Director shall state the deficiences of the 
application in a letter to the applicant in making the provisional 
denial.
    (1) The applicant has 60 days from the date of the DWOP to correct 
the cited deficiencies in the application unless a request for an 
extension of time for submission of the supplemental information has 
been received by the Director prior to the expiration of the 60-day 
period and is approved.
    (2) The written request (letter or telegram) for an extension should 
indicate the reasons for the request and the amount of additional time 
needed. If granted, extensions of time will generally be limited to 30 
days.
    (3) Resubmissions must reference the application number of the 
earlier application. The resubmission shall be made by letter and filed 
in quadruplicate with the Director. The record of a resubmitted 
application shall include the original submission on file with the 
Department. Any new material or information contained in a resubmission, 
which should address the specific deficiencies cited in the DWOP letter, 
should be clearly labeled and referenced to the applicable question(s) 
on the application form. The resubmission should be signed and dated by 
the individual in the applicant institution who signed the original 
application or, in his/her absence, the individual in the applicant 
institution under whose direction and control the foreign instrument 
will be used and who is familiar with the intended uses of the 
instrument. The resubmission must be for the instrument covered by the 
original application unless the DWOP letter specifies to the contrary. 
The resubmission shall be subject to the certification contained in 
question 11 on the original application.
    (4) If the applicant fails to resubmit within the applicable time 
period, the prior DWOP shall, irrespective of the merits of the case, 
result in a denial of the application.
    (5) The Director shall use the postmark date of the fully completed 
resubmission in determining whether the resubmission was made within the 
allowable time period. Certified or registered mail, or some other means 
which can unequivocally establish the date of mailing, is recommended.
    (6) The applicant may, at any time prior to the end of the 
resubmission period, notify the Director in writing that it does not 
intend to resubmit the application. Upon such notification, the 
application will be deemed to have been withdrawn. (See Sec. 301.5(g).)
    (7) Information provided in a resubmission that, in the judgment of 
the Director, contradicts or conflicts with information provided in a 
prior submission, or is not a reasonable extension of the information 
contained in the prior submission, shall not be considered in making the 
decision on an application that has been resubmitted. Accordingly, an 
applicant may elect to reinforce an orginal submission by elaborating in 
the resubmission on the description of the purposes contained in a prior 
submission and may supply additional examples, documentation and/or 
other clarifying detail, but the applicant shall not introduce new 
purposes

[[Page 17]]

or other material changes in the nature of the original application. The 
resubmission should address the specific deficiencies cited in the DWOP. 
The Director may draw appropriate inferences from the failure of an 
applicant to attempt to provide the information requested in the DWOP.
    (8) In the event an applicant fails to address the noted 
deficiencies in the response to the DWOP, the Director may deny the 
application.
    (9) Upon receipt of a responsive resubmission the Director shall 
publish a notice in the Federal Register citing the number of the 
earlier application, the name and address of the applicant institution, 
the instrument(s) involved, and any other information the Director deems 
relevant. The notice will also include the Federal Register citation for 
the original notice of application. Procedures applicable to comments on 
the processing of original applications shall thereafter apply.
    (f) Decisions on applications. The Director shall prepare a written 
decision granting or denying each application. However, when he deems 
appropriate, the Director may issue a consolidated decision on two or 
more applications. The Director shall promptly forward a copy of the 
decision to each applicant institution and to the Federal Register for 
publication.
    (g) Withdrawal of applications. The Director shall discontinue 
processing an application withdrawn by the applicant and shall publish 
notice of such withdrawal in the Federal Register. If at any time while 
its application is pending before the Director, either during the 
intital application or resubmission stage, an applicant cancels an order 
for the instrument to which the application relates or ceases to have a 
firm intention to order such instrument or apparatus, the institution 
shall promptly notify the Director. Such notification shall constitute a 
withdrawal. Withdrawals shall be considered as having been finally 
denied for purposes of Sec. 301.7(c) below.
    (h) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the 
Director's discretion at any stage of processing to insert into the 
record and consider in making his decision any information in the public 
domain which he deems relevant.

Sec. 301.6  Appeals.

    (a) An appeal from any decision made pursuant to Sec. 301.5(f) may 
be taken, in accordance with headnote 6(e) to part 4 of Schedule 8, only 
to the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and only on questions of 
law, within 20 days after publication of the decision in the Federal 
Register. If at any time while its application is under consideration by 
the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals on an appeal from a finding by 
the Director an institution cancels an order for the instrument to which 
the application relates or ceases to have a firm intention to order such 
instrument, the institution shall promptly notify the court.
    (b) An appeal may be taken by: (1) The institution which makes the 
application;
    (2) A person who, in the proceeding which led to the decision, 
timely represented to the Secretary of Commerce in writing that he/she 
manufactures in the United States an instrument of equivalent scientific 
value for the purposes for which the instrument to which the application 
relates is intended to be used;
    (3) The importer of the instrument, if the instrument to which the 
application relates has been entered at the time the appeal is taken; or
    (4) An agent of any of the foregoing.
    (c) Questions regarding appeal procedures should be addressed 
directly to the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, Clerks' 
Office, Washington, DC 20439.


<R05>
Sec. 301.7  Final disposition of an application.

    (a) Disposition of an application shall be final when 20 days have 
elapsed after publication of the Director's final decision in the 
Federal Register (see Sec. 301.6(a)) and no appeal has been taken 
pursuant to Sec. 301.6 of these regulations, of if such appeal has been 
taken, when final judgment is made and entered by the Court.

[[Page 18]]

    (b) The Director shall notify the Customs Port when disposition of 
an application becomes final. If the Director has not been advised of 
the port of entry of the instrument, or if entry has not been made when 
the decision on the application becomes final, the Director shall notify 
the Commissioner of final disposition of the application.
    (c) An instrument, the duty-free entry of which has been finally 
denied, may not be the subject of a new application from the same 
institution.


<R05>
Sec. 301.8  Instructions for entering instruments through U.S. Customs under tariff item 851.60.

    Failure to follow the procedures in this section may disqualify an 
instrument for duty-free entry notwithstanding an approval of an 
application on its merits by the Department of Commerce.
    (a) Entry procedures. (1) An applicant desiring duty-free entry of 
an instrument may make a claim at the time of entry of the instrument 
into the Customs territory of the United States that the instrument is 
entitled to duty-free classification under tariff item 851.60.
    (2) If no such claim is made the instrument shall be immediately 
classified without regard to tariff item 851.60, duty will be assessed, 
and the entry liquidated in the ordinary course.
    (3) If a claim is made for duty-free entry under tariff item 851.60, 
the entry shall be accepted without requiring a deposit of estimated 
duties provided that a copy of the form, stamped by Customs as accepted 
for transmittal to the Department of Commerce in accordance with 
Sec. 301.4(b), is filed simultaneously with the entry.
    (4) If a claim for duty-free entry under tariff item 851.60 is made 
but is not accompanied by a copy of the properly stamped form, a deposit 
of the estimated duty is required. Liquidation of the entry shall be 
suspended for a period of 180 days from the date of entry. On or before 
the end of this suspension period the applicant must file with the 
Customs Port a properly stamped copy of the form. In the event that the 
Customs Port does not receive a copy of the properly stamped form within 
180 days the instrument shall be classified and liquidated in the 
ordinary course, without regard to tariff item 851.60.
    (5) Entry of an instrument after the Director's approval of an 
application. Whenever an institution defers entry until after it 
receives a favorable final determination on the application for duty-
free entry of the instrument, the importer shall file with the entry of 
the instrument (i) the stamped copy of the form, (ii) the institution's 
copy of the favorable final determination and (iii) proof that a bona 
fide order for the merchandise was placed on or before the 60th day 
after the favorable decision became final pursuant to Sec. 301.7 of 
these regulations. Liquidation in such case shall be made under tariff 
item 851.60.
    (b) Normal Customs entry requirements. In addition to the above 
entry requirements mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
normal Customs entry requirements must be met. In most of the cases, the 
value of the merchandise will be such that the formal Customs entry 
requirements, which generally include the filing of a Customs entry 
bond, must be complied with. (For further information, see 19 CFR 142.3 
and 142.4 (TD-221).)
    (c) Late filing. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of 
Sec. 301.8 any document, form, or statement required by regulations in 
this section to be filed in connection with the entry may be filed at 
any time before liquidation of the entry becomes final, provided that 
failure to file at the time of entry or within the period for which a 
bond was filed for its production was not due to willful negligence or 
fraudulent intent. Liquidation of any entry becomes conclusive upon all 
persons if the liquidation is not protested in writing in accordance 
with 19 CFR part 174, or the necessary document substantiating duty-free 
entry is not produced in accordance with 19 CFR 10.112, within 90 days 
after notice of liquidation. Upon notice of such final and conclusive 
liquidation, the Department of Commerce will cease the processing of any 
pending application for duty-free entry of the subject article. In all 
other respects, the provisions of this section do not apply to 
Department of Commerce

[[Page 19]]

responsibilities and procedures for processing applications pursuant to 
other sections of these regulations.
    (d) Payment of duties. The applicant will be billed for payment of 
duties when Customs determines that such payment is due.


<R05>
Sec. 301.9  Uses and disposition of instruments entered under item 851.60, TSUS.

    (a) An instrument granted duty-free entry may be transferred from 
the applicant institution to another eligible institution provided the 
latter institution agrees not to use the instrument for commercial 
purposes within 5 years of the date of entry of the instrument. In such 
cases title to the instrument must be transferred directly between the 
institutions involved. An institution transferring a foreign instrument 
entered under item 851.60 within 5 years of its entry shall so inform 
the Customs Port in writing and shall include the following information:
    (1) The name and address of the transferring institution.
    (2) The name and address of the transferee.
    (3) The date of transfer.
    (4) A detailed description of the instrument.
    (5) The serial number of the instrument and any accompanying 
accessories.
    (6) The entry number, date of entry, and port of entry of the 
instrument.
    (b) Whenever the circumstances warrant, and occasionally in any 
event, the fact of continued use for 5 years for noncommercial purposes 
by the applicant institution shall be verified by Customs.
    (c) If an instrument is transferred in a manner other than specified 
above or is used for commercial purposes within 5 years of entry, the 
institution for which such instrument was entered shall promptly notify 
the Customs officials at the Port and shall be liable for the payment of 
duty in an amount determined on the basis of its condition as imported 
and the rate applicable to it.


<R05>
Sec. 301.10  Importation of repair components under item 851.65 for article previously entered under item 851.60.

    (a) An institution which owns an instrument entered under tariff 
item 851.60 and desires to enter repair components for such instrument 
under tariff item 851.65 may do so without regard to the application 
procedures applicable to entries under item 851.60 provided the 
institution certifies to the customs official at the port of entry upon 
entry of such components that they are needed repair components for an 
instrument owned by that institution and previously entered and 
classified under tariff item 851.60.
    (b) Instruments entered under item 851.60 and subsequently returned 
to the foreign manufacturer for repair, replacement or modification are 
not covered by tariff item 851.65, although they may, in certain 
circumstances, be considered non-dutiable under other Customs provisions 
(e.g., drawback within the specified period pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 
1313(c)). Such instruments, if classified as dutiable by Customs, may 
nevertheless be made the subject of a new application under tariff item 
851.60.

<R05>
Sec. 303.1  Purpose.

    (a) This part implements the responsibilities of the Secretaries of 
Commerce and the Interior (``the Secretaries'') under Pub. L. 97-446, 
enacted on 12 January 1983, which substantially amended Pub. L. 89-805, 
enacted 10 November 1966, amended by Pub. L. 94-88, enacted 8 August 
1975, and amended by Pub. L. 94-241, enacted 24 March 1976, and amended 
by Pub. L. 103-465, enacted 8 December 1994. The law provides for 
exemption from duty of territorial watches and watch movements without 
regard to the value of the foreign materials they contain, if they 
conform with the provisions of U.S. Legal Note 5 to Chapter 91 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``91/5''). 91/5 denies 
this benefit to articles containing any material which is the product of 
any country with respect to which Column 2 rates of duty apply; 
authorizes the Secretaries to establish the total quantity of such 
articles, provided that the quantity so established does not exceed 
10,000,000 units or one-ninth of apparent domestic consumption, 
whichever is greater, and provided also that the quantity is not 
decreased by more than ten percent nor increased by more than twenty 
percent (or to more than 7,000,000 units, whichever is greater) of the 
quantity established in the previous year.
    (b) The law directs the International Trade Commission to determine 
apparent domestic consumption for the preceding calendar year in the 
first year U.S. insular imports of watches and watch movements exceed 
9,000,000 units. 91/5 authorizes the Secretaries to establish 
territorial shares of the overall duty-exemption within specified 
limits; and provides for the annual allocation of the duty-exemption 
among insular watch producers equitably and on the basis of allocation 
criteria, including minimum assembly requirements, that will reasonably 
maximize the net amount of direct economic benefits to the insular 
possessions.
    (c) The amended law also provides for the issuance to producers of 
certificates entitling the holder (or any transferee) to obtain duty 
refunds on watches and watch movements and parts (except discrete 
watchcases) imported into the customs territory of the United States. 
The amounts of these certificates may not exceed specified percentages 
of the producers' verified creditable wages in the insular possessions 
(90% of wages paid for the production of the first 300,000 units and 
declining percentages, established by the Secretaries, of wages paid for 
incremental production up to 750,000 units by each producer) nor an 
aggregate annual amount for all certificates exceeding $5,000,000 
adjusted for growth by the ratio of the previous year's gross national 
product to the gross national product in 1982. Refund requests are 
governed by regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury. The 
Secretaries are authorized to issue regulations necessary to carry out 
their duties under Headnote 6 and may cancel or restrict the license or 
certificate of any insular manufacturer found violating the regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 303.2  Definitions and forms.

    (a) Definitions. Unless the context indicates otherwise:
    (1) Act means Pub. L. 97-446, enacted January 12, 1983 (19 U.S.C. 
1202), 96 Stat. 2329, as amended by Pub. L. 103-465, enacted on December 
8, 1994, 108 Stat. 4991.
    (2) Secretaries means the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of 
Interior or their delegates, acting jointly.
    (3) Director means the Director of the Statutory Import Programs 
Staff, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.
    (4) Sale or tranfer of a business means the sale or transfer of 
control, whether temporary or permanent, over a firm

[[Page 21]]

to which a duty-exemption has been allocated, to any other firm, 
corporation, partnership, person or other legal entity by any means 
whatsoever, including, but not limited to, merger and transfer of stock, 
assets or voting trusts.
    (5) New firm means an entity which is completely separate from and 
unassociated with (by way of ownership or control) any duty-exempt 
recipient in any territory. A new entrant is a new firm which has 
received an allocation.
    (6) Producer means a duty-exemption holder which has maintained its 
eligibility for further allocations by complying with these regulations.
    (7) Established industry means all producers, including new 
entrants, that have maintained their eligibility for further 
allocations.
    (8) Territories, territorial, and insular possessions refer to the 
insular possessions of the United States (i.e., the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
Guam, and American Samoa) and the Northern Mariana Islands.
    (9) Duty-exemption refers to the authorization of duty-free entry of 
a specified number of watches and watch movements into the Customs 
Territory of the United States.
    (10) Total annual duty-exemption refers to the entire quantity of 
watches or watch components which may enter duty-free into the customs 
territory of the United States from the territories under 91/5 in a 
calendar year, as determined by the Secretaries or by the International 
Trade Commission in accordance with the Act.
    (11) Territorial distribution refers to the apportionment by the 
Secretaries of the total annual duty-exemption among the separate 
territories; territorial share means the portion consigned to each 
territory by this apportionment.
    (12) Allocation refers to the distribution of all parts of a 
territorial share, or a portion thereof, among the several producers in 
a territory.
    (13) Creditable wages means all wages--up to the amount per person 
shown in Sec. 303.14(a)(1)(i)--paid to permanent residents of the 
territories employed in a firm's 91/5 watch and watch movement assembly 
operations, plus any wages paid for the repair of non-91/5 watches up to 
an amount equal to 50 percent of the firm's total creditable wages. 
Excluded, however, are wages paid for special services rendered to the 
firm by accountants, lawyers, or other professional personnel and for 
the repair of non-91/5 watches and movements to the extent that such 
wages exceed the foregoing ratio. Wages paid to persons engaged in both 
creditable and non-creditable assembly and repair activities may be 
credited proportionately provided the firm maintains production and 
payroll records adequate for the Departments' verification of the 
creditable portion.
    (14) Non-91/5 watches and watch movements include, but are not 
limited to, watches and movements which are liquidated as dutiable by 
the U.S. Customs Service; contain any material which is the product of 
any country with respect to which Column 2 rates of duty apply; are 
ineligible for duty-free treatment pursuant to law or regulation; or are 
units the assembly of which the Department has determined not to involve 
substantial and meaningful work in the territory (as elsewhere defined 
in these regulations).
    (15) Discrete movements and components means screws, parts, 
components and subassemblies not assembled together with another part, 
component or subassembly at the time of importation into the territory. 
(A mainplate containing set jewels or shock devices, together with other 
parts, would be considered a single discrete component, as would a 
barrel bridge subassembly.)
    (b) Forms--(1) ITA-334P ``Application for License to Enter Watches 
and Watch Movements into the Customs Territory of the United States.'' 
This form must be completed annually by all producers desiring to 
receive an annual allocation. It is also used, with appropriate special 
instructions for its completion, by new firms applying for duty-
exemptions.
    (2) ITA-333 ``License to Enter Watches and Watch Movements into the 
Customs Territory of the United States.'' This form is issued by the 
Director to producers who have received an allocation and constitutes 
authorization for issuing specific shipment permits by

[[Page 22]]

the territorial governments. It is also used to record the balance of a 
producer's remaining duty-exemptions after each shipment permit is 
issued.
    (3) ITA-340 ``Permit to Enter Watches and Watch Movements into the 
Customs Territory of the United States.'' This form may be obtained, by 
producers holding a valid license, from the territorial government or 
may be produced by the licensee in an approved computerized format or 
any other medium or format approved by the Departments of Commerce and 
the Interior. The completed form authorizes duty-free entry of a 
specified amount of watches or watch movements at a specified U.S. 
Customs port.
    (4) ITA-360P ``Certificate of Entitlement to Secure the Refund of 
Duties on Watches and Watch Movements.'' This document authorizes an 
insular producer to request the refund of duties on imports of watches, 
watch movements and parts therefor, with certain exceptions, up to a 
specified value. Certificates may be used to obtain duty refunds only 
when presented with a properly executed Form ITA-361P.
    (5) ITA-361P ``Request for Refund of Duties on Watches and Watch 
Movements.'' This form must be completed to obtain the refund of duties 
authorized by the Director through Form ITA-360P. After authentication 
by the Department of Commerce, it may be used for the refund of duties 
on items which were entered into the customs territory of the United 
States during a specified time period. Copies of the appropriate Customs 
entries must be provided with this form to establish a basis for issuing 
the claimed amounts. The forms may also be used to transfer all or part 
of the producer's entitlement to another party. (See Sec. 303.12.)

(The information collection requirements in paragraph (b)(1) were 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0625-0040. The information collection requirements in paragraphs (b) (4) 
through (6) were approved under control number 0625-0134)

<R05>
Sec. 303.3  Determination of the total annual duty-exemption.

    (a) Procedure for determination. If, after considering the 
productive capacity of the territorial watch industry and the economic 
interests of the territories, the Secretaries determine that the amount 
of the total annual duty-exemption, or the territorial shares of the 
total amount, should be changed, they shall publish in the Federal 
Register a proposed limit on the quantity of watch units which may enter 
duty-free into the customs territory of the United States and proposed 
territorial shares thereof and, after considering comments, establish 
the limit and shares by Federal Register notice. If the Secretaries take 
no action under this section, they shall make the allocations in 
accordance with the limit and shares last established by this procedure.
    (b) Standards for determination. (1) Notwithstanding paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, the limit established for any year may be 
7,000,000 units if the limit established for the preceding year was a 
smaller amount.
    (2) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, the total annual duty-
exemption shall not be decreased by more than 10% of the quantity 
established for the preceding calendar year, or increased, if the 
resultant total is larger than 7,000,000, by more than 20% of the 
quantity established for the calendar year immediately preceding.
    (3) The Secretaries shall determine the limit after considering the 
interests of the territories; the domestic or international trade policy 
objectives of the United States; the need to maintain the competitive 
nature of the territorial industry; the total contribution of the 
industry to the economic well-being of the territories; and the 
territorial industry's utilization of the total duty-exemption 
established in the preceding year.
    (c) Determinations based on consumption. (1) The Secretaries shall 
notify the International Trade Commission whenever they have reason to 
believe duty-free watch imports from the territories will exceed 
9,000,000 units, or whenever they make a preliminary determination that 
the total annual

[[Page 23]]

duty-exemption should exceed 10,000,000 units.
    (2) In addition to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Secretaries shall not establish a limit exceeding one-ninth of 
apparent domestic consumption if such consumption, as determined by 
International Trade Commission, exceeds 90 million units.
[49 FR 17740, Apr. 25, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 7170, Feb. 21, 1985; 50 
FR 43568, Oct. 28, 1985; 53 FR 52994, Dec. 30, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 303.4  Determination of territorial distribution.

    (a) Procedure for determination. The Secretaries shall determine the 
territorial shares concurrently with their determination of the total 
annual duty exemption, and in the same manner (see Sec. 303.3, above).
    (b) Standards for determination--(1) Limitations. A territorial 
share may not be reduced by more than 500,000 units in any calendar 
year. No territorial share shall be less than 500,000 units.
    (2) Criteria for setting precise quantities. The Secretaries shall 
determine the precise quantities after considering, inter alia, the 
territorial capacity to produce and ship watch units. The Secretaries 
shall further bear in mind the aggregate benefits to the territories, 
such as creditable wages paid, creditable wages per unit exported, and 
corporate income tax payments.
    (3) Limitations on reduction of share. The Secretaries shall not 
reduce a territory's share if its producers use 85% or more of the 
quantity distributed to that territory in the immediately preceding 
year, except in the case of a major increase or decrease in the number 
of producers in a territory or if they believe that a territorial 
industry will decrease production by more than 15% from the total of the 
preceding year.
    (4) Standby redistribution authority. The Secretaries may 
redistribute territorial shares if such action is warranted by 
circumstances unforeseen at the time of the initial distributions, such 
as that a territory will use less than 80% of its total by the end of a 
calendar year, or if a redistribution is necessary to maintain the 
competitive nature of the territorial industries.
[49 FR 17740, Apr. 25, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 7170, Feb. 21, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 303.5  Application for annual allocations of duty-exemptions.

    (a) Application forms (ITA-334P) shall be furnished to producers by 
January 1, and must be completed and returned to the Director no later 
than January 31, of each calendar year.
    (b) All data supplied are subject to verification by the Secretaries 
and no allocation shall be made to producer until the Secretaries are 
satisfied that the data are accurate. To verify the data, 
representatives of the Secretaries shall have access to relevant company 
records including:
    (1) Work sheets used to answer all questions on the application 
form;
    (2) Original records from which such data are derived;
    (3) Records pertaining to ownership and control of the company and 
to the satisfaction of eligibility requirements of duty-free treatment 
of its product by the U.S. Customs Service;
    (4) Records pertaining to corporate income taxes, gross receipts 
taxes and excise taxes paid by each producer in the territories on the 
basis of which a portion of each producer's annual allocation is or may 
be predicated;
    (5) Customs, bank, payroll, and production records;
    (6) Records on purchases of components and sales of movements, 
including proof of payment; and
    (7) Any other records in the possession of the parent or affiliated 
companies outside the territory pertaining to any aspect of the 
producer's 91/5 watch assembly operation.
    (c) Data verification shall be performed in the territories, unless 
other arrangements satisfactory to the Departments are made in advance, 
by the Secretaries' representatives by the end of February of each 
calendar year. In the event a company cannot substantiate the data in 
its application before allocations must be calculated, the Secretaries 
shall determine which data will be used.
    (d) Records subject to the requirements of paragraph (b), above, 
shall be

[[Page 24]]

retained for a period of two years following their creation.
[49 FR 17740, Apr. 25, 1984, as amended at 50 FR 43568, Oct. 28, 1985; 
53 FR 52994, Dec. 30, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 303.6  Allocation and reallocation of exemptions among producers.

    (a) Interim allocations. As soon as practicable after January 1 of 
each year the Secretaries shall make an interim allocation to each 
producer equaling 70% of the number of watch units it has entered duty-
free into the customs territory of the United States during the first 
eight months of the preceding calendar year, or any lesser amount 
requested in writing by the producer. The Secretaries may also issue a 
lesser amount if, in their judgment, the producer might otherwise 
receive an interim allocation in an amount greater than the producer's 
probable annual allocation. In calculating the interim allocations, the 
Director shall count only duty-free watches and watch movements verified 
by the U.S. Customs Service as having been entered on or before August 
31 of the preceding year. Interim allocations shall not be published.
    (b) Annual allocations. (1) By March 1 of each year the Secretaries 
shall make annual allocations to the producers in accordance with the 
allocation formula based on data supplied in their annual application 
(Form ITA-334P) and verified by the Secretaries.
    (2) The excess of a producer's duty-exemption earned under the 
allocation criteria over the amount formally requested by the producer 
shall be considered to have been relinquished voluntarily (see paragraph 
(f) below). A producer's request may be modified by written 
communication received by the Secretaries by February 28, or, at the 
discretion of the Secretaries, before the annual allocations are made. 
An allocation notice shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (c) Supplemental allocations. At the request of a producer, the 
Secretaries may supplement a producer's interim allocation if the 
Secretaries determine the producer's interim allocation will be used 
before the Secretaries can issue the annual allocation. Allocations to 
supplement a producer's annual allocation shall be made under the 
reallocation provisions prescribed below.
    (d) Allocations to new entrants. In making interim and annual 
allocations to producers selected the preceding year as new entrants, 
the Secretaries shall take into account that such producers will not 
have had a full year's operation as a basis for computation of its duty-
exemption. The Secretaries may make an interim or annual allocation to a 
new entrant even if the firm did not operate during the preceding 
calendar year.
    (e) Special allocations. A producer may request a special allocation 
if unusual circumstances kept it from making duty-free shipments at a 
level comparable with its past record. In considering such requests, the 
Secretaries shall take into account the firm's proposed assembly 
operations; its record in contributing to the territorial economy; and 
its intentions and capacity to make meaningful contributions to the 
territory. They shall also first determine that the amount of the 
special allocation requested will not significantly affect the amounts 
allocated to other producers pursuant to Sec. 303.6(b)(1).
    (f) Reallocations. Duty-exemptions may become available for 
reallocation as a result of cancellation or reduction for cause, 
voluntary relinquishment or nonplacement of duty-exemption set aside for 
new entrants. At the request of a producer, the Secretaries may 
reallocate such duty-exemptions among the remaining producers who can 
use additional quantities in a manner judged best for the economy of the 
territories. The Secretaries shall consider such factors as the wage and 
income tax contributions of the respective producers during the 
preceding year and the nature of the producer's present assembly 
operations. In addition, the Secretaries may consider other factors 
which, in their judgment, are relevant to determining that applications 
from new firms, in lieu of reallocations, should be considered for part 
or all of unused portions of the total duty exemptions. Such factors may 
include:
    (1) The ability of the established industry to use the duty-
exemption;

[[Page 25]]

    (2) Whether the duty-exemption is sufficient to support new entrant 
operations;
    (3) The impact upon the established industry if new entrants are 
selected, particularly with respect to the effect on local employment, 
tax contributions to the territorial government, and the ability of the 
established industry to maintain satisfactory production levels; and
    (4) Whether additional new entrants offer the best prospect for 
adding economic benefits to the territory.
    (g) Section 303.14 of this part contains the criteria and formulae 
used by the Secretaries in calculating each watch producer's annual 
watch duty-exemption allocation, and other special rules or provisions 
the Secretaries may periodically adopt to carry out their 
responsibilities in a timely manner while taking into account changing 
circumstances. References to duty-exemptions, unless otherwise 
indicated, are to the amount available for reallocation in the current 
calendar year. Specifications of or references to data or bases used in 
the calculation of current year allocations (e.g., economic 
contributions and shipments) are, unless indicated otherwise, those 
which were generated in the previous year.
    (h) The Secretaries may propose changes to Sec. 303.14 at any time 
they consider it necessary to fulfill their responsibilities. Normally, 
such changes will be proposed towards the end of each calendar year. 
Interested parties shall be given an opportunity to submit written 
comments on proposed changes.

61 FR 55885, Oct. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 303.7  Issuance of licenses and shipment permits.

    (a) Issuance of Licenses (ITA-333). (1) Concurrently with annual 
allocations under Sec. 303.5 the Director shall issue a non-transferable 
license (Form ITA-333) to each producer. The Director shall also issue a 
replacement license if a producer's allocation is reduced pursuant to 
Sec. 303.6.
    (2) Annual duty-exemption licenses shall be for only that portion of 
a producer's annual duty-exemption not previously licensed.
    (3) If a producer's duty-exemption has been reduced, the Director 
shall not issue a replacement license for the reduced amount until the 
producer's previous license has been received for cancellation by the 
Director.
    (4) A producer's license shall be used in their entirety, except 
when they expire or are cancelled, in order of their date of issuance, 
i.e., an interim license must be completely used before shipment permits 
can be issued against an interim supplemental license.
    (5) Outstanding licenses issued by the Director automatically expire 
at midnight, December 31, of each calendar year. No unused allocation of 
duty-exemption may be carried over into the subsequent calendar year.
    (6) The Director shall ensure that all licenses issued are 
conspicuously marked to show the type of license issued, the identity of 
the producer, and the year for which the license is valid. All licenses 
shall bear the signature of the Director.
    (7) Each producer is responsible for the security of its licenses. 
The loss of a license shall be reported immediately to the Director. 
Defacing, tampering with, and unauthorized use of a license are 
forbidden.
    (b) Shipment Permit Requirements (ITA-340). (1) Producers may obtain 
shipment permits from the territorial government officials designated by 
the Governor. Permits may also be produced in any computerized or other 
format or medium approved by the Departments. The permit is for use 
against a producer's valid duty-exemption license and a permit must be 
completed for every duty-free shipment.
    (2) Each permit must specify the license and permit number, the 
number of watches and watch movements included in the shipment, the 
unused balance remaining on the producer's license, pertinent shipping 
information and must have the certification statement signed by an 
official of the licensee's company. A copy of the completed permit must 
be sent electronically or taken to the designated territorial government 
officials, no later than the day of shipment, for confirmation that the 
producer's duty-exemption license has

[[Page 26]]

not been exceeded and that the permit is properly completed.
    (3) The permit (form ITA-340) shall be filed with Customs along with 
the other required entry documents to receive duty-free treatment unless 
the importer or its representative clears the documentation through 
Customs' automated broker interface. Entries made electronically do not 
require the submission of a permit to Customs, but the shipment data 
must be maintained as part of a producer's recordkeeping 
responsibilities for the period prescribed by Customs' recordkeeping 
regulations. U.S. Customs Service Import Specialists may request the 
documentation they deem appropriate to substantiate claims for duty-free 
treatment, allowing a reasonable amount of time for the importer to 
produce the permit.

Sec. 303.8  Maintenance of duty-exemption entitlements.

    (a) The Secretaries may order a producer to show cause within 30 
days of receipt of the order why the duty-exemption to which the firm 
would otherwise be entitled should not be cancelled, in whole or in 
part, if:
    (1) At any time after June 30 of the calendar year:
    (i) A producer's assembly and shipment record provides a reasonable 
basis to conclude that the producer will use less than 80 percent of its 
total allocation by the end of the calendar year, and
    (ii) The producer refuses a request from the Departments to 
relinquish that portion of its allocation which they conclude will not 
be used; or
    (2) A producer fails to satisfy or fulfill any term, condition or 
representation, whether undertaken by itself or prescribed by the 
Departments, upon which receipt of allocation has been predicated or 
upon which the Departments have relied in connection with the sale or 
transfer of a business together with its allocation; or
    (3) A producer, in the judgment of the Secretaries, has failed to 
make a meaningful contribution to the territory for a period of two or 
more consecutive calendar years, when compared with the performance of 
the duty-free watch assembly industry in the territory as a whole. This 
comparison shall include the producer's quantitative use of its 
allocations, amount of direct labor employed in the assembly of watches 
and watch movements, and the net amount of corporate income taxes paid 
to the government of the territory. If the producer fails to satisfy the 
Secretaries as to why such action should not be taken, the firm's 
allocation shall be reduced or cancelled, whichever is appropriate under 
the show-cause order. The eligibility of a firm whose allocation has 
been cancelled to receive further allocations may also be terminated.
    (b) The Secretaries may also issue a show-cause order to reduce or 
cancel a producer's allocation or production incentive certificate (see 
Sec. 303.12, below), as appropriate, or to declare the producer 
ineligible to receive an allocation or certificate if it violates any 
regulation in this part, uses a form, license, permit, or certificate in 
an unauthorized manner, or fails to provide information or data required 
by these regulations or requested by the Secretaries or their delegates 
in the performance of their responsibilities.
    (c) If a firm's allocation is reduced or cancelled, or if a firm 
voluntarily relinquishes a part of its allocation, the Secretaries may:
    (1) Reallocate the allocation involved among the remaining producers 
in a manner best suited to contribute to the economy of the territory;
    (2) Reallocate the allocation or part thereof to a new entrant 
applicant; or
    (3) Do neither of the above if deemed in the best interest of the 
territories and the established industry.

Sec. 303.9  Restrictions on the transfer of duty-exemptions.

    (a) The sale or transfer of a duty-exemption from one firm to 
another shall not be permitted.
    (b) The sale or transfer of a business together with its duty-
exemption shall

[[Page 27]]

be permitted with prior written notification to the Departments. Such 
notification shall be accompanied by certifications and representations, 
as appropriate, that:
    (1) If the transferee is a subsidiary of or in any way affiliated 
with any other company engaged in the production of watch movements 
components being offered for sale to any territorial producer, the 
related company or companies will continue to offer such watch and watch 
movement components on equal terms and conditions to all willing buyers 
and shall not engage in any practice, in regard to the sale of 
components, that competitively disadvantages the non-affiliated 
territorial producers vis-a-vis the territorial subsidiary;
    (2) The sale or transfer price for the business together with its 
duty-exemption does not include the capitalization of the duty-exemption 
per se;
    (3) The transferee is neither directly or indirectly affiliated with 
any other territorial duty-exemption holder in any territory;
    (4) The transferee will not modify the watch assembly operations of 
the duty-exemption firm in a manner that will significantly diminish its 
economic contributions to the territory.
    (c) At the request of the Departments, the transferee shall permit 
representatives of the Departments to inspect whatever records are 
necessary to establish to their satisfaction that the certifications and 
representations contained in paragraph (b) of this section have been or 
are being met.
    (d) Any transferee who is either unwilling or unable to make the 
certifications and representations specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section shall secure the Departments' approval in advance of the sale or 
transfer of the business together with its duty-exemption. The request 
for approval shall specify which of the certifications specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section the firm is unable or unwilling to make, 
and give reasons why such fact should not constitute a basis for the 
Departments' disapproval of the sale or transfer.

<R05>
Sec. 303.12  Issuance and use of production incentive certificates.

    (a) Issuance of certificates. (1) Certificates of Entitlement, Form 
ITA-360, shall be issued before March 1 of the current year.
    (2) Certificates shall not be issued to more than one company in the 
territories owned or controlled by the same corporate entity.
    (b) Securities and handling of certificates. (1) Certificate holders 
are responsible for the security of the certificates. The certificates 
shall be kept at the territorial address of the insular producer or at 
another location having the advance approval of the Departments.
    (2) All refund requests made pursuant to the certificates shall be 
entered on the reverse side of the certificate.
    (3) Certificates shall be returned by registered, certified or 
express carrier mail to the Departments when:
    (i) A refund is requested which exhausts the entitlement on the face 
of the certificate,
    (ii) The certificate expires, or
    (iii) The Departments request their return with good cause.
    (4) Certificate entitlements may be transferred according to the 
procedures described in (c) of this section.
    (c) The use and transfer of certificate entitlements. (1) Insular 
producers issued a certificate may request a refund by executing a Form 
ITA-361P (see Sec. 303.2(b)(5) and the instructions on the form). After 
authentication by the Department of Commerce, the Form ITA-361P may be 
used to obtain duty refunds on watch movements, watches, and parts 
therefor. Duties on watchcases not containing a movement and on articles 
containing any material which is the product of a country with respect 
to which Column 2 rates of duty apply may not be refunded. Articles for 
which duty refunds are claimed must have entered the customs territory 
of the United States during the two-year period prior to the issue date 
of the certificate or during the one-year period the certificate remains 
valid. Copies of the appropriate Customs entries must be provided with 
the refund request in order to establish a

[[Page 28]]

basis for issuing the claimed amounts. Certification regarding drawback 
claims and liquidated refunds relating to the presented entries is 
required from the claimant on the form.
    (2) Regulations issued by the U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Department 
of the Treasury, govern the refund of duties under Pub. L. 97-446, as 
amended by Public Law 103-465. If the Departments receive information 
from the Customs Service that a producer has made unauthorized use of 
any official form, they shall cancel the affected certificate.
    (3) The insular producer may transfer a portion of all of its 
certificate entitlement to another party by entering in block C of Form 
ITA-361P the name and address of the party.
    (4) After a Form ITA-361P transferring a certificate entitlement to 
a party other than the certificate holder has been authenticated by the 
Department of Commerce, the form may be exchanged for any consideration 
satisfactory to the two parties. In all cases, authenticated forms shall 
be transmitted to the certificate holder or its authorized custodian for 
disposition (see paragraph (b) above).
    (5) All disputes concerning the use of an authenticated Form ITA-
361P shall be referred to the Departments for resolution. Any party 
named on an authenticated Form ITA-361P shall be considered an 
``interested party'' within the meaning of Sec. 303.13 of this part.

Sec. 303.13  Appeals.

    (a) Any official decision or action relating to the allocation of 
duty-exemptions or to the issuance or use of production incentive 
certificates may be appealed to the Secretaries by any interested party. 
Such appeals must be received within 30 days of the date on which the 
decision was made or the action taken in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Interested parties may 
petition for the issuance of a rule, or amendment or repeal of a rule 
issued by the Secretaries. Interested parties may also petition for 
relief from the application of any rule on the basis of hardship or 
extraordinary circumstances resulting in the inability of the petitioner 
to comply with the rule.
    (b) Petitions shall bear the name and post office address of the 
petitioner and the name and address of the principal attorney or 
authorized representative (if any) for the party concerned. They shall 
be addressed to the Secretaries and filed in one original and two copies 
with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Import Administration, 
International Trade Administration, Washington, D.C. 20230, Attention: 
Statutory Import Programs Staff. Petitions shall contain the following:
    (1) A reference to the decision, action or rule which is the subject 
of the petition;
    (2) A short statement of the interest of the petitioner;
    (3) A statement of the facts as seen by the petitioner;
    (4) The petitioner's argument as to the points of law, policy of 
fact. In cases where policy error is contended, the alleged error 
together with the policy the submitting party advocates as the correct 
one should be described in full;
    (5) A conclusion specifying the action that the petitioner believes 
the Secretaries should take.
    (c) The Secretaries may at their discretion schedule a hearing and 
invite the participation of other interested parties.
    (d) The Secretaries shall communicate their decision which shall be 
final, to the petitioner by registered mail.
    (e) If the outcome of any petition materially affects the amount of 
the petitioner's allocation and if the Secretaries' consideration of the 
petition continues during the calculation of the annual allocations, the 
Secretaries shall set aside a portion of the affected territorial share 
in an amount which, in their judgment, protects the petitioner's 
interest and shall allocate the remainder among the other producers.

Sec. 303.14  Allocation factors and miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) The allocation formula. (1) Except as provided in (a)(2) of this 
section, the territorial shares (excluding any amount set aside for 
possible new entrants) shall be allocated among the several producers in 
each territory in accordance with the following formula:
    (i) Fifty percent of the territorial share shall be allocated on the 
basis of the net dollar amount of economic contributions to the 
territory consisting of the dollar amount of creditable wages, up to a 
maximum of $35,000 per person, paid by each producer to territorial 
residents, plus the dollar amount of income taxes (excluding penalty and 
interest payments and deducting any income tax refunds and subsidies 
paid by the territorial government), and
    (ii) Fifty percent of the territorial share shall be allocated on 
the basis of the number of units of watches and watch movements 
assembled in the territory and entered by each producer duty-free into 
the customs territory of the United States.
    (2) If there is only one producer in a territory, the entire 
territorial share, excluding any amount set aside for possible new 
entrants, may be allocated without recourse to any distributive formula.
    (b) Minimum assembly requirements and prohibition of preferential 
supply relationship. (1) No insular watch movement or watch may be 
entered free of duty into the customs territory of the United States 
unless the producer used 30 or more discrete parts and components to 
assemble a mechanical watch movement and 33 or more discrete parts and 
components to assemble a mechanical watch.
    (2) Quartz analog watch movements must be assembled from parts 
knocked down to the maximum degree possible for the technical 
capabilities of the insular industry as a whole. The greatest degree of 
disassembly specified, for each manufacturer's brand and model, by any 
producer in any territory purchasing such brands and models shall 
constitute the disassembly required as a minimum for the industry as a 
whole.
    (3) Watch movements and watches assembled from components with a 
value of more than $35 for watch movements and $200 for watches shall 
not be eligible for duty-exemption upon entry into the U.S. Customs 
territory. Value means the value of the merchandise plus all charges and 
costs incurred up to the last point of shipment (i.e., prior to entry of 
the parts and components into the territory).
    (4) No producer shall accept from any watch parts and components 
supplier advantages and preferences which might result in a more 
favorable competitive position for itself vis-a-vis other territorial 
producers relying on the same supplier. Disputes under this paragraph 
may be resolved under the appeals procedures contained in 
Sec. 303.13(b).
    (c) Calculation of the value of production incentive certificates. 
(1) The value of each producer's certificate shall equal the producer's 
average creditable wages per unit shipped (including non-91/5 units as 
provided for in Sec. 303.2(a)(13)) multiplied by the sum of:
    (i) The number of units shipped up to 300,000 units times a factor 
of 90%; plus
    (ii) Incremental units shipped up to 450,000 units times a factor of 
85%; plus
    (iii) Incremental units shipped up to 600,000 times a factor of 80%; 
plus
    (iv) Incremental shipments up to 750,000 units times a factor of 
75%.
    (2) The Departments may make adjustments for these data in the 
manner set forth in Sec. 303.5(c).
    (d) New entrant invitations. (1) Applications from new firms are 
invited for the territorial shares of American Samoa and the Northern 
Mariana Islands.
    (2) Applications from new firms are invited for the unused portion 
of the Virgin Islands and Guam territorial shares.
    (e) Territorial shares. The shares of the total duty exemption are 
3,100,000 for the Virgin Islands, 500,000 for Guam, 500,000 for American 
Samoa, and 500,000 for the Northern Mariana Islands.

Sec. 310.1  Background and purpose.

    The regulations in this part are issued under the authority of Pub. 
L. 91-269 (84 Stat. 271, 22 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.) which establishes an 
orderly procedure for Federal Government recognition of, and 
participation in, international expositions to be held in the United 
States. The Act provides, inter alia, that Federal recognition of an 
exposition is to be granted upon a finding by the President that such 
recognition will be in the national interest. In making this finding, 
the President is directed to consider, among other factors, a report 
from the Secretary of Commerce as to the purposes and reasons for an 
exposition and the extent of financial and other support to be provided 
by the State and local officials and business and community leaders 
where the exposition is to be held, and a report by the Secretary of 
State to determine whether the exposition is qualified for registration 
under Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) rules. The BIE is an 
international organization established by the Paris Convention of 1928 
(T.I.A.S. 6548 as amended by T.I.A.S. 6549) to regulate the conduct and 
scheduling of international expositions in which foreign nations are 
officially invited to participate. The BIE divides international 
expositions into different categories and types and requires each member 
nation to observe specified minimum time intervals in scheduling each of 
these categories and types of expositions.<SUP>1</SUP> Under BIE rules, 
member nations may not ordinarily participate in an international 
exposition unless such exposition has been approved by the BIE. The 
United States became a member of the BIE on April 30, 1968, upon 
ratification of the Paris Convention by the U.S. Senate (114 Cong. Rec. 
11012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    <SUP>1</SUP> The BIE defines a General Exposition of the First 
Category as an exposition dealing with progress achieved in a particular 
field applying to several branches of human activity at which the 
invited countries are obligated to construct national pavilions. A 
General Exposition of the Secondary Category is a similar exposition at 
which invited countries are not authorized to construct national 
pavilions, but occupy space provided by the exposition sponsors. Special 
Category Expositions are those dealing only with one particular 
technique, raw material, or basic need.
    The BIE frequency rules require that an interval of 15 years must 
elapse between General Expositions of the First Category held in one 
country. General Expositions of the Second Category require an interval 
of 10 years. An interval of 5 years must ordinarily elapse between 
Special Category Expositions of the same kind in one country or three 
months between Special Category Expositions of different kinds. These 
frequency intervals are computed from the date of the opening of the 
exposition.
    More detailed BIE classification criteria and regulations are 
contained in the Paris Convention of 1928, as amended in 1948 and 1966. 
Applicants not having a copy of the text of this convention may obtain 
one by writing the Director. (The Convention may soon be amended by a 
Protocol which has been approved by the BIE and ratified by the United 
States. This amendment would increase authorized frequencies or 
intervals for BIE approved expositions.)


Federal participation in a recognized international exposition requires 
a specific authorization by the Congress, upon a finding by the 
President that such participation would be in the national interest. The 
Act provides for the transmission to Congress of a participation 
proposal by the President.

[[Page 31]]

This proposal transmits to the Congress information regarding the 
exposition, including a statement that it has been registered by the BIE 
and a plan for Federal participation prepared by the Secretary of 
Commerce in cooperation with other interested Federal departments and 
agencies.

Sec. 310.4  Action on application.

    (a) Upon receipt of an application, the Director will analyze the 
application and all accompanying exhibits to insure compliance with the 
provisions of Sec. 310.3 and report his findings with respect thereto to 
the Secretary.
    (b) If more than one applicant applies for Federal recognition for 
expositions to be held within three years or less of each other, the 
applications will be reviewed concurrently by the Director. The 
following standards will be considered in determining which if any of 
the competing applicants will be recommended for Federal recognition:
    (1) The order of receipt of the applications by the Director, 
complete with all exhibits required by Sec. 310.3.
    (2) The financial plans of the applications. Primary consideration 
will be given to those applications which do not require Federal 
financing for exposition development. This does not extend to funding 
for a Federal pavilion, if one is desired.
    (3) The relative merit of the applications in terms of their 
qualifications as tourism destination sites, both with respect to 
existing facilities and those facilities planned for the proposed 
exposition. If necessary, to assist in making this determination, the 
Director will appoint a panel of travel industry experts representing 
tour developers, the transportation, entertainment and hotel/motel 
industries for the purpose of studying the competing applications and 
reporting to the Director its views as to which proposed site best meets 
the above criteria. If such a panel is deemed necessary, the provisions 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (86 Stat. 770, 5 U.S.C. App. I) 
will be applicable.
    (c) In analyzing the applications, the Director may hold public 
hearings with the objective of clarifying issues that might be raised by 
the application. If desired, the Director may utilize the services of an 
examiner.
    (d) If the Director, in his discretion, decides to hold a public 
hearing, notice of such hearing shall be published in the Federal 
Register, and a copy of the notice shall be furnished to local 
newspapers. The notice shall state the subject to be considered and when 
and where the hearing will be held, specifically designating the date, 
hour, and place.
    (e) The following general procedure shall govern the conduct of 
public hearings: (1) Stenographic minutes of the proceedings shall be 
made; (2) the names and addresses of all parties present or represented 
at the hearing shall be recorded; and (3) the Director or Examiner shall 
read aloud for the record and for the benefit of the public such parts 
of the Act and of these regulations as bear on the application. He shall 
also read aloud for the record and for the benefit of the public such 
other important papers, or extracts therefrom, as may be necessary for a 
full understanding of the issues which require clarification. The 
Director or Examiner shall impress upon the parties in attendance at the 
public hearing, and shall specifically state at the commencement of the 
hearing, that the hearing is not adversary in nature and that the sole 
objective thereof is to clarify issues that might have been raised by 
the application.
    (f) Statements of interested parties may be presented orally at the 
hearing, or submitted in writing for the record.
    (g) Within six months after receipt of a fully completed application 
and/or the adjournment of the public hearing, the Director shall submit 
his report containing his findings on the application to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 310.5  Report of the Secretary on Federal recognition.

    If the Director's report recommends Federal recognition, the 
Secretary, within a reasonable time, shall submit a report to the 
President.
    (a) The Secretary's report shall include: (1) An evaluation of the 
purposes and reasons for the exposition; and (2) a determination as to 
whether guaranteed financial and other support has been secured by the 
exposition from affected State and local governments and from business 
and civic leaders of the region and others in amounts sufficient to 
assure the successful development and progress of the exposition.
    (b) Based on information from, and coordination with the Department 
of Commerce the Secretary of State shall also file a report with the 
President

[[Page 34]]

that the exposition qualifies for recognition by the BIE.


<R05>
Sec. 310.6  Recognition by the President.

    If the President concurs in the favorable reports from the 
Secretaries of State and Commerce, he may grant Federal recognition to 
the exposition by indicating his concurrence to the two Secretaries and 
authorizing them to seek BIE registration.


<R05>
Sec. 310.7  Statement for Federal participation.

    If Federal participation in the exposition, as well as Federal 
recognition thereof is desired, the applicant shall in a statement to 
the Director outline the nature of the Federal participation envisioned, 
including whether construction of a Federal pavilion is contemplated. 
(It should be noted, however, that before Federal participation can be 
authorized by the Congress under the Act, the exposition must have (i) 
met the criteria for Federal recognition and be so recognized, and (ii) 
been registered by the BIE. Although applicants need not submit such a 
statement until these prerequisites are satisfied, they are encouraged 
to do so.) Where the desired Federal participation includes a request 
for construction of a Federal pavilion, the statement shall be 
accompanied by the following exhibits:

    1. Exhibit No. 1. A survey drawing of the proposed Federal pavilion 
site, showing its areas and boundaries, its grade elevations, and 
surface and subsoil conditions.

comprising the proposed Federal pavilion site in fee-simple and free of 
liens and encumbrances to the Federal Government. The only consideration 
on the part of the Government for the conveyance of the property shall 
be the Government's commitment to participate in the exposition.
    3. Exhibit No. 3. A certified copy of the building code which would 
be applicable should a pavilion be constructed.
    4. Exhibit No. 4. An engineering drawing showing the accessibility 
of the proposed pavilion site to utilities (e.g., sewerage, water, gas, 
electricity, etc.).
    5. Exhibit No. 5. A statement setting forth the security and 
maintenance and arrangements which the applicant would undertake (and an 
estimate of their cost) while a pavilion is under construction.
    6. Exhibit No. 6. A study pursuant to Executive Order 11296 of 
August 10, 1966, entitled ``Evaluation of flood hazard in locating 
Federally owned or financed buildings, roads and other facilities and in 
disposing of Federal land and properties.''


<R05>
Sec. 310.8  Proposed plan for Federal participation.

    (a) Upon receipt of the statement, and the exhibits referred to in 
Sec. 310.7, the Director shall prepare a proposed plan in cooperation 
with other interested departments and agencies of the Federal Government 
for Federal participation in the exposition.
    (b) In preparing the proposed plan for Federal participation in the 
exposition, the Director shall conduct a feasibility study of Federal 
participation including cost estimates by utilizing the services within 
the Federal Government, professional consultants and private sources as 
required and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
    (c) The Director, in the proposed plan for Federal participation in 
the exposition, shall determine whether or not a Federal pavilion should 
be constructed and, if so, whether or not the Government would have need 
for a permanent structure in the area of the exposition or whether a 
temporary structure would be more appropriate.
    (d) The Director shall seek the advice of the Administrator of the 
General Services Administration to the extent necessary in carrying out 
the proposed plan for Federal participation in the exposition.
    (e) Upon completion of the proposed plan for Federal participation 
in the exposition, the Director shall submit the plan to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 310.9  Report of the Secretary on Federal participation.

    Upon receipt of the Director's proposed plan for Federal 
participation, the Secretary, within a reasonable time, shall submit a 
report to the President including: (a) Evidence that the exposition has 
met the criteria for Federal recognition and has been so recognized; (b) 
a statement that the exposition has been registered by the BIE; and (c) 
a proposed plan for the

exchanges, this information is necessary to evaluate whether the conduct 
for which certification is sought meets the standards of the Act.
    (12) A statement of whether the applicant intends or reasonably 
expects that any exported goods or services covered by the proposed 
certificate will re-enter the United States, either in their original or 
modified form. If so, identify the goods or services and the manner in 
which they may re-enter the U.S.
    (13) The names and addresses of the suppliers of the goods and 
services to be exported (and the goods and services to be supplied by 
each) unless the goods and services to be exported are to be supplied by 
the applicant and/or its members.
    (14) A proposed non-confidential summary of the export conduct for 
which certification is sought. This summary may be used as the basis for 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (15) Any other information that the applicant believes will be 
necessary or helpful to a determination of whether to issue a 
certificate under the standards of the Act.
    (16) (Optional) A draft proposed certificate.
    (c) The applicant must sign the application and certify that (1) 
each member has authorized the applicant to submit the application, and 
(2) to the best of its belief the information in the application is 
true, correct, and fully responsive.
    (d) Conformity with regulations. No application shall be deemed 
submitted unless it complies with these regulations. Applicants are 
encouraged to seek guidance and assistance from the Department of 
Commerce in preparing and documenting their applications.
    (e) Review and acceptance. The Secretary will stamp the application 
on the day that it is received in the Office of Export Trading Company 
Affairs. From that date, the Secretary will have five working days to 
decide whether the application is complete and can be deemed submitted 
under the Act. On the date on which the application is deemed submitted, 
the Secretary will stamp it with that date and notify the applicant that 
the application has been accepted for review. If the application is not 
accepted for review, the Secretary shall advise the applicant that it 
may file the application again after correcting the deficiencies that 
the Secretary has specified. If the Secretary does not take action on 
the application within the five-day period, the application shall be 
deemed submitted as of the sixth day.
    (f) Withdrawal of application. The applicant may withdraw an 
application by written request at any time before the Secretary has 
determined whether to issue a certificate. An applicant who withdraws an 
application may submit a new application at any time.
    (g) Supplemental information. After an application has been deemed 
submitted, if the Secretary or the Attorney General finds that 
additional information is necessary to make a determination on the 
application, the Secretary will ask the applicant in writing to supply 
the supplemental information. The running of the time period for a

[[Page 40]]

determination on the application will be suspended from the date on 
which the request is sent until the supplemental information is received 
and is considered complete. The Secretary shall promptly decide whether 
the supplemental information is complete, and shall notify the applicant 
of his decision. If the information is being sought by the Attorney 
General, the supplemental information may be deemed complete only if the 
Attorney General concurs. If the applicant does not agree to provide the 
additional information, or supplies information which the Secretary or 
the Attorney General considers incomplete, the Secretary and the 
Attorney General will decide whether the information in their possession 
is sufficient to make a determination on the application. If either the 
Secretary or the Attorney General considers the information in their 
possession insufficient, the Secretary may make an additional request or 
shall deny the application. If they consider the information in their 
possession sufficient to make a determination on the application, the 
Secretary shall notify the applicant that the time period for a 
determination has resumed running.

conduct and all persons or entities which are protected from liability

sought. If the Secretary does not intend to publish the summary proposed 
by the applicant, he shall notify the applicant. Within twenty days 
after the date the notice is published in the Federal Register, 
interested parties may submit written comments to the Secretary on the 
application. The Secretary shall provide a copy of such comments to the 
Attorney General.
    (b) If a certificate is issued, the Secretary shall publish a

<R05>
Sec. 325.8  Expediting the certification process.

    (a) Request for expedited action. (1) An applicant may be granted 
expedited action on its application in the discretion of the Secretary 
and the Attorney General. The Secretary and the Attorney General will 
consider such requests in light of an applicant's showing that it has a 
special need for a prompt decision. A request for expedited action 
should include an explanation of why expedited action is needed, 
including a statement of all relevant facts and circumstances, such as 
bidding deadlines or other circumstances beyond the control of the 
applicant, that require the applicant to act in less than ninety days 
and that have a significant impact on the applicant's export trade.
    (2) The Secretary shall advise the applicant within ten days after 
the application is deemed submitted whether it will receive expedited 
action. The Secretary may grant the request in whole or in part and 
process the remainder of the application through the normal

[[Page 42]]

procedures. Expedited action may be granted only if the Attorney General 
concurs.
    (b) Time period. The Secretary shall determine whether to issue a 
certificate to the applicant within forty-five days after the Secretary 
granted the request for expedited action, or within a longer period if 
agreed to by the applicant (excluding any suspension pursuant to 
Sec. 325.3(f) of the time period for making a determination). The 
Secretary may not issue a certificate until thirty days after the 
summary of the application is published in the Federal Register.
    (c) Concurrence of the Attorney General. (1) Not later than ten 
working days before the date on which a determination on the application 
is due, the Secretary shall deliver a proposed certificate to the

does not agree that the proposed certificate may be issued, he shall, 
not later than five working days before the date on which a 
determination on the application is due, so advise the Secretary and 
state the reasons for the disagreement. The Secretary, with the 
concurrence of the Attorney General, may revise the proposed certificate 
to resolve the objections and problems raised by the Attorney General, 
or deny the application.
    (2) If the Attorney General receives the proposed certificate by the 
date specified in the preceding paragraph and does not respond within 
the time period specified in that paragraph, he shall be deemed to 
concur in the proposed certificate.

the reasons for his determination.
    (b) Within thirty days after receiving a notice of denial, the 
applicant may request the Secretary to reconsider his determination.

statement setting forth the reasons why the applicant believes the 
decision should be reconsidered, and any additional information that the 
applicant considers relevant.

Attorney General will meet informally with the applicant and/or his 
representative to discuss the applicant's reasons why the determination

regard to reconsidering an application. The Secretary may modify his

determination after reconsideration and of his reasons for the 
determination within thirty days after the request for reconsideration 
has been received.


<R05>
Sec. 325.10  Modifying or revoking a certificate.

    (a) Action subject to modification or revocation. The Secretary 
shall revoke a certificate, in whole or in part, or modify it, as the 
Secretary or the Attorney General considers necessary, if:
    (1) The export conduct of a person or entity protected by the 
certificate no longer complies with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 325.4(b);
    (2) A person or entity protected by the certificate fails to comply 
with a request for information under paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (3) The certificate holder fails to file a complete annual report.
    (b) Request for information. If the Secretary or the Attorney 
General has reason to believe that the export trade, export trade 
activities, or methods of operation of a person or entity protected by a 
certificate no longer comply with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 325.4(b), the Secretary shall request any information that he or 
the Attorney General considers to be necessary to resolve the matter.
    (c) Proceedings for the revocation or modification of a 
certificate--(1) Notification letter. If, after reviewing the relevant 
information in their possession,

[[Page 43]]

it appears to the Secretary or the Attorney General that a certificate 
should be revoked or modified for any of the reasons set forth in 
paragraph (a) above, the Secretary shall so notify the certificate 
holder in writing. The notification shall be sent by registered or 
certified mail to the address specified in the certificate. The 
notification shall include a detailed statement of the facts, conduct, 
or circumstances which may warrant the revocation or modification of the 
certificate.
    (2) Answer. The certificate holder shall respond to the notification 
letter within thirty days after receiving it, unless the Secretary, in 
his discretion, grants a thirty day extension for good cause shown. The 
certificate holder shall respond specifically to the statement included 
with the notification letter and state in detail why the facts, conduct 
or circumstances described in the notification letter are not true, or 
if they are true, why they do not warrant the revoking or modifying of 
the certificate. If the certificate holder does not respond within the 
specified period, it will be considered an admission of the statements 
contained in the notification letter.
    (3) Resolution of factual disputes. Where material facts are in 
dispute, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall, upon request, 
meet informally with the certificate holder. The Secretary or the 
Attorney General may require the certificate holder to provide any 
documents or information that are necessary to support its contentions. 
After reviewing the statements of the certificate holder and the 
documents or information that the certificate holder has submitted, and 
upon considering other relevant documents or information in his 
possession, the Secretary shall make proposed findings of the factual 
matters in dispute. The Attorney General is not bound by the proposed 
findings.
    (4) Final determination. The Secretary and the Attorney General 
shall review the notification letter and the certificate holder's answer 
to it, the proposed factual findings made under paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, and any other relevant documents or information in their 
possession. If, after review, the Secretary or the Attorney General 
determines that the export conduct of a person or entity protected by 
the certificate no longer complies with the standards set forth in 
Sec. 325.4(b), the Secretary shall revoke or modify the certificate as 
appropriate. If the Secretary or the Attorney General determines that 
the certificate holder has failed to comply with the request for 
information under paragraph (b) of this section, or has failed to file a 
complete annual report, and that the failure to comply or file should 
result in revocation of modification, the Secretary shall revoke or 
modify the certificate as appropriate. The determination will be final 
and will be issued to the certificate holder in writing. The notice to 
the certificate holder shall include a statement of the circumstances 
underlying and the reasons in support of the determination. If the 
Secretary determines to revoke or modify the certificate, the decision 
shall specify the effective date of the revocation or modification; this 
date must be at least thirty days but not more than ninety days after 
the Secretary notifies the certificate holder of his determination. The 
Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of a revocation 
or modification or a decision not to revoke or modify.
    (d) Investigative information. In proceedings under this section, 
the Attorney General shall make available to the Secretary any 
information that has been obtained in response to Civil Investigative 
Demands issued under section 304(b)(3) of the Act. Unless prohibited by 
law, the Attorney General and the Secretary shall also make available to 
each other any other information which each is relying upon under these 
proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 325.11  Judicial review.

    (a) Review of certain determinations. (1) Any person aggrieved by a 
final determination of the Secretary under Sec. 325.5, Sec. 325.7, 
Sec. 325.9, or Sec. 325.10 of these regulations may, within thirty days 
of the determination, bring an action in an appropriate district court 
of the United States to set aside the determination on the ground that 
it is erroneous. If a certificate is denied, the applicant may bring 
suit within thirty days after the notice of denial is published in the

[[Page 44]]

Federal Register, or, if the applicant seeks reconsideration, within 
thirty days after the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register notice 
of his determination after reconsideration.
    (b) For purposes of judicial review, determinations of the Secretary 
are final when notice is published in the Federal Register.
    (c) Record for judicial review. For purposes of judicial review, the 
record shall include all information presented to or obtained by the 
Secretary which had a bearing on the determination, the determination 
itself, the supporting statement setting forth the reasons for the 
determination, and the Attorney General's response to the Secretary 
indicating concurrence or nonconcurrence.
    (d) Limitation of judicial review. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a) of this section, no agency action taken under the Act shall be 
subject to judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 325.12  Returning the applicant's documents.

    (a) Upon the denial or withdrawal of an application for a 
certificate in its entirety, the applicant may request the return of all 
copies of the documents submitted by the applicant in connection with 
the application to the Department of Commerce or the Department of 
Justice. The applicant shall submit this request in writing to both the 
Secretary and the Attorney General.
    (b) The Secretary and the Attorney General shall return the 
documents to the applicant within thirty days after they receive the 
applicant's request.


<R05>
Sec. 325.13  Nonadmissibility in evidence.

    If the Secretary denies, in whole or in part, an application for a 
certificate or for an amendment to a certificate, or revokes or amends a 
certificate, neither the negative determination nor the statement of 
reasons therefor shall be admissible in evidence in any administrative 
or judicial proceeding in support of any claim under the antitrust laws.


<R05>
Sec. 325.14  Submitting reports.

    (a) Not later than each anniversary of a certificate's effective 
date, the Secretary shall notify the certificate holder of the 
information to be included in the annual report. This report shall 
contain any changes relevant to the matters specified in the 
certificate, an update of the information contained in the application 
brought current to the anniversary date, and any other information the 
Secretary considers appropriate, after consultation with the Attorney 
General.
    (b) Not later than forty-five days after each anniversary of a 
certificate's effective date, a certificate holder shall submit its 
annual report to the Secretary. The Secretary shall deliver a copy of 
the annual report to the Attorney General.
    (c) Failure to submit a complete annual report may be the basis for 
modification or revocation of a certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 325.15  Relinquishing a certificate.

    A certificate holder may relinquish a certificate at any time 
through written notice to the Secretary. The certificate will cease to 
be effective on the day the Secretary receives the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 325.16  Protecting confidentiality of information.

    (a) Any information that is submitted by any person under the Act is 
exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 
552).
    (b)(1) Except as authorized under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
no officer or employee of the United States shall disclose commercial or 
financial information submitted under this Act if the information is 
privileged or confidential, and if disclosing the information would 
cause harm to the person who submitted it.
    (2) A person submitting information shall designate the documents or 
information which it considers privileged or confidential and the 
disclosure of which would cause harm to the person submitting it. The 
Secretary shall endeavor to notify these persons of any requests or 
demands before disclosing any of this information.
    (3) An officer or employee of the United States may disclose 
information covered under paragraph (b)(1) of this section only under 
the following circumstances--

[[Page 45]]

of the Congress,
    (ii) In a judicial or administrative proceeding subject to issuance 
of an appropriate protective order,
    (iii) With the written consent of the person who submitted the 
information,
    (iv) When the Secretary considers disclosure of the information to 
be necessary for determining whether or not to issue, amend, or revoke a 
certificate, if--
    (A) The Secretary determines that a non-confidential summary of the 
information is inadequate; and
    (B) The person who submitted the information is informed of the 
intent to disclose the information, and has an opportunity to advise the 
Secretary of the potential harm which disclosure may cause,
    (v) In accordance with any requirement imposed by a statute of the 
United States.
    (c) In any judicial or administrative proceeding in which disclosure 
is sought from the Secretary or the Attorney General of any confidential

submitted the documents or information.

<R04>
                    Subpart A--Scope and Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 400.1  Scope.

    (a) This part sets forth the regulations, including the rules of 
practice and procedure, of the Foreign-Trade Zones Board with regard to 
foreign-trade zones in the United States pursuant to the Foreign-Trade 
Zones Act of 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u). It includes the 
substantive and procedural rules for the authorization of zones and the 
regulation of zone activity. The purpose of zones as stated in the Act 
is to ``expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and other purposes.'' 
The regulations provide the legal framework for accomplishing this 
purpose in the context of evolving U.S. economic and trade policy, and 
economic factors relating to international competition.
    (b) Part 146 of the regulations of the United States Customs Service 
(19 CFR part 146) governs zone operations, including the admission of 
merchandise into zones, zone activity involving such merchandise, and 
the transfer of merchandise from zones.
    (c) To the extent ``activated'' under Customs procedures in 19 CFR 
part 146, and only for the purposes specified in the Act (19 U.S.C. 
81c), zones are treated for purposes of the tariff laws and Customs 
entry procedures as being outside the Customs territory of the United 
States. Under zone procedures, foreign and domestic merchandise may be 
admitted into zones for operations such as storage, exhibition, 
assembly, manufacture and processing, without being subject to formal 
Customs entry procedures and payment of duties, unless and until the 
foreign merchandise enters Customs territory for domestic consumption. 
At that time, the importer ordinarily has a choice of paying duties 
either at the rate applicable to the foreign material in its condition 
as admitted into a zone, or if used in manufacturing or processing, to 
the emerging product. Quota restrictions do not normally apply to 
foreign goods in zones. The Board can deny or limit the

[[Page 49]]

use of zone procedures in specific cases on public interest grounds. 
Merchandise moved into zones for export (zone-restricted status) may be 
considered exported for purposes such as federal excise tax rebates and 
Customs drawback. Foreign merchandise (tangible personal property) 
admitted to a zone and domestic merchandise held in a zone for 
exportation are exempt from certain state and local ad valorem taxes (19 
U.S.C. 81o(e)). Articles admitted into zones for purposes not specified 
in the Act shall be subject to the tariff laws and regular entry 
procedures, including the payment of applicable duties, taxes, and fees.

<R05>
Sec. 400.28  Conditions, prohibitions and restrictions applicable to grants of authority.

    (a) In general. Grants of authority issued by the Board for the 
establishment of zones or subzones, including those already issued, are 
subject to the Act and this part and the following general conditions or 
limitations:
    (1) Approvals from the grantee and the Port Director, pursuant to 19 
CFR part 146, are required prior to the activation of any portion of an 
approved zone project; and
    (2) Approval of the Board or the Commerce Department's Assistant 
Secretary for Import Administration pursuant to subpart D of this part 
is required prior to the commencement of manufacturing beyond the scope 
of that approved as part of the application or pursuant to reviews under 
this part (e.g., new end products, significant expansions of plant 
production capacity), and of similar changes in processing activity 
which involves foreign articles subject to quantitative import controls 
(quotas) or results in articles subject to a lower (actual or effective) 
duty rate (inverted tariff) than any of their foreign components.
    (3) Sourcing changes--(i) Notification requirement. The grantee or 
operator of a zone or subzone shall notify the Executive Secretary when 
there is a change in sourcing for authorized manufacturing or processing 
activity which involves the use of new foreign articles subject to 
quotas or inverted tariffs, unless--
    (A) Entries for consumption are not to be made at the lower duty 
rate; or
    (B) The product in which the foreign articles are to be incorporated 
is being produced for exportation.
    (ii) Notification procedure. Notification shall be given prior to 
the commencement of the activity, when possible, otherwise at the time 
the new foreign articles arrive in the zone or are withdrawn from 
inventory for use in production. Requests may be made to the Executive 
Secretary for authority to submit notification of sourcing changes on a 
quarterly federal fiscal year basis covering changes in the previous 
quarter.
    (iii) Reviews. (A) Upon notification of a sourcing change under 
paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, within 30 days, the Executive 
Secretary will conduct a preliminary review of the changes in relation 
to the approved activity to determine whether they could have 
significant adverse effects, taking into account the factors enumerated 
in Sec. 400.31(b), and will submit a report and recommendation to the 
Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, who 
shall determine whether review is necessary. The procedures of 
Sec. 400.32(b) shall be used in these situations when appropriate.
    (B) The Board or the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for 
Import Administration may, based on public interest grounds, prohibit or 
restrict the use of zone procedures in regard to the change in sourcing, 
including requiring that items be placed in privileged foreign status 
(19 CFR 146.41) upon admission to a zone or subzone.
    (C) The Executive Secretary shall direct reviews necessary to ensure 
that activity involved in these situations continues to be in the public 
interest.
    (4) Prior to activation of a zone, the zone grantee or operator 
shall obtain all necessary permits from federal, state and local 
authorities, and except as otherwise specified in the Act or this part, 
shall comply with the requirements of those authorities.
    (5) A grant of authority for a zone or a subzone shall lapse unless 
the zone project (in case of subzones, the subzone facility) is 
activated, pursuant to 19 CFR part 146, and in operation not later than 
five years from:
    (i) A Board order (authorizing the zone or subzone) issued after 
November 7, 1991; or
    (ii) November 7, 1991.
    (6) A grant of authority approved under this subpart includes 
authority for the grantee to permit the erection of buildings necessary 
to carry out the approved zone project subject to concurrence of the 
Port Director.
    (7) Zone grantees, operators, and users shall permit federal 
government officials acting in an official capacity to have access to 
the zone project and records during normal business hours and under 
other reasonable circumstances.
    (8) A grant of authority may not be sold, conveyed, transferred, set 
over, or

[[Page 59]]

assigned (FTZ Act, section 17; 19 U.S.C. 81q). Private ownership of zone 
land and facilities is permitted provided the zone grantee retains the 
control necessary to implement the approved zone project. Should title 
to land or facilities be transferred after a grant of authority is 
issued, the zone grantee must retain, by agreement with the new owner, a 
level of control which allows the grantee to carry out its 
responsibilities as grantee. The sale of a zone site or facility for 
more than its fair market value without zone status could, depending on 
the circumstances, be subject to section 17 of the Act.
    (9) A grant of authority will not be construed to make the zone 
grantee automatically liable for violations by operators, users, or 
other parties.
    (b) Additional conditions, prohibitions and restrictions. Other 
requirements, conditions or restrictions under Federal, State or local 
law may apply to the zone or subzone authorized by the grant of 
authority.
    (c) Revocation of grants of authority. (1) In general. As provided 
in this section, the Board can revoke in whole or in part a grant of 
authority for a zone or subzone whenever it determines that the zone 
grantee or, in the case of subzones, the subzone operator, has violated, 
repeatedly and willfully, the provisions of the Act.
    (2) Procedure. When the Board has reason to believe that the 
conditions for revocation, as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, are met, the Board will:
    (i) Notify the zone or subzone grantee in writing stating the nature 
of the alleged violations, and provide the grantee an opportunity to 
request a hearing on the proposed revocation;
    (ii) Conduct a hearing, if requested or otherwise if appropriate;
    (iii) Make a determination on the record of the proceeding not 
earlier than 4 months after providing notice to the zone grantee under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (iv) If the Board's determination is affirmative, publish notice of 
revocation of the grant of authority in the Federal Register.
    (3) As provided in section 18 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 81r(c)), the 
zone or subzone grantee may appeal an order of the Board revoking the 
grant of authority.

FR 53535, Oct. 15, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 400.29  Application fees.

    (a) In general. This section sets forth a uniform system of charges 
in the form of fees to recover some costs incurred by the Foreign-Trade 
Zones staff of the Department of Commerce in processing the applications 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section. The legal authority for the 
fees is 31 U.S.C. 9701, which provides for the collection of user fees 
by agencies of the Federal Government.
    (b) Uniform system of user fee charges. The following graduated fee 
schedule establishes fees for certain types of applications and requests 
for authority based on their average processing time. Applications 
combining requests for more than one type of approval are subject to the 
fee for each category.

(1) Additional general-purpose zones (Sec.  400.24; Sec.                
 400.21(a)(2)).................................................   $3,200
(2) Special-purpose subzones (Sec.  400.25):                            
  (i) Non-manufacturing/processing or less than three products.    4,000
  (ii) Manufacturing/processing--three or more products........    6,500
(3) Expansions (Sec.  400.26(b))...............................    1,600
                                                                        

    (c) Applications submitted to the Board shall include a check drawn 
on a national or state bank or trust company of the United States or 
Puerto Rico in the amount called for in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Uncertified checks must be acceptable for deposit by a Federal Reserve 
bank or branch.
    (d) Applicants shall make their checks payable to the U.S. 
Department of Commerce ITA. The checks will be deposited by ITA into the 
Treasury receipts account. If applications are found deficient under 
Sec. 400.27(b)(1), or withdrawn by applicants prior to formal filing, 
refunds will be made.


<R04>
        Subpart D--Manufacturing and Processing Activity--Reviews


<R05>
Sec. 400.31  Manufacturing and processing activity; criteria.

    (a) In general. Pursuant to section 15(c) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 
81o(c)), the

[[Page 60]]

Board has authority to restrict or prohibit zone activity ``that in its 
judgment is detrimental to the public interest.'' When evaluating zone 
and subzone manufacturing and processing activity, either as proposed in 
an application, in a request for manufacturing/processing approval, or 
as part of a review of an ongoing operation, the Board shall determine 
whether the activity is in the public interest by reviewing it in 
relation to the evaluation criteria contained in paragraph (b) of this 
section. With regard to processing activity, this section shall apply 
only when the activity involves foreign articles subject to quantitative 
import controls (quotas) or results in articles subject to a lower duty 
rate (inverted tariff) than any of their foreign components. Such a 
review involves consideration of whether the activity is consistent with 
trade policy and programs, and whether its net economic effect is 
positive.
    (b) Evaluation criteria--(1) Threshold factors. It is the policy of 
the Board to authorize zone activity only when it is consistent with 
public policy and, in regard to activity involving foreign merchandise 
subject to quotas or inverted tariffs, when zone procedures are not the 
sole determining cause of imports. Thus, without undertaking a review of 
the economic factors enumerated in Sec. 400.31(b)(2), the Board shall 
deny or restrict authority for proposed or ongoing activity if it 
determines that:
    (i) The activity is inconsistent with U.S. trade and tariff law, or 
policy which has been formally adopted by the Executive branch;
    (ii) Board approval of the activity under review would seriously 
prejudice U.S. tariff and trade negotiations or other initiatives; or
    (iii) The activity involves items subject to quantitative import 
controls or inverted tariffs, and the use of zone procedures would be 
the direct and sole cause of imports that, but for such procedures, 
would not likely otherwise have occurred, taking into account imports 
both as individual items and as components of imported products.
    (2) Economic factors. After its review of threshold factors, if 
there is a basis for further consideration, the Board shall consider the 
following factors in determiing the net economic effect of the activity 
or proposed activity:
    (i) Overall employment impact;
    (ii) Exports and reexports;
    (iii) Retention or creation of manufacturing or processing activity;
    (iv) Extent of value-added activity;
    (v) Overall effect on import levels of relevant products, including 
import displacement;
    (vi) Extent and nature of foreign competition in relevant products;
    (vii) Impact on related domestic industry, taking into account 
market conditions; and
    (viii) Other relevant information relating to public interest and 
net economic impact considerations, including technology transfers and 
investment effects.
    (c) Methodology and evidence--(1)(i) The first phase 
(Sec. 400.31(b)) involves consideration of threshold factors. If an 
examiner or reviewer makes a negative finding on any of the factors in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the course of a review, the 
applicant shall be informed pursuant to Sec. 400.27(d)(3)(vii)(A). When 
threshold factors are the basis for a negative recommendation in a 
review of ongoing activity, the zone grantee and directly affected party 
shall be notified and given an opportunity to submit evidence pursuant 
to Sec. 400.27(d)(3)(vii)(A). If the Board determines in the negative 
any of the factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it shall deny or 
restrict authority for the proposed or ongoing activity.
    (ii) The process for paragraph (b)(2) of this section involves 
consideration of the enumerated economic factors, taking into account 
their relative weight and significance under the circumstances. Previous 
evaluations in similar cases are considered. The net effect is arrived 
at by balancing the positive and negative factors and arriving at a net 
economic effect.
    (2) Contributory effect. In assessing the significance of the 
economic effect of the zone activity as part of the consideration of 
economic factors, and in consideration of whether there is a significant 
public benefit, the Board may consider the contributory effect zone 
savings have as an incremental part of

[[Page 61]]

cost effectiveness programs adopted by companies to improve their 
international competitiveness.
    (3) Burden of proof. Applicants for subzones shall have the burden 
of submitting evidence establishing that the activity does or would 
result in a significant public benefit, taking into account the factors 
in paragraph (b) of this section. Applicants for approval of 
manufacturing or processing in general-purpose zones shall submit 
evidence regarding the positive economic effects that would result from 
activity within the zone and may submit evidence and comments as to 
policy considerations. Both types of applicants are expected to submit 
information in response to evidence of adverse economic effects during 
the public comment period. Parties should submit evidence that is 
probative and substantial in addressing the matter in issue.
    (d) Monitoring and post-approval reviews--(1) Ongoing zone activity 
may be reviewed at anytime to determine whether it is in compliance with 
the Act and regulations, as well as the authority granted by the Board. 
Reviews may also be conducted to determine whether there are changed 
circumstances that raise questions as to whether the activity is 
detrimental to the public interest, taking into account the factors 
enumerated in Sec. 400.31. The Board may prescribe special monitoring 
requirements in its decisions when appropriate.
    (2) Reviews may be initiated by the Board, the Commerce Department's 
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, or the Executive 
Secretary; or, they may be undertaken in response to requests from 
parties directly affected by the activity in question and showing good 
cause.
    (3) Upon review, if the Board finds that zone activity is no longer 
in the public interest, taking into account the provisions of 
Sec. 400.31, it may restrict the activity in question. The 
appropriateness of a delayed effective date will be considered in such 
cases.
[56 FR 50798, Oct. 8, 1991; 56 FR 56544, Nov. 5, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 400.32  Procedure for review of request for approval of manufacturing or processing.

    (a) Request as part of application for grant of authority. A request 
for approval of proposed manufacturing or processing activity may be 
submitted as part of an application under Secs. 400.24-400.26(a). The 
Board will review the request taking into account the criteria in 
Sec. 400.31(b).
    (b) Request for manufacturing/processing in approved zone or 
subzone. Prior to the commencement of manufacturing in a zone or subzone 
involving activity beyond the scope of that which has been previously 
authorized at the facility (i.e., new end products, significant 
expansions of plant production capacity), and of similar changes in 
processing activity that involves foreign articles subject to quotas or 
inverted tariffs, zone grantees or operators shall request the 
determination referred to in Sec. 400.31(a) by submitting a request in 
writing to the Executive Secretary (Sec. 400.28(a)(2)). Such requests 
shall include the information required by Secs. 400.24(d)(4)(vii) and 
400.25.
    (1) The Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for Import 
Administration may make determinations in these cases based upon a 
review by the FTZ staff and the recommendation of the Executive 
Secretary, when:
    (i) The proposed activity is the same, in terms of products 
involved, to activity recently approved by the Board and similar in 
circumstances; or
    (ii) The activity is for export only; or
    (iii) The zone benefits sought do not involve the election of non-
privileged foreign status (19 CFR 146.42) on items involving inverted 
tariffs; or
    (iv) The Port Director determines that the activity could otherwise 
be conducted under Customs bonded procedures.
    (2) When the informal procedure in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
is not appropriate--
    (i) The Executive Secretary will:
    (A) Assign a case docket number and give notice in the Federal 
Register inviting public comment;
    (B) Arrange a public hearing, if appropriate;
    (C) Appoint an examiner, if appropriate, to conduct a review and 
prepare

[[Page 62]]

a report with recommendations for the Board; and
    (D) Prepare and transmit a report with recommendations, or transmit 
the examiners report, to the Board for appropriate action; and
    (ii) The Board will make a determination on the requests, and the 
Executive Secretary will notify the grantee in writing of the Board's 
determination, and will publish notice of the determination in the 
Federal Register.
    (c) Scope determinations. Determinations shall be made by the 
Executive Secretary as to whether changes in activity are within the 
scope of related activity already approved for the facility involved 
under this part. When warranted, the procedures of paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section will be followed.
[56 FR 50798, Oct. 8, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 53535, Oct. 15, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 400.33  Restrictions on manufacturing and processing activity.

    (a) In general. In approving manufacturing or processing activity 
for a zone or subzone the Board may adopt restrictions to protect the 
public interest, health, or safety. The Commerce Department's Assistant 
Secretary for Import Administration may similarly adopt restrictions in 
exercising authority under Sec. 400.32(b)(1).
    (b) Restrictions on items subject to antidumping and countervailing 
duty actions--(1) Board policy. Zone procedures shall not be used to 
circumvent antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) actions under 
19 CFR parts 353 and 355.
    (2) Admission of items subject to AD/CVD actions. Items subject to 
AD/CVD orders or items which would be otherwise subject to suspension of 
liquidation under AD/CVD procedures, if they entered U.S. Customs 
territory, shall be placed in privileged foreign status (19 CFR 146.41) 
upon admission to a zone or subzone. Upon entry for consumption, such 
items shall be subject to duties under AD/CVD orders or to suspension of 
liquidation, as appropriate, under 19 CFR parts 353 and 355.


<R04>
       Subpart E--Zone Operations and Administrative Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 400.41  Zone operations; general.

    Zones shall be operated by or under the contractual oversight of 
zone grantees, subject to the requirements of the Act and this part, as 
well as those of other federal, state and local agencies having 
jurisdiction over the site and operation. Zone grantees shall ensure 
that the reasonable zone needs of the business community are served by 
their zone projects. The Port Director represents the Board with regard 
to the zone projects in the district and is responsible for enforcement, 
including physical security and access requirements, as provided in 19 
CFR part 146.
[56 FR 50798, Oct. 8, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 53535, Oct. 15, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 400.42  Requirements for commencement of operations in a zone project.

    (a) In general. The following actions are required before operations 
in a zone may commence:
    (1) Approval by the Port Director of an application for activation 
is required as provided in 19 CFR part 146; and
    (2) The Executive Secretary will review proposed manufacturing or 
processing, pursuant to Sec. 400.32, and a zone schedule as provided in 
this section.
    (b) Zone schedule. (1) The zone grantee shall submit to the 
Executive Secretary and to the Port Director a zone schedule which sets 
forth:
    (i) Internal rules and regulations for the zone; and
    (ii) A statement of the rates and charges (fees) applicable to zone 
users.
    (2) A zone schedule shall consist of typed, loose-leaf, numbered, 
letter-sized pages, enclosed in covers, and shall contain:
    (i) A title page, with information to include:
    (A) The name of the zone grantee and operator(s);
    (B) Schedule identification;
    (C) Site description;
    (D) Date of original schedule; and
    (E) Name of the preparer;
    (ii) A table of contents;

[[Page 63]]

    (iii) Administrative information;
    (iv) A statement of zone operating policy, rules and regulations, 
including uniform procedures regarding the construction of buildings and 
facilities; and
    (v) A section listing rates and charges for zones and subzones with 
information sufficient for the Board or the Executive Secretary to 
determine whether the rates and charges are reasonable based on other 
like operations in the port of entry area, and whether there is uniform 
treatment under like circumstances among zone users.
    (3) The Executive Secretary will review the schedule to determine 
whether it contains sufficient information for users concerning the 
operation of the facility and a statement of rates and charges as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the Executive Secretary 
determines that the schedule satisfies these requirements, the Executive 
Secretary will notify the zone grantee, unless there is a basis for 
review under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. A copy of the schedule 
shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the zone 
grantee and operator. The zone grantee shall send a copy to the Port 
Director, who may submit comments to the Executive Secretary.
    (4) Amendments to the schedule shall be prepared and submitted in 
the manner described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this 
section, and listed in the concluding section of the schedule, with 
dates.
    (5) A zone user or prospective user showing good cause may object to 
the zone or subzone fee on the basis that it is not reasonable, fair and 
uniform, by submitting to the Executive Secretary a complaint in writing 
with supporting information. The Executive Secretary will review the 
complaint and issue a report and decision, which will be final unless 
appealed to the Board within 30 days. The Board or the Executive 
Secretary may otherwise initiate a review for cause. The factors 
considered in reviewing reasonableness and fairness, will include:
    (i) The going-rates and charges for like operations in the area and 
the extra costs of operating a zone, including return on investment; and
    (ii) In the case of subzones, the value of actual services rendered 
by the zone grantee or operator, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Sec. 400.44  Zone-restricted merchandise.

    (a) In general. Merchandise which has been given export status by 
Customs officials (``zone-restricted merchandise''--19 CFR 146.44) may 
be returned to the Customs Territory of the United States only when the 
Board determines that the return would be in the public interest. Such 
returns are subject to the Customs laws and the payment of applicable 
duties and excise taxes (19 U.S.C. 81c, 4th proviso).
    (b) Criteria. In making the determination described in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Board will consider:
    (1) The intent of the parties;
    (2) Why the goods cannot be exported;
    (3) The public benefit involved in allowing their return; and
    (4) The recommendation of the Port Director.
    (c) Procedure. (1) A request for authority to return ``zone-
restricted'' merchandise into Customs territory shall be made to the 
Executive Secretary in letter form by the zone grantee or operator of 
the zone in which the merchandise is located, with supporting 
information and documentation.
    (2) The Executive Secretary will investigate the request and prepare 
a report for the Board.

[[Page 64]]

    (3) The Executive Secretary may act for the Board under this section 
in cases involving merchandise valued at 500,000 dollars or less, 
provided requests are accompanied with a letter of concurrence from the 
Port Director.

Sec. 400.45  Retail trade.

    (a) In general. Retail trade is prohibited in zones, except that 
sales or other commercial activity involving domestic, duty-paid, and 
duty-free goods may be conducted within an activated zone project under 
permits issued by the zone grantee and approved by the Board, with the 
further exception that no permits shall be necessary for sales involving 
domestic, duty-paid or duty-free food and non-alcoholic beverage 
products sold within the zone or subzone for consumption on premises by 
persons working therein. The Port Director will determine whether an 
activity is retail trade, subject to review by the Board when the zone 
grantee requests such a review with a good cause.
    (b) Procedure. Requests for Board approval under this section shall 
be submitted in letter form, with supporting documentation, to the Port 
Director, who is authorized to act for the Board in these cases, subject 
to the concurrence of the Executive Secretary.
    (c) Criteria. In evaluating requests under this section, the Port 
Director and the Executive Secretary will consider:
    (1) Whether any public benefits would result from approval; and
    (2) The economic effect such activity would have on the retail trade 
outside the zone in the port of entry area.
[56 FR 50798, Oct. 8, 1991; 57 FR 2319, Jan. 21, 1992, as amended at 62

    (a) In general. The Executive Secretary will publish notice in the 
Federal Register inviting public comment on applications docketed for 
Board action (see, Sec. 400.27(c)), and with

[[Page 65]]

regard to other reviews or matters considered under this part when 
public comment is necessary. Applicants shall give appropriate notice of 
their proposals in local newspapers. The Board, the Secretary, the 
Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, or 
the Executive Secretary, as appropriate, may schedule and/or hold 
hearings during any proceedings or reviews conducted under this part 
whenever necessary or appropriate.
    (b) Requests for hearings--(1) A directly affected party showing 
good cause may request a hearing during a proceeding or review.
    (2) The request must be made within 30 days of the beginning of the 
period for public comment (see, Sec. 400.27) and must be accompanied by 
information establishing the need for the hearing and the basis for the 
requesting party's interest in the matter.
    (3) A determination as to the need for the hearing will be made by 
the Commerce Department's Assistant Secretary for Import Administration 
within 15 days after the receipt of such a request.
    (c) Procedure for public hearings. The Board will publish notice in 
the Federal Register of the date, time and location of a hearing. All 
participants shall have the opportunity to make a presentation. 
Applicants and their witnesses shall ordinarily appear first. The 
presiding officer may adopt time limits for individual presentations.


<R05>
Sec. 400.52  Official record; public access.

    (a) Content. The Executive Secretary will maintain at the location 
stated in Sec. 400.53(d) an official record of each proceeding within 
the Board's jurisdiction. The Executive Secretary will include in the 
official record all factual information, written argument, and other 
material developed by, presented to, or obtained by the Board in 
connection with the proceeding. The official record will contain 
material that is public, business proprietary, privileged, and 
classified. While there is no requirement that a verbatim record shall 
be kept of public hearings, the proceedings of such hearings shall 
ordinarily be recorded and transcribed when significant opposition is 
involved.
    (b) Opening and closing of official record. The official record 
opens on the date the Executive Secretary files an application or 
receives a request that satisfies the applicable requirements of this 
part and closes on the date of the final determination in the proceeding 
or review, as applicable.
    (c) Protection of the official record. Unless otherwise ordered in a 
particular case by the Executive Secretary, the official record will not 
be removed from the Department of Commerce. A certified copy of the 
record will be made available to any court before which any aspect of a 
proceeding is under review, with appropriate safeguards to prevent 
disclosure of proprietary or privileged information.

information, including business proprietary information, and written 
argument necessary or appropriate to the proceeding.
    (b) Public information. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, the Board will consider all information submitted in a 
proceeding to be public information. If the person submitting the 
information does not agree to its public disclosure, the Board will 
return the information and not consider it in the proceeding.
    (c) Business proprietary information. Persons submitting business 
proprietary information and requesting protection from public disclosure 
shall mark the cover page ``business proprietary,'' as well as the top 
of each page on which such information appears.
    (d) Disclosure of information. Disclosure of public information will 
be governed by 15 CFR part 4. Public information in the official record 
will be available for inspection and copying at the Office of the

<R04>
                           Subpart A--Purpose


<R05>
Sec. 700.1  Purpose of this regulation.

    (a) Title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 
U.S.C. App. 2061, et seq.) (Defense Production Act), authorizes the 
President: to require the priority performance of contracts and orders 
necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense over other 
contracts or orders; to allocate materials and facilities as necessary 
or appropriate to promote the national defense; and to require the 
allocation of, or the priority performance under contracts or orders 
relating to, supplies of materials and equipment in order to assure 
domestic energy supplies for national defense needs.
    (b) This regulation consolidates, simplifies, and revises the 
Defense Materials System and the Defense Priorities System regulations, 
directions, and orders. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System 
(DPAS) helps to keep current national defense programs on schedule and 
provides an operating system that can be rapidly expanded in a national 
emergency.
    (c) To aid in understanding and using the DPAS, an overview of its 
major provisions is incorporated into this regulation as subpart B--
Overview. The full text of the DPAS is found in subparts D through L.


<R04>
                           Subpart B--Overview


<R05>
Sec. 700.2  Introduction.

    (a) The Federal Emergency Management Agency authorizes certain 
national defense programs for priorities and allocations support. For 
example, military aircraft production, ammunition, and certain programs 
which maximize domestic energy supplies are ``authorized programs.'' A 
complete list of currently authorized programs is provided at Schedule 
I.
    (b) To ensure the preferential treatment of certain contracts and 
orders for authorized programs, the Department of Commerce administers 
the DPAS.
    (c) Commerce has delegated authority to place priority ratings on 
contracts or orders necessary or appropriate to promote the national 
defense to the government agencies that issue such contracts or orders. 
Schedule I includes a list of agencies delegated this authority. Copies 
of the Delegations of Authority are provided at Appendix I. They set 
forth the authorities delegated and those retained by Commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 700.3  Priority ratings and rated orders.

    (a) Rated orders are identified by a priority rating consisting of 
the rating--either DX or DO--and a program identification symbol. Rated 
orders take preference over all unrated orders as necessary to meet 
required delivery dates. Among rated orders, DX rated orders take 
preference over DO rated orders. Program identification symbols indicate 
which authorized program is involved with the rated order. For example, 
A1 identifies defense aircraft programs and A7 signifies defense 
electronic programs. The program identification symbols, in themselves, 
do not connote any priority.
    (b) Persons receiving rated orders must give them preferential 
treatment as required by this regulation. This means a person must 
accept and fill a rated order for items that the person normally 
supplies. The existence of previously accepted unrated or lower rated 
orders is not sufficient reason for rejecting a rated order. Persons are 
required to reschedule unrated orders if they conflict with performance 
against a rated order. Similarly, persons must reschedule DO rated 
orders if they conflict with performance against a DX rated order.
    (c) All rated orders must be scheduled to the extent possible to 
ensure delivery by the required delivery date.
    (d) Persons who receive rated orders must in turn place rated orders 
with their suppliers for the items they need

[[Page 71]]

to fill the orders. This provision ensures that suppliers will give 
priority treatment to rated orders from contractor to subcontractor to 
suppliers throughout the procurement chain.
    (e) Persons may place a priority rating on orders only when they are 
in receipt of a rated order, have been explicitly authorized to do so by 
the Department of Commerce or a Delegate Agency, or are otherwise 
permitted to do so by this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 700.4  Controlled materials.

    (a) Federal central management of certain key materials, designated 
``controlled materials'', has been essential in the past to effective 
industrial mobilizations. Accordingly, special rules are maintained in 
peacetime to provide an operating mechanism that can be rapidly expanded 
during a national emergency to meet increased defense and other 
essential needs. Currently, the controlled materials are steel, copper, 
aluminum, and nickel alloys.
    (b) Under the controlled materials program, the Department of 
Commerce requires suppliers of controlled materials to accept rated 
orders up to a specified quantity of material during a given period of 
time. This quantity is called a ``set-aside''. This provision ensures 
that the material will be available when rated orders are placed. In 
addition, the system ensures that controlled materials producers are 
treated equitably, for after the set-aside quantity levels have been 
reached, controlled materials producers may generally reject additional 
rated orders. These orders would then be filled by other controlled 
materials producers who had not exhausted their set-aside requirement.
    (c) In time of national emergency, the level and scope of the 
controlled materials program may be greatly expanded to ensure the 
necessary allocation of materials and in order to direct general 
industrial activity toward supporting the requirements of the emergency.
    (d) Certain other items, in addition to the controlled materials, 
have critical importance to national defense programs. From time-to-
time, special rules, similar to those for controlled materials, may be 
needed to manage those materials.
    (e) If items become scarce and critical and the requirements of the 
national defense cannot be met without creating a significant 
dislocation in the civilian market place so as to create appreciable 
hardship, special rules may be established under section 101(b) of the 
Defense Production Act to control the general distribution of such items 
in the civilian market.


<R05>
Sec. 700.5  Special priorities assistance.

    (a) The DPAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, from 
time-to-time production or delivery problems will arise. In this event, 
special priorities assistance is available from Commerce and from the 
Delegate Agencies.
    (b) Special priorities assistance is available for any reason 
consistent with this regulation. Generally, special priorities 
assistance is provided to expedite deliveries, resolve delivery 
conflicts, place rated orders, locate suppliers, or to verify 
information supplied by customers and vendors. Special priorities 
assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items not 
automatically ratable.


<R05>
Sec. 700.6  Official actions.

    When necessary, Commerce takes specific official actions to 
implement or enforce the provisions of this regulation and to provide 
special priorities assistance. Such actions may include the issuance of: 
Rating Authorizations, Directives, Letters of Understanding, Set-asides, 
and compliance documents (Administrative Subpoenas, Demands for 
Information, and Inspection Authorizations).


<R05>
Sec. 700.7  Compliance.

    (a) Compliance with the provisions of this regulation and official 
actions is required by the Defense Production Act. Violators are subject 
to criminal penalties.
    (b) Any person who places or receives a rated order should be 
thoroughly familiar with, and must comply with, the provisions of this 
regulation.

                    Subpart D--Industrial Priorities


<R05>
Sec. 700.10  Delegation of authority.

    (a) The priorities and allocations authorities given to the 
President in Title I of the Defense Production Act have been delegated 
to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), who, 
in turn, has delegated these authorities with respect to industrial 
resources to the Secretary of Commerce. FEMA retains the overall policy 
and coordinating functions for this delegated authority.
    (b) Within the Department of Commerce, these responsibilities have 
been assigned to the Office of Industrial Resource Administration. The 
Department of Commerce has authorized the Delegate Agencies to assign 
priority ratings to orders for items needed for authorized programs. 
Copies of these Delegations of Authority are provided at Appendix I. 
They set forth the authorities delegated and those retained by Commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 700.11  Priority ratings.

    (a) Levels of priority. (1) There are two levels of priority 
established by this regulation, identified by the rating symbols ``DO'' 
and ``DX''.
    (2) All DO rated orders have equal priority with each other and take 
preference over unrated orders. All DX rated orders have equal priority 
with each other and take preference over DO rated orders and unrated 
orders. (For resolution of conflicts among rated orders of equal 
priority, see Sec. 700.14(c).)
    (3) In addition, a Directive issued by Commerce takes preference 
over any DX rated order, DO rated order, or unrated order, as stipulated 
in the Directive. (For a full discussion of Directives, see 
Sec. 700.62.)
    (b) Program identification symbols. Program identification symbols 
indicate which authorized program is being supported by a rated order. 
The list of authorized programs and their identification symbols are 
listed in Schedule I. For example, A1 identifies defense aircraft 
programs and A7 signifies defense electronic programs. Program 
identification symbols, in themselves, do not connote any priority.
    (c) Priority ratings. A priority rating consists of the rating 
symbol--DO and DX--and the program identification symbol, such as A1, 
B2, or H6. Thus, a contract for the production of an aircraft will 
contain a DO-A1 or DX-A1 priority rating. A contract for a radar set 
will contain a DO-A7 or DX-A7 priority rating.


<R05>
Sec. 700.12  Elements of a rated order.

    Each rated order must include:
    (a) The appropriate priority rating (e.g. DO-A1, DX-A4, DO-H1);
    (b) A required delivery date or dates. The words ``immediately'' or 
``as soon as possible'' do not constitute a delivery date. A 
``requirements contract'' bearing a priority rating may contain no 
specific delivery date or dates and may provide for the furnishing of 
items from time-to-time or within a stated period against specific 
purchase orders or ``calls''. Such ``calls'' must specify a required 
delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date 
of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original 
``requirements contract'';
    (c) The signature of an individual authorized to sign rated orders 
for the person placing the order. The signature certifies that the rated 
order is authorized under this regulation and that the requirements of 
this regulation are being followed; and
    (d) A statement that reads in substance:

    This is a rated order certified for national defense use, and you 
are required to follow all the provisions of the Defense Priorities and 
Allocations System regulation (15 CFR part 700).

[[Page 74]]


<R05>
Sec. 700.13  Acceptance and rejection of rated orders.

    (a) Mandatory acceptance. (1) Except as otherwise specified in this 
section, a person shall accept every rated order received and must fill 
such orders regardless of any other rated or unrated orders that have 
been accepted.
    (2) A person shall not discriminate against rated orders in any 
manner such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms 
and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.
    (b) Mandatory rejection. Unless otherwise directed by Commerce:
    (1) A person shall not accept a rated order for delivery on a 
specific date if unable to fill the order by that date. However, the 
person must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery 
can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date. 
Scheduling conflicts with previously accepted lower rated or unrated 
orders are not sufficient reason for rejection under this section.
    (2) A person shall not accept a DO rated order for delivery on a 
date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DO 
or DX rated orders. However, the person must offer to accept the order 
based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.
    (3) A person shall not accept a DX rated order for delivery on a 
date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DX 
rated orders, but must offer to accept the order based on the earliest 
delivery date otherwise possible.
    (c) Optional rejection. Unless otherwise directed by Commerce, rated 
orders may be rejected in any of the following cases as long as a 
supplier does not discriminate among customers:
    (1) If the person placing the order is unwilling or unable to meet 
regularly established terms of sale or payment;
    (2) If the order is for an item not supplied or for a service not 
performed;
    (3) If the order is for an item produced, acquired, or provided only 
for the supplier's own use for which no orders have been filled for two 
years prior to the date of receipt of the rated order. If, however, a 
supplier has sold some of these items, the supplier is obligated to 
accept rated orders up to that quantity or portion of production, 
whichever is greater, sold within the past two years;
    (4) If the person placing the rated order, other than the U.S. 
Government, makes the item or performs the service being ordered;
    (5) If the rated order is for a controlled material in an amount 
below the minimum mill quantity established in Schedule II, and the 
person placing the order is not willing to buy the minimum quantity;
    (6) If the rated order is for a controlled material and is not 
received by the controlled materials producer within the time frame 
specified in Schedule I;
    (7) If the applicable set-aside has been reached or would be 
exceeded by acceptance, except that a DX order must be accepted without 
regard for such set-aside;
    (8) If acceptance of a rated order or performance against a rated 
order would violate any other regulation, official action, or order of 
the Department of Commerce issued under the authority of the Defense 
Production Act [See Sec. 700.75].
    (d) Customer notification requirements. (1) A person must accept or 
reject a rated order in writing within ten working days after receipt of 
a DO rated order and within five working days after receipt of a DX 
rated order. The person must give reasons in writing for the rejection.
    (2) If a person has accepted a rated order and later discovers that, 
due to circumstances beyond the person's control, deliveries will be 
delayed, the person must notify the customer immediately, give the 
reasons for the delay, and advise of a new shipment date. If 
notification is given verbally, written confirmation must be provided 
within five working days.


<R05>
Sec. 700.14  Preferential scheduling.

    (a) A person must schedule operations, including the acquisition of 
all needed production items, in a timely manner to satisfy the delivery 
requirements of each rated order. Modifying production or delivery 
schedules is necessary only when required delivery

[[Page 75]]

dates for rated orders cannot otherwise be met.
    (b) DO rated orders must be given production preference over unrated 
orders, if necessary to meet required delivery dates, even if this 
requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery 
against unrated orders. Similarly, DX rated orders must be given 
preference over DO rated orders and unrated orders.

    Examples: If a person receives a DO rated order with a delivery date 
of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or 
delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be 
delayed. If a DX rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 
and a person has a DO rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and 
operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to 
alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX 
rated order.

    (c) If a person cannot fill all the rated orders of equal priority 
status received on the same day, the person must accept those orders 
which can be filled which have the earliest delivery dates. For example, 
the person must accept order A requiring delivery on December 15 before 
accepting order B requiring delivery on December 31. For those orders 
which cannot be filled on time, the supplier must inform the customer 
within the time limits set forth in Sec. 700.13(d), of the earliest date 
on which delivery can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis 
of that date.
    (d) If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in 
time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person 
must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A 
person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace 
those items with the use of a rated order as provided in Sec. 700.17(b).


<R05>
Sec. 700.15  Extension of priority ratings.

    (a) A person must use rated orders with suppliers to obtain items 
needed to fill a rated order. The person must use the priority rating 
indicated on the customer's rated order, except as otherwise provided in 
this regulation or as directed by the Department of Commerce.

    For example, if a person is in receipt of a DO-A3 rated order for a 
navigation system and needs to purchase semiconductors for its 
manufacture, that person must use a DO-A3 rated order to obtain the 
needed semiconductors.

    (b) The priority rating must be included on each successive order 
placed to obtain items needed to fill a customer's rated order. This 
continues from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the 
entire procurement chain.


<R05>
Sec. 700.16  Changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders.

    (a) The priority rating on a rated order may be changed or cancelled 
by:
    (1) An official action of the Department of Commerce; or
    (2) Written notification from the person who placed the rated order 
(including a Delegate Agency).
    (b) If an unrated order is amended so as to make it a rated order, 
or a DO, rating is changed to a DX rating, the supplier must give the 
appropriate preferential treatment to the order as of the date the 
change is received by the supplier.
    (c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a 
supplier's original production or delivery schedule shall constitute a 
new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept 
or reject the amended order according to the provisions of Sec. 700.13.
    (d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order: a 
change in shipping destination; a reduction in the total amount of the 
order; an increase in the total amount of the order which has negligible 
impact upon deliveries; a minor variation in size or design; or a change 
which is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.
    (e) If a person no longer needs items to fill a rated order, any 
rated orders placed with suppliers for the items, or the priority rating 
on those orders, must be cancelled.
    (f) When a priority rating is added to an unrated order, or is 
changed or cancelled, all suppliers must be promptly notified in 
writing.

[[Page 76]]


<R05>
Sec. 700.17  Use of rated orders.

    (a) A person must use rated orders to obtain:
    (1) Items which will be physically incorporated into other items to 
fill rated orders, including that portion of such items normally 
consumed, or converted into scrap or by-products, in the course of 
processing;
    (2) Containers or other packaging materials required to make 
delivery of the finished items against rated orders;
    (3) Services, other than contracts of employment, needed to fill 
rated orders; and
    (4) MRO needed to produce the finished items to fill rated orders. 
However, for MRO, the priority rating used must contain the program 
identification symbol H7 along with the rating symbol contained on the 
customer's rated order. For example, a person in receipt of a DO-A3 
rated order, who needs MRO, would place a DO-H7 rated order with the 
person's supplier.
    (b) A person may use a rated order to replace inventoried items 
(including finished items) if such items were used to fill rated orders, 
as follows:
    (1) The order must be placed within 90 days of the date of use of 
the inventory.
    (2) A DO rating symbol and the program identification symbol 
indicated on the customer's rated order must be used on the order 
(except as provided in Sec. 700.31(d)--Controlled materials program 
identification symbols). A DX rating symbol may not be used even if the 
inventory was used to fill a DX rated order.
    (3) If the priority ratings on rated orders from one customer or 
several customers contain different program identification symbols, the 
rated orders may be combined. In this case, the program identification 
symbol H1 must be used (i.e., DO-H1) (not applicable to controlled 
materials producers).
    (c) A person may combine DX and DO rated orders from one customer or 
several customers if the items covered by each level of priority are 
identified separately and clearly. If different program identification 
symbols are indicated on those rated orders of equal priority, the 
person must use the program identification symbol H1 (i.e., DO-H1 or DX-
H1), except as provided in Sec. 700.31(d) (Controlled materials program 
identification symbols).
    (d) Combining rated and unrated orders. (1) A person may combine 
rated and unrated orders provided that the rated quantities are 
identified separately and are also contained in a separate rated order 
which conforms to the requirements of Sec. 700.12 (Elements of a rated 
order). In addition to identifying clearly the rated quantities, the 
combined purchase order must contain a statement that the rated 
quantities are contained in a separate rated order placed in accordance 
with this regulation. Wherever possible, the separate rated order must 
be physically attached to the combined purchase order. A supplier must 
give preferential treatment to the rated quanitities of the combined 
order, if necessary. A supplier may not use the authorities of this 
regulation to give preferential treatment to the unrated portion.
    (2) Any supplier who believes that rated and unrated orders are 
being combined in a manner contrary to the intent of this regulation or 
in a fashion that causes undue or exceptional hardship may submit a 
request for adjustment or exception under Sec. 700.80.
    (e) A person may place a rated order for the minimum commercially 
procurable quantity even if the quantity needed to fill a rated order is 
less than that minimum. However, a person must combine rated orders as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if possible, to obtain 
minimum procurable quantities.
    (f) A person is not required to place a priority rating on an order 
for less than $5,000 provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely 
fashion without the use of the priority rating.


<R05>
Sec. 700.18  Limitations on placing rated orders.

    (a) General limitations. (1) A person may not place a DO or DX rated 
order unless entitled to do so under this regulation.
    (2) Rated orders may not be used to obtain:
    (i) Delivery on a date earlier than needed;
    (ii) A greater quantity of the item than needed, except to obtain a 
minimum procurable quantity. Separate

[[Page 77]]

rated orders may not be placed solely for the purpose of obtaining 
minimum procurable quantities on each order;
    (iii) Items in advance of the receipt of a rated order, except as 
specifically authorized by Commerce (see Sec. 700.51(c) for information 
on obtaining authorization for a priority rating in advance of a rated 
order); or
    (iv) Any of the following items unless specific priority rating 
authority has been obtained from a Delegate Agency or Commerce:
    (A) Items for plant improvement, expansion or construction, unless 
they will be physically incorporated into a construction project covered 
by a rated order; and
    (B) Production or construction equipment or items to be used for the 
manufacture of production equipment. [For information on requesting 
priority rating authority, see Sec. 700.53.]
    (b) Jurisdictional limitations. (1) The priorities and allocations 
authority for certain items has been delegated under Executive Order 
10480, as amended, to other agencies, and, thus, the provisions of this 
regulation are not applicable to them. These items include:
    (i) Petroleum, gas, solid fuel, and electric power and all other 
forms of energy (Department of Energy);
    (ii) Food and the domestic distribution of farm equipment and 
commercial fertilizer (Department of Agriculture);
    (iii) Civil transportation and the movement of persons and property 
by all modes (Department of Transportation);
    (iv) Minerals (Department of the Interior);
    (v) Water (Department of Defense--U.S. Army Corps of Engineers);
    (vi) Housing facilities (Department of Housing and Urban 
Development);
    (vii) Health facilities (Department of Health and Human Services); 
and
    (viii) Radioisotopes, stable isotopes, source material, and special 
nuclear material, produced in Government-owned plants or facilities 
operated by or for Department of Energy (Department of Energy).
    (2) The jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce and the 
Departments of Energy, Agriculture, and the Interior over certain 
specific items included in the categories listed above has been 
clarified by Interagency Memoranda of Understanding. Copies of these 
Memoranda are provided for information at appendix II.
    (3) The following items under the jurisdiction of Commerce are 
currently excluded from the rating provisions of this regulation; 
however, these items are subject to Commerce Directives. These excluded 
items are:

Communication services
Copper raw materials (as defined in Schedule III)
Crushed stone
Gravel
Sand
Scrap
Slag
Steam heat, central
Waste paper


<R04>
          Subpart E--Industrial Priorities for Energy Programs


<R05>
Sec. 700.20  Use of priority ratings.

    (a) Section 101(c) of the Defense Production Act authorizes the use 
of priority ratings for projects which maximize domestic energy 
supplies.
    (b) Projects which maximize domestic energy supplies include those 
which maintain or further domestic energy exploration, production, 
refining, and transportation; maintain or further the conservation of 
energy; or are involved in the construction or maintenance of energy 
facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 700.21  Application for priority rating authority.

    (a) For projects believed to maximize domestic energy supplies, a 
person may request priority rating authority for scarce, critical and 
essential supplies of materials and equipment by submitting DOE Form PR 
437 to the Department of Energy. Blank applications and further 
information may be obtained from the Technical Information Center, 
Department of Energy, P.O. Box 62, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830, or from 
the Procurement and Assistance Management Directorate, Department of 
Energy, Attn: MA 932, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., 
Washington, DC 20585.
    (b) On receipt of the application, the Department of Energy will:

[[Page 78]]

    (1) Determine if the project maximizes domestic energy supplies; and
    (2) Find whether the materials or equipment involved in the 
application are critical and essential to the project.
    (c) If the Department of Energy notifies Commerce that the project 
maximizes domestic energy supplies and that the materials or equipment 
are critical and essential, Commerce must find whether the items in 
question are scarce and whether there is a need to use the priorities 
and allocations authorities.
    (1) Scarcity implies an unusual difficulty in obtaining the material 
or equipment in a timeframe consistent with the timely completion of the 
energy project. Among the factors to be used in making the scarcity 
finding will be the following:
    (i) Value and volume of material or equipment shipments;
    (ii) Consumption of material and equipment;
    (iii) Volume and market trends of imports and exports;
    (iv) Domestic and foreign sources of supply;
    (v) Normal levels of inventories;
    (vi) Rates of capacity utilization;
    (vii) Volume of new orders; and
    (viii) Lead times for new orders.
    (2) In finding whether there is a need to use the priorities and 
allocations authorities, Commerce will consider alternative supply 
solutions and other measures.
    (d) If Commerce does not find that the items of material or 
equipment are scarce, it will not proceed to analyze the need to use the 
priorities and allocations authorities.
    (e) Commerce will inform the Department of Energy of the results of 
its analysis. If Commerce has made the two required findings, it will 
authorize the Department of Energy to grant the use of a priority rating 
to the applicant.
    (f) Schedule I includes a list of authorized programs to support the 
maximization of domestic energy supplies. A Department of Energy 
regulation setting forth the procedures and criteria used by the 
Department of Energy in making its determination and findings is 
published in 10 CFR part 216.


<R04>
                   Subpart F--The Controlled Materials


<R05>
Sec. 700.30  Management of the controlled materials.

    (a) The controlled materials are steel, copper, aluminum, and nickel 
alloys in the shapes and forms listed in Schedule II and defined in 
Schedule III. These materials are basic industrial resources necessary 
for both authorized defense programs and for general industrial 
activity. Federal management of these four materials assures the timely 
availability of the materials to meet current authorized program 
requirements; assures the equitable distribution of requirements among 
the suppliers of the materials; and provides a flexible and expandable 
system capable of directing general economic and industrial activity 
during times of emergency.
    (b) Before controlled materials can be used for authorized programs, 
the Delegate Agencies must obtain specific approval, known as an 
allotment, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
Accordingly, the Delegate Agencies submit to FEMA requirements for the 
controlled materials necessary to support their authorized programs. 
After reviewing the available supply of the materials and other national 
security, economic and policy considerations, FEMA approves the use of 
specific quantities of controlled materials by issuing allotments to 
each Delegate Agency. (Special controlled materials provisions 
applicable to the Delegate Agencies are found in the Delegations of 
Authority and the U.S.-Canadian Memorandum of Understanding appended to 
this regulation.)
    (c) To assure the timely availability of controlled materials, the 
Department of Commerce manages their supply and distribution by 
requiring producers and distributors of controlled materials to set-
aside or reserve space in their order books for the receipt of rated 
orders. This process is described in greater detail in the following 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 700.31  Specific rules for controlled materials suppliers and users.

    (a) Rated orders. Rated orders are used to obtain controlled 
materials

[[Page 79]]

needed for authorized programs. Such orders must comply with the 
requirements of Sec. 700.12 (Elements of a rated order). In addition, a 
rated order for controlled materials placed with a producer must be in 
sufficient detail to permit entry on mill schedules.
    (b) Set-asides. (1) Controlled materials suppliers are issued set-
asides by type and shape of controlled material as provided in the 
following paragraphs. Each supplier is required to accept all rated 
orders received up to the set-aside level. The supplier may reject DO 
rated orders after the set-aside quantity has been filled except that 
the supplier must accept all DX rated orders regardless of the set-aside 
level.
    (2) A person who has had a DO rated order rejected because a set-
aside has been filled, must attempt to place the rated order with other 
controlled materials suppliers whose set-asides are not filled. If still 
unable to place the rated order, the person should request special 
priorities assistance (see Subpart H).
    (3) Steel controlled materials. (i) A set-aside is applicable to 
each steel controlled materials producer who receives a written set-
aside notification from Commerce.
    (ii) Any steel controlled materials producer who has not received a 
set-aside notification must accept, in accordance with the provisions of 
this regulation, all rated orders received, but may receive a set-aside 
by applying in writing to Commerce.
    (iii) The set-aside is a specified monthly quantity based on average 
monthly shipments during a specific base period.
    (4) Copper controlled materials. (i) Set-asides are applicable to 
all copper controlled materials producers.
    (ii) The monthly set-aside for each copper controlled materials 
producer is calculated by multiplying the producer's set-aside base by 
the appropriate set-aside percentage for each product. The set-aside 
percentage and set-aside base are contained in Schedule IV.
    (5) Aluminum controlled materials. (i) A set-aside is applicable to 
each aluminum controlled materials producer who receives a written set-
aside notification from Commerce.
    (ii) Any aluminum controlled materials producer who has not received 
a set-aside notification must, in accordance with the provisions of this 
regulation, accept all rated orders received, but may receive a set-
aside in writing by applying in writing to Commerce.
    (iii) The set-aside for aluminum ingot and aluminum molten metal is 
calculated based on the average monthly production capacity during a 
specific base period.
    (iv) The set-aside for all other aluminum controlled materials is 
calculated based on the average monthly shipments during a specific base 
period.
    (6) Nickel alloys controlled materials. (i) Set-asides are 
applicable to all nickel alloys controlled materials producers.
    (ii) The monthly set-aside for each nickel alloys controlled 
materials producer is calculated by multiplying the producer's set-aside 
base by the appropriate set-aside percentage for each product. The set-
aside percentage and set-aside base are contained in Schedule V.
    (c) Order books and product lead times. (1) Each controlled 
materials producer must open its order books for the acceptance of DO 
rated orders at least 45 days prior to the commencement of the 
applicable minimum lead times provided in Schedule II for the various 
shapes and forms of controlled materials.
    (2) When order books are open, a controlled materials producer must 
accept all rated orders received until the minimum lead time shown in 
Schedule II is reached or until the set-aside level is reached.
    (3) Once the minimum lead time is reached, a controlled materials 
producer may devote remaining capacity to unrated orders, even if the 
set-aside has not been filled. However, the producer must accept all DX 
rated orders without regard to lead time. If unable to make delivery by 
the required date, the producer must offer to accept the order in 
accordance with Sec. 700.13.
    (d) Controlled materials program identification symbols. (1) A 
controlled materials producer must use the program identification symbol 
H2 on all rated orders to obtain production materials or to replace 
inventories used to fill rated orders except for materials for further 
conversion.

[[Page 80]]

    (2) A controlled materials producer must use the program 
identification symbol H3 on rated orders to obtain controlled materials 
for further conversion needed for production or inventory replacement.
    (3) A controlled materials distributor must use the program 
identification symbol H4 on rated orders to obtain controlled materials 
needed to fill rated orders, or to replace in inventory, controlled 
materials used to fill rated orders.
    (e) Controlled materials shipments and requirements data. (1)

<R04>
                Subpart H--Special Priorities Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 700.50  General provisions.

    (a) The DPAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, it 
is anticipated that from time-to-time problems will occur. In this 
event, a person

[[Page 81]]

should immediately contact the appropriate contract administration 
officer for guidance or assistance. If additional formal aid is needed, 
special priorities assistance should be sought from the Delegate Agency 
through the contract administration officer. If the Delegate Agency is 
unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use of a priority 
rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, the Delegate 
Agency may forward the request to the Department of Commerce for action. 
Special priorities assistance is a service provided to alleviate 
problems that do arise.
    (b) Special priorities assistance can be provided for any reason in 
support of this regulation, such as assisting in obtaining timely 
deliveries of items needed to satisfy rated orders or authorizing the 
use of priority ratings on orders to obtain items not automatically 
ratable under this regulation.
    (c) A request for special priorities assistance or priority rating 
authority must be submitted on Form ITA-999 (OMB control number 0625-
0015) to the local contract administration representative. Form ITA-999 
may be obtained from the Delegate Agency representative, any Commerce 
District Office, or from the Department of Commerce. A sample Form ITA-
999 is attached at Appendix III.
[49 FR 30414, July 30, 1984; 49 FR 50171, Dec. 27, 1984. Redesignated at 
54 FR 601, Jan. 9, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 700.51  Requests for priority rating authority.

    (a) If a rated order is likely to be delayed because a person is 
unable to obtain items not normally rated under this regulation, the 
person may request the authority to use a priority rating in ordering 
the needed items. Examples of items for which priority ratings can be 
authorized include:
    (1) Production or construction equipment;
    (2) Computers when not used as production items; and
    (3) Expansion, rebuilding or replacing plant facilities.
    (b) Rating authority for production or construction equipment. (1) A 
request for priority rating authority for production or construction 
equipment must be submitted to the appropriate Delegate Agency. The 
Delegate Agency may establish particular forms to be used for these 
requests (e.g., Department of Defense Form DD 691.)
    (2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the 
procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may 
be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the 
latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in 
the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease 
rather than sell.
    (c) Rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract. (1) In 
certain cases and upon specific request, Commerce, in order to promote 
the national defense, may authorize a person to place a priority rating 
on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime 
contract. In these instances, the person requesting advance rating 
authority must obtain sponsorship of the request from the appropriate 
Delegate Agency. The person shall also assume any business risk 
associated with the placing of rated orders if these orders have to be 
cancelled in the event the rated prime contract is not issued.
    (2) The person must state the following in the request:

    It is understood that the authorization of a priority rating in 
advance of our receiving a rated prime contract from a Delegate Agency 
and our use of that priority rating with our suppliers in no way commits 
the Delegate Agency, the Department of Commerce or any other government 
agency to enter into a contract or order or to expend funds. Further, we 
understand that the Federal Government shall not be liable for any 
cancellation charges, termination costs, or other damages that may 
accrue if a rated prime contract is not eventually placed and, as a 
result, we must subsequently cancel orders placed with the use of the 
priority rating authorized as a result of this request.

    (3) In reviewing requests for rating authority in advance of a rated 
prime contract, Commerce will consider, among other things, the 
following criteria:
    (i) The probability that the prime contract will be awarded;
    (ii) The impact of the resulting rated orders on suppliers and on 
other authorized programs;

[[Page 82]]

    (iii) Whether the contractor is the sole source;
    (iv) Whether the item being produced has a long lead time;
    (v) The political sensitivity of the project; and
    (vi) The time period for which the rating is being requested.
    (4) Commerce may require periodic reports on the use of the rating 
authority granted under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (5) If a rated prime contract is not issued, the person shall 
promptly notify all suppliers who have received rated orders pursuant to 
the advanced rating authority that the priority rating on those orders 
is cancelled.


<R05>
Sec. 700.52  Examples of assistance.

    (a) While special priorities assistance may be provided for any 
reason in support of this regulation, it is usually provided in 
situations where:
    (1) A person is experiencing difficulty in obtaining delivery 
against a rated order by the required delivery date; or
    (2) A person cannot locate a supplier for an item needed to fill a 
rated order.
    (b) Other examples of special priorities assistance include:
    (1) Ensuring that rated orders receive preferential treatment by 
suppliers;
    (2) Resolving production or delivery conflicts between various rated 
orders;
    (3) Assisting in placing rated orders with suppliers;
    (4) Verifying the urgency of rated orders; and
    (5) Determining the validity of rated orders.


<R05>
Sec. 700.53  Criteria for assistance.

    Requests for special priorities assistance should be timely, i.e., 
the request has been submitted promptly and enough time exists for the 
Delegate Agency or Commerce to effect a meaningful resolution to the 
problem, and must establish that:
    (a) There is an urgent need for the item; and
    (b) The applicant has made a reasonable effort to resolve the 
problem.


<R05>
Sec. 700.54  Instances where assistance will not be provided.

    Special priorities assistance is provided at the discretion of the 
Delegate Agencies and Commerce when it is determined that such 
assistance is warranted to meet the objectives of this regulation. 
Examples where assistance will not be provided include situations when a 
person is attempting to:
    (a) Secure a price advantage;
    (b) Obtain delivery prior to the time required to fill a rated 
order;
    (c) Gain competitive advantage;
    (d) Disrupt an industry apportionment program in a manner designed 
to provide a person with an unwarranted share of scarce items; or
    (e) Overcome a supplier's regularly established terms of sale or 
conditions of doing business.


<R05>
Sec. 700.55  Assistance programs with Canada and other nations.

    (a) To promote military assistance to foreign nations, this section 
provides for authorizing priority ratings to persons in Canada and in 
other foreign nations to obtain items in the United States in support of 
authorized programs. Although priority ratings have no legal authority 
outside of the United States, this section also provides information on 
how persons in the United States may obtain informal assistance in 
Canada.
    (b) Canada. (1) The joint U.S.-Canadian military arrangements for 
the defense of North America and the integrated nature of their defense 
industries as set forth in the U.S.-Canadian Statement of Principles for 
Economic Cooperation (October 26, 1950) require close coordination and 
the establishment of a means to provide mutual assistance to the defense 
industries located in both countries.
    (2) The Department of Commerce coordinates with the Canadian 
Department of Supply and Services on all matters of mutual concern 
relating to the administration of this regulation. A copy of the 
Memorandum of Understanding between the two departments is provided at 
appendix IV.
    (3) Any person in the United States ordering defense items in Canada 
should inform the Canadian supplier that the items being ordered are to 
be used to fill a rated order. The Canadian supplier should be informed 
that if production materials are needed from the United States by the 
supplier or the

[[Page 83]]

supplier's vendor to fill the order, they should contact the Canadian 
Department of Supply and Services for authority to place rated orders in 
the United States.
    (4) Any person in Canada producing defense items for the Canadian 
government may also obtain priority rating authority for items to be 
purchased in the United States by applying to the Canadian Department of 
Supply and Services in accordance with procedures specified by that 
Department.
    (5) Persons in Canada needing special priorities assistance in 
obtaining defense items in the United States may apply for such 
assistance to the Canadian Department of Supply and Services. The 
Department of Supply and Services will forward appropriate requests to 
Commerce.
    (6) Any person in the United States requiring assistance in 
obtaining items in Canada must submit a request through the Delegate 
Agency to Commerce on Form ITA-999. Commerce will forward appropriate 
requests to the Canadian Department of Supply and Services.
    (c) Foreign nations. (1) Any person in a foreign nation other than 
Canada requiring assistance in obtaining defense items in the United 
States or priority rating authority for defense items to be purchased in 
the United States, should apply for such assistance or rating authority 
to the U.S. Department of Defense. The request must be sponsored by the 
government of the foreign nation prior to its submission.
    (2) If the Department of Defense endorses the request, it will be 
forwarded to Commerce for appropriate action.

                       Subpart I--Official Actions


<R05>
Sec. 700.60  General provisions.

    (a) Commerce may, from time-to-time, take specific official actions 
to implement or enforce the provisions of this regulation.
    (b) Several of these official actions (Rating Authorizations, 
Directives, and Letters of Understanding) are discussed in this subpart. 
Other official actions which pertain to compliance (Administrative 
Subpoenas, Demands for Information, and Inspection Authorizations) are 
discussed in Sec. 700.71(b).


<R05>
Sec. 700.61  Rating Authorizations.

    (a) A Rating Authorization is an official action granting specific 
priority rating authority that:
    (1) Permits a person to place a priority rating on an order for an 
item not normally ratable under this regulation; or
    (2) Authorizes a person to modify a priority rating on a specific 
order or series of contracts or orders.
    (b) To request priority rating authority, see Sec. 700.51.


<R05>
Sec. 700.62  Directives.

    (a) A Directive is an official action which requires a person to 
take or refrain from taking certain actions in accordance with its 
provisions.
    (b) A person must comply with each Directive issued. However, a 
person may not use or extend a Directive to obtain any items from a 
supplier, unless expressly authorized to do so in the Directive.
    (c) Directives take precedence over all DX rated orders, DO rated 
orders, and unrated orders previously or subsequently received, unless a 
contrary instruction appears in the Directive.


<R05>
Sec. 700.63  Letters of Understanding.

    (a) A Letter of Understanding is an official action which may be 
issued in resolving special priorities assistance cases to reflect an 
agreement reached by all parties (Commerce, the Delegate Agency, the 
supplier, and the customer).
    (b) A Letter of Understanding is not used to alter scheduling 
between rated orders, to authorize the use of priority ratings, to 
impose restrictions under this regulation, or to take other official 
actions. Rather, Letters of Understanding are used to confirm production 
or shipping schedules which do not require modifications to other rated 
orders.


<R04>
                          Subpart J--Compliance


<R05>
Sec. 700.70  General provisions.

appropriate to the enforcement or the administration of the Defense 
Production Act, this regulation, or an official action.

[[Page 84]]

Such actions include audits, investigations, or other inquiries.
    (b) Any person who places or receives a rated order should be 
thoroughly familiar with, and must comply with, the provisions of this 
regulation.
    (c) Willful violation of any of the provisions of Title I or section 
705 of the Defense Production Act, this regulation, or an official

provided in the Defense Production Act and as set forth in Sec. 700.74 
of this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 700.71  Audits and investigations.

    (a) Audits and investigations are official examinations of books, 
records, documents, other writings and information to ensure that the 
provisions of the Defense Production Act, this regulation, and official 
actions have been properly followed. An audit or investigation may also 
include interviews and a systems evaluation to detect problems or 
failures in the implementation of this regulation.
    (b) When undertaking an audit, investigation, or other inquiry, the 
Department of Commerce shall:
    (1) Define the scope and purpose in the official action given to the

and authoritative data are not available from any Federal or other 
responsible agency.
    (c) In administering this regulation, Commerce may issue the 
following documents which constitute official actions:
    (1) Administrative Subpoenas. An Administrative Subpoena requires a 
person to appear as a witness before an official designated by the 
Department of Commerce to testify under oath on matters of which that 
person has knowledge relating to the enforcement or the administration 
of the Defense Production Act, this regulation, or official actions. An 
Administrative Subpoena may also require the production of books, 
papers, records, documents and physical objects or property.
    (2) Demand for Information. A Demand for Information requires a 
person to furnish to a duly authorized representative of the Department 
of Commerce any information necessary or appropriate to the enforcement 
or the administration of the Defense Production Act, this regulation, or

documents, other writings and information in the person's possession or 
control at the place where that person usually keeps them, and to 
inspect a person's property when such interviews and inspections are 
necessary or appropriate to the enforcement or the administration of the 
Defense Production Act, this regulation, or official actions.
    (d) The production of books, records, documents, other writings and 
information will not be required at any place other than where they are 
usually kept if, prior to the return date specified in the 
Administrative Subpoena or Demand for Information, a duly authorized 
official of Commerce is furnished with copies of such material that are 
certified under oath to be true copies. As an alternative, a person may 
enter into a stipulation with a duly authorized official of Commerce as 
to the content of the material.
    (e) An Administrative Subpoena, Demand for Information, or 
Inspection Authorization, shall include the name, title or official 
position of the person to be served, the evidence sought to be adduced, 
and its general relevance to the scope and purpose of the audit, 
investigation, or other inquiry. If employees or agents are to be 
interviewed; if books, records, documents, other writings, or 
information are to be produced; or if property is to be inspected; the 
Administrative Subpoena, Demand for Information, or Inspection 
Authorization will describe them with particularity.
    (f) Service of documents shall be made in the following manner:
    (1) Service of a Demand for Information or Inspection Authorization 
shall be made personally, or by Certified Mail--Return Receipt Requested 
at the person's last known address. Service of an Administrative

last known dwelling or place of business.
    (2) Service upon other than an individual may be made by serving a 
partner, corporate officer, or a managing or general agent authorized by 
appointment or by law to accept service of process. If an agent is 
served, a copy of the document shall be mailed to the person named in 
the document.
    (3) Any individual 18 years of age or over may serve an 
Administrative Subpoena, Demand for Information, or Inspection 
Authorization. When personal service is made, the individual making the 
service shall prepare an affidavit as to the manner in which service was 
made and the identity of the person served, and return the affidavit, 
and in the case of subpoenas, the original document, to the issuing 
officer. In case of failure to make service, the reasons for the failure 
shall be stated on the original document.


<R05>
Sec. 700.72  Compulsory process.

    (a) If a person refuses to permit a duly authorized representative 
of Commerce to have access to any premises or source of information 
necessary to the administration or the enforcement of the Defense 
Production Act, this regulation, or official actions, the Commerce 
representative may seek compulsory process. Compulsory process means the 
institution of appropriate legal action, including ex parte application 
for an inspection warrant or its equivalent, in any forum of appropriate 
jurisdiction.
    (b) Compulsory process may be sought in advance of an audit, 
investigation, or other inquiry, if, in the judgment of the Director of 
the Office of Industrial Resource Administration, U.S. Department of 
Commerce, in consultation with the Assistant General Counsel for 
International Trade, U.S. Department of Commerce, there is reason to 
believe that a person will refuse to permit an audit, investigation, or 
other inquiry, or that other circumstances exist which make such process 
desirable or necessary.

Sec. 700.73  Notification of failure to comply.

    (a) At the conclusion of an audit, investigation, or other inquiry, 
or at any other time, Commerce may inform the person in writing where 
compliance with the requirements of the Defense Production Act, this 
regulation, or an official action were not met.
    (b) In cases where Commerce determines that failure to comply with 
the provisions of the Defense Production Act, this regulation, or an 
official action was inadvertent, the person may be informed in writing 
of the particulars involved and the corrective action to be taken. 
Failure to take corrective action may then be construed as a willfull 
violation of the Defense Production Act, this regulation, or an official 
action.


<R05>
Sec. 700.74  Violations, penalties, and remedies.

    (a) Willful violation of the provisions of Title I or sections 705

or imprisonment, or both. Except as provided in (b) below, the maximum 
penalties provided by the Defense Production Act are a $10,000 fine, or 
one year in prison, or both.
    (b) Willful refusal to furnish any information or reports required 
by Commerce under section 705 of the Defense Production Act, this

penalties provided by the Defense Production Act are a $1,000 fine, or 
one year in prison, or both.
    (c) The government may also seek an injunction from a court of 
appropriate jurisdiction to prohibit the continuance of any violation 
of, or to enforce compliance with, the Defense Production Act, this 
regulation, or an official action.
    (d) In order to secure the effective enforcement of the Defense 
Production Act, this regulation, and official actions, the following are

reason to believe that the item will be accepted, redelivered, held, or 
used in violation of the Defense Production Act, this regulation, or an 
official action. In such instances, the person must immediately notify 
the Department of Commerce that, in accordance with this provision, 
delivery has not been made.


<R05>
Sec. 700.75  Compliance conflicts.

    If compliance with any provision of the Defense Production Act, this 
regulation, or an official action would prevent a person from filling a 
rated order or from complying with another provision of the Defense 
Production Act, this regulation, or an official action, the person must 
immediately notify the Department of Commerce for resolution of the 
conflict.

Defense necessary to the effective implementation of the Defense 
Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation (15 CFR part 700).
    (b) Certain specifics concerning the implementation of this 
delegated authority are contained in a Statement of Conditions to this 
delegation issued by the Office of Industrial Resource Administration 
(OIRA), Department of Commerce (DOC).
    3. Rating Authority.
    (a) The Secretary of Defense is delegated the authority to place 
rated contracts and orders in support of Department of Defense (DOD) 
programs authorized by the Director, Federal Emergency Management 
Agency.
    (b) The Secretary of Defense is delegated the authority to use the 
DX rating symbol in placing rated orders for those authorized programs 
determined by the President to be of the Highest National Priority as 
described in the DOD Master Urgency List.
    4. Co-production Programs.
    (a) The Secretary of Defense may request priority rating authority 
from DOC for specific co-production programs, and if granted, may 
authorize only those foreign firms which have entered into a formal co-
production agreement with a U.S. producer to use priority ratings.
    (b) DOC may authorize the use of priority ratings by other foreign 
firms providing items necessary to the co-production activity on a case-
by-case basis.
    5. Production and Construction Equipment.
    (a) The Secretary of Defense may authorize persons to place rated

    Appendix II to Part 700--Interagency Memorandum of Understanding

  Departments of Agriculture and Commerce--Memorandum of Understanding 
     Between the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce Concerning 
 Priorities and Allocations Jurisdiction and Responsibilities for Foods 
                       Which Have Industrial Uses

                               A. Purpose

    This Understanding sets forth the priorities and allocations 
jurisdiction and responsibilities of the Department of Agriculture 
(Agriculture) and the Department of Commerce (Commerce) for defense 
mobilization in the event of a national emergency, and for emergency 
preparedness functions, as they relate to foods which have industrial 
uses.

                              B. Authority

    1. Section 201(a) of Executive Order 10480, as amended (E.O. 10480), 
and Defense Mobilization Order 3 (DMO 3) (44 CFR 322) provide for the 
delegation of authority for the administration of priorities and 
allocations functions under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as 
amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2061, et seq.), to the Secretary of Agriculture 
with respect to food; and to the Secretary of Commerce with respect to 
all other materials and facilities not specifically delegated to other 
agencies.
    2. Section 901 et seq. of Executive Order 11490, as amended (E.O. 
11490), delegates to the Secretary of Commerce the authority for 
preparing national emergency plans and developing preparedness programs 
covering the production and distribution of all materials and the use of 
all production facilities, except those that are specifically assigned 
to, or under the jurisdiction of other agencies. Section 801 et seq. of 
E.O. 11490 provides for the delegation of authority with respect to the 
production, processing, distribution, and storage of food resources, and 
the use of food resource facilities, to the Secretary of Agriculture.
    3. Section 601(h) of E.O. 10480 defines the term ``food'' as:

    * * * all commodities and products, simple, mixed, or compound or 
complements to such commodities or products, that are capable of being 
eaten or drunk by either human beings or animals, irrespective of other 
uses to which such commodities or products may be put, at all stages of 
processing from the raw commodity to the products thereof in vendible 
form for human or animal consumption * * *. The term ``food'' shall also 
include all starches, sugars, vegetable and animal fats and oils, 
cotton, tobacco, wool, mohair, hemp, flax fiber, and naval stores, but 
shall not include any such material after it loses its identity as an 
agricultural commodity or agricultural product.

Section 802(1) of E.O. 11490 defines the term ``food resources'' in the 
same language. Accordingly, these terms are used interchangeably in this 
Understanding.
    4. The functions delegated by these authorities to the Secretaries 
of Agriculture and Commerce have been redelegated by the Secretary of 
Agriculture to the Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and 
Conservation Service (ASCS), and by the Secretary of Commerce to the 
Director, Office of Industrial Resource Administration (OIRA).

                          C. General Provisions

    1. This Understanding covers only food and agricultural commodities 
and products

[[Page 101]]

which have industrial uses. Jurisdiction over such commodities will 
normally pass to Commerce at the point where the foods are no longer 
capable of being eaten or drunk, except as otherwise provided.
    2. The provisions of this Understanding covering fibers are limited 
to those specifically mentioned in E.O. 10480 and 11490 (i.e., cotton, 
wool, mohair, hemp and flax fiber), and have the purpose of defining the 
points at which these fibers lose their identity as agricultural 
commodities or agricultural products.
    3. Both Agriculture and Commerce have jurisdiction over the major 
food commodities listed in section D of this Understanding. For each of 
these commodities, the point at which the jurisdiction of Agriculture 
will end is indicated and, except as otherwise provided, the 
jurisdiction of Commerce will begin at that point.
    (a) The points at which the jurisdiction of Agriculture will 
terminate are expressed in terms of a particular stage of production or 
processing pursuant to the authority provided in E.O. 10480 and 11490, 
and at a point considered to be most administratively feasible.
    (b) Consideration is given wherever possible to the structure of an 
industry. The wet-milling industry, for example, is large and integrated 
and it is desirable that Agriculture have jurisdiction over the raw 
products while they are a part of this industry and until they enter the 
processes of other industries which result in their becoming nonfood or 
nonagricultural products. As an illustration, corn starch for textile 
sizing would be under the jurisdiction of Agriculture while it is being 
extracted from the corn and prepared for use by the textile industry. It 
would still be under the jurisdiction of Agriculture until it enters the 
textile manufacturing process. At this point, jurisdiction over this 
commodity shifts to Commerce.
    (c) Commodities such as fats and oils, grain products, egg products, 
starch from all sources, spices, and tartaric acid are used for the 
manufacture of so many nonfood or nonagricultural products that it is 
not practical to enumerate all of these products in section D and to 
identify in each case the exact beginning process. Consequently, the 
principle for determining the respective jurisdiction of the two 
Departments in cases of this type is expressed broadly and supplemented 
by a few examples of nonfood and nonagricultural products so as to 
clarify the application of the principle. These examples are not 
intended to be all-inclusive.
    4. Imports and exports of food and agricultural commodities and 
products in any form prior to industrial uses are within the 
jurisdiction of Agriculture, subject to meeting requirements that may be 
imposed by any other agency in the exercise of its authority.
    5. Agriculture will, with noted exceptions, allocate and exercise 
priority controls on food and agricultural commodities and products, 
taking into account claims presented by Commerce. However, the 
suballocation of food and agricultural commodities or products for 
conversion into non-food and non-agricultural commodities or products 
will be made in accordance with the recommendations of Commerce.
    6. It is understood that relationships between Agriculture and 
Commerce involving jurisdiction over particular functions and particular 
commodities may have to be amplified at a later time. It is also 
recognized that there will be situations in which operations of the same 
person, as defined in section 702(a) of the Defense Production Act of 
1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2152(a)), will be affected by the 
exercise of the respective authorities of the two Departments under this 
Understanding. To avoid overlapping and duplication of reporting and 
related operations in such situations, it is agreed that the two 
Departments will work out specific cooperative arrangements whereby the 
facilities of one shall be utilized by the other and that efforts will 
be made to provide the most feasible arrangements for administering 
necessary program controls.
    7. To assure that both Agriculture and Commerce have full authority 
to implement their respective responsibilities under E.O. 10480 and 
11490, and DMO 3, as well as to effectuate the provisions of this 
Understanding, each Department delegates to the other the requisite 
authority for the exercise of priorities and allocations functions as 
set forth in this Understanding.

                        D. Particular Commodities

    The following list identifies some major food and agricultural 
commodities and commodity groups in which both Agriculture and Commerce 
have an interest and provides the point at which Agriculture's 
jurisdiction ends and Commerce's jurisdiction begins. This list is not 
all-inclusive but it does cover the major items for which jurisdiction 
might become an issue.
    1. Agriculture shall have jurisdiction over the following 
commodities until they enter any manufacturing process and lose their 
identity as food or as agricultural commodities or products (examples 
are set forth in parentheses after the name of the commodity):
    (a) Egg products. (Shampoos, products used in printing, 
pharmaceuticals)
    (b) Fats and oils. (Paints, soap, varnishes, lacquers, printer's 
ink, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals)
    (c) Fatty acids. (Paints, soap, cosmetics, chemicals, 
pharmaceuticals)
    (d) Grain and grain products, including dextrin, corn syrups, grain 
sugars, lactic acid, gluten, and low-grade wheat flour.

[[Page 102]]

(Textiles, adhesives, leather, core binders, pharmaceuticals, 
nonbeverage alcohol)
    (e) Molasses, including blackstrap and high-test, and potatoes. 
(Nonbeverage alcohol)
    (f) Spices, essential oils. (Cosmetics)
    (g) Starches. (Adhesives, asbestos, textiles, explosives)
    (h) Sugars. (Insecticides, plasticizing agents, adhesives)
    (i) Tartaric acid. (Products used in photography, dyeing, textile 
printing)
    2. Agriculture shall have jurisdiction over the following 
commodities until the specifically designated point in their processing, 
except as otherwise provided:
    (a) Cotton lint and linters, hemp and flax fiber--When the bale is 
opened for the purpose of processing in the mill in which it is opened. 
This authority shall extend to the delivery and distribution of soft 
types of cotton waste but shall not include control over the use of such 
waste in the mill producing it.
    (b) Milk and milk products--When the milk and milk products enter a 
plant where they are to be used or processed for industrial purposes as 
distinct from use as human food or animal feed. Agriculture shall have 
jurisdiction over imports of milk and milk products intended for use as 
human food or animal feed, while Commerce shall have jurisdiction over 
imports intended for industrial purposes only.
    (c) Wool and mohair--When the wool and mohair (grease and scoured, 
shorn and pulled) enter a plant where they are to be used, or 
manufactured into a final product. Inventories of scoured wool or 
scoured mohair held by manufacturers for their use in producing other 
products, whether by incorporation into such products or otherwise, 
shall be controlled by Commerce. The jurisdiction of Agriculture shall 
extend to the delivery and distribution of noils but shall not include 
control over the use of noils by the mill producing them.
    (d) Naval stores:
    (1) Tall oil (sulfate naval stores). Commerce shall have 
jurisdiction over the production, distribution, processing, and 
allocation. The distribution of tall oil fatty acids shall be under the 
jurisdiction of Agriculture.
    (2) Wood. Commerce shall have jurisdiction over production, 
distribution, processing, and allocation.
    (3) Gum. Agriculture shall have jurisdiction over production through 
the first processing of the gum. Commerce shall have jurisdiction over 
allocation.
    (4) Commerce will consult with Agriculture before allocating naval 
stores in order to avoid conflict with programs administered by 
Agriculture.
    3. The following commodities are under the jurisdiction of the 
designated Department:
    (a) Ice--Agriculture.
    (b) Tobacco and tobacco products--Agriculture.
    (c) Hides and leather, hair and bristles, feathers, soap. 
detergents, beeswax, pharmaceuticals (including medicines and vitamins), 
acetic acid, chemical leavening compounds and salt--Commerce.
    4. In order to further clarify the division of authority for fats 
and oils, Schedule A to this Understanding lists major fats and oils, 
and fat and oil products, over which Agriculture has jurisdiction and 
the major products of fats and oils, and products produced using fats 
and oils, over which Commerce has jurisdiction.
    5. It is recognized that quantities of certain commodities may be 
needed for food use which are under the jurisdiction of Commerce. 
Conversely, raw materials for manufacturing may be needed which are 
under the jurisdiction of Agriculture. In situations of this kind and 
for other similar commodities not listed in this section, working

Departments of Energy and Commerce--Memorandum of Understanding Between 
 the Departments of Energy and Commerce Concerning the Jurisdiction and 
    Responsibilities for Products and Equipment Associated with the 
     Production of Petroleum and Gas for Emergency Preparedness and 
                              Mobilization

                               A. Purpose

    This Understanding sets forth the jurisdiction and responsibilities 
of the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Commerce (DOC) 
for defense mobilization, emergency preparedness, and resource 
management programs under the authorities listed in section B, in the 
event of a national emergency, as such programs relate to the production 
and distribution of: (1) chemicals and fluids made especially for use in 
the petroleum and gas industry; (2) oil and gas field machinery and 
equipment; and (3) petrochemicals derived from oil, gas, and natural gas 
liquids.

                              B. Authority

    1. Pursuant to section 201(a) of Executive Order 10480, as amended 
(E.O. 10480), Defense Mobilization Order 3 (DMO 3) (44 CFR 322) 
delegates authority for the administration of priorities and allocations 
functions under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 
U.S.C. app. 2061, et seq.), to the Secretary of Energy with respect to 
petroleum, gas, solid fuels, and electric power; and to the Secretary of 
Commerce with respect to all other materials and facilities not 
specifically delegated to other agencies.
    2. Executive Order 11490, as amended (E.O. 11490), delegates to the 
Secretary of Commerce the authority for preparing national emergency 
plans and developing preparedness programs covering the production and 
distribution of all materials, and the use of all production facilities 
except those that are specifically assigned to, or under the 
jurisdiction of, other agencies. Such an exception is provided for the 
production and distribution of, and the use of facilities for, petroleum 
and gas. E.O. 11490 provides for the delegation of this authority to the 
Secretary of Energy.
    3. The functions delegated by these authorities to the Secretaries 
of Energy and Commerce have been redelegated by the Secretary of Energy 
to the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Protection, Safety, and 
Emergency Preparedness, and by the Secretary of Commerce to the 
Director, Office of Industrial Resource Administration (OIRA).

                      C. Departmental Jurisdiction

    The primary use of a product or material is the basis for the 
division of Departmental jurisdiction set forth below. Any product or 
material not specifically identified in this Understanding which is used 
primarily as a fuel or in a primary manufacturing process to produce 
fuel, is under the jurisdiction of DOE. Generally, any non-fuel product 
or material, or any product or material which is used primarily as an 
industrial raw material, is under the jurisdiction of DOC. In the event 
that questions arise with respect to jurisdiction over particular 
products, materials, or production facilities, it is agreed that the two 
Departments will resolve these questions in such a manner as to provide 
the most feasible arrangements for program administration.
    1. Production.
    Department of Energy: DOE has jurisdiction over the production of: 
(a) petroleum and gaseous fuels, natural gas liquids, and petroleum 
lubricants, including ``refinery finished products,'' ``unfinished 
oils,'' and ``petrochemical feedstocks''; (b) ``petrochemicals'' from 
processing units located within a petroleum refinery where the weight of 
``petrochemicals'' in the output of the processing unit constitutes less 
than 30 percent by weight of the net input to the unit; (c) n-paraffin 
``petrochemical intermediates''; (d) ``special petroleum chemical 
supplies''; and (e) any fossil fuel or synthetic product not 
specifically indentified which is or can be used as a fuel or lubricant.
    Department of Commerce: DOC has jurisdiction over the production of: 
(a) all ``chemicals'' including ``petroleum processing catalysts'' and 
``fuel combustion improvers''; and (b) ``petrochemicals'' including 
those from processing units located within a petroleum refinery where 
the weight of ``petrochemcials'' in the output of the processing unit 
constitutes 30 percent or more by weight of the net input to the unit; 
and (c) oil and gas field machinery and equipment as identified in 
Schedule A to this Understanding, as well as any machinery, equipment, 
and technologies not yet developed for obtaining petroleum and natural 
gas.
    2. Facilities.
    Department of Energy: DOE has jurisdiction over all facilities for 
which production jurisdiction has been assigned to it by this 
Understanding.
    Department of Commerce: DOC has jurisdiction over all facilities for 
which production jurisdiction has been assigned to it by this 
Understanding.
    3. Distribution.
    Department of Energy: DOE has jurisdiction over the distribution of: 
(a) all petroleum, gaseous fuels (when such jurisdiction as authorized 
by E.O. 11490 is not exercised by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission), natural gas liquids, and petroleum lubricants; (b) all 
``special petroleum chemical supplies,'' ``petroleum processing 
catalysts,'' and ``fuel combustion improvers''; (c) ``petrochemical 
feedstocks'' except those produced

[[Page 107]]

or gathered specifically for a chemical operation; (e) any other fossil 
fuel or synthetic product which is or can be used as a fuel; and (f) oil 
and gas field machinery and equipment as identified in Schedule A to 
this Understanding, as well as any machinery, equipment, and 
technologies not yet developed for obtaining petroleum and natural gas.
    Department of Commerce: DOC has jurisdiction over the distribution 
of: (a) all ``chemicals'' including ``petrochemicals'' but excluding 
those chemical product groups assigned to DOE; (b) ``petrochemical 
feedstocks'' specifically produced or gathered for a chemical operation; 
and (c) ``non-fuel or non-lubricant petroleum products.''

                             D. Definitions

    Under this Understanding, the term ``petroleum'' means crude oil, 
synthetic liquid fuel, their products and associated hydrocarbons, 
including pipelines for their movement and facilities specially designed 
for their storage; and the term ``gas'' means natural gas (excluding 
helium) and manufactured gas (but not industrial gases), including 
pipelines for their movement and facilities specially designed for their 
storage, when such juridiction as authorized by E.O. 11490 is not 
exercised by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For the purpose 
of assigning jurisdiction under this Understanding, the following 
additional definitions shall apply:
    1. ``Petrochemical Feedstocks''
    Includes hydrocarbon materials obtained from petroleum and natural 
gas when used as ``feedstock'' or raw material for the production of 
``primary petrochemicals'' or ``petrochemical intermediates.'' These 
materials also include:
    Natural gas (methane) processed to a quality suitable for pipeline 
transmission;
    Natural gas liquids which are the several low boiling point, lower 
molecular weight hydrocarbons that include ethane, propane, butanes, 
pentanes, and liquified petroleum gases obtained from the processing of 
natural gas;
    Naphtha (light petroleum liquids) which is a medium boiling point 
range mixture of hydrocarbons obtained from the processing of natural 
gas, crude oil, or petroleum refining. Naphtha is the major component of 
gasoline. The usual distillation range of naphtha feedstock is 100-
400 deg. F; and
    Gas oil (heavy petroleum liquids) which is a high boiling point 
mixture of hydrocarbons obtained from the processing of crude oil or 
petroleum refining. Gas oil is the major component of distillate grades 
of fuel oil. Atmospheric gas oil may comprise hydrocarbons in the 
distillation range 400-650 deg. F; vacuum gas oil may comprise higher 
boiling materials in the distillation range 650-1000 deg. F.
    2. ``Chemicals''
    For the purpose of this Understanding, ``chemicals'' shall comprise 
those products listed under Major Group 28, Chemical and Allied 
Products, Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1977 Edition; and 
shall specifically include ``petrochemicals,'' ``petroleum processing 
catalysts,'' ``fuel combustion improvers''; but shall exclude ``special 
petroleum chemical supplies.''
    3. ``Petrochemicals''
    Chemical materials which, directly or indirectly, are manufactured 
from petrochemical feedstock hydrocarbons. These materials include:
    Primary petrochemicals produced directly from feedstocks by chemical 
conversion or breakdown and mainly used for the production of 
``intermediates'' or petrochemical ``products'';
    Petrochemical intermediates generally produced by chemical converson 
of primary petrochemicals to form more complicated derived compounds. 
Such compounds serve as the raw material for synthesis of petrochemical 
``products,'' and for numerous other materials; and
    Petrochemical products which are end products of the chemical 
industry produced by chemical conversion of ``primary'' petrochemicals 
or petrochemical ``intermediates.''
    4. ``Refinery Finished Products''
    Any one of the petroleum oils or mixtures of oils which can be used 
without further processing, including:

    Liquified petroleum gases (LPG);
    Gasoline;
    Jet fuel;
    Naphtha;
    Distillate fuel oils;
    Lubricating oils and greases;
    Residual fuel oils;
    Asphalt; and
    Natural gas products--natural gasoline.

    5. ``Unfinished Oils''
    Semi-finished refinery products, or unseparated mixtures of refinery 
products, which are further processed for production of ``refinery 
finished products.''
    6. ``Special Petroleum Chemical Supplies''
    Products made especially for use in the production, refining and 
compounding of petroleum fuels and lubricants, including:
    Hydrogen produced in a refinery for use in petroleum processing; and
    Special additives:

for fuels and lubricants;
to facilitate the drilling of oil and gas wells;
to stimulate the production of oil and gas for enhanced oil recovery; 
and
to facilitate the pipeline transmission of petroleum.

    7. ``Non-fuel or Non-lubricant Petroleum Products''
    Certain products produced in the course of the refining of petroleum 
whose primary

[[Page 108]]

uses are other than as fuels or lubricants, such as:

    Asphalts;
    Coke, petroleum--green and calcined;
    Cresylic acids;
    Naphthenic acids;
    Oils, rubber extending;
    Solvents--aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons;
    Waxes, refined--paraffin and micro-crystalline; and
    White oils, petrolatums, and other oils for medicinal, 
pharmaceutical and cosmetic purposes.

    8. ``Petroleum Processing Catalysts''
    Solid inorganic compositions used in petroleum refining to 
facilitate the conversion of hydrocarbons by chemical reaction, 
including:

    Catalytic cracking;
    Hydrocracking;
    Reforming;
    Isomerization;
    Desulfurization; and
    Hydrotreating.
    9. ``Fuel Combustion Improvers''
    Chemical compostions added to liquid petroleum fuels to improve 
combustion characteristics, including:
    Ethanol (ethyl alcohol);
    Methanol (methyl alcohol);
    Methyl tertiary butyl ether;
    Tertiary butyl alcohol;
    Tetraethyl lead and tetramethyl lead, and their blends for use as 
anti-knock materials; and
    Other products such as amyl nitrate, hexyl nitrate, n-methyl 
aniline, and the manganese-methyl cyclopentadiene complexes.

                       E. Delegation of Authority

    To ensure that DOE and DOC have the requisite authority to implement 
their responsibilities under E.O. 10480 and 11490, and DMO 3, as well as 
to effectuate the provisions of this Understanding, each Department 
delegates to the other its authority for the exercise of priorities and 
allocations functions under Section 101(a) of the Defense Production Act 
of 1950, as amended, with respect to the facilities, materials, and 
products specified in this Understanding.

                            F. Effective Date

    This Memorandum of Understanding shall take effect August 29, 1984, 
superseding the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the 
Interior and the Department of Commerce that became effective on October 
30, 1973 (38 FR 30896, November 8, 1973). The Department of the

 Departments of the Interior and Commerce--Memorandum of Understanding 
  Between the Departments of the Interior and Commerce Concerning the 
 Jurisdiction and Responsibilities for Certain Minerals, Facilities and 
                 Materials; and Delegation of Authority

                               A. Purpose

    This Understanding sets forth the jurisdiction and responsibilities 
of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce for 
defense mobilization, emergency preparedness programs, and resource 
management in the event of a national emergency as they relate to stages 
of processing and types of facilities concerning certain minerals. This 
Understanding also provides for a delegation of certain authority to the 
Secretary of the Interior which is presently assigned to the Secretary 
of Commerce.

                              B. Authority

    1. Section 201(a) of Executive Order 10480, as amended (E.O. 10480), 
and Defense Mobilization Order 3 (DMO 3) (44 CFR 322), provide for the 
delegation of authority to the Secretary of Commerce for administration 
of priorities and allocations functions under the Defense Production Act 
of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2061, et seq.), for materials and 
facilities not specifically delegated to other agencies. Section 602 of 
E.O. 10480 provides for redelegation of this authority.
    2. Section 901 et seq. of E.O. 11490 provides for the delegation of 
authority to the Secretary of Commerce for preparing national emergency 
plans and developing preparedness programs covering the production and 
distribution of all materials and the use of all production facilities, 
except those that are specifically assigned to, or under the 
jurisdiction of, other agencies. Such an exception is provided for the 
production and related distribution of minerals. Section 701 et seq. of 
E.O. 11490 provides for the delegation of this authority to the 
Secretary of the Interior.
    3. Section 702(5) of E.O. 11490 defines the term ``minerals'' to 
mean:

* * * all raw materials of mineral origin * * * obtained by mining and 
like operations and processed through the stages specified and at the 
facilities designated in an agreement between the Secretary of Commerce 
as being within the emergency preparedness responsibilities of the 
Secretary of the Interior.

This Understanding implements this requirement.
    4. The functions delegated by these authorities to the Secretaries 
of Commerce and the Interior have been redelegated by the Secretary of 
Commerce to the Director, Office of Industrial Resource Administration 
(OIRA), and by the Secretary of the Interior to the Director, Bureau of 
Mines.

                    C. Departmental Responsibilities

    1. Department of the Interior. Schedule A to this Understanding 
contains a listing of mineral commodities and related facilities and 
materials. With respect to the mineral commodities listed in Column 1 of

 Appendix IV to Part 700--Memorandum of Understanding on Priorities and 
  Allocations Support Between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the 
               Canadian Department of Supply and Services

                               A. Purpose

    Since 1950, the United States and Canada have been assisting each 
other on priorities and allocations for programs important to the 
defense of both nations. Details on the implementation of that 
assistance were spelled out in the U.S. Defense Priorities System 
Regulation No. 2 (DPS Reg. 2), Operations of the Priorities and 
Allocations System between Canada and the United States (15 CFR part 
351). The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation 
(15 CFR part 700) supersedes the Defense Materials System and Defense 
Priorities System regulations (15 CFR parts 330 through 351), including 
DPS Reg. 2. While the revised regulation addresses the procedures for 
obtaining priorities and allocations support from the United States and 
Canada, it does not fully detail the working relationship between the 
United States and Canada. Accordingly, the following Memorandum of 
Understanding is set forth between the U.S. Department of Commerce and 
the Canadian Department of Supply and Services.

                               B. General

    1. The Office of Industrial Resource Administration, U.S. Department 
of Commerce (DOC), is the United States point of contact for the 
Canadian government with respect to priorities and allocations.
    2. The Supply Information and Data Management Branch, Canadian 
Department of Supply and Services (DSS), is the Canadian point of 
contact for the U.S. government with respect to priorities and 
allocations.

                      C. Priority Rating Authority

    1. DOC will authorize the DSS to use priority ratings, including 
those for the procurement of controlled materials, in the United States 
in support of the following programs authorized by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency:

D1--Canadian Military Programs
D2--Canadian Production and Construction
D3--Canadian Atomic Energy Program

    2. DOC must receive requests for priority rating authority, by 
program, at least ninety days in advance of the calendar quarter in 
which the authorization is required. Requests with respect to controlled 
materials requirements must be received at least 240 days in advance of 
the calendar quarter in which authorization is required.

                             D. DX Authority

    DSS may authorize the use of the ``DX'' rating symbol for 
procurements in the United States which are in support of U.S. ``DX'' 
rated programs.

        E. Items Which Will Not Receive Priority Rating Authority

    Priority ratings may not be used for procurements in the United 
States of (1) civilian items for resale in Military Exchanges or the 
packaging for such items; (2) material purchased from exclusively retail 
establishments; (3) direct procurement of those Federal Supply 
Classification classes, groups, or items specified in Attachment A to 
this Understanding, unless those items are to be used as production 
material for an authorized program; or (4) procurement of items to be 
used primarily for administrative purposes, such as for personnel or 
financial management.

                    F. Special Priorities Assistance

    1. DOC will provide special priorities assistance as needed to 
Canadian procurements in the United States which are in support of D1, 
D2, and D3 programs when requests for such assistance are sponsored by 
DSS.
    2. DSS will provide assistance to United States procurements in 
Canada which are in support of authorized programs when requests for 
such assistance are sponsored by DOC.

                          G. Forms and Reports

    1. Canadian requests for special priorities assistance from the 
United States will be submitted to DOC on Form ITA-999, ``Request for 
Special Priorities Assistance''.
    2. Requests for priority rating authority will be submitted to DOC 
on Form DSS-1451-1, ``Application for U.S. Priority Rating Covering 
Importation of Quarterly Requirements of Materials from the United 
States'', on Form DSS-1451-2, ``Application for U.S. Priority Rating 
Covering Specific Materials'', or other forms as may be established by 
DSS.
    3. DSS will report monthly on the number of rating authorizations 
and their dollar value against DOC rating authorizations during the 
previous month.
    4. DSS will report, two months following the close of each calendar 
quarter, the number and quantity of controlled materials allotments 
issued against DOC authorizations for each program during that quarter.
    5. United States requests for assistance from Canada will be 
submitted to DSS by letter.

[[Page 118]]

                              H. Compliance

    1. DSS will ensure that Canadian Government personnel and Canadian 
defense contractors are in compliance with the provisions of the DPAS 
when placing rated orders in the United States, including those for 
controlled materials.
    2. DOC will ensure that U.S. Government personnel and U.S. 
contractors are in compliance with the provisions of the DPAS when 
placing rated orders in Canada, including controlled materials.
    3. The DSS will inform DOC of any alleged violations of the DPAS of 
which it may become aware.

                               I. Training

    1. The DSS will develop and implement training programs on the DPAS 
for appropriate Canadian Government procurement and contract 
administration personnel and contractor personnel.
    2. DOC will develop and implement training programs on the DPAS for 
appropriate U.S. Government procurement and contract administration 
personnel and contractor personnel.
    3. DSS and DOC training programs shall be coordinated to ensure the 
conduct of a comprehensive program and to minimize duplication.

                            J. Effective Date

    This Memorandum of Understanding shall take effect August 29, 1984.

<R05>
Sec. 701.1  Purpose.

    The Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 require the Secretary 
of Commerce to promulgate regulations for U.S. firms entering into 
contracts for the sale of defense articles or defense services to 
foreign countries or foreign firms that are subject to offset agreements 
exceeding $5,000,000 in value to furnish information regarding such 
agreements. The Secretary of Commerce has designated the Bureau of 
Export Administration as the organization responsible for implementing 
this provision. The information provided by U.S. firms will be 
aggregated and used to determine the impact of offset transactions on 
the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and 
trade of the United States. Summary reports will be submitted annually 
to the Congress pursuant Section 309 of the Defense Production Act of 
1950, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 701.2  Definitions.

    (a) Offsets--Compensation practices required as a condition of 
purchase in either government-to-government or commercial sales of 
defense articles and/or defense services as defined by the Arms Export 
Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
    (b) Military Export Sales--Exports that are either Foreign Military 
Sales (FMS) or commercial (direct) sales of defense articles and/or 
defense services as defined by the Arms Export Control Act and 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
    (c) Prime Contractor--A firm that has a sales contract with a 
foreign entity or with the U.S. Government for military export sales.
    (d) United States--Includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories.
    (e) Offset Agreement--Any offset as defined above that the U.S. firm 
agrees to in order to conclude a military export sales contract. This 
includes all offsets, whether they are ``best effort'' agreements or are 
subject to penalty clauses.
    (f) Offset Transaction--Any activity for which the U.S. firm claims 
credit for full or partial fulfillment of the offset agreement. 
Activities to implement offset agreements may include, but are not 
limited to, coproduction, licensed production, subcontractor production, 
overseas investment, technology transfer countertrade, barter, 
counterpurchase, and buy back.
    (g) Direct Offset--Contractual arrangements that involve defense 
articles and services referenced in the sales agreement for military 
exports.
    (h) Indirect Offset--Contractual arrangements that involve defense 
goods and services unrelated to the exports referenced in the sales 
agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 701.3  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This rule applies to U.S. firms entering contracts for the sale 
of defense articles or defense services (as defined in the Arms Export 
Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations) to a foreign 
country or foreign firm for which the contract is subject to an offset 
agreement exceeding $5,000,000 in value.
    (b) This rule applies to all offset transactions completed in 
performance of existing offset commitments since January 1, 1993 for 
which offset credit of $250,000 or more has been claimed from the 
foreign representative, and new offset agreements entered into since 
that time.


<R05>
Sec. 701.4  Procedures.

    (a) To avoid double counting, firms should report only offset 
transactions for which they are directly responsible for reporting to 
the foreign customer (i.e., prime contractors should report for their 
subcontractors if the subcontractors are not a direct party to the 
offset agreement).
    (b) Reports should be delivered to the Offsets Program Manager, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, Office of Strategic Industries and Economic 
Security, Bureau of Export Administration, Room 3878, 14th Street and 
Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington DC 20230. The first industry 
reports should be submitted to the Bureau of Export Administration not 
later than March 15, 1995 and should cover offset transactions completed 
during the calendar year 1993, as well as information regarding 
unfulfilled offset agreements. After this initial submission, companies 
should provide information once yearly

[[Page 120]]

not later than June 15 covering the preceding calendar year. All 
submissions should include a point of contact (name and telephone 
number) and should be by a company official authorized to provide such 
information.

Sec. 705.2  Purpose.

    These regulations set forth the procedures by which the Department 
shall commence and conduct an investigation to determine the effect on 
the national security of the imports of any article. Based on this 
investigation, the Secretary shall make a report and recommendation to 
the President for action or inaction regarding an adjustment of the

article.


<R05>
Sec. 705.4  Criteria for determining effect of imports on the national security.

    (a) To determine the effect on the national security of the imports 
of the article under investigation, the Department shall consider the 
quantity of the article in question or other circumstances related to 
its import. With regard for the requirements of national security, the 
Department shall also consider the following:
    (1) Domestic production needed for projected national defense 
requirements;
    (2) The capacity of domestic industries to meet projected national 
defense requirements;
    (3) The existing and anticipated availabilities of human resources, 
products, raw materials, production equipment and facilities, and other 
supplies and services essential to the national defense;
    (4) The growth requirements of domestic industries to meet national 
defense requirements and the supplies and services including the 
investment, exploration and development necessary to assure such growth; 
and
    (5) Any other relevant factors.
    (b) In recognition of the close relation between the strength of our 
national economy and the capacity of the United States to meet national 
security requirements, the Department shall also, with regard for the 
quantity, availability, character and uses of the imported article under 
investigation, consider the following:
    (1) The impact of foreign competition on the economic welfare of any 
domestic industry essential to our national security;
    (2) The displacement of any domestic products causing substantial 
unemployment, decrease in the revenues of government, loss of investment 
or specialized skills and productive capacity, or other serious effects; 
and

of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (b) When a request, application or motion is under investigation, or 
when an investigation has been completed pursuant to Sec. 705.10 of this 
part, any subsequently filed request or application concerning imports 
of the same or related article that does not raise new or different 
issues may be either consolidated with the investigation in progress as 
provided in Sec. 705.7(e) of this part, or rejected. In either event, an 
explanation for taking such action shall be promptly given to the 
applicant. If the request or application is rejected, it will not be 
returned unless requested by the applicant.
    (c) Requests or applications shall describe how the quantity, 
availability, character, and uses of a particular imported article, or 
other circumstances related to its import, affect the national security, 
and shall contain the following information to the fullest extent 
possible:
    (1) Identification of the applicant;
    (2) A precise description of the article;
    (3) Description of the domestic industry affected, including 
pertinent information regarding companies and their plants, locations, 
capacity and current output of the industry;
    (4) Pertinent statistics on imports and domestic production showing 
the quantities and values of the article;
    (5) Nature, sources, and degree of the competition created by 
imports of the article;
    (6) The effect that imports of the article may have upon the 
restoration of domestic production capacity in the event of national 
emergency;
    (7) Employment and special skills involved in the domestic 
production of the article;
    (8) Extent to which the national economy, employment, investment, 
specialized skills, and productive capacity is or will be adversely 
affected;
    (9) Revenues of Federal, State, or local Governments which are or 
may be adversely affected;
    (10) National security supporting uses of the article including data 
on applicable contracts or sub-contracts, both past and current; and
    (11) Any other information or advice relevant and material to the 
subject matter of the investigation.
    (d) Statistical material presented should be, if possible, on a 
calendar-year basis for sufficient periods of time to indicate trends.

included as well as any other breakdowns which may be pertinent to show 
seasonal or short-term factors.


<R05>
Sec. 705.6  Confidential information.

    (a) Any information or material which the applicant or any other 
party desires to submit in confidence at any stage of the investigation 
that would disclose national security classified information or business 
confidential information (trade secrets, commercial or financial 
information, or any other information considered senstitive or 
privileged), shall be submitted on separate sheets with the clear legend 
``National Security Classified'' or ``Business Confidential,'' as 
appropriate, marked at the top of each sheet. Any information or 
material submitted that is identified as national security classified 
must be accompanied at the time of filing by a statement indicating the 
degree of classification, the authority for the classification, and the 
identity of the classifying entity. By submitting information or 
material identified as business confidential, the applicant or other 
party represents that the information is exempted from public 
disclosure, either by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552 et 
seq.) or by some other specific statutory exemption. Any request for

<R05>
Sec. 730.1  What these regulations cover.

    In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The EAR are 
issued by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export 
Administration (BXA) under laws relating to the control of certain 
exports, reexports, and activities. In addition, the EAR implement 
antiboycott law provisions requiring regulations to prohibit specified 
conduct by United States persons that has the effect of furthering or 
supporting boycotts fostered or imposed by a country against a country 
friendly to United States. Supplement No. 1 to part 730 lists the 
control numbers assigned to information collection requirements under 
the EAR by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995.


<R05>
Sec. 730.2  Statutory authority.

    The EAR have been designed primarily to implement the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended, 50 U.S.C. app. 2401-2420 (EAA). 
There are numerous other legal authorities underlying the EAR. These are 
listed in the Federal Register documents promulgating the EAR and at the 
beginning of each part of the EAR in the Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR). From time to time, the President has exercised authority under 
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act with respect to the EAR 
(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706 (IEEPA)). The EAA is not permanent legislation, and 
when it has lapsed, Presidential executive orders under IEEPA have 
directed and authorized the continuation in force of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 730.3  Dual use exports.

    The convenient term dual use is sometimes used to distinguish the

[[Page 126]]

types of items covered by the EAR from those that are covered by the 
regulations of certain other U.S. government departments and agencies 
with export licensing responsibilities. In general, the term dual use 
serves to distinguish EAR-controlled items that can be used both in 
military and other strategic uses (e.g., nuclear) and commercial 
applications. In general, the term dual use serves to distinguish EAR-
controlled items that can be used both in military and other strategic 
uses and in civil applications from those that are weapons and military 
related use or design and subject to the controls of the Department of 
State or subject to the nuclear related controls of the Department of 
Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Note, however, that 
although the short-hand term dual use may be employed to refer to the 
entire scope of the EAR, the EAR also apply to some items that have 
solely civil uses.


<R05>
Sec. 730.4  Other control agencies and departments.

    In addition to the departments and agencies mentioned in Sec. 730.3 
of this part, other departments and agencies have jurisdiction over 
certain narrower classes of exports and reexports. These include the 
Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which 
administers controls against certain countries that are the object of 
sanctions affecting not only exports and reexports, but also imports and 
financial dealings. For your convenience, Supplement No. 3 to part 730 
identifies other departments and agencies with regulatory jurisdiction 
over certain types of exports and reexports. This is not a comprehensive 
list, and the brief descriptions are only generally indicative of the 
types of controls administered and/or enforced by each agency.


<R05>
Sec. 730.5  Coverage of more than exports.

    The core of the export control provisions of the EAR concerns 
exports from the United States. You will find, however, that some 
provisions give broad meaning to the term ``export'', apply to 
transactions outside of the United States, or apply to activities other 
than exports.
    (a) Reexports. Commodities, software, and technology that have been 
exported from the United States are generally subject to the EAR with 
respect to reexport. Many such reexports, however, may go to many 
destinations without a license or will qualify for an exception from 
licensing requirements.
    (b) Foreign products. In some cases, authorization to export 
technology from the United States will be subject to assurances that 
items produced abroad that are the direct product of that technology 
will not be exported to certain destinations without authorization from 
BXA.
    (c) Scope of ``exports''. Certain actions that you might not regard 
as an ``export'' in other contexts do constitute an export subject to 
the EAR. The release of technology to a foreign national in the United 
States through such means as demonstration or oral briefing is deemed an 
export. Other examples of exports under the EAR include the return of 
foreign equipment to its country of origin after repair in the United 
States, shipments from a U.S. foreign trade zone, and the electronic 
transmission of non-public data that will be received abroad.
    (d) U.S. person activities. To counter the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction, the EAR restrict the involvement of ``United States 
persons'' anywhere in the world in exports of foreign-origin items, or 
in providing services or support, that may contribute to such 
proliferation. The EAR also restrict technical assistance by U.S. 
persons with respect to encryption commodities or software.
[61 FR 12734, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68577, Dec. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 730.6  Control purposes.

    The export control provisions of the EAR are intended to serve the 
national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation, and short supply 
interests of the United States and, in some cases, to carry out its 
international obligations. Some controls are designed to restrict access 
to dual use items by countries or persons that might apply such items to 
uses inimical to U.S. interests. These include controls designed to stem 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and controls designed

[[Page 127]]

to limit the military and terrorism support capability of certain 
countries. The effectiveness of many of the controls under the EAR is 
enhanced by their being maintained as part of multilateral control 
arrangements. Multilateral export control cooperation is sought through 
arrangements such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, 
and the Missile Technology Control Regime. The EAR also include some 
export controls to protect the United States from the adverse impact of 
the unrestricted export of commodities in short supply.


<R05>
Sec. 730.7  License requirements and exceptions.

    A relatively small percentage of exports and reexports subject to 
the EAR require an application to BXA for a license. Many items are not 
on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to Sec. 774.1 of 
the EAR), or, if on the CCL, require a license to only a limited number 
of countries. Other transactions may be covered by one or more of the 
License Exceptions in the EAR. In such cases no application need be made 
to BXA.


<R05>
Sec. 730.8  How to proceed and where to get help.

    (a) How the EAR are organized. The Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) are structured in a logical manner. In dealing with the EAR you 
may find it helpful to be aware of the overall organization of these 
regulations. In order to determine what the rules are and what you need 
to do, review the titles and the introductory sections of the parts of 
the EAR.
    (1) How do you go about determining your obligations under the EAR? 
Part 732 of the EAR provides steps you may follow to determine your 
obligations under the EAR. You will find guidance to enable you to tell 
whether or not your transaction is subject to the EAR and, if it is, 
whether it qualifies for a License Exception or must be authorized 
through issuance of a license.
    (2) Are your items or activities subject to the EAR at all? Part 734 
of the EAR defines the items and activities that are subject to the EAR. 
Note that the definition of ``items subject to the EAR'' includes, but 
is not limited to, items listed on the Commerce Control List in part 774 
of the EAR.
    (3) If subject to the EAR, what do the EAR require? Part 736 of the 
EAR lists all the prohibitions that are contained in the EAR. Note that 
certain prohibitions (General Prohibitions One through Three) apply to 
items as indicated on the CCL, and others (General Prohibitions Four 
through Ten) prohibit certain activities and apply to all items subject 
to the EAR unless otherwise indicated.
    (4) Do you need a license for your item or activity? What policies 
will BXA apply if you do need to submit license application? The EAR 
have four principal ways of describing license requirements:
    (i) The EAR may require a license to a country if your item is 
listed on the CCL and the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR tells 
that a license is required to that country. Virtually all Export Control 
Classification Numbers (ECCN) on the CCL are covered by the Country 
Chart in part 738 of the EAR. That part identifies the limited number of 
entries that are not included on the Chart. These ECCNs will state the 
specific countries that require a license or refer you to a self-
contained section, i.e., Short Supply in part 754 of the EAR, or 
Embargoes in part 746 of the EAR. If a license is required, you should 
consult part 740 of the EAR which describes the License Exception that 
may be available for items on the CCL. Part 742 of the EAR describes the 
licensing policies that BXA will apply in reviewing an application you 
file. Note that part 754 of the EAR on short supply controls and part 
746 on embargoes are self-contained parts that include the available 
exceptions and licensing policy.
    (ii) A license requirement may be based on the end-use or end-user 
in a transaction, primarily for proliferation reasons. Part 744 of the 
EAR describes such requirements and relevant licensing policies and 
includes both restrictions on items and restrictions on the activities 
of U.S. persons.
    (iii) A license is required for virtually all exports to embargoed 
destinations, such as Cuba. Part 746 of the EAR describes all the 
licensing requirements, license review policies and License Exceptions 
that apply to such

[[Page 128]]

destinations. If your transaction involves one of these countries, you 
should first look at this part. This part also describes controls that 
may be maintained under the EAR to implement UN sanctions.
    (iv) In addition, under Secs. 736.2(b)(9) and (10) of the EAR, you 
may not engage in a transaction knowing a violation is about to occur or 
violate any orders, terms, and conditions under the EAR. Part 764 of the 
EAR describes prohibited transactions with a person denied export 
privileges or activity that violates the terms or conditions of a denial 
order.
    (5) How do you file a license application and what will happen to 
the application once you do file it? What if you need authorization for 
multiple transactions? Parts 748 and 750 of the EAR provide information 
on license submission and processing. Part 752 of the EAR provides for a 
Special Comprehensive License that authorizes multiple transactions. If 
your application is denied, part 756 of the EAR provides rules for 
filing appeals.
    (6) How do you clear shipments with the U.S. Customs Service? Part 
758 of the EAR describes the requirements for clearance of exports.
    (7) Where do you find the rules on restrictive trade practices and 
boycotts? Part 760 of the EAR deals with restrictive trade practices and 
boycotts.
    (8) Where are the rules on recordkeeping and enforcement? Part 762 
of the EAR sets out your recordkeeping requirements, and parts 764 and 
766 of the EAR deal with violations and enforcement proceedings.
    (9) What is the effect of foreign availability? Part 768 of the EAR 
provides rules for determining foreign availability of items subject to 
controls.
    (10) Do the EAR provide definitions and interpretations? Part 770 of 
the EAR contains interpretations and part 772 of the EAR lists 
definitions used.
    (b) Why the EAR are so detailed. Some people will find the great 
length of the EAR and their extensive use of technical terms 
intimidating. BXA believes, however, that such detail and precision can 
and does serve the interests of the public. The detailed listing of 
technical parameters in the CCL establishes precise, objective criteria. 
This should, in most cases, enable you to ascertain the appropriate 
control status. Broader, more subjective criteria would leave exporters 
and reexporters more dependent upon interpretations and rulings by BXA 
officials. Moreover, much of the detail in the CCL is derived from 
multilaterally adopted lists, and the specificity serves to enhance the 
uniformity and effectiveness of international control practices and to 
promote a ``level playing field''. The detailed presentation of such 
elements as licensing and export clearance procedures enables you to 
find in one place what you need to know to comply with pertinent 
requirements. Of special importance is the detailed listing of License 
Exception criteria, as these will enable you to determine quickly, and 
with confidence, that you may proceed with a transaction without delay. 
Finally, some of the detail results from the need to draft the EAR with 
care in order to avoid loop-holes and to permit effective enforcement.
    (c) Where to get help. Throughout the EAR you will find information 
on offices you can contact for various purposes and types of 
information. General information including; assistance in understanding 
the EAR, information on how to obtain forms, electronic services, 
publications, and information on training programs offered by BXA, is 
available from the Office of Exporter Services at the following 
locations:

<R05>
Sec. 730.9  How the Bureau of Export Administration is organized.

    Functionally, the Bureau of Export Administration is divided into 
two

[[Page 129]]

branches, Export Administration and Export Enforcement. Also, BXA 
manages a number of Technical Advisory Committees consisting of industry 
and government representatives which advise and assist BXA and other 
agencies with respect to actions designed to implement the EAR.
    (a) Export Administration. Export Administration implements and 
administers the export controls reflected in the EAR. Export 
Administration consists of five offices located in Washington D.C. and 
two field offices in California under the supervision of the Assistant 
Secretary for Export Administration:
    (1) The Office of Nuclear and Missile Technology Controls is 
responsible for policy and technical issues and license applications 
related to the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology 
Control Regime. This office has responsibility for items associated with 
those regimes, and missile and nuclear related exports and reexports 
subject to the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative.
    (2) The Office Chemical/Biological Controls and Treaty Compliance is 
responsible for implementing multilateral export controls under the 
Australia Group. This office has licensing responsibility for items 
associated with the Australia Group and related exports and reexports 
subject to the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative.
    (3) The Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls is 
responsible for implementing multilateral export controls dealing with 
conventional arms and related dual use items. This office is also 
responsible for computer export control policies, and implements U.S. 
foreign policy controls (e.g., crime control, anti-terrorism, and 
regional stability). It also has licensing responsibility for items 
controlled for national security and foreign policy reasons.
    (4) The Office of Exporter Services is responsible for the Special 
Comprehensive License, processing and routing all license applications, 
and preparing responses to requests for advisory opinions and commodity 
classifications. This office also provides counselling to exporters and 
reexporters, conducts educational seminars for the business community, 
maintains the Export Administration Regulations, and coordinates the 
operations of two field offices listed in Sec. 730.8(c) of this part.
    (5) The Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security 
implements programs to ensure the continued health of the U.S. defense 
industrial base, facilitating diversification of U.S. defense related 
industries into civilian markets, and promoting the conversion of 
military enterprises. This office is also responsible for analyzing the 
economic impact of U.S. export controls on industrial competitiveness.
    (b) Export Enforcement. Export Enforcement implements the 
enforcement provisions of the EAR, including part 760 of the EAR 
(Restrictive Trade Practices and Boycotts). This office also conducts 
outreach programs to assist members of the public in understanding their 
obligation under EAR. The Office of Export Enforcement is organized into 
three offices under the supervision of the Assistant Secretary for 
Export Enforcement.
    (1) The Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) is comprised of an office 
in Washington, D.C. and eight field offices. OEE is staffed with 
criminal investigators and analysts. This office investigates 
allegations of violations and supports administrative and criminal 
enforcement proceedings. The addresses and telephone numbers of the 
eight field offices are listed in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of the EAR.
    (2) The Office of Enforcement Support (OES) is located in 
Washington, D.C. OES supports BXA's preventive enforcement efforts, 
including conducting pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications. 
OES also provides administrative and analytical support for OEE.
    (3) The Office of Antiboycott Compliance administers and enforces 
the provisions of part 760 of the EAR (Restrictive Trade Practices and 
Boycotts). It investigates and prepares cases on alleged violations of 
this part.
    (c) Technical Advisory Committees. (1) The Technical Advisory 
Committees (TACs) provide advice and assistance to BXA from U.S. 
industry regarding the creation and implementation of export

[[Page 130]]

controls. For further information regarding establishment of TACs and 
other information, see Supplement No. 2 to part 730. Existing TACs 
include the following:
    (i) The Information Systems TAC;
    (ii) The Materials TAC;
    (iii) The Materials Processing Equipment TAC;

       Supplement No. 2 to Part 730--Technical Advisory Committees

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this supplement is to describe the 
procedures and criteria for the establishment and operation of Technical 
Advisory Committees.

[[Page 131]]

    (b) Technical advisory committees. Any producer of articles, 
materials, or supplies, including technology, software, and other 
information, that are subject to export controls, or are being 
considered for such controls because of their significance to the 
national security of the United States, may request the Secretary of 
Commerce to establish a technical advisory committee, under the 
provisions of section 5(h) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as 
amended (EAA) to advise and assist the Department of Commerce and other 
appropriate U.S. Government agencies or officials with respect to 
questions involving technical matters; worldwide availability and actual 
utilization of production technology; licensing procedures that affect 
the level of export controls applicable to a clearly defined grouping of 
articles, materials, or supplies, including technology, software, or 
other information; and exports and reexports subject to all controls 
that the United States maintains including proposed revisions of any 
such controls. If producers of articles, materials, or supplies, 
including technology, software, and other information, that are subject 
to export controls because of their significance to the national 
security of the United States, wish a trade association or other 
representative to submit a written request on their behalf for the 
appointment to a TAC, such request shall be submitted in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(4) of this supplement.
    (1) Form and substance of requests. Each request for the appointment 
of a TAC shall be submitted in writing to: Assistant Secretary for 
Export Administration, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
    The request shall include:
    (i) A description of the articles, materials, or supplies including 
technology and software, in terms of a clear, cohesive grouping (citing 
the applicable Export Control Classification Numbers where practical);
    (ii) A statement of the reasons for requesting the appointment of a 
TAC; and
    (iii) Any information in support of any contention that may be made 
that the request meets the criteria described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this supplement.
    (2) Consideration of request for establishment of a TAC. The 
Department of Commerce will review all requests for the establishment of 
a TAC to determine if the following criteria are met:
    (i) That a substantial segment of the industry producing the 
specified articles, materials, or supplies including technology desires 
such a committee; and
    (ii) That the evaluation of such articles, materials, or supplies 
including technology and software for export control purposes is 
difficult because of questions involving technical matters, worldwide 
availability and actual utilization of production and software 
technology, or licensing procedures.
    (3) Requests by a substantial segment of an industry. In determining 
whether or not a substantial segment of any industry has requested the 
appointment of a TAC, the Department of Commerce will consider:
    (i) The number of persons or firms requesting the establishment of a 
TAC for a particular grouping of commodities, software and technology in 
relation to the total number of U.S. producers of such items; and
    (ii) The volume of annual production by such persons or firms of 
each item in the grouping in relation to the total U.S. production. 
Generally, a substantial segment of an industry (for purposes of this 
supplement) shall consist of:
    (A) Not less than 30 percent of the total number of U.S. producers 
of the items concerned; or
    (B) Three or more U.S. producers who produce a combined total of not 
less than 30 percent of the total U.S. annual production, by dollar 
value of the items concerned; or
    (C) Not less than 20 percent of the total number of U.S. producers 
of the items concerned, provided that the total of their annual 
production thereof is not less than 20 percent of the total U.S. annual 
production, by dollar value.
    (iii) If it is determined that a substantial segment of the industry 
concerned has requested the establishment of a TAC concerning a specific 
grouping of items that the Department of Commerce determines difficult 
to evaluate for export control purposes, BXA will establish and use the 
TAC requested.
    (4) Requests from trade associations or other representatives. 
Requests from trade associations or other representatives of U.S. 
producers for the establishment of a TAC must comply with the provisions 
of paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this supplement. In addition, in 
order to assist BXA in determining whether the criteria described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this supplement have been met, a trade association 
or other representative submitting a request for the establishment of a 
TAC should include the following information:
    (i) The total number of firms in the particular industry;
    (ii) The total number of firms in the industry that have authorized 
the trade association or other representative to act in their behalf in 
this matter;
    (iii) The approximate amount of total U.S. annual production by 
dollar value of the items concerned produced by those firms that have 
authorized the trade association or other representative to act in their 
behalf; and
    (iv) A description of the method by which authorization to act on 
behalf of these producers was obtained.
    (5) Nominations for membership on TACs. When the Department of 
Commerce determines that the establishment of a TAC is

[[Page 132]]

warranted, it will request nominations for membership on the committee 
among the producers of the items and from any other sources that may be 
able to suggest well-qualified nominees.
    (6) Selection of industry members of committee. Industry members of 
a TAC will be selected by the Department of Commerce from a list of the 
nominees who have indicated their availability for service on the 
committee. To the extent feasible, the Department of Commerce will 
select a committee balanced to represent all significant facets of the 
industry involved, taking into consideration such factors as the size of 
the firms, their geographical distribution, and their product lines. No 
industry representative shall serve on a TAC for more than four 
consecutive years. The membership of a member who is absent from four 
consecutive meetings shall be terminated.
    (7) Government members. Government members of a TAC will be selected 
by the Department of Commerce from the agencies having an interest in 
the subject matter concerned.
    (8) Invitation to serve on committee. Invitations to serve on a TAC 
will be sent by letter to the selected nominees.
    (9) Election of Chair. The Chair of each TAC shall be elected by a 
vote of the majority of the members of the committee present and voting.
    (c) Charter. (1) No TAC established pursuant to this supplement 
shall meet or take any action until an advisory committee charter has 
been filed with the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration of the 
Department of Commerce and with the standing committees of the Senate 
and of the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over 
the Department. Such charter shall contain the following information:
    (i) The committee's official designation;
    (ii) The committee's objectives and the scope of its activities;
    (iii) The period of time necessary for the committee to carry out 
its purposes;
    (iv) The agency or official to whom the committee reports;
    (v) The agency responsible for providing the necessary support for 
the committee;
    (vi) A description of the duties for which the committee is 
responsible, and, if such duties are not solely advisory, a 
specification of the authority for such functions;
    (vii) The estimated annual operating costs in dollars and years for 
such committee;
    (viii) The estimated number and frequency of committee meetings;
    (ix) The committee's termination date, if less than two years from 
the date of the committee's establishment; and
    (x) The date the charter is filed.
    (d) Meetings. (1) Each TAC established under the provisions of the 
EAA and paragraph (b) of this supplement shall meet at least once every 
three months at the call of its Chair unless it is specifically 
determined by the Chair, in consultation with other members of the 
committee, that a particular meeting is not necessary.
    (2) No TAC may meet except at the call of its Chair.
    (3) Each meeting of a TAC shall be conducted in accordance with an 
agenda approved by a designated Federal government employee.
    (4) No TAC shall conduct a meeting in the absence of a designated 
Federal government employee who shall be authorized to adjourn any 
advisory committee meeting, whenever the Federal government employee 
determines adjournment to be in the public interest.
    (e) Public notice. Notice to the public of each meeting of a TAC 
will be issued at least 20 days in advance and will be published in the 
Federal Register. The notice will include the time and place of the 
meeting and the agenda.
    (f) Public attendance and participation. (1) Any member of the 
public who wishes to do so may file a written statement with any TAC 
before or after any meeting of a committee.
    (2) A request for an opportunity to deliver an oral statement 
relevant to matters on the agenda of a meeting of a TAC will be granted 
to the extent that the time available for the meeting permits. A 
committee may establish procedures requiring such persons to obtain 
advance approval for such participation.
    (3) Attendance at meetings of TACs will be open to the public unless 
it is determined pursuant to section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act to be necessary to close all, or some portion, of the 
meeting to the public. A determination that a meeting or portion thereof 
be closed to the public may be made if all or a specific portion of a 
meeting of a TAC is concerned with matters described in section 552(b) 
of Title 5, U.S.C.
    (4) Participation by members of the public in open TAC meetings or 
questioning of committee members or other participants shall not be 
permitted except in accordance with procedures established by the 
committee.
    (5) Every effort will be made to accommodate all members of the 
public who wish to attend.
    (g) Minutes. (1) Detailed minutes of each meeting of each TAC will 
be kept and will contain a record of the persons present, a complete and 
accurate description of the matters discussed and conclusions reached, 
and copies of all reports received, issued, or approved by the TAC.

informative to the public consistent with the policy of section 552(b) 
of Title 5, U.S.C.
    (3)(i) Requests for records should be addressed to: Bureau of Export 
Administration, Freedom of Information, Records Inspection Facility, 
U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 4513, Washington, DC 20230, Telephone 
(202) 482-2593.
    (ii) Rules concerning the use of the Records Inspection Facility are 
contained in 15 CFR part 4, Subtitle A, or may be obtained from this 
facility.
    (i) Compensation. If the Department of Commerce deems it 
appropriate, a member of a TAC may be reimbursed for travel, 
subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred in connection with 
the member's duties.
    (j) Scope of advisory committee functions. All TACs are limited to 
the functions described in their charters.
    (k) Duration of committees. Each TAC will terminate at the end of 
two years from the date the committee was established or two years from 
the effective date of its most recent extension, whichever is later. 
Committees may be continued only for successive two-year periods by 
appropriate action taken by the authorized officer of the Department of 
Commerce prior to the date on which such advisory committee would 
otherwise terminate. TACs may be extended or terminated only after 
consultation with the committee.
    (l) Miscellaneous. (1) TACs established in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this supplement must conform to the provisions of the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-63 (Revision of March 1974), ``Advisory Committee 
Management,'' Department of Commerce Administrative Order 205-12, 
``Public Information,'' the applicable provisions of the EAA, and any 
other applicable Department of Commerce regulations or procedures 
affecting the establishment or operation of advisory committees.
    (2) Whenever the Department of Commerce desires the advice or 
assistance of a particular segment of an industry with respect to any 
export control problem for which the service of a TAC, as described in 
paragraph (b) of this supplement is either unavailable or impracticable, 
an advisory committee may be established pursuant to the provisions of 
section 9 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Such committees will be 
subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, OMB 
Circular A-63 (Revision of March 1974), ``Advisory Committee 
Management,'' Department of Commerce Administrative Order 205-12, 
``Public Information,'' and any other applicable Department of Commerce 
regulations or procedures affecting the establishment or operation of 
advisory committees.
    (3) Nothing in the provisions of this supplement shall be construed 
to restrict in any manner the right of any person or firm to discuss any 
export control matter with the Department of Commerce or to offer advice 
or information on export control matters. Similarly, nothing in these 
provisions shall be construed to restrict the Department of Commerce in 
consulting any person or firm relative to any export control matter.

Sec. 732.1  Steps overview.

    (a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are 
references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part is intended to 
help you determine your obligations under the EAR by listing logical 
steps in Sec. 732.2 through Sec. 732.5 of this part that you can take in 
reviewing these regulations. A flow chart describing these steps is 
contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 732. By cross-references to the 
relevant provisions of the EAR, this part describes the suggested steps 
for you to determine applicability of the following:
    (i) The scope of the EAR (part 734 of the EAR);
    (ii) Each of the general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR);
    (iii) The License Exceptions (part 740 of the EAR); and
    (iv) Other requirements such as clearing your export with the U.S. 
Customs Service, keeping records, and completing and documenting license 
applications.
    (2) These steps describe the organization of the EAR, the 
relationship among the provisions of the EAR, and the appropriate order 
for you to consider the various provisions of the EAR.
    (b) Facts about your transaction. The following five types of facts 
determine

[[Page 135]]

your obligations under the EAR and will be of help to you in reviewing 
these steps:
    (1) What is it? What an item is, for export control purposes, 
depends on its classification, which is its place on the Commerce 
Control List (see part 774 of the EAR).
    (2) Where is it going? The country of ultimate destination for an 
export or reexport also determines licensing requirements (see parts 738 
and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country Chart and the Commerce Control 
List).
    (3) Who will receive it? The ultimate end-user of your item cannot 
be a bad end-user. See General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) in 
Sec. 736.2(b)(4) and parts 744 and 764 of the EAR for a reference to the 
list of persons you may not deal with.
    (4) What will they do with it? The ultimate end-use of your item 
cannot be a bad end-use. See General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User) 
in Sec. 736.2(b)(5) and part 744 of the EAR for general end-use and end-
user restrictions.
    (5) What else do they do? Conduct such as contracting, financing, 
and freight forwarding in support of a proliferation project (as 
described in Sec. 744.6 of the EAR) may prevent you from dealing with 
someone.
    (c) Are your items and activities subject to the EAR? You should 
first determine whether your commodity, software, or technology is 
subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR concerning scope), and Steps 
1 through 6 help you do that. For exports from the United States, only 
Steps 1 and 2 are relevant. If you already know that your item or 
activity is subject to the EAR, you should go on to consider the ten 
general prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR. If your item or activity is 
not subject to the EAR, you have no obligations under the EAR and may 
skip the remaining steps.
    (d) Does your item or activity require a license under one or more 
of the ten general prohibitions? (1) Brief summary of the ten general 
prohibitions. The general prohibitions are found in part 736 of the EAR 
and referred to in these steps. They consist, very briefly, of the 
following:
    (i) General Prohibition One (Exports and Reexports): Export and 
reexport of controlled items to listed countries.
    (ii) General Prohibition Two (Parts and Components Reexports): 
Reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating more 
than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content.
    (iii) General Prohibition Three (Foreign-produced Direct Product 
Reexports): Reexport and export from abroad of the foreign-produced 
direct product of U.S. technology and software.
    (iv) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders): Engaging in actions 
prohibited by a denial order.
    (v) General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User): Export or reexport 
to prohibited end-user or end-users.
    (vi) General Prohibition Six (Embargo): Export or reexport to 
embargoed destinations.
    (vii) General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person Proliferation 
Activity): Support of proliferation activities.
    (viii) General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit): In-transit shipments 
and items to be unladen from vessels and aircraft.
    (ix) General Prohibition Nine (Orders, Terms and Conditions): 
Violation of any orders, terms, or conditions.
    (x) General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur): 
Proceeding with transactions with knowledge that a violation has 
occurred or is about to occur.
    (2) Controls on items on the Commerce Control List (CCL). If your 
item or activity is subject to the EAR, you should determine whether any 
one or more of the ten general prohibitions require a license for your 
export, reexport, or activity. Steps 7 through 11 refer to 
classification of your item on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (part 774 
of the EAR) and how to use the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) to determine whether a license is required based upon 
the classification of your item. These steps refer to General 
Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components 
Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) for 
all countries except: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,

[[Page 136]]

and North Korea. For these countries, you may skip Steps 7 through 11 
and go directly to Step 12.
    (3) Controls on activities. Steps 12 through 18 refer to General 
Prohibitions Four through Ten. Those general prohibitions apply to all 
items subject to the EAR, not merely those items listed on the CCL in 
part 774 of the EAR. For example, they refer to the general prohibitions 
for persons denied export privileges, prohibited end-uses and end-users, 
embargoed countries (e.g., Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea), 
prohibited activities of U.S. persons in support of proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, prohibited unlading of shipments, 
compliance with orders, terms and conditions, and activities when a 
violation has occurred or is about to occur.
    (4) General prohibitions. If none of the ten general prohibitions 
applies, you should skip the steps concerning License Exceptions and for 
exports from the United States, review Steps 27 through 29 concerning 
Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S. Customs Service, 
Destination Control Statements for export control documents, and 
recordkeeping requirements.
    (e) Is a License Exception available to overcome the license 
requirement? If you decide by reviewing the CCL in combination with the 
Country Chart that a license is required for your destination, you 
should determine whether a License Exception will except you from that 
requirement. Steps 20 through 24 help you determine whether a License 
Exception is available. Note that generally License Exceptions are not 
available to overcome General Prohibitions Four through Ten. However, 
selected License Exceptions for embargoed destinations are specified in 
part 746 of the EAR and License Exceptions for short supply controls are 
specified in part 754 of the EAR. If a License Exception is available 
and the export is from the United States, you should review Steps 26 
through 28 concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the 
U.S. Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export control 
documents and recordkeeping requirements. If a License Exception is not 
available, go on to Steps 25 through 29.
    (f) How do you apply for a license? If you must file a license 
application, you should review the requirements of part 748 of the EAR 
as suggested by Step 26. Then you should review Steps 27 through 29 
concerning Shipper's Export Declarations to be filed with the U.S. 
Customs Service, Destination Control Statements for export control 
documents, and recordkeeping requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 732.2  Steps regarding scope of the EAR.

    Steps 1 though 6 are designed to aid you in determining the scope of 
the EAR. A flow chart describing these steps is contained in Supplement 
No. 2 to part 732.
    (a) Step 1: Items subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another 
Federal agency. This step is relevant for both exports and reexports. 
Determine whether your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of 
another Federal Agency as provided in Sec. 734.3 of the EAR.
    (1) If your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another 
Federal agency, comply with the regulations of that agency. You need not 
comply with the EAR and may skip the remaining steps.
    (2) If your item is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of 
another federal agency, then proceed to Step 2 in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Step 2: Publicly available technology and software. This step is 
relevant for both exports and reexports. Determine if your technology or 
software is publicly available as defined and explained at part 734 of 
the EAR. Supplement No. 1 to part 734 of the EAR contains several 
practical examples describing publicly available technology and software 
that is outside the scope of the EAR. The examples are illustrative, not 
comprehensive. Note that encryption software controlled for EI reasons 
under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List (refer to Supplement No.1 
to part 774 of the EAR) shall be subject to the EAR even if publicly 
available. Accordingly, the provisions of the EAR concerning the public 
availability of items

[[Page 137]]

are not applicable to encryption items controlled for ``EI'' reasons 
under ECCN 5D002.
    (1) If your technology or software is publicly available, and 
therefore outside the scope of the EAR, you may proceed with the export 
or reexport if you are not a U.S. person subject to General Prohibition 
Seven. If you are a U.S. person, go to Step 15 at Sec. 732.3(j) of this 
part. If you are a U.S. person and General Prohibition Seven concerning 
proliferation activity of U.S. persons does not apply, then you may 
proceed with the export or reexport of your publicly available 
technology or software. Note that all U.S. persons are subject to the 
provisions of General Prohibition Seven.
    (2) If your technology or software is not publicly available and you 
are exporting from the United States, skip to Step 7 in Sec. 732.3(b) of 
this part concerning the general prohibitions.
    (3) If you are exporting items from a foreign country, you should 
then proceed to Step 3 in paragraph (c) of this section and the other 
steps concerning the scope of the EAR.
    (c) Step 3: Reexport of U.S.-origin items. This step is appropriate 
only for reexporters. For an item in a foreign country, you should 
determine whether the item is of U.S. origin. If it is of U.S.-origin, 
skip to Step 7 in Sec. 732.3(b) of this part. If it is not of U.S. 
origin, then proceed to Step 4 in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Step 4: Foreign-made items incorporating less than the de 
minimis level of U.S. parts, components, and materials. This step is 
appropriate only for items that are made outside the United States and 
not currently in the U.S. Note that encryption items controlled for EI 
reasons under ECCN 5A002 or ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List 
(refer to Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) shall be subject to 
the EAR even if they incorporate less than the de minimis level of U.S. 
content. Accordingly, the provisions of the EAR concerning de minimis 
levels are not applicable to encryption items controlled for ``EI'' 
reasons under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002, or 5E002.
    (1) For an item made in a foreign country, you should determine 
whether controlled U.S.-origin parts, components, or materials are 
incorporated as provided in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR. Also, determine the 
value of the U.S.-origin controlled content as provided in Supplement 
No. 2 to part 734 of the EAR.
    (2) To determine the value of the U.S.-origin controlled content, 
you should classify the U.S.-origin content on the CCL, determine those 
items that would require a license from BXA for reexport to the ultimate 
destination of the foreign-made product if such parts, components, or 
materials were reexported to that destination in the form received, and 
divide the total value of the controlled U.S. parts, components, and 
materials incorporated into the foreign-made item by the sale price of 
the foreign-made item.
    (3) If no U.S. parts, components, or materials are incorporated or 
if the incorporated U.S. parts, components, and materials are below the 
de minimis level described in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR, then the foreign-
made item is not subject to the EAR by reason of the parts and 
components rule, the classification of a foreign-made item is irrelevant 
in determining the scope of the EAR, and you should skip Step 4 and go 
on to consider Step 6 regarding the foreign-produced direct product 
rule.
    (4) If controlled parts, components, or materials are incorporated 
and are above the de minimis level, then you should go on to Step 5.
    (e) Step 5: Foreign-made items incorporating more than the de 
minimis level of U.S. parts, components, or materials. This step is 
appropriate only for foreign-made items incorporating certain U.S. 
parts. If the incorporated U.S. parts exceed the relevant de minimis 
level, then your export from abroad is subject to the EAR. You then 
should skip to Step 7 at Sec. 732.3 of this part and consider the steps 
regarding all other general prohibitions, License Exceptions, and other 
requirements.
    (f) Step 6: Foreign-made items produced with certain U.S. technology 
for export to specified destinations. This step is appropriate for 
foreign-made items in foreign countries.
    (1) If your foreign-produced item is described in an entry on the 
CCL and the Country Chart requires a license to your export or reexport 
destination for national security reasons, you should

[[Page 138]]

determine whether your item is subject to General Prohibition Three 
(Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the 
EAR). Your item is subject to the EAR if it is captured by General 
Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), and that 
prohibition applies if your transaction meets each of the following 
conditions:
    (i) Country scope of prohibition. Your export or reexport 
destination for the direct product is Cuba, North Korea, Libya, or a 
destination in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of 
the EAR) (reexports of foreign-produced direct products exported to 
other destinations are not subject to General Prohibition Three);
    (ii) Scope of technology or software used to create direct products 
subject to the prohibition. Technology or software that was used to 
create the foreign-produced direct product, and such technology or 
software that was subject to the EAR and required a written assurance as 
a supporting document for a license or as a precondition for the use of 
License Exception TSR in Sec. 740.6 of the EAR (reexports of foreign-
produced direct products created with other technology and software are 
not subject to General Prohibition Three); and
    (iii) Scope of direct products subject to the prohibition. The 
foreign-produced direct products are subject to national security 
controls as designated on the proper ECCN of the Commerce Control List 
in part 774 of the EAR (reexports of foreign-produced direct products 
not subject to national security controls are not subject to General 
Prohibition Three).
    (2) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described in part 740 
of the EAR overcomes this General Prohibition Three if all terms and 
conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or 
reexporter.
    (3) Subject to the EAR. If your item is captured by the foreign-
produced direct product control at General Prohibition Three, then your 
export from abroad is subject to the EAR. You should next consider the 
steps regarding all other general prohibitions, License Exceptions, and 
other requirements. If your item is not captured by General Prohibition 
Three, then your export from abroad is not subject to the EAR. You have 
completed the steps necessary to determine whether your transaction is 
subject to the EAR, and you may skip the remaining steps. Note that in 
summary, items in foreign countries are subject to the EAR when they 
are:
    (i) U.S.-origin commodities, software and technology unless 
controlled for export exclusively by another Federal agency or unless 
publicly available;
    (ii) Foreign-origin commodities, software, and technology that are 
within the scope of General Prohibition Two (Parts and Components 
Reexports), or General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced Direct 
Product Reexports). (However, such foreign-made items are also outside 
the scope of the EAR if they are controlled for export exclusively by 
another Federal agency or publicly available.)
[61 FR 12740, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 64274, Dec. 4, 1996; 61 
FR 68577, Dec. 30, 1996; 62 FR 25453, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 732.3  Steps regarding the ten general prohibitions.

    (a) Introduction. If your item or activity is subject to the scope 
of the EAR, you should then consider each of the ten general 
prohibitions listed in part 736 of the EAR. General Prohibitions One 
((Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and 
Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b) (1), 
(2), and (3) of the EAR) are product controls that are shaped and 
limited by parameters specified on the CCL and Country Chart. General 
Prohibitions Four through Ten are prohibitions on certain activities 
that are not allowed without authorization from BXA, and these 
prohibitions apply to all items subject to the EAR unless otherwise 
specified (Sec. 736.2(b) (4) through (10) of the EAR).
    (b) Step 7: Classification. (1) You should classify your items in 
the relevant entry on the CCL, and you may do so on your own without the 
assistance of BXA. You are responsible for doing so correctly, and your 
failure to correctly classify your items does not relieve you of the 
obligation to obtain a license when one is required by the EAR.

[[Page 139]]

    (2) You have a right to request the applicable classification of 
your item from BXA, and BXA has a duty to provide that classification to 
you. For further information on how to obtain classification assistance 
from BXA, see part 748 of the EAR.
    (3) For items subject to the EAR but not listed on the CCL, the 
proper classification is EAR99. This number is a ``basket'' for items 
not specified under any CCL entry and appears at the end of each 
Category on the CCL.
    (c) Step 8: Country of ultimate destination. You should determine 
the country of ultimate destination. The country of destination 
determines the applicability of several general prohibitions, License 
Exceptions, and other requirements. Note that part 754 of the EAR 
concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the only 
location in the EAR that contains both the prohibitions and exceptions 
applicable to short supply controls.
    (d) Step 9: Reason for control and the Country Chart. (1) Reason for 
control and column identifier within the Export Control Classification 
Number (ECCN). Once you have determined that your item is controlled by 
a specific ECCN, you must use information contained in the ``License 
Requirements'' section of that ECCN in combination with the Country 
Chart to decide whether a license is required under General Prohibitions 
One, Two, or Three to a particular destination. The CCL and the Country 
Chart are taken together to define these license requirements. The 
applicable ECCN will indicate the reason or reasons for control for 
items within that ECCN. For example, ECCN 6A007 is controlled for 
national security, missile technology, and anti-terrorism reasons.
    (2) Reason for control within the Country Chart. With each of the 
applicable Country Chart column identifiers noted in the correct ECCN, 
turn to the Country Chart. Locate the correct Country Chart column 
identifier on the horizontal axis, and determine whether an ``X'' is 
marked in the cell next to the destination in question. Consult 
Sec. 738.4 of the EAR for comprehensive instructions on using the 
Country Chart and a detailed example.
    (i) An ``X'' in the cell or cells for the relevant country and 
reason(s) for control column indicates that a license is required for 
General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received), 
Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct 
Product Reexports). (See Sec. 736.2 (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the 
EAR).
    (ii) If one or more cells have an ``X'' in the relevant column, a 
license is required unless you qualify for a License Exception described 
in part 740 of the EAR. If a cell does not contain an ``X'' for your 
destination in one or more relevant columns, a license is not required 
under the CCL and the Country Chart.
    (iii) Additional controls may apply to your export. You must go on 
to steps 12 through 18 described in paragraphs (g) to (m) of this 
section to determine whether additional limits described in General 
Prohibition Two (Parts and Components Reexports) and General Prohibition 
Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports ) apply to your 
proposed transaction. If you are exporting an item from the United 
States, you should skip Step 10 and Step 11. Proceed directly to Step 12 
in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) License requirements not on the Country Chart. There are two 
instances where the Country Chart cannot be used to determine if a 
license is required. Items controlled for short supply reasons are not 
governed by the Country Chart. Part 754 of the EAR contains license 
requirements and License Exceptions for items subject to short supply 
controls. A limited number of ECCNs contained on the CCL do not identify 
a Country Chart column identifier. In these instances, the ECCN states 
whether a license is required and for which destinations. See 
Sec. 738.3(a) of the EAR for a list of the ECCNs for which you do not 
need to consult the Country Chart to determine licensing requirements.
    (4) Destinations subject to embargo provisions. The Country Chart 
does not apply to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea; and for 
those countries you should review the embargo provisions at part 746 of 
the EAR and may skip this step concerning the Country

[[Page 140]]

Chart. For Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Rwanda, and Serbia and 
Montenegro the Country Chart provides for certain license requirements, 
and part 746 of the EAR provides additional requirements.
    (5) Items subject to the EAR but not on the CCL. Items subject to 
the EAR that are not on the CCL are properly classified EAR99. For such 
items, you may skip this step and proceed directly with Step 12 in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Step 10: Foreign-made items incorporating U.S.-origin items and 
the de minimis rule. (1) Parts and components rule. The following 
considerations are appropriate for items abroad and are the same steps 
necessary to determine whether a foreign-made item incorporating U.S. 
parts, components, or materials is subject to the EAR. If your foreign-
made item is described in an entry on the CCL and the Country Chart 
requires a license to your export or reexport destination, you should 
determine whether the controlled U.S.-origin commodities, software, or 
technology incorporated into the foreign-made item exceeds the de 
minimis level applicable to the ultimate destination of the foreign-made 
item, as follows:
    (i) A 10% de minimis level to embargoed and terrorist-supporting 
countries; or
    (ii) A 25% de minimis level to all other countries.
    (2) Guidance for calculations. For guidance on how to calculate the 
U.S.-controlled content, refer to Supplement No. 2 to part 734 of the 
EAR. Note that certain rules issued by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control, certain exports from abroad by U.S.-owned or controlled 
entities may be prohibited notwithstanding the de minimis provisions of 
the EAR. In addition, the de minimis exclusions from the parts and 
components rule do not relieve U.S. persons of the obligation to refrain 
from supporting the proliferation of weapons of mass-destruction and 
missiles as provided in General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person 
Proliferation Activity) described in Sec. 736.2(b)(7) of the EAR. Note 
that encryption items controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5A002 or ECCN 
5D002 on the Commerce Control List (refer to Supplement No.1 to part 774 
of the EAR) shall be subject to the EAR even if they incorporate less 
than the de minimis level of U.S. content. Accordingly, the provisions 
of the EAR concerning de minimis levels are not applicable to encryption 
items controlled for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5A002, ECCN 5D002, or 
ECCN 5E002.
    (f) Step 11: Foreign-produced direct product. The following 
considerations are appropriate for items abroad and are the same 
considerations necessary to determine whether a foreign-produced direct 
product is subject to the EAR under Step 6 in Sec. 732.2(f) of this 
part.
    (1) If your foreign-produced item is described in an entry on the 
CCL and the Country Chart requires a license to your export or reexport 
destination for national security reasons, you must determine whether 
your item is subject to General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced 
Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR). Your item is 
subject to this general prohibition if your transaction meets each of 
the following conditions:
    (i) Country scope of prohibition. Your export or reexport 
destination for the direct product is Cuba, Libya, North Korea, or a 
destination in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of 
the EAR) (reexports of foreign-produced direct products exported to 
other destinations are not subject to General Prohibition Three 
described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR);
    (ii) Scope of technology or software used to create direct products 
subject to the prohibition. Technology or software that was used to 
create the foreign-produced direct product, and such technology or 
software that was subject to the EAR and required a written assurance as 
a supporting document for a license or as a precondition for the use of 
License Exception TSR in Sec. 740.6 of the EAR (reexports of foreign-
produced direct products created with other technology and software are 
not subject to General Prohibition Three); and
    (iii) Scope of direct products subject to the prohibition. The 
foreign-produced direct products are controlled for national security 
reasons indicated in an ECCN on the CCL (reexports of foreign-produced 
direct products not subject to national security controls are not 
subject to General Prohibition Three).

[[Page 141]]

    (2) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described in part 740 
of the EAR overcomes General Prohibition Three (Foreign-Produced Direct 
Product Reexports) if all terms and conditions of a given License 
Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
    (g) Step 12: Persons denied export privileges. (1) Determine whether 
your transferee, ultimate end-user, any intermediate consignee, or any 
other party to a transaction is a person denied export privileges. (See 
part 764 of the EAR). While it is not a violation of General Prohibition 
Four (Denial Orders) (Sec. 736.2(b)(4) of the EAR) to fail to check the 
Denied Persons List prior to a transfer, it is nonetheless a violation 
of the EAR to engage in any activity that violates the terms or 
conditions of a denial order. General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) 
applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and 
within EAR99.
    (2) There are no License Exceptions to General Prohibition Four 
(Denial Orders). The prohibition concerning persons denied export 
privileges may be overcome only by a specific authorization from BXA, 
something that is rarely granted.
    (h) STEP 13: Prohibited end-uses and end-users. (1) Review the end-
uses and end-users prohibited under General Prohibition Five (End-Use 
and End-User) (Sec. 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) described in part 744 of the 
EAR. Part 744 of the EAR contains all the end-use and end-user license 
requirements, and those are in addition to the license requirements 
under General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and 
Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-produced Direct Product 
Reexports). Unless otherwise indicated, the license requirements of 
General Prohibition Five (End-Use and End-User) described in part 744 of 
the EAR apply to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the 
CCL and within EAR99. Moreover, the requirements of General Prohibition 
Five (End-Use and End-User) are in addition to various end-use and end-
user limitations placed on certain License Exceptions.
    (2) Under License Exception TSU (Sec. 740.13 of the EAR), 
operational technology and software (OTS), sales technology (STS), and 
software updates (SUD) overcome General Prohibition Five (End-Use and 
End-User) (Sec. 736.2(b)(5) of the EAR) if all terms and conditions of 
these provisions are met by the exporter or reexporter.
    (i) Step 14: Embargoed countries and special destinations. If your 
destination for any item is Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Cuba, Iran, 
Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Rwanda, or Serbia and Montenegro, you must 
consider the requirements of part 746 of the EAR. Unless otherwise 
indicated, General Prohibition Six (Embargo) applies to all items 
subject to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99. You may 
not make an export or reexport contrary to the provisions of part 746 of 
the EAR without a license unless:
    (1) You are exporting or reexporting only publicly available 
technology or software or other items outside the scope of the EAR, or
    (2) You qualify for a License Exception referenced in part 746 of 
the EAR concerning embargoed destinations. You may not use a License 
Exception described in part 740 of the EAR to overcome General 
Prohibition Six (Embargo) (Sec. 736.2(b)(6) of the EAR) unless it is 
specifically authorized in part 746 of the EAR. Note that part 754 of 
the EAR concerning short supply controls is self-contained and is the 
only location in the EAR for both the prohibitions and exceptions 
applicable to short supply controls.
    (j) Step 15: Proliferation activity of U.S. persons unrelated to 
exports and reexports. (1) Review the scope of activity prohibited by 
General Prohibition Seven (U.S. Person Proliferation Activity) 
(Sec. 736.2(b)(7) of the EAR) as that activity is described in 
Sec. 744.6 of the EAR. Keep in mind that such activity is not limited to 
exports and reexports and is not limited to items subject to General 
Prohibition One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components 
Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports). 
Moreover, such activity extends to services and dealing in wholly 
foreign-origin items in support of the specified proliferation activity 
and is not limited to items listed on the CCL or included in EAR99.
    (2) Review the definition of U.S. Person in part 744 of the EAR.

[[Page 142]]

    (k) Step 16: In-transit. Shippers and operators of vessels or 
aircraft should review General Prohibition Eight (In-Transit) to 
determine the countries in which you may not unladen or ship certain 
items in-transit. General Prohibition Eight applies to all items subject 
to the EAR, i.e. both items on the CCL and within EAR99.
    (l) Step 17: Review orders, terms, and conditions. Review the 
orders, terms, and conditions applicable to your transaction. General 
Prohibition Nine (Orders, Terms, and Conditions) prohibits the violation 
of any orders, terms, and conditions imposed under the EAR. Terms and 
conditions are frequently contained in licenses. In addition, the ten 
general prohibitions (part 736 of the EAR) and the License Exceptions 
(part 740 of the EAR) impose terms and conditions or limitations on your 
proposed transactions and use of License Exceptions. A given license or 
License Exception may not be used unless each relevant term or condition 
is met.
    (m) Step 18: Review the ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance and General 
Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur). License requirements 
under the EAR are determined solely by the classification, end-use, end-
user, ultimate destination, and conduct of U.S. persons. Supplement No. 
1 to part 732 of the EAR is intended to provide helpful guidance 
regarding the process for the evaluation of information about customers, 
end-uses, and end-users. General Prohibition Ten (Knowledge Violation to 
Occur) prohibits anyone from proceeding with a transaction with 
knowledge that a violation of the EAR has occurred or is about to occur. 
It also prohibits related shipping, financing, and other services. 
General Prohibition Ten applies to all items subject to the EAR, i.e. 
both items on the CCL and within EAR99.
    (n) Step 19: Complete the review of the general prohibitions. After 
completion of Steps described in this section and review of all ten 
general prohibitions in part 736 of the EAR, including cross-referenced 
regulations in the EAR, you will know which, if any, of the ten general 
prohibitions of the EAR apply to you and your contemplated transaction 
or activity.
    (1) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your 
export from the United States, no license from BXA is required, you do 
not need to qualify for a License Exception under part 740 of the EAR. 
You should skip the Steps in Sec. 732.4 of this part regarding License 
Exceptions and proceed directly to the Steps in Sec. 732.5 of this part 
regarding recordkeeping, clearing the U.S. Customs Service with the 
appropriate Shipper's Export Declaration, and using the required 
Destination Control Statement.
    (2) If none of the ten general prohibitions is applicable to your 
reexport or export from abroad, no license is required and you should 
skip all remaining Steps.
    (3) If one or more of the ten general prohibitions are applicable, 
continue with the remaining steps.

<R05>
Sec. 732.4  Steps regarding License Exceptions.

    (a) Introduction to Steps for License Exceptions. If your export or 
reexport is subject to the EAR and is subject to General Prohibitions 
One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), or 
Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports), consider the steps 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section. If your export or reexport is 
subject to General Prohibitions Four (Denial Orders), Seven (U.S. Person 
Proliferation Activity), Eight (In-Transit), Nine (Orders, Terms, and 
Conditions), or Ten (Knowledge Violation to Occur), there are no License 
Exceptions available for your export or reexport. If your export is 
subject to General Prohibition Five (End-Use End-User), consult part 744 
of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition 
Six (Embargo), consult part 746 of the EAR for applicable License 
Exceptions.
    (b) Steps for License Exceptions. (1) Step 20: Applicability of 
General Prohibitions. Determine whether any one or more of the general 
prohibitions described in Sec. 736.2(b) of the EAR apply to your export 
or reexport. If no general prohibition applies to your export or 
reexport, then you may proceed with

[[Page 143]]

your export or reexport and need not review part 740 of the EAR 
regarding License Exceptions. You are reminded of your recordkeeping 
obligations related to the clearance of the U.S. Customs Service 
provided in parts 762 and 758 of the EAR.
    (2) Step 21: Applicability of restrictions on all License 
Exceptions. Determine whether any one or more of the restrictions in 
Sec. 740.2 of the EAR applies to your export or reexport. If any one or 
more of these restrictions apply, there are no License Exceptions 
available to you, and you must either obtain a license or refrain from 
the export or reexport.
    (3) Step 22: Terms and conditions of the License Exceptions. (i) If 
none of the restrictions in Sec. 740.2 of the EAR applies, then review 
each of the License Exceptions to determine whether any one of them 
authorizes your export or reexport. Eligibility for License Exceptions 
is based on the item, the country of ultimate destination, the end-use, 
and the end-user, along with any special conditions imposed within a 
specific License Exception.
    (ii) You may meet the conditions for more than one License 
Exception. Moreover, although you may not qualify for some License 
Exceptions you may qualify for others. Review the broadest License 
Exceptions first, and use any License Exception available to you. You 
are not required to use the most restrictive applicable License 
Exception. If you fail to qualify for the License Exception that you 
first consider, you may consider any other License Exception until you 
have determined that no License Exception is available.
    (iii) License Exceptions TMP, RPL, BAG, AVS, GOV, and TSU authorize 
exports notwithstanding the provisions of the CCL. List-based License 
Exceptions (LVS, GBS, CIV, TSR, and CTP) are available only to the 
extent specified on the CCL. Part 740 of the EAR provides authorization 
for reexports only to the extent each License Exception expressly 
authorizes reexports. License Exception APR authorizes reexports only.
    (4) Step 23: Scope of License Exceptions. Some License Exceptions 
are limited by country or by type of item.
    (i) Countries are arranged in country groups for ease of reference. 
For a listing of country groups, please refer to Supplement No. 1 to 
part 740 of the EAR. Unless otherwise indicated in a License Exception, 
License Exceptions do not apply to any exports or reexports to embargoed 
destinations. If your export or reexport is subject to General 
Prohibition Six (Embargo) for embargoed destinations, License Exceptions 
are only available to the extent specifically provided in part 746 of 
the EAR concerning embargoed destinations.
    (ii) Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. No 
License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR may be used for 
items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons. License 
Exceptions for short supply items are found in part 754 of the EAR.
    (5) Step 24: Compliance with all terms and conditions. If a License 
Exception is available, you may proceed with your export or reexport. 
However, you must meet all the terms and conditions required by the 
License Exception that you determined authorized your export or 
reexport. You must also consult part 758 and 762 of the EAR to determine 
your recordkeeping and documentation requirements.
    (6) Step 25: License requirements. If no License Exception is 
available, then you must either obtain a license before proceeding with 
your export or reexport or you must refrain from the proposed export or 
reexport.
    (7) Step 26: License applications. If you are going to file a 
license application with BXA, you should first review the requirements 
at part 748 of the EAR. Exporters, reexporters, and exporters from 
abroad should review the instructions concerning applications and 
required support documents prior to submitting an application for a 
license.

<R05>
Sec. 732.5  Steps regarding Shipper's Export Declaration, Destination Control Statements, record keeping, license applications, and other requirements.

    (a) Step 27--Shipper's Export Declaration. You should review 
Sec. 758.3 of the

[[Page 144]]

EAR to determine what notations you must enter on the Shipper's Export 
Declaration (SED). These steps should be reviewed by exporters. 
Reexporters and firms exporting from abroad may skip Steps 27 through 29 
and proceed directly to Sec. 732.6 of this part.
    (1) NLR. The term ``NLR'' represents exports of listed items when no 
license is required. Such exports do not require that you qualify for a 
License Exception. The symbol ``NLR'' is required on the SED under two 
circumstances. First, NLR is the correct symbol when exporting an item 
subject to the EAR not listed on the CCL. Such items are classified 
EAR99. Secondly, certain items are listed on the CCL but do not require 
a license to all destinations under General Prohibitions One (Exports 
and Reexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components 
Reexports), or Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports) 
(Sec. 736.2 (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of the EAR). Such items do not 
have an ``X'' in the appropriate cell on the Country Chart. If General 
Prohibitions Four through Ten (Sec. 736.2 (b)(4) of the EAR) through 
(b)(10) of the EAR) also do not apply, you must clear exports of such 
items by entering the symbol ``NLR'' in the appropriate place on the 
SED.
    (2) License Exception symbol. You must enter on any required SED the 
letter code (e.g., LVS, TMP) of the License Exceptions under which you 
are exporting. In the case of License Exceptions LVS, GBS, and CIV, the 
ECCN of the item being exported must also be entered when an SED is 
required. Please refer to Sec. 758.3 of the EAR for detailed information 
on use of SEDs.
    (3) License number. If you are exporting under a license, enter the 
license number on the SED as required by Sec. 758.3 of the EAR.
    (b) Step 28: Destination Control Statement. You are required to 
enter an appropriate Destination Control Statement (DCS) on commercial 
documents in accordance with the DCS requirements of Sec. 758.6 of the 
EAR. Exporters should review Sec. 758.6 of the EAR and use the DCS as 
required. Reexporters and exporters from abroad should review Sec. 752.6 
for DCS requirements when using a Special Comprehensive License. 
Otherwise, DCS requirements do not apply to reexports and exports from 
abroad.
    (c) Step 29: Recordkeeping. Records of transactions involving 
exports under any license or License Exception must be maintained in 
accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.
[61 FR 12740, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 64274, Dec. 4, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 732.6  Steps for other requirements.

    Sections 732.1 through 732.4 of this part are useful in determining 
the license requirements that apply to you. Other portions of the EAR 
impose other obligations and requirements. Some of them are:
    (a) Requirements relating to the use of a license in Sec. 758.2 of 
the EAR.
    (b) Obligations of carriers, forwarders, exporters and others to 
take specific steps and prepare and deliver certain documents to assure 
that items subject to the EAR are delivered to the destination to which 
they are licensed or authorized by a License Exception or some other 
provision of the regulations in Sec. 758.4 through Sec. 758.6 of the 
EAR.
    (c) Duty of carriers to return or unload shipments at the direction 
of U.S. Government officials (see Sec. 758.8 of the EAR).
    (d) Specific obligations imposed on parties to Special Comprehensive 
licenses in part 752 of the EAR.
    (e) Recordkeeping requirements imposed in part 762 of the EAR.
    (f) Requirements of part 764 of the EAR to disclose facts that may 
come to your attention after you file a license application or make 
other statements to the government concerning a transaction or proposed 
transaction that is subject to the EAR.
    (g) Certain obligations imposed by part 760 of the EAR on parties 
who receive requests to take actions related to foreign boycotts and 
prohibits certain actions relating to those boycotts.

Supplement No. 3 to Part 732--BXA's ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance and 
                                Red Flags

                     ``Know Your Customer'' Guidance

    Various requirements of the EAR are dependent upon a person's 
knowledge of the end-use, end-user, ultimate destination, or other facts 
relating to a transaction or activity. These provisions include the 
nonproliferation-related ``catch-all'' sections and the prohibition 
against proceeding with a transaction with knowledge that a violation of 
the EAR has occurred or is about to occur.
    (a) BXA provides the following guidance on how individuals and firms 
should act under this knowledge standard. This guidance does not change 
or interpret the EAR.
    (1) Decide whether there are ``red flags''. Take into account any 
abnormal circumstances in a transaction that indicate that the export 
may be destined for an inappropriate end-use, end-user, or destination. 
Such circumstances are referred to as ``red flags''. Included among 
examples of red flags are orders for items that are inconsistent with 
the needs of the purchaser, a customer declining installation and 
testing when included in the sales price or when normally requested, or 
requests for equipment configurations that are incompatible with the 
stated destination (e.g., 120 volts in a country with 220 volts). 
Commerce has developed lists of such red flags that are not all-
inclusive but are intended to illustrate the types of circumstances that 
should cause reasonable suspicion that a transaction will violate the 
EAR.
    (2) If there are ``red flags'', inquire. If there are no ``red 
flags'' in the information that comes to your firm, you should be able 
to proceed with a transaction in reliance on information you have 
received. That is, absent ``red flags'' (or an express requirement in 
the EAR), there is no affirmative duty upon exporters to inquire, 
verify, or otherwise ``go behind'' the customer's representations. 
However, when ``red flags'' are raised in information that comes to your 
firm, you have a duty to check out the suspicious circumstances and 
inquire about the end-use, end-user, or ultimate country of destination. 
The duty to check out ``red flags'' is not confined to the use of 
License Exceptions affected by the ``know'' or ``reason to know'' 
language in the EAR. Applicants for licenses are required by part 748 of 
the EAR to obtain documentary evidence concerning the transaction, and 
misrepresentation or concealment of material facts is prohibited, both 
in the licensing process and in all export control documents. You can 
rely upon representations from your customer and repeat them in the 
documents you file unless red flags oblige you to take verification 
steps.
    (3) Do not self-blind. Do not cut off the flow of information that 
comes to your firm in the normal course of business. For example, do not 
instruct the sales force to tell potential customers to refrain from 
discussing the actual end-use, end-user, and ultimate country of 
destination for the product your firm is seeking to sell. Do not put on 
blinders that prevent the learning of relevant information. An 
affirmative policy of steps to avoid ``bad'' information would not 
insulate a company from liability, and it would usually be considered an 
aggravating factor in an enforcement proceeding.
    (4) Employees need to know how to handle ``red flags''. Knowledge 
possessed by an employee of a company can be imputed to a firm so as to 
make it liable for a violation. This makes it important for firms to 
establish clear policies and effective compliance procedures to ensure 
that such knowledge about transactions can be evaluated by responsible 
senior officials. Failure to do so could be regarded as a form of self-
blinding.
    (5) Reevaluate all the information after the inquiry. The purpose of 
this inquiry and reevaluation is to determine whether the ``red flags'' 
can be explained or justified. If they can, you may proceed with the 
transaction. If the ``red flags'' cannot be explained or justified and 
you proceed, you run the risk of having had ``knowledge'' that would 
make your action a violation of the EAR.
    (6) Refrain from the transaction or advise BXA and wait. If you 
continue to have reasons for concern after your inquiry, then you should 
either refrain from the transaction or submit all the relevant 
information to BXA in the form of an application for a license or in 
such other form as BXA may specify.
    (b) Industry has an important role to play in preventing exports and 
reexports contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests 
of the United States. BXA will continue to work in partnership with 
industry to make this front line of defense effective, while minimizing 
the regulatory burden on exporters. If you have any question about 
whether you have encountered a ``red flag'', you may contact the Office 
of Export Enforcement at 1-800-424-2980 or the Office of Exporter 
Services at (202) 482-4532.

                                Red Flags

    Possible indicators that an unlawful diversion might be planned by 
your customer include the following:
    1. The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant to offer 
information about the end-use of a product.
    2. The product's capabilities do not fit the buyer's line of 
business; for example, a small bakery places an order for several 
sophisticated lasers.

[[Page 148]]

    3. The product ordered is incompatible with the technical level of 
the country to which the product is being shipped. For example, 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment would be of little use in a 
country without an electronics industry.
    4. The customer has little or no business background.
    5. The customer is willing to pay cash for a very expensive item 
when the terms of the sale call for financing.
    6. The customer is unfamiliar with the product's performance 
characteristics but still wants the product.
    7. Routine installation, training or maintenance services are 
declined by the customer.
    8. Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are planned for out-of-
the-way destinations.
    9. A freight forwarding firm is listed as the product's final 
destination.
    10. The shipping route is abnormal for the product and destination.
    11. Packaging is inconsistent with the stated method of shipment or 
destination.
    12. When questioned, the buyer is evasive or unclear about whether 
the purchased product is for domestic use, export or reexport.

<R05>
Sec. 734.1  Introduction.

    (a) In this part, references to the Export Administration 
Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. 
This part describes the scope of the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) and explains certain key terms and principles used in the EAR. 
This part provides the rules you need to use to determine whether items 
and activities are subject to the EAR. This part is the first step in 
determining your obligations under the EAR. If your item or activity is 
not subject to the EAR, then you do not have any obligations under the 
EAR and you do not need to review other parts of the EAR. If you already 
know that your item or activity is subject to the EAR, you do not need 
to review this part and you can go on to review other parts of the EAR 
to determine your obligations. This part also describes certain key 
terms and principles used in the EAR. Specifically, it includes the 
following terms: ``subject to the EAR,'' ``items subject to the EAR,'' 
``export,'' and ``reexport.'' These and other terms are also included in 
part 772 of the EAR, Definitions of Terms, and you should consult part 
772 of the EAR for the meaning of terms used in the EAR. Finally, this 
part makes clear that compliance with the EAR does not relieve any 
obligations imposed under foreign laws.
    (b) This part does not address any of the provisions set forth in 
part 760 of the EAR, Restrictive Trade Practices or Boycotts.
    (c) This part does not define the scope of legal authority to 
regulate exports, including reexports, or activities found in the Export 
Administration Act and other statutes. What this part does do is set 
forth the extent to which such legal authority has been exercised 
through the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 734.2  Important EAR terms and principles.

    (a) Subject to the EAR--Definition. (1) ``Subject to the EAR'' is a 
term used in the EAR to describe those items and

[[Page 149]]

activities over which BXA exercises regulatory jurisdiction under the 
EAR. Conversely, items and activities that are not subject to the EAR 
are outside the regulatory jurisdiction of the EAR and are not affected 
by these regulations. The items and activities subject to the EAR are 
described in Sec. 734.2 through Sec. 734.5 of this part. You should 
review the Commerce Control List (CCL) and any applicable parts of the 
EAR to determine whether an item or activity is subject to the EAR. 
However, if you need help in determining whether an item or activity is 
subject to the EAR, see Sec. 734.6 of this part. Publicly available 
technology and software not subject to the EAR are described in 
Sec. 734.7 through Sec. 734.11 and Supplement No. 1 to this part.
    (2) Items and activities subject to the EAR may also be controlled 
under export-related programs administered by other agencies. Items and 
activities subject to the EAR are not necessarily exempted from the 
control programs of other agencies. Although BXA and other agencies that 
maintain controls for national security and foreign policy reasons try 
to minimize overlapping jurisdiction, you should be aware that in some 
instances you may have to comply with more than one regulatory program.
    (3) The term ``subject to the EAR'' should not be confused with 
licensing or other requirements imposed in other parts of the EAR. Just 
because an item or activity is subject to the EAR does not mean that a 
license or other requirement automatically applies. A license or other 
requirement applies only in those cases where other parts of the EAR 
impose a licensing or other requirement on such items or activities.
    (b) Export and reexport--(1) Definition of export. ``Export'' means 
an actual shipment or transmission of items subject to the EAR out of 
the United States, or release of technology or software subject to the 
EAR to a foreign national in the United States, as described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. See part 772 of the EAR for the 
definition that applies to exports of satellites subject to the EAR. See 
paragraph (b)(9) of this section for the definition that applies to 
exports of encryption source code and object code software subject to 
the EAR.
    (2) Export of technology or software. (See paragraph (b)(9) for 
provisions that apply to encryption source code and object code 
software.) ``Export'' of technology or software, excluding encryption 
software subject to ``EI'' controls, includes:
    (i) Any release of technology or software subject to the EAR in a 
foreign country; or
    (ii) Any release of technology or source code subject to the EAR to 
a foreign national. Such release is deemed to be an export to the home 
country or countries of the foreign national. This deemed export rule 
does not apply to persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence in 
the United States and does not apply to persons who are protected 
individuals under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 
1324b(a)(3)). Note that the release of any item to any party with 
knowledge a violation is about to occur is prohibited by 
Sec. 736.2(b)(10) of the EAR.
    (3) Definition of ``release'' of technology or software. Technology 
or software is ``released'' for export through:
    (i) Visual inspection by foreign nationals of U.S.-origin equipment 
and facilities;
    (ii) Oral exchanges of information in the United States or abroad; 
or
    (iii) The application to situations abroad of personal knowledge or 
technical experience acquired in the United States.
    (4) Definition of reexport. ``Reexport'' means an actual shipment or 
transmission of items subject to the EAR from one foreign country to 
another foreign country; or release of technology or software subject to 
the EAR to a foreign national outside the United States, as described in 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section. See part 772 of the EAR for the 
definition that applies to reexports of satellites subject to the EAR.
    (5) Reexport of technology or software. Any release of technology or 
source code subject to the EAR to a foreign national of another country 
is a deemed reexport to the home country or countries of the foreign 
national.

[[Page 150]]

However, this deemed reexport definition does not apply to persons 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The term ``release'' is 
defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Note that the release of 
any item to any party with knowledge or reason to know a violation is 
about to occur is prohibited by Sec. 736.2(b)(10) of the EAR.
    (6) For purposes of the EAR, the export or reexport of items subject 
to the EAR that will transit through a country or countries or be 
transshipped in a country or countries to a new country or are intended 
for reexport to the new country, are deemed to be exports to the new 
country.
    (7) If a territory, possession, or department of a foreign country 
is not listed on the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of 
the EAR, the export or reexport of items subject to the EAR to such 
destination is deemed under the EAR to be an export to the foreign 
country. For example, a shipment to the Cayman Islands, a dependent 
territory of the United Kingdom, is deemed to be a shipment to the 
United Kingdom.
    (8) Export or reexport of items subject to the EAR does not include 
shipments among any of the states of the United States, the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or 
any territory, dependency, or possession of the United States. These 
destinations are listed in Schedules C & E, Classification of Country 
and Territory Designations for U.S. Export Statistics, issued by the 
Bureau of the Census.
    (9) Export of encryption source code and object code software. (i) 
For purposes of the EAR, the export of encryption source code and object 
code software means:
    (A) An actual shipment, transfer, or transmission out of the United 
States (see also paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section); or
    (B) A transfer of such software in the United States to an embassy 
or affiliate of a foreign country.
    (ii) The export of encryption source code and object code software 
controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) includes downloading, or 
causing the downloading of, such software to locations (including 
electronic bulletin boards, Internet file transfer protocol, and World 
Wide Web sites) outside the U.S., or making such software available for 
transfer outside the United States, over wire, cable, radio, 
electromagnetic, photooptical, photoelectric or other comparable 
communications facilities accessible to persons outside the United 
States, including transfers from electronic bulletin boards, Internet 
file transfer protocol and World Wide Web sites, unless the person 
making the software available takes precautions adequate to prevent 
unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States. Such 
precautions shall include:
    (A) Ensuring that the facility from which the software is available 
controls the access to and transfers of such software through such 
measures as:
    (1) The access control system, either through automated means or 
human intervention, checks the address of every system requesting or 
receiving a transfer and verifies that such systems are located within 
the United States;
    (2) The access control system, provides every requesting or 
receiving party with notice that the transfer includes or would include 
cryptographic software subject to export controls under the Export 
Administration Act, and that anyone receiving such a transfer cannot 
export the software without a license; and
    (3) Every party requesting or receiving a transfer of such software 
must acknowledge affirmatively that he or she understands that the 
cryptographic software is subject to export controls under the Export 
Administration Act and that anyone receiving the transfer cannot export 
the software without a license; or
    (B) Taking other precautions, approved in writing by the Bureau of 
Export Administration, to prevent transfer of such software outside the 
U.S. without a license.

Trade Zone or moving intransit through the United States from one 
foreign country to another;
    (2) All U.S. origin items wherever located;
    (3) U.S. origin parts, components, materials or other commodities 
incorporated abroad into foreign-made products, U.S. origin software 
commingled with foreign software, and U.S. origin technology commingled 
with foreign technology, in quantities exceeding de minimis levels as 
described in Sec. 734.4 and Supplement No. 2 of this part;
    (4) Certain foreign-made direct products of U.S. origin technology 
or software, as described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR. The term 
``direct product'' means the immediate product (including processes and 
services) produced directly by the use of technology or software; and
    (5) Certain commodities produced by any plant or major component of 
a plant located outside the United States that is a direct product of 
U.S.-origin technology or software, as described in Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of 
the EAR.
    (b) The following items are not subject to the EAR:
    (1) Items that are exclusively controlled for export or reexport by 
the following departments and agencies of the U.S. Government which 
regulate exports or reexports for national security or foreign policy 
purposes:
    (i) Department of State. The International Traffic in Arms 
Regulations (22 CFR part 121) administered by the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls relate to defense articles and defense services on the 
U.S. Munitions List. Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 
U.S.C. 2778).
    (ii) Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). 
Regulations administered by OFAC implement broad controls and embargo 
transactions with certain foreign countries. These regulations include 
controls on exports and reexports to certain countries (31 CFR chapter 
V). Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. app. section 1 et seq.), and 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.)
    (iii) U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Regulations 
administered by NRC control the export and reexport of commodities 
related to nuclear reactor vessels (10 CFR part 110). Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. part 2011 et seq.).
    (iv) Department of Energy (DOE). Regulations administered by DOE 
control the export and reexport of technology related to the production 
of special nuclear materials (10 CFR part 810). Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. section 2011 et seq.).
    (v) Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Regulations administered by 
PTO provide for the export to a foreign country of unclassified 
technology in the form of a patent application or an amendment, 
modification, or supplement thereto or division thereof (37 CFR part 5). 
BXA has delegated authority under the Export Administration Act to the 
PTO to approve exports and reexports of such technology which is subject 
to the EAR. Exports and reexports of such technology not approved under 
PTO regulations must comply with the EAR.
    (2) Prerecorded phonograph records reproducing in whole or in part, 
the content of printed books, pamphlets, and miscellaneous publications, 
including newspapers and periodicals; printed books, pamphlets, and 
miscellaneous publications including bound newspapers and periodicals; 
children's picture and painting books; newspaper and periodicals, 
unbound, excluding waste; music books; sheet music; calendars and 
calendar blocks, paper; maps, hydrographical charts, atlases, 
gazetteers, globe covers, and globes (terrestrial and celestial); 
exposed and developed microfilm reproducing, in whole or in part, the 
content of any of the above; exposed and developed motion picture film 
and soundtrack; and advertising printed matter exclusively related 
thereto.
    (3) Publicly available technology and software, except software 
controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List, 
that:
    (i) Are already published or will be published as described in 
Sec. 734.7 of this part;

[[Page 152]]

    (ii) Arise during, or result from, fundamental research, as 
described in Sec. 734.8 of this part;
    (iii) Are educational, as described in Sec. 734.9 of this part;
    (iv) Are included in certain patent applications, as described in 
Sec. 734.10 of this part.

    Note to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section: A printed book 
or other printed material setting forth encryption source code is not 
itself subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). However, 
notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2), encryption source code in electronic 
form or media (e.g., computer diskette or CD ROM) remains subject to the 
EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(3)).

    (4) Foreign made items that have greater than the de minimis U.S. 
content based on the principles described in Sec. 734.4 of this part.
    (c) ``Items subject to the EAR'' consist of the items listed on the 
Commerce Control List (CCL) in part 774 of the EAR and all other items 
which meet the definition of that term. For ease of reference and 
classification purposes, items subject to the EAR which are not listed 
on the CCL are designated as ``EAR99.''
[61 FR 12746, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 65464, Dec. 13, 1996; 
61 FR 68578, Dec. 30, 1996; 62 FR 25456, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 734.4  De minimis U.S. content.

    (a) There is no de minimis level for the export from a foreign 
country of a foreign-made computer exceeding 7000 MTOPS containing U.S.-
origin controlled semiconductors (other than memory circuits) classified 
under ECCN 3A001 or high speed interconnect devices (ECCN 4A003.g) to 
Computer Tier 3 and 4 countries described in Sec. 742.12 of the EAR.
    (b) There is no de minimis level for the reexport of foreign-origin 
items that incorporate the following:
    (1) Items controlled by ECCN 9A004.a; or
    (2) ``Information security'' systems and equipment, cryptographic 
devices, software and components specifically designed or modified 
therefor, and related technology controlled for ``EI'' reasons under 
ECCN, 5A002 ECCN 5D002, and 5E002. Certain mass market encryption 
software may become eligible for de minimis only after a one-time BXA 
review (refer to Sec. 742.15(b)(1)).
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section for certain 
computers, the following reexports are not subject to the EAR when made 
to either an embargoed country listed in part 746 of the EAR or to a 
terrorist-supporting country as described in part 742 of the EAR:
    (1) Reexports of a foreign-made commodity incorporating controlled 
U.S.-origin commodities valued at 10% or less of the total value of the 
foreign-made commodity;
    (2) Reexports of foreign-made software incorporating controlled 
U.S.-origin software valued at 10% or less of the total value of the 
foreign-made software; or
    (3) Reexports of foreign technology commingled with or drawn from 
controlled U.S.-origin technology valued at 10% or less of the total 
value of the foreign technology.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section for certain 
computers, for all other countries not included in paragraph (b) of this 
section the following reexports are not subject to the EAR:
    (1) Reexports of a foreign-made commodity incorporating controlled 
U.S.-origin commodities valued at 25% or less of the total value of the 
foreign-made commodity;
    (2) Reexports of foreign-made software incorporating controlled 
U.S.-origin software valued at 25% or less of the total value of the 
foreign-made software; or
    (3) Reexports of foreign technology commingled with or drawn from 
controlled U.S.-origin technology valued at 25% or less of the total 
value of the foreign technology.
    (e) For purposes of determining de minimis levels, technology and 
source code used to design or produce foreign-made commodities or 
software are not considered to be incorporated into such foreign-made 
commodities or software. Commodities subject only to short supply 
controls are not included in calculating U.S. content.
    (f) You are responsible for making the necessary calculations to 
determine whether the de minimis provisions

[[Page 153]]

apply to your situation. See Supplement No. 2 to part 734 for guidance 
regarding calculation of U.S. controlled content.
    (g) See Sec. 770.3 of the EAR for principles that apply to 
commingled U.S.-origin technology and software.
    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, U.S.-origin technology controlled by ECCN 9E003a.1 through 
a.12, and .f, and related controls, and encryption software controlled 
for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5D002 or encryption technology controlled 
for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5E002 do not lose their U.S.-origin when 
redrawn, used, consulted, or otherwise commingled abroad in any respect 
with other software or technology of any other origin. Therefore, any 
subsequent or similar software or technology prepared or engineered 
abroad for the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of any 
plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is based on or uses any such 
U.S.-origin software or technology is subject to the EAR.
[61 FR 12746, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 54543, Oct. 21, 1996; 
61 FR 65464, Dec. 13, 1996; 61 FR 68578, Dec. 30, 1996; 62 FR 25456, May 
9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 734.5  Activities of U.S. and foreign persons subject to the EAR.

    The following kinds of activities are subject to the EAR:
    (a) Certain activities of U.S. persons related to the proliferation 
of chemical or biological weapons or of missile technology as described 
in Sec. 744.6 of the EAR.
    (b) Activities of U.S. or foreign persons prohibited by any order 
issued under the EAR, including a Denial Order issued pursuant to part 
766 of the EAR.
    (c) Technical assistance by U.S. persons with respect to encryption 
commodities or software as described in Sec. 744.9 of the EAR.
[61 FR 12746, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68578, Dec. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 734.6  Assistance available from BXA for determining licensing and other requirements.

    (a) If you are not sure whether a commodity, software, technology, 
or activity is subject to the EAR, or is subject to licensing or other 
requirements under the EAR, you may ask BXA for an advisory opinion, 
classification, or a determination whether a particular item or activity 
is subject to the EAR. In many instances, including those where the item 
is specially designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for 
military application, the item may fall under the licensing jurisdiction 
of the Department of State and may be subject to the controls of the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) 
(ITAR). In order to determine if the Department of State has licensing 
jurisdiction over an item, you should submit a request for a commodity 
jurisdiction determination to the Department of State, Office of Defense 
Trade Controls. Exporters should note that in a very limited number of 
cases, the categories of items may be subject to both the ITAR and the 
EAR. The relevant departments are working to eliminate any unnecessary 
overlaps that may exist.
    (b) As the agency responsible for administering the EAR, BXA is the 
only agency that has the responsibility for determining whether an item 
or activity is subject to the EAR and, if so, what licensing or other 
requirements apply under the EAR. Such a determination only affects EAR 
requirements, and does not affect the applicability of any other 
regulatory programs.
    (c) If you need help in determining BXA licensing or other 
requirements you may ask BXA for help by following the procedures 
described in Sec. 748.3 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 734.7  Published information and software.

    (a) Information is ``published'' when it becomes generally 
accessible to the interested public in any form, including:
    (1) Publication in periodicals, books, print, electronic, or any 
other media available for general distribution to any member of the 
public or to a community of persons interested in the subject matter, 
such as those in a scientific or engineering discipline, either free or 
at a price that does not exceed

[[Page 154]]

the cost of reproduction and distribution (See Supplement No. 1 to this 
part, Questions A(1) through A(6));
    (2) Ready availability at libraries open to the public or at 
university libraries (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question A(6));
    (3) Patents and open (published) patent applications available at 
any patent office; and
    (4) Release at an open conference, meeting, seminar, trade show, or 
other open gathering.
    (i) A conference or gathering is ``open'' if all technically 
qualified members of the public are eligible to attend and attendees are 
permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record (not 
necessarily a recording) of the proceedings and presentations.
    (ii) All technically qualified members of the public may be 
considered eligible to attend a conference or other gathering 
notwithstanding a registration fee reasonably related to cost and 
reflecting an intention that all interested and technically qualified 
persons be able to attend, or a limitation on actual attendance, as long 
as attendees either are the first who have applied or are selected on 
the basis of relevant scientific or technical competence, experience, or 
responsibility (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions B(1) 
through B(6)).
    (iii) ``Publication'' includes submission of papers to domestic or 
foreign editors or reviewers of journals, or to organizers of open 
conferences or other open gatherings, with the understanding that the 
papers will be made publicly available if favorably received. (See 
Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions A(1) and A(3)).
    (b) Software and information is published when it is available for 
general distribution either for free or at a price that does not exceed 
the cost of reproduction and distribution. See Supplement No. 1 to this 
part, Questions G(1) through G(3).
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, note 
that encryption software controlled under ECCN 5D002 for ``EI'' reasons 
on the Commerce Control List (refer to Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of 
the EAR) remains subject to the EAR even when publicly available.

Sec. 734.8  Information resulting from fundamental research.

    (a) Fundamental research. Paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section 
and Sec. 734.11 of this part provide specific rules that will be used to 
determine whether research in particular institutional contexts 
qualifies as ``fundamental research''. The intent behind these rules is 
to identify as ``fundamental research'' basic and applied research in 
science and engineering, where the resulting information is ordinarily 
published and shared broadly within the scientific community. Such 
research can be distinguished from proprietary research and from 
industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the 
results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary reasons or 
specific national security reasons as defined in Sec. 734.11(b) of this 
part. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question D(8)). Note that the 
provisions of this section do not apply to encryption software 
controlled under ECCN 5D002 for ``EI'' reasons on the Commerce Control 
List (refer to Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR).
    (b) University based research. (1) Research conducted by scientists, 
engineers, or students at a university normally will be considered 
fundamental research, as described in paragraphs (b) (2) through (6) of 
this section. (``University'' means any accredited institution of higher 
education located in the United States.)
    (2) Prepublication review by a sponsor of university research solely 
to insure that the publication would not inadvertently divulge 
proprietary information that the sponsor has furnished to the 
researchers does not change the status of the research as fundamental 
research. However, release of information from a corporate sponsor to 
university researchers where the research results are subject to 
prepublication review, is subject to the EAR. (See Supplement No. 1 to 
this part, Questions D(7), D(9), and D(10).)

[[Page 155]]

    (3) Prepublication review by a sponsor of university research solely 
to ensure that publication would not compromise patent rights does not 
change the status of fundamental research, so long as the review causes 
no more than a temporary delay in publication of the research results.
    (4) The initial transfer of information from an industry sponsor to 
university researchers is subject to the EAR where the parties have 
agreed that the sponsor may withhold from publication some or all of the 
information so provided. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question 
D(2).)
    (5) University based research is not considered ``fundamental 
research'' if the university or its researchers accept (at the request, 
for example, of an industrial sponsor) other restrictions on publication 
of scientific and technical information resulting from the project or 
activity. Scientific and technical information resulting from the 
research will nonetheless qualify as fundamental research once all such 
restrictions have expired or have been removed. (See Supplement No. 1 to 
this part, Question D(7) and D(9).)
    (6) The provisions of Sec. 734.11 of this part will apply if a 
university or its researchers accept specific national security controls 
(as defined in Sec. 734.11 of this part) on a research project or 
activity sponsored by the U.S. Government. (See Supplement No. 1 to this 
part, Questions E(1) and E(2).)
    (c) Research based at Federal agencies or FFRDCs. Research conducted 
by scientists or engineers working for a Federal agency or a Federally 
Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) may be designated as 
``fundamental research'' within any appropriate system devised by the 
agency or the FFRDC to control the release of information by such 
scientists and engineers. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions 
D(8) and D(11).)
    (d) Corporate research. (1) Research conducted by scientists or 
engineers working for a business entity will be considered ``fundamental 
research'' at such time and to the extent that the researchers are free 
to make scientific and technical information resulting from the research 
publicly available without restriction or delay based on proprietary 
concerns or specific national security controls as defined in 
Sec. 734.11(b) of this part.
    (2) Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that the 
publication would compromise no proprietary information provided by the 
company to the researchers is not considered to be a proprietary 
restriction under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. However, paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section does not authorize the release of information to 
university researchers where the research results are subject to 
prepublication review. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions 
D(8), D(9), and D(10).)
    (3) Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that 
prepublication would compromise no patent rights will not be considered 
a proprietary restriction for this purpose, so long as the review causes 
no more than a temporary delay in publication of the research results.
    (4) However, the initial transfer of information from a business 
entity to researchers is not authorized under the ``fundamental 
research'' provision where the parties have agreed that the business 
entity may withhold from publication some or all of the information so 
provided.
    (e) Research based elsewhere. Research conducted by scientists or 
engineers who are not working for any of the institutions described in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section will be treated as corporate 
research, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. (See Supplement 
No. 1 to this part, Question D(8).)

Sec. 734.9  Educational information.

    ``Educational information'' referred to in Sec. 734.3(b)(3)(iii) of 
this part is not subject to the EAR if it is released by instruction in 
catalog courses and associated teaching laboratories of academic 
institutions. Dissertation research is discussed in Sec. 734.8(b) of 
this part. (Refer to Supplement No. 1 to this part, Question C(1) 
through C(6)). Note that the provisions of this section do not apply to

Sec. 734.10  Patent applications.

    The information referred to in Sec. 734.3(b)(3)(iv) of this part is:
    (a) Information contained in a patent application prepared wholly 
from foreign-origin technical data where the application is being sent 
to the foreign inventor to be executed and returned to the United States 
for subsequent filing in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office;
    (b) Information contained in a patent application, or an amendment, 
modification, supplement or division of an application, and authorized 
for filing in a foreign country in accordance with the regulations of 
the Patent and Trademark Office, 37 CFR part 5; <SUP>1</SUP> or
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\ Regulations issued by the Patent and Trademark Office in 37 CFR 
part 5 provide for the export to a foreign country of unclassified 
technical data in the form of a patent application or an amendment, 
modification, or supplement thereto or division thereof.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Information contained in a patent application when sent to a 
foreign country before or within six months after the filing of a United 
States patent application for the purpose of obtaining the signature of 
an inventor who was in the United States when the invention was made or 
who is a co-inventor with a person residing in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 734.11  Government-sponsored research covered by contract controls.

    (a) If research is funded by the U.S. Government, and specific 
national security controls are agreed on to protect information 
resulting from the research, Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of this part will not 
apply to any export or reexport of such information in violation of such 
controls. However, any export or reexport of information resulting from 
the research that is consistent with the specific controls may 
nonetheless be made under this provision.
    (b) Examples of ``specific national security controls'' include 
requirements for prepublication review by the Government, with right to 
withhold permission for publication; restrictions on prepublication 
dissemination of information to non-U.S. citizens or other categories of 
persons; or restrictions on participation of non-U.S. citizens or other 
categories of persons in the research. A general reference to one or 
more export control laws or regulations or a general reminder that the 
Government retains the right to classify is not a ``specific national 
security control''. (See Supplement No. 1 to this part, Questions E(1) 
and E(2).)

Sec. 734.12  Effect on foreign laws and regulations.

    Any person who complies with any of the license or other 
requirements of the EAR is not relieved of the responsibility of 
complying with applicable foreign laws and regulations. Conversely, any 
person who complies with the license or other requirements of a foreign 
law or regulation is not relieved of the responsibility of complying 
with U.S. laws and regulations, including the EAR.

  Supplement No. 1 to Part 734--Questions and Answers--Technology and 
                       Software Subject to the EAR

    This Supplement No. 1 contains explanatory questions and answers 
relating to technology and software that is subject to the EAR. It is 
intended to give the public guidance in understanding how BXA interprets 
this part, but is only illustrative, not comprehensive. In addition, 
facts or circumstances that differ in any material way from those set 
forth in the questions or answers will be considered under the 
applicable provisions of the EAR. Exporters should note that the 
provisions of this supplement do not apply to encryption software 
(including source code) transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the 
Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 
(61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date. 
See Sec. 742.15 of the EAR. This supplement is divided into nine 
sections according to topic as follows:
    Section A: Publication of technology and exports and reexports of 
technology that has been or will be published.
    Section B: Release of technology at conferences.
    Section C: Educational instruction.
    Section D: Research, correspondence, and informal scientific 
exchanges.

    Section E: Federal contract controls.
    Section F: Commercial consulting.
    Section G: Software.
    Section H: Availability in a public library.
    Section I: Miscellaneous.

                         Section A: Publication

    Question A(1): I plan to publish in a foreign journal a scientific 
paper describing the results of my research, which is in an area listed 
in the EAR as requiring a license to all countries except Canada. Do I 
need a license to send a copy to my publisher abroad?
    Answer: No. This export transaction is not subject to the EAR. The 
EAR do not cover technology that is already publicly available, as well 
as technology that is made public by the transaction in question 
(Secs. 734.3 and 734.7 of this part). Your research results would be 
made public by the planned publication. You would not need a license.
    Question A(2): Would the answer differ depending on where I work or 
where I performed the research?
    Answer: No. Of course, the result would be different if your 
employer or another sponsor of your research imposed restrictions on its 
publication (Sec. 734.8 of this part).
    Question (A)3: Would I need a license to send the paper to the 
editors of a foreign journal for review to determine whether it will be 
accepted for publication?
    Answer: No. This export transaction is not subject to the EAR 
because you are submitting the paper to the editors with the intention 
that the paper will be published if favorably received 
(Sec. 734.7(a)(4)(iii) of this part).
    Question A(4): The research on which I will be reporting in my paper 
is supported by a grant from the Department of Energy (DOE). The grant 
requires prepublication clearance by DOE. Does that make any difference 
under the Export Administration Regulations?
    Answer: No, the transaction is not subject to the EAR. But if you 
published in violation of any Department of Energy controls you have 
accepted in the grant, you may be subject to appropriate administrative, 
civil, or criminal sanctions under other laws.
    Question A(5): We provide consulting services on the design, layout, 
and construction of integrated circuit plants and production lines. A 
major part of our business is the publication for sale to clients of 
detailed handbooks and reference manuals on key aspects on the design 
and manufacturing processes. A typical cost of publishing such a 
handbook and manual might be $500; the typical sales price is about 
$15,000. Is the publication and sale of such handbooks or manuals 
subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Yes. The price is above the cost of reproduction and 
distribution (Sec. 734.7(a)(1) of this part). Thus, you would need to 
obtain a license or qualify for a License Exception before you could 
export or reexport any of these handbooks or manuals.
    Question A(6): My Ph.D. thesis is on technology, listed in the EAR 
as requiring a license to all destinations except Canada, which has 
never been published for general distribution. However, the thesis is 
available at the institution from which I took the degree. Do I need a 
license to send another copy to a colleague overseas?
    Answer: That may depend on where in the institution it is available. 
If it is not readily available in the university library (e.g., by 
filing in open stacks with a reference in the catalog), it is not 
``publicly available'' and the export or reexport would be subject to 
the EAR on that ground. The export or reexport would not be subject to 
the EAR if your Ph.D. research qualified as ``fundamental research'' 
under Sec. 734.8 of this part. If not, however, you will need to obtain 
a license or qualify for a License Exception before you can send a copy 
out of the country.
    Question A(7): We sell electronically recorded information, 
including software and databases, at wholesale and retail. Our products 
are available by mail order to any member of the public, though intended 
for specialists in various fields. They are priced to maximize sales to 
persons in those fields. Do we need a license to sell our products to 
foreign customers?
    Answer: You would not need a license for otherwise controlled 
technology or software if the technology and software are made publicly 
available at a price that does not exceed the cost of production and 
distribution to the technical community. Even if priced at a higher 
level, the export or reexport of the technology or software source code 
in a library accessible to the public is not subject to the EAR 
(Sec. 734.7(a) of this part).

                         Section B: Conferences

    Question B(1): I have been invited to give a paper at a prestigious 
international scientific conference on a subject listed as requiring a 
license under the EAR to all countries, except Canada. Scientists in the 
field are given an opportunity to submit applications to attend. 
Invitations are given to those judged to be the leading researchers in 
the field, and attendance is by invitation only. Attendees will be free 
to take notes, but not make electronic or verbatim recordings of the 
presentations or discussions. Some of the attendees will be foreigners. 
Do I need a license to give my paper?
    Answer: No. Release of information at an open conference and 
information that has been released at an open conference is not subject 
to the EAR. The conference you describe fits the definition of an open 
conference (Sec. 734.7(a) of this part).

[[Page 158]]

    Question B(2): Would it make any difference if there were a 
prohibition on making any notes or other personal record of what 
transpires at the conference?
    Answer: Yes. To qualify as an ``open'' conference, attendees must be 
permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record (although 
not necessarily a recording). If note taking or the making of personal 
records is altogether prohibited, the conference would not be considered 
``open''.
    Question B(3): Would it make any difference if there were also a 
registration fee?
    Answer: That would depend on whether the fee is reasonably related 
to costs and reflects an intention that all interested and technically 
qualified persons should be able to attend (Sec. 734.7(a)(4)(ii) of this 
part).
    Question B(4): Would it make any difference if the conference were 
to take place in another country?
    Answer: No.
    Question B(5): Must I have a license to send the paper I propose to 
present at such a foreign conference to the conference organizer for 
review?
    Answer: No. A license is not required under the EAR to submit papers 
to foreign organizers of open conferences or other open gatherings with 
the intention that the papers will be delivered at the conference, and 
so made publicly available, if favorably received. The submission of the 
papers is not subject to the EAR (Sec. 734.7(a)(4)(iii) of this part).
    Question B(6): Would the answers to any of the foregoing questions 
be different if my work were supported by the Federal Government?
    Answer: No. You may export and reexport the papers, even if the 
release of the paper violates any agreements you have made with your 
government sponsor. However, nothing in the EAR relieves you of 
responsibility for conforming to any controls you have agreed to in your 
Federal grant or contract.

                   Section C: Educational Instruction

    Question C(1): I teach a university graduate course on design and 
manufacture of very high-speed integrated circuitry. Many of the 
students are foreigners. Do I need a license to teach this course?
    Answer: No. Release of information by instruction in catalog courses 
and associated teaching laboratories of academic institutions is not 
subject to the EAR (Sec. 734.9 of this part).
    Question C(2): Would it make any difference if some of the students 
were from countries to which export licenses are required?
    Answer: No.
    Question C(3): Would it make any difference if I talk about recent 
and as yet unpublished results from my laboratory research?
    Answer: No.
    Question C(4): Even if that research is funded by the Government?
    Answer: Even then, but you would not be released from any separate 
obligations you have accepted in your grant or contract.
    Question C(5): Would it make any difference if I were teaching at a 
foreign university?
    Answer: No.
    Question C(6): We teach proprietary courses on design and 
manufacture of high-performance machine tools. Is the instruction in our 
classes subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Yes. That instruction would not qualify as ``release of 
educational information'' under Sec. 734.9 of this part because your 
proprietary business does not qualify as an ``academic institution'' 
within the meaning of Sec. 734.9 of this part. Conceivably, however, the 
instruction might qualify as ``release at an open * * * seminar, * * * 
or other open gathering'' under Sec. 734.7(a) of this part. The 
conditions for qualification of such a seminar or gathering as ``open'', 
including a fee ``reasonably related to costs (of the conference, not of 
producing the data) and reflecting an intention that all interested and 
technically qualified persons be able to attend,'' would have to be 
satisfied.

 Section D: Research, Correspondence, and Informal Scientific Exchanges

    Question D(1): Do I need a license in order for a foreign graduate 
student to work in my laboratory?
    Answer: Not if the research on which the foreign student is working 
qualifies as ``fundamental research'' under Sec. 734.8 of this part. In 
that case, the research is not subject to the EAR.
    Question D(2): Our company has entered into a cooperative research 
arrangement with a research group at a university. One of the 
researchers in that group is a PRC national. We would like to share some 
of our proprietary information with the university research group. We 
have no way of guaranteeing that this information will not get into the 
hands of the PRC scientist. Do we need to obtain a license to protect 
against that possibility?
    Answer: No. The EAR do not cover the disclosure of information to 
any scientists, engineers, or students at a U.S. university in the 
course of industry-university research collaboration under specific 
arrangements between the firm and the university, provided these 
arrangements do not permit the sponsor to withhold from publication any 
of the information that he provides to the researchers. However, if your 
company and the researchers have agreed to a prohibition on publication, 
then you must obtain a license or qualify for a License Exception before

[[Page 159]]

transferring the information to the university. It is important that you 
as the corporate sponsor and the university get together to discuss 
whether foreign nationals will have access to the information, so that 
you may obtain any necessary authorization prior to transferring the 
information to the research team.
    Question D(3): My university will host a prominent scientist from 
the PRC who is an expert on research in engineered ceramics and 
composite materials. Do I require a license before telling our visitor 
about my latest, as yet unpublished, research results in those fields?
    Answer: Probably not. If you performed your research at the 
university, and you were subject to no contract controls on release of 
the research, your research would qualify as ``fundamental research'' 
(Sec. 734.8(a) of this part). Information arising during or resulting 
from such research is not subject to the EAR (Sec. 734.3(b)(3) of this 
part).
    You should probably assume, however, that your visitor will be 
debriefed later about anything of potential military value he learns 
from you. If you are concerned that giving such information to him, even 
though permitted, could jeopardize U.S. security interests, the Commerce 
Department can put you in touch with appropriate Government scientists 
who can advise you. Write to Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export 
Administration, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
    Question D(4): Would it make any difference if I were proposing to 
talk with a PRC expert in China?
    Answer: No, if the information in question arose during or resulted 
from the same ``fundamental research.''
    Question D(5): Could I properly do some work with him in his 
research laboratory inside China?
    Answer: Application abroad of personal knowledge or technical 
experience acquired in the United States constitutes an export of that 
knowledge and experience, and such an export may be subject to the EAR. 
If any of the knowledge or experience you export in this way requires a 
license under the EAR, you must obtain such a license or qualify for a 
License Exception.
    Question D(6): I would like to correspond and share research results 
with an Iranian expert in my field, which deals with technology that 
requires a license to all destinations except Canada. Do I need a 
license to do so?
    Answer: Not as long as we are still talking about information that 
arose during or resulted from research that qualifies as ``fundamental'' 
under the rules spelled out in Sec. 734.8(a) of this part.
    Question D(7): Suppose the research in question were funded by a 
corporate sponsor and I had agreed to prepublication review of any paper 
arising from the research?
    Answer: Whether your research would still qualify as ``fundamental'' 
would depend on the nature and purpose of the prepublication review. If 
the review is intended solely to ensure that your publications will 
neither compromise patent rights nor inadvertently divulge proprietary 
information that the sponsor has furnished to you, the research could 
still qualify as ``fundamental.'' But if the sponsor will consider as 
part of its prepublication review whether it wants to hold your new 
research results as trade secrets or otherwise proprietary information 
(even if your voluntary cooperation would be needed for it to do so), 
your research would no longer qualify as ``fundamental.'' As used in 
these regulations it is the actual and intended openness of research 
results that primarily determines whether the research counts as 
``fundamental'' and so is not subject to the EAR.
    Question D(8): In determining whether research is thus open and 
therefore counts as ``fundamental,'' does it matter where or in what 
sort of institution the research is performed?
    Answer: In principle, no. ``Fundamental research'' is performed in 
industry, Federal laboratories, or other types of institutions, as well 
as in universities. The regulations introduce some operational 
presumptions and procedures that can be used both by those subject to 
the regulations and by those who administer them to determine with some 
precision whether a particular research activity is covered. Recognizing 
that common and predictable norms operate in different types of 
institutions, the regulations use the institutional locus of the 
research as a starting point for these presumptions and procedures. 
Nonetheless, it remains the type of research, and particularly the 
intent and freedom to publish, that identifies ``fundamental research,'' 
not the institutional locus (Sec. 734.8(a) of this part).
    Question D(9): I am doing research on high-powered lasers in the 
central basic-research laboratory of an industrial corporation. I am 
required to submit the results of my research for prepublication review 
before I can publish them or otherwise make them public. I would like to 
compare research results with a scientific colleague from Vietnam and 
discuss the results of the research with her when she visits the United 
States. Do I need a license to do so?
    Answer: You probably do need a license (Sec. 734.8(d) of this part). 
However, if the only restriction on your publishing any of that 
information is a prepublication review solely to ensure that publication 
would compromise no patent rights or proprietary information provided by 
the company to the researcher your research may be considered 
``fundamental research,'' in which case you

[[Page 160]]

may be able to share information because it is not subject to the EAR. 
Note that the information will be subject to the EAR if the 
prepublication review is intended to withhold the results of the 
research from publication.
    Question D(10): Suppose I have already cleared my company's review 
process and am free to publish all the information I intend to share 
with my colleague, though I have not yet published?
    Answer: If the clearance from your company means that you are free 
to make all the information publicly available without restriction or 
delay, the information is not subject to the EAR. (Sec. 734.8(d) of this 
part)
    Question D(11): I work as a researcher at a Government-owned, 
contractor-operated research center. May I share the results of my 
unpublished research with foreign nationals without concern for export 
controls under the EAR?
    Answer: That is up to the sponsoring agency and the center's 
management. If your research is designated ``fundamental research'' 
within any appropriate system devised by them to control release of 
information by scientists and engineers at the center, it will be 
treated as such by the Commerce Department, and the research will not be 
subject to the EAR. Otherwise, you would need to obtain a license or 
qualify for a License Exception, except to publish or otherwise make the 
information public (Sec. 734.8(c) of this part).

                  Section E: Federal Contract Controls

    Question E(1): In a contract for performance of research entered 
into with the Department of Defense (DOD), we have agreed to certain 
national security controls. DOD is to have ninety days to review any 
papers we proposed before they are published and must approve assignment 
of any foreign nationals to the project. The work in question would 
otherwise qualify as ``fundamental research'' section under Sec. 734.8 
of this part. Is the information arising during or resulting from this 
sponsored research subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Under Sec. 734.11 of this part, any export or reexport of 
information resulting from government-sponsored research that is 
inconsistent with contract controls you have agreed to will not qualify 
as ``fundamental research'' and any such export or reexport would be 
subject to the EAR. Any such export or reexport that is consistent with 
the controls will continue to be eligible for export and reexport under 
the ``fundamental research'' rule set forth in Sec. 734.8(a) of this 
part. Thus, if you abide by the specific controls you have agreed to, 
you need not be concerned about violating the EAR. If you violate those 
controls and export or reexport information as ``fundamental research'' 
under Sec. 734.8(a) of this part, you may subject yourself to the 
sanctions provided for under the EAR, including criminal sanctions, in 
addition to administrative and civil penalties for breach of contract 
under other law.
    Question E(2): Do the Export Administration Regulations restrict my 
ability to publish the results of my research?
    Answer: The Export Administration Regulations are not the means for 
enforcing the national security controls you have agreed to. If such a 
publication violates the contract, you would be subject to 
administrative, civil, and possible criminal penalties under other law.

                    Section F: Commercial Consulting

    Question F(1): I am a professor at a U.S. university, with expertise 
in design and creation of submicron devices. I have been asked to be a 
consultant for a ``third-world'' company that wishes to manufacture such 
devices. Do I need a license to do so?
    Answer: Quite possibly you do. Application abroad of personal 
knowledge or technical experience acquired in the United States 
constitutes an export of that knowledge and experience that is subject 
to the Export Administration Regulations. If any part of the knowledge 
or experience your export or reexport deals with technology that 
requires a license under the EAR, you will need to obtain a license or 
qualify for a License Exception.

                    Section G: Software <SUP>2</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \2\ Exporters should note that these provisions do not apply to 
software controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations 
(e.g., certain encryption software).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Question G(1): Is the export or reexport of software in machine 
readable code subject to the EAR when the source code for such software 
is publicly available?
    Answer: If the source code of a software program is publicly 
available, then the machine readable code compiled from the source code 
is software that is publicly available and therefore not subject to the 
EAR.
    Question G(2): Is the export or reexport of software sold at a price 
that does not exceed the cost of reproduction and distribution subject 
to the EAR?
    Answer: Software in machine readable code is publicly available if 
it is available to a community at a price that does not exceed the cost 
of reproduction and distribution. Such reproduction and distribution 
costs may include variable and fixed allocations of overhead and normal 
profit for the reproduction and distribution functions either in your 
company or in a third party distribution system. In your company, such 
costs may not include recovery for development, design, or acquisition. 
In this case, the provider of the software does not receive a fee for 
the inherent value of the software.

[[Page 161]]

    Question G(3): Is the export or reexport of software subject to the 
EAR if it is sold at a price BXA concludes in a classification letter to 
be sufficiently low so as not to subject it to the EAR?
    Answer: In response to classification requests, BXA may choose to 
classify certain software as not subject to the EAR even though it is 
sold at a price above the costs of reproduction and distribution as long 
as the price is nonetheless sufficiently low to qualify for such a 
classification in the judgment of BXA.

                Section H: Available in a Public Library

    Question H(1): Is the export or reexport of information subject to 
the EAR if it is available in a library and sold through an electronic 
or print service?
    Answer: Electronic and print services for the distribution of 
information may be relatively expensive in the marketplace because of 
the value vendors add in retrieving and organizing information in a 
useful way. If such information is also available in a library--itself 
accessible to the public--or has been published in any way, that 
information is ``publicly available'' for those reasons, and the 
information itself continues not to be subject to the EAR even though 
you access the information through an electronic or print service for 
which you or your employer pay a substantial fee.
    Question H(2): Is the export or reexport of information subject to 
the EAR if the information is available in an electronic form in a 
library at no charge to the library patron?
    Answer: Information available in an electronic form at no charge to 
the library patron in a library accessible to the public is information 
publicly available even though the library pays a substantial 
subscription fee for the electronic retrieval service.
    Question H(3): Is the export or reexport of information subject to 
the EAR if the information is available in a library and sold for more 
than the cost of reproduction and distribution?
    Answer: Information from books, magazines, dissertations, papers, 
electronic data bases, and other information available in a library that 
is accessible to the public is not subject to the EAR. This is true even 
if you purchase such a book at more than the cost of reproduction and 
distribution. In other words, such information is ``publicly available'' 
even though the author makes a profit on your particular purchase for 
the inherent value of the information.

                        Section I: Miscellaneous

    Question I(1): The manufacturing plant that I work at is planning to 
begin admitting groups of the general public to tour the plant 
facilities. We are concerned that a license might be required if the 
tour groups include foreign nationals. Would such a tour constitute an 
export? If so, is the export subject to the EAR?
    Answer: The EAR define exports and reexports of technology to 
include release through visual inspection by foreign nationals of U.S.-
origin equipment and facilities. Such an export or reexport qualifies 
under the ``publicly available'' provision and would not be subject to 
the EAR so long as the tour is truly open to all members of the public, 
including your competitors, and you do not charge a fee that is not 
reasonably related to the cost of conducting the tours. Otherwise, you 
will have to obtain a license, or qualify for a License Exception, prior 
to permitting foreign nationals to tour your facilities (Sec. 734.7 of 
this part).
    Question I(2): Is the export or reexport of information subject to 
the EAR if the information is not in a library or published, but sold at 
a price that does not exceed the cost of reproduction and distribution?
    Answer: Information that is not in a library accessible to the 
public and that has not been published in any way, may nonetheless 
become ``publicly available'' if you make it both available to a 
community of persons and if you sell it at no more than the cost of 
reproduction and distribution. Such reproduction and distribution costs 
may include variable and fixed cost allocations of overhead and normal 
profit for the reproduction and distribution functions either in your 
company or in a third party distribution system. In your company, such 
costs may not include recovery for development, design, or acquisition 
costs of the technology or software. The reason for this conclusion is 
that the provider of the information receives nothing for the inherent 
value of the information.
    Question I(3): Is the export or reexport of information contributed 
to an electronic bulletin board subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Assume each of the following:
    1. Information is uploaded to an electronic bulletin board by a 
person that is the owner or originator of the information;
    2. That person does not charge a fee to the bulletin board 
administrator or the subscribers of the bulletin board; and
    3. The bulletin board is available for subscription to any 
subscriber in a given community regardless of the cost of subscription.
    Such information is ``publicly available'' and therefore not subject 
to the EAR even if it is not elsewhere published and is not in a 
library. The reason for this conclusion is that the bulletin board 
subscription charges or line charges are for distribution exclusively, 
and the provider of the information receives nothing for the inherent 
value of the information.

[[Page 162]]

    Question I(4): Is the export or reexport of patented information 
fully disclosed on the public record subject to the EAR?
    Answer: Information to the extent it is disclosed on the patent 
record open to the public is not subject to the EAR even though you may 
use such information only after paying a fee in excess of the costs of 
reproduction and distribution. In this case the seller does receive a 
fee for the inherent value of the technical data; however, the export or 
reexport of the information is nonetheless not subject to the EAR 
because any person can obtain the technology from the public record and 
further disclose or publish the information. For that reason, it is 
impossible to impose export controls that deny access to the 
information.

Supplement No. 2 to Part 734--Calculation of Values for De Minimis Rules

    (a) Use the following guidelines in determining values for 
establishing exemptions or for submission of a request for 
authorization:
    (1) U.S. content value.
    (i) U.S. content value is the delivered cost to the foreign 
manufacturer of the U.S. origin parts, components, or materials. (When 
affiliated firms have special arrangements that result in lower than 
normal pricing, the cost should reflect ``fair market'' prices that 
would normally be charged to similar, unaffiliated customers.)
    (ii) In calculating the U.S. content value, do not include parts, 
components, or materials that could be exported from the United States 
to the new country of destination without a license (designated as 
``NLR'') or under License Exception GBS (see part 740 of the EAR) or 
under NLR for items classified as EAR99.
    (2) The foreign-made product value is the normal selling price 
f.o.b. factory (excluding value added taxes or excise taxes).
    (3) To determine the value of the U.S.-origin controlled content, 
you should classify the U.S.-origin content on the Commerce Control 
List, determine those items that would require a license from BXA for 
reexport to the ultimate destination of the foreign-made product if such 
parts, components, or materials were reexported to that destination in 
the form received, and divide the total value of the controlled U.S. 
parts, components, and materials incorporated into the foreign-made item 
by the sale price of the foreign-made item.
    (4) If no U.S. parts, components or materials are incorporated or if 
the incorporated U.S. parts, components, and materials are below the de 
minimis level, then the foreign-made item is not subject to the EAR by 
reason of Sec. 734.4 of this part, the classification of a foreign-made 
item is irrelevant in determining the scope of the EAR, and you should 
skip Step 4 in Sec. 732.2(d) and go on to consider Step 6 in 
Sec. 732.2(f) of the EAR regarding the foreign-produced direct product 
rule.
    Note to paragraph (a)--U.S. origin peripheral or accessory devices 
that are merely rack mounted with or cable connected into foreign 
equipment are not deemed to be incorporated components even though 
intended for use with products made abroad. Rather, such items are 
treated as U.S. items that retain their identity and remain subject to 
the EAR.
    (b) One-time report prior to reliance upon the de minimis exclusion. 
Report requirement. Before you may rely upon the de minimis exclusion 
for foreign software and technology commingled with U.S. software or 
technology, you must file a one-time report for the foreign software or 
technology. The report must include the percentage of U.S.-content by 
value and a description of your calculations including relevant values, 
assumptions, and the basis or methodologies for making the percentage 
calculation. The three criteria important to BXA in its review of your 
report will be the export price of the U.S.-content, the assumption 
regarding future sales of software, and the choice of the scope of 
foreign technology. Your methodologies must be based upon the accounting 
standards used in the operation of your business, and you must specify 
that standard in your report. Regardless of the accounting systems, 
standard, or conventions you use in the operation of your business, you 
may not depreciate the fair market values reported or otherwise reduce 
the fair market values by other accounting conventions such as 
depreciation. You may rely upon the de minimis exclusion from the 
commingled rule only to the extent you have reported the relevant 
calculations, values, assumptions, and the basis or methodologies for 
the calculations. These values may be historic or projected. You may 
rely on projected values only to the extent that and for so long as they 
remain consistent with your report or future values reduce the U.S.-
content under your reported assumptions, basis, and methodologies. You 
are not required to file the above report if you do not choose to take 
advantage of the de minimis exclusion from the commingled rule.
    (2) Export price. The report must include a description of the U.S.-
content including its classification on the Commerce Control List, its 
performance characteristics and features, and the method of calculating 
its fair market value. The fair market value shall be the arms-length 
transaction price, if it is available. If an arms-length transaction 
price is unavailable, then the report will describe the

[[Page 163]]

valuation method chosen to calculate or derive the fair market value. 
Such methods may include comparable market prices or costs of production 
and distribution. This rule does not require calculations based upon any 
one accounting system or U.S. accounting standards. However, you must 
specify the accepted accounting standards you have chosen, and cost-
based methods of valuation must be based upon records you maintain in 
the normal course of business. You should also indicate whether reported 
values are actual arms-length market prices or derived from comparable 
transactions or costs of production, overhead, and profit. For example, 
if you chose to make calculations under the transfer pricing rules of 
the United States Internal Revenue Code at section 482, your report 
should indicate that this is the source for your methodology, and you 
should also indicate which of the several methodologies in these 
transfer pricing rules you have chosen.
    (3) Future software sales. For calculations of U.S.-content in 
foreign software, you shall include your historic and estimated future 
software sales in units and value along with the rationale and basis for 
those estimates in the report. Unlike parts incorporated into 
commodities, the cost of U.S. software code will be attributed or 
allocated to the future sales of foreign-made software incorporating the 
U.S. code, to determine the percentage of U.S. controlled content. In 
making this calculation for foreign-made software, you must make an 
estimate of future software sales of that foreign software if it is 
commingled with or incorporated with the U.S. code. The value of the 
U.S. code commingled with or incorporated into the foreign made software 
shall be divided by the total selling price of all foreign-made software 
units already sold, plus the total selling price of all foreign-made 
software units estimated for future sales.
    (4) Foreign technology and software. For calculations of U.S.-
content in foreign technology and software, you shall include in the 
report a description of the foreign technology or software and a 
description of its fair market value along with the rationale and basis 
for the selection and valuation of such foreign software or technology. 
The report does not require information regarding destinations and end 
users for reexport. The purpose of the report is solely to permit the 
U.S. Government to evaluate the reasonableness of U.S.-content 
calculations.
    (5) Report and wait. If you have not been contacted by BXA 
concerning your report within thirty days after filing the report with 
BXA, you may rely upon the calculations in your report and the de 
minimis exclusions for software and technology for so long as you are 
not contacted by BXA. BXA may contact you concerning your report to 
inquire of you further or to indicate that BXA does not accept the 
assumptions or rationale for your calculations. If you receive such a 
contact or communication from BXA, you may not rely upon the de minimis 
exclusions for software and technology in Sec. 734.4 of this part until 
BXA has indicated whether or not you may do so in the future. You must 
include in your report the name, title, address, telephone number, and 
facsimile number of the person BXA may contact concerning your report.

Sec. 736.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. A person may undertake transactions subject to the 
EAR without a license or other authorization, unless the regulations 
affirmatively state such a requirement. As such, if an export, reexport, 
or activity is subject to the EAR, the general prohibitions contained in 
this part and the License Exceptions specified in part 740 of the EAR 
must be reviewed to determine if a license is necessary. In the case of 
all exports from the United States, you must document your export as 
described in part 762 of the EAR regarding recordkeeping and clear your 
export through the U.S. Customs Service as described in part 758 of the 
EAR regarding export clearance requirements. Also note that for short 
supply controls all prohibitions and License Exceptions are in part 754 
of the EAR.
    (a) In this part we tell you:

[[Page 164]]

    (1) The facts that make your proposed export, reexport, or conduct 
subject to these general prohibitions, and
    (2) The ten general prohibitions.
    (b) Your obligations under the ten general prohibitions and under 
the EAR depend in large part upon the five types of information 
described in Sec. 736.2(a) of this part and upon the general 
prohibitions described in Sec. 736.2(b) of this part. The ten general 
prohibitions contain cross-references to other parts of the EAR that 
further define the breadth of the general prohibitions. For that reason, 
this part is not freestanding. In part 732, we provide certain steps you 
may follow in proper order to help you understand the general 
prohibitions and their relationship to other parts of the EAR.
    (c) If you violate any of these ten general prohibitions, or engage 
in other conduct contrary to the Export Administration Act, the EAR, or 
any order, license, License Exception, or authorization issued 
thereunder, as described in part 764 of the EAR regarding enforcement, 
you will be subject to the sanctions described in that part.


<R05>
Sec. 736.2  General prohibitions and determination of applicability.

    (a) Information or facts that determine the applicability of the 
general prohibitions. The following five types of facts determine your 
obligations under the ten general prohibitions and the EAR generally:
    (1) Classification of the item. The classification of the item on 
the Commerce Control List (see part 774 of the EAR);
    (2) Destination. The country of ultimate destination for an export 
or reexport (see parts 738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country 
Chart and the Commerce Control List);
    (3) End-user. The ultimate end-user (see General Prohibition Four 
(paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and parts 744 and 764 of the EAR for 
a reference to the list of persons you may not deal with);
    (4) End-use. The ultimate end-use (see General Prohibition Five 
(paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 of the EAR for general 
end-use restrictions); and
    (5) Conduct. Conduct such as contracting, financing, and freight 
forwarding in support of a proliferation project as described in part 
744 of the EAR.
    (b) General prohibitions. The following ten general prohibitions 
describe certain exports, reexports, and other conduct, subject to the 
scope of the EAR, in which you may not engage unless you either have a 
license from the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) or qualify under 
part 740 of the EAR for a License Exception from each applicable general 
prohibition in this paragraph. The License Exceptions at part 740 of the 
EAR apply only to General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the 
Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three 
(Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports); however, selected License 
Exceptions are specifically referenced and authorized in part 746 of the 
EAR concerning embargo destinations and in Sec. 744.2(c) of the EAR 
regarding nuclear end-uses.
    (1) General Prohibition One--Export and reexport of controlled items 
to listed countries (Exports and Reexports). You may not, without a 
license or License Exception, export any item subject to the EAR to 
another country or reexport any item of U.S.-origin if each of the 
following is true:
    (i) The item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable 
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), and
    (ii) Export to the country of destination requires a license for the 
control reason as indicated on the Country Chart at part 738 of the EAR. 
(The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct 
classification of your item and the ultimate destination as that 
combination is reflected on the Country Chart.) <SUP>1</SUP> Note that 
each License Exception described at part 740 of the EAR supersedes 
General Prohibition One if all terms and conditions of a given License 
Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\ See part 738 of the EAR for selected controls that are not 
specified on the Country Chart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) General Prohibition Two--Reexport and export from abroad of 
foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of 
controlled U.S. content (Parts and Components Reexports). (i)

[[Page 165]]

You may not, without a license or License Exception, export, reexport or 
export from abroad any foreign-made commodity, software, or technology 
incorporating U.S.-origin commodities, software, or technology 
respectively that is controlled to the country of ultimate destination 
if the foreign-made item meets all three of the following conditions:
    (A) It incorporates more than the de minimis amount of controlled 
U.S. content, as defined in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope 
of the EAR;
    (B) It is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable ECCN; 
and
    (C) Its export to the country of destination requires a license for 
that control reason as indicated on the Country Chart. (The scope of 
this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your 
foreign-made item and the ultimate destination, as that combination is 
reflected on the Country Chart.)
    (ii) Each License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR 
supersedes General Prohibition Two if all terms and conditions of a 
given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
    (3) General Prohibition Three--Reexport and export from abroad of 
the foreign-produced direct product of U.S. technology and software 
(Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports). (i) Country scope of 
prohibition. You may not export, reexport, or export from abroad items 
subject to the scope of this General Prohibition Three to Cuba, North 
Korea, Libya, or a destination in Country Group D:1 (See Supplement No. 
1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (ii) Product scope of foreign-made items subject to prohibition. 
This General Prohibition 3 applies if an item meets either the 
Conditions defining the direct product of technology or the Conditions 
defining the direct product of a plant in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of 
this section:
    (A) Conditions defining direct product of technology. Foreign-made 
items are subject to this General Prohibition 3 if they meet both of the 
following conditions:
    (1) They are the direct product of technology or software that 
requires a written assurance as a supporting document for a license or 
as a precondition for the use of License Exception TSR in Sec. 740.6 of 
the EAR, and
    (2) They are subject to national security controls as designated on 
the applicable ECCN of the Commerce Control List at part 774 of the EAR.
    (B) Conditions defining direct product of a plant. Foreign-made 
items are also subject to this General Prohibition 3 if they are the 
direct product of a complete plant or any major component of a plant if 
both of the following conditions are met:
    (1) Such plant or component is the direct product of technology that 
requires a written assurance as a supporting document for a license or 
as a precondition for the use of License Exception TSR in Sec. 740.6 of 
the EAR, and
    (2) Such foreign-made direct products of the plant or component are 
subject to national security controls as designated on the applicable 
ECCN of the Commerce Control List at part 774 of the EAR.
    (iii) License Exceptions. Each License Exception described at part 
740 of the EAR supersedes this General Prohibition Three if all terms 
and conditions of a given exception are met by the exporter or 
reexporter.
    (4) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders)--Engaging in actions 
prohibited by a denial order. (i) You may not take any action that is 
prohibited by a denial order issued under part 766 of the EAR, 
Administrative Enforcement Proceedings. These orders prohibit many 
actions in addition to direct exports by the person denied export 
privileges, including some transfers within a single country either in 
the United States or abroad by other persons. You are responsible for 
ensuring that any of your transactions in which a person who is denied 
export privileges is involved do not violate the terms of the order. The 
names of persons denied export privileges are published in the Federal 
Register and are also included on the Denied Persons List, which is 
referenced in Supplement No. 2 to part 764 of the EAR, Enforcement. The 
terms of the standard denial order are set forth in Supplement No. 1 to 
part 764. You should note that some denial orders differ from the 
standard denial order. BXA may, on an exceptional basis, authorize 
activity otherwise prohibited

[[Page 166]]

by a denial order. See Sec. 764.3(a)(3) of the EAR.
    (ii) There are no License Exceptions described in part 740 of the 
EAR that authorize conduct prohibited by this General Prohibition Four.
    (5) General Prohibition Five--Export or reexport to prohibited end-
uses or end-users (End-Use End-User). You may not, without a license, 
knowingly export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to an end-user 
of end-use that is prohibited by part 744 of the EAR.
    (6) General Prohibition Six--Export or reexport to embargoed 
destinations (Embargo). (i) You may not, without a license or License 
Exception authorized under part 746, export or reexport any item subject 
to the EAR to a country that is embargoed by the United States or 
otherwise made subject to controls as both are described at part 746 of 
the EAR.
    (ii) License Exceptions to General Prohibition Six are described in 
part 746 of the EAR, on Embargoes and Other Special Controls. Unless a 
License Exception or other authorization is authorized in part 746 of 
the EAR, the License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR are not 
available to overcome this general prohibition.
    (7) General Prohibition Seven--Support of Certain Activities by U.S. 
persons--(i) Support of Proliferation Activities (U.S. Person 
Proliferation Activity). If you are a U.S. Person as that term is 
defined in Sec. 744.6(c) of the EAR, you may not engage in any 
activities prohibited by Sec. 744.6 (a) or (b) of the EAR which 
prohibits the performance, without a license from BXA, of certain 
financing, contracting, service, support, transportation, freight 
forwarding, or employment that you know will assist in certain 
proliferation activities described further in part 744 of the EAR. There 
are no License Exceptions to this General Prohibition Seven in part 740 
of the EAR unless specifically authorized in that part.
    (ii) You may not, without a license from BXA, provide certain 
technical assistance to foreign persons with respect to encryption 
items, as described in Sec. 744.9 of the EAR.
    (8) General Prohibition Eight--In transit shipments and items to be 
unladen from vessels or aircraft (Intransit).
    (i) Unlading and shipping in transit. You may not export or reexport 
an item through or transit through a country listed in paragraph 
(b)(8)(ii) of this section unless a License Exception or license 
authorizes such an export or reexport directly to such a country of 
transit.
    (ii) Country scope. This General Prohibition Eight applies to 
Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cuba, 
Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Mongolia, North Korea, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, 
Uzbekistan, Vietnam.
    (9) General Prohibition Nine--Violation of any order, terms, and 
conditions (Orders, Terms, and Conditions). You may not violate terms or 
conditions of a license or of a License Exception issued under or made a 
part of the EAR, and you may not violate any order issued under or made 
a part of the EAR. There are no License Exceptions to this General 
Prohibition Nine in part 740 of the EAR. Supplements Nos. 1 and 2 to 
this part provide for certain General Orders and Administrative Orders.
    (10) General Prohibition Ten--Proceeding with transactions with 
knowledge that a violation has occurred or is about to occur (Knowledge 
Violation to Occur). You may not sell, transfer, export, reexport, 
finance, order, buy, remove, conceal, store, use, loan, dispose of, 
transfer, transport, forward, or otherwise service, in whole or in part, 
any item subject to the EAR and exported or to be exported with 
knowledge that a violation of the Export Administration Regulations, the 
Export Administration Act or any order, license, License Exception, or 
other authorization issued thereunder has occurred, is about to occur, 
or is intended to occur in connection with the item. Nor may you rely 
upon any license or License Exception after notice to you of the 
suspension or revocation of that license or exception. There are no 
License Exceptions to this General Prohibition Ten in part 740 of the 
EAR.

control matters.
    (1) Exclusion of persons guilty of unethical conduct or not 
possessing required integrity and ethical standards.
    (i) Who may be excluded. Any person, whether acting on his own 
behalf or on behalf of another, who shall be found guilty of engaging in 
any unethical activity or who shall be demonstrated not to possess the 
required integrity and ethical standards, may be excluded from (denied) 
export privileges on his own behalf, or may be excluded from practice 
before BXA on behalf of another, in connection with any export control 
matter, or both, as provided in part 764 of the EAR.
    (ii) Grounds for exclusion. Among the grounds for exclusion are the

reasonable value of the services performed, whether or not the license 
is issued and regardless of the amount thereof, are fairly compensated; 
and
    (E) Knowingly violating or participating in the violation of, or an 
attempt to violate, any regulation with respect to the export of

<R05>
Sec. 738.1  Introduction.

    (a) Commerce Control List scope. (1) In this part, references to the 
EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of 
Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) 
within the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which includes items 
(i.e., commodities, software, and technology) subject to the export 
licensing authority of BXA. The CCL does not include those items 
exclusively controlled for export or reexport by another department or 
agency of the U.S. Government. In instances where agencies other than 
the Department of Commerce administer controls over related items, 
entries in the CCL contain a reference to these controls.
    (2) The CCL is contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR. 
Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR contains the General Technology 
and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.
    (b) Commerce Country Chart scope. BXA also maintains the Commerce 
Country Chart. The Commerce Country Chart, located in Supplement No. 1 
to part 738, contains licensing requirements based on destination and 
Reason for Control. In combination with the CCL, the Commerce Country 
Chart allows you to determine whether a license is required for items on 
the CCL to any country in the world.


<R05>
Sec. 738.2  Commerce Control List (CCL) structure.

    (a) Categories. The CCL is divided into 10 categories, numbered as 
follows:

0--Nuclear Materials, Facilities and Equipment and Miscellaneous
1--Materials, Chemicals, ``Microorganisms,'' and Toxins
2--Materials Processing
3--Electronics
4--Computers
5--Telecommunications and Information Security
6--Lasers and Sensors
7--Navigation and Avionics
8--Marine
9--Propulsion Systems, Space Vehicles and Related Equipment

    (b) Groups. Within each category, items are arranged by group. Each 
category contains the same five groups. Each Group is identified by the 
letters A through E, as follows:

A--Equipment, Assemblies and Components
B--Test, Inspection and Production Equipment
C--Materials
D--Software
E--Technology

    (c) Order of review. In order to classify your item against the CCL, 
you should begin with a review of the general characteristics of your 
item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category on the 
CCL. Once the appropriate category is identified, you should match the 
particular characteristics and functions of your item to a specific 
ECCN. If the ECCN contains a list under the ``Items'' heading, you 
should review the list to determine within which subparagraph(s) your 
items are identified.
    (d) Entries. (1) Composition of an entry. Within each group, 
individual items are identified by an Export Control Classification 
Number (ECCN). Each number consists of a set of digits and a letter. The 
first digit identifies the general category within which the entry falls 
(e.g., 3A001). The letter immediately following this first digit 
identifies under which of the five groups the item is listed (e.g., 3 
A001). The second digit differentiates individual entries by identifying 
the type of controls associated with the items contained in the entry 
(e.g., 3A001). Listed below are the Reasons for Control associated with 
this second digit.

0: National Security reasons (including Dual Use and International 
          Munitions List) and Items on the NSG Dual Use Annex and 
          Trigger List
1: Missile Technology reasons
2: Nuclear Nonproliferation reasons
3: Chemical & Biological Weapons reasons
9: Anti-terrorism, Crime Control, Regional Stability, Short Supply, UN 
          Sanctions, etc.


[[Page 169]]


    (i) Since Reasons for Control are not mutually exclusive, numbers 
are assigned in order of precedence. As an example, if an item is 
controlled for both National Security and Missile Technology reasons, 
the entry's third digit will be a ``0''. If the item is controlled only 
for Missile Technology the third digit will be ``1''.
    (ii) The numbers in either the second or third digit (e.g., 3A001) 
serve to differentiate between multilateral and unilateral entries. An 
entry with the number ``9'' as the second digit, identifies the entire 
entry as controlled for a unilateral concern (e.g., 2B991 for anti-
terrorism reasons). If the number ``9'' appears as the third digit, the 
item is controlled for unilateral purposes based on a proliferation 
concern (e.g., 2A292 is controlled for unilateral purposes based on 
nuclear nonproliferation concerns).
    (iii) The last digit within each entry (e.g., 3A001) is used for the 
sequential numbering of ECCNs to differentiate between entries on the 
CCL.
    (2) Reading an ECCN. A brief description is provided next to each 
ECCN. Following this description is the actual entry containing 
``License Requirements,'' ``License Exceptions,'' and ``List of Items 
Controlled'' sections. A brief description of each section and its use 
follows:
    (i) License Requirements. This section contains a separate line 
identifying all possible Reasons for Control in order of precedence, and 
two columns entitled ``Control(s)'' and ``Country Chart''.
    (A) The ``Controls'' header identifies all applicable Reasons for 
Control, in order of restrictiveness, and to what extent each applies 
(e.g., to the entire entry or only to certain subparagraphs). Those 
requiring licenses for a larger number of countries and/or items are 
listed first. As you read down the list the number of countries and/or 
items requiring a license declines. Since Reasons for Control are not 
mutually exclusive, items controlled within a particular ECCN may be 
controlled for more than one reason. The following is a list of all 
possible Reasons for Control:

AT  Anti-Terrorism
CB  Chemical & Biological Weapons
CC  Crime Control
EI  Encryption Items
MT  Missile Technology
NS  National Security
NP  Nuclear Nonproliferation
RS  Regional Stability
SS  Short Supply
XP  Computers
SI  Significant Items

    (B) The ``Country Chart'' header identifies, for each applicable 
Reason for Control, a column name and number (e.g., CB Column 1). These 
column identifiers are used to direct you from the CCL to the 
appropriate column identifying the countries requiring a license. 
Consult part 742 of the EAR for an indepth discussion of the licensing 
requirements and policies applicable to each Country Chart column.
    (ii) License Exceptions. This section provides a brief eligibility 
statement for each ECCN-driven License Exception that may be applicable 
to your transaction, and should be consulted only AFTER you have 
determined a license is required based on an analysis of the entry and 
the Country Chart. The brief eligibility statement in this section is 
provided to assist you in deciding which ECCN-driven License Exception 
related to your particular item and destination you should explore prior 
to submitting an application. The term ``Yes'' (followed in some 
instances by the scope of Yes) appears next to each available ECCN-
driven License Exception. The term ``N/A'' will be noted for License 
Exceptions that are not available within a particular entry. If one or 
more License Exceptions appear to apply to your transaction, you must 
consult part 740 of the EAR to review the conditions and restrictions 
applicable to each available License Exception. The list of License 
Exceptions contained within each ECCN is not an all-exclusive list. 
Other License Exceptions, not based on particular ECCNs, may be 
available. Consult part 740 of the EAR to determine eligibility for non-
ECCN-driven License Exceptions.
    (iii) List of Items Controlled--(A) Units. The unit of measure 
applicable to each entry is identified in the ``Units'' header. Most 
measurements used in the CCL are expressed in metric units with an inch-
pound conversion where appropriate. Note that in some ECCNs the inch-
pound unit will be listed first. In

[[Page 170]]

instances where other units are in general usage or specified by law, 
these will be used instead of metric. Generally, when there is a 
difference between the metric and inch-pound figures, the metric 
standard will be used for classification and licensing purposes.
    (B) Related definitions. This header identifies, where appropriate, 
definitions or parameters that apply to all items controlled by the 
entry. The information provided in this section is unique to the entry, 
and hence not listed in the definitions contained in part 772 of the 
EAR.
    (C) Related controls. If another U.S. government agency or 
department has export licensing authority over items related to those 
controlled by an entry, a statement is included identifying the agency 
or department along with the applicable regulatory cite. An additional 
cross-reference may be included in instances where the scope of controls 
differs between a CCL entry and its corresponding entry on list 
maintained by the European Union. This information is provided to assist 
readers who use both lists.
    (D) Items. This header contains a positive list of all items 
controlled by a particular entry and must be reviewed to determine 
whether your item is controlled by that entry. In some entries, the list 
is contained within the entry heading. In these entries a note is 
included to direct you to the entry heading.
[61 FR 112756, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68579, Dec. 30, 1996; 
62 FR 25456, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 738.3  Commerce Country Chart structure.

    (a) Scope. The Commerce Country Chart (Country Chart) allows you to 
determine, based on the Reason(s) for Control associated with your item, 
if you need a license to export or reexport your item to a particular 
destination. There are only two instances where the chart cannot be used 
for this purpose:
    (1) Items controlled for short supply reasons. Due to the unique 
nature of these controls, entries controlled for Short Supply reasons 
will send you directly to part 754 of the EAR. Part 754 of the EAR is 
self-contained and includes information on licensing requirements, 
licensing policies, and all available License Exceptions, for items 
controlled for Short Supply reasons.
    (2) Unique entries. The following are unique entries where you do 
not need to consult the Country Chart to determine whether a license is 
required.
    (A) ECCNs 0A983 and 5A980. A license is required for all 
destinations of items controlled under these entries. No License 
Exceptions apply. If your item is controlled by 0A983 or 5A980 you 
should proceed directly to part 748 of the EAR for license application 
instructions and Sec. 742.11 or Sec. 742.13 of the EAR for information 
on the licensing policy relevant to these types of applications.
    (B) ECCNs 0A986, 0A988, 1A988, 2A994, 2D994, 2E994 and 2B985. A 
license is required for items controlled under these entries only to the 
specific countries identified within each entry.
    (b) Countries. The first column of the Country Chart lists all 
countries in alphabetical order. There are a number of destinations that 
are not listed in the Country Chart contained in Supplement No. 1 to 
part 738. If your destination is not listed on the Country Chart and 
such destination is a territory, possession, or department of a country 
included on the Country Chart, the EAR accords your destination the same 
licensing treatment as the country of which it is a territory, 
possession, or department. For example, if your destination is the 
Cayman Islands, a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, consult the 
United Kingdom on the Country Chart for licensing requirements.
    (c) Columns. Stretching out to the right are horizontal headers 
identifying the various Reasons for Control. Under each Reason for 
Control header are diagonal column identifiers capping individual 
columns. Each column identifier consists of the two letter Reason for 
Control and a column number. (e.g., CB Column 1). The column identifiers 
correspond to those listed in the ``Country Chart'' header within the 
``License Requirements'' section of each ECCN.
    (d) Cells. The symbol ``X'' is used to denote licensing requirements 
on the Country Chart. If an ``X'' appears in a

[[Page 171]]

particular cell, transactions subject to that particular Reason for 
Control/Destination combination require a license. There is a direct 
correlation between the number of ``X''s applicable to your transaction 
and the number of licensing reviews your application will undergo.


<R05>
Sec. 738.4  Determining whether a license is required.

    (a) Using the CCL and the Country Chart--(1) Overview. Once you have 
determined that your item is controlled by a specific ECCN, you must use 
information contained in the ``License Requirements'' section of that 
ECCN in combination with the Country Chart to decide whether a license 
is required.
    (2) License decision making process. The following decision making 
process must be followed in order to determine whether a license is 
required to export or reexport a particular item to a specific 
destination:
    (i) Examine the appropriate ECCN in the CCL. Is the item you intend 
to export or reexport controlled for a single Reason for Control?
    (A) If yes, identify the single Reason for Control and the relevant 
Country Chart column identifier (e.g., CB Column 1).
    (B) If no, identify the Country Chart column identifier for each 
applicable Reason for Control (e.g., NS Column 1, NP Column 1, etc.).
    (ii) Review the Country Chart. With each of the applicable Country 
Chart Column identifiers noted, turn to the Country Chart (Supplement 
No. 1 to part 738). Locate the correct Country Chart column identifier 
on the diagonal headings, and determine whether an ``X'' is marked in 
the cell next to the country in question for each Country Chart column 
identified in the applicable ECCN. If your item is subject to more than 
one reason for control, repeat this step using each unique Country Chart 
column identifier.
    (A) If yes, a license application must be submitted based on the 
particular reason for control and destination, unless a License 
Exception applies. If ``Yes'' is noted next to any of the listed License 
Exceptions, you should consult part 740 of the EAR to determine whether 
you can use any of the available ECCN-drvien License Exceptions to 
effect your shipment, rather than applying for a license. Each 
affirmative license requirement must be overcome by a License Exception. 
If you are unable to qualify for a License Exception based on each 
license requirement noted on the Country Chart, you must apply for a 
license. Note that other License Exceptions, not related to the CCL, may 
also apply to your transaction (See part 740 of the EAR).
    (B) If no, a license is not required based on the particular reason 
for control and destination. Provided General Prohibitions Four through 
Ten do not apply to your proposed transaction, you may effect your 
shipment using the symbol ``NLR''. Proceed to parts 758 and 762 of the 
EAR for information on export clearance procedures and recordkeeping 
requirements. Note that although you may stop after determining a 
license is required based on the first Reason for Control, it is best to 
work through each applicable Reason for Control. A full analysis of 
every possible licensing requirement based on each applicable Reason for 
Control is required to determine the most advantageous License Exception 
available for your particular transaction and, if a license is required, 
ascertain the scope of review conducted by BXA on your license 
application.
    (b) Sample analysis using the CCL and Country Chart--(1) Scope. The 
following sample entry and related analysis is provided to illustrate 
the type of thought process you must complete in order to determine 
whether a license is required to export or reexport a particular item to 
a specific destination using the CCL in combination with the Country 
Chart.
    (2) Sample CCL entry.

2A000:  Entry heading.

List of Items Controlled

Unit: Number
Related Definition: N/A
Related Controls: N/A
Items:

    a. Having x.
    b. Having z.

    (3) Sample analysis. After consulting the CCL, I determine my item, 
valued at $10,000, is classified under ECCN 2A000.a. I read that the 
entire entry is controlled for national security, and anti-terrorism 
reasons. Since my item is classified under paragraph .a, and not .b, I 
understand that though nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to a 
portion the entry, they do not apply to my item. I note that the 
appropriate Country Chart column identifiers are NS Column 2 and AT 
Column 1. Turning to the Country Chart, I locate my specific 
destination, India, and see that an ``X'' appears in the NS Column 2 
cell for India, but not in the AT Column 1 cell. I understand that a 
license is required, unless my transaction qualifies for a License 
Exception or Special Comprehensive License. From the License Exception 
LVS value listed in the entry, I know immediately that my proposed 
transaction exceeds the value limitation associated with LVS. Noting 
that License Exception GBS is ``Yes'' for this entry, I turn to part 740 
of the EAR to review the provisions related to use of GBS.

Sec. 740.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Scope. A ``License Exception'' is an authorization contained in 
this part that allows you to export or reexport under stated conditions, 
items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that would 
otherwise require a license under General Prohibition One, Two, or 
Three, as indicated under one or more of the Export Control 
Classification Numbers (ECCNs) in the Commerce Control List (CCL) in 
Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is 
subject to General Prohibitions Six for embargoed destinations, refer to 
part 746 of the EAR to determine the availability of any License 
Exceptions. Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. 
License Exceptions for items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short 
Supply reasons are found in part 754 of the EAR. If your export or 
reexport is subject to General Prohibition Five, consult part 744 of the 
EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibitions Four, 
Seven, Eight, Nine, or Ten, then no License Exceptions apply.
    (b) Certification. By using any of the License Exceptions you are 
certifying that the terms, provisions, and conditions for the use of the 
License Exception described in the EAR have been met. Please refer to 
part 758 of the EAR for clearance of shipments and documenting the use 
of License Exceptions.
    (c) License Exception symbols. Each License Exception bears a three 
letter symbol that will be used for export clearance purposes (see 
paragraph (d) of this section).
    (d) Shipper's Export Declaration--(1) Clearing exports under License 
Exceptions. You must enter on any required Shipper's Export Declaration 
(SED) the letter code (e.g., LVS, TMP) of the License Exception(s) under 
which you are exporting. In the case of License Exceptions LVS, GBS, and 
CIV, the ECCN of the item being exported must also be entered. Please 
refer to Sec. 758.3 of the EAR for the use of SEDs.
    (2) Clearing exports when no license is required (NLR). Certain 
items are listed on the CCL but do not require a license to certain 
destinations under General Prohibitions One, (Exports and Reexports in 
the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), or Three 
(Foreign Produced Direct Product Reexports) (Sec. 736.2 (b)(1), (b)(2), 
or (b)(3) of the EAR). (You will have determined this by consulting the 
Country Chart and finding no ``X'' in the box(es) at the intersection(s) 
of your country of destination and the column headings assigned to your 
item by the CCL.) If General Prohibitions Four through Ten (Sec. 736.2 
(b)(4) through (b)(10) of the EAR) also do not apply, you must clear 
exports of such items by entering the symbol ``NLR'' in the

[[Page 180]]

appropriate place on the Shippers Export Declaration. The term ``NLR'' 
represents exports of listed items when no license is required. Such 
exports do not require that you qualify for a License Exception.
    (e) Destination Control Statement. You may be required to enter an 
appropriate Destination Control Statement on commercial documents in 
accordance with Destination Control Statement requirements of Sec. 758.5 
and Sec. 758.6 of the EAR.
    (f) Recordkeeping. Records of transactions involving exports under 
any of the License Exceptions must be maintained in accordance with the 
recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.

<R05>
Sec. 740.2  Restrictions on all License Exceptions.

    (a) You may not use any License Exception if any one or more of the 
following apply:
    (1) Your authorization to use a License Exception has been suspended 
or revoked, or your intended export does not qualify for a License 
Exception.
    (2) The export or reexport is subject to one of the ten General 
Prohibitions, is not eligible for a License Exception, and has not been 
authorized by BXA.
    (3) The item is for surreptitious interception of wire or oral 
communications, controlled under ECCN 5A980, unless you are a U.S. 
Government agency (see Sec. 740.11(b)(2)(ii) of this part, Governments 
(GOV)).
    (4) The commodity you are shipping is a specially designed crime 
control and detection instrument or equipment described in Sec. 742.7 of 
the EAR and you are not shipping to Iceland, New Zealand, or countries 
listed in Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), unless 
the shipment is authorized under License Exception BAG, Sec. 740.14(e) 
of this part (shotguns and shotgun shells).
    (b) All License Exceptions are subject to revision, suspension, or 
revocation, in whole or in part, without notice. It may be necessary for 
BXA to stop a shipment or an export transaction at any stage of its 
progress, e.g., in order to prevent an unauthorized export or reexport. 
If a shipment is already en route, it may be further necessary to order 
the return or unloading of the shipment at any port of call.

FR 25457, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 740.3  Shipments of limited value (LVS).

    (a) Scope. License Exception LVS authorizes the export and reexport 
in a single shipment of eligible commodities as identified by ``LVS - 
$(value limit)'' on the CCL.
    (b) Eligible Destinations. This License Exception is available for 
all destinations in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), 
provided that the net value of the commodities included in the same 
order and controlled under the same ECCN entry on the CCL does not 
exceed the amount specified in the LVS paragraph for that entry.
    (c) Definitions--(1) Order. The term order as used in this 
Sec. 740.3 means a communication from a person in a foreign country, or 
that person's representative, expressing an intent to import commodities 
from the exporter. Although all of the details of the order need not be 
finally determined at the time of export, terms relating to the kinds 
and quantities of the commodities to be exported, as well as the selling 
prices of these commodities, must be finalized before the goods can be 
exported under License Exception LVS.
    (2) Net value: for LVS shipments. The actual selling price of the 
commodities that are included in the same order and are controlled under 
the same entry on the CCL, less shipping charges, or the current market 
price of the commodities to the same type of purchaser in the United 
States, whichever is the larger. In determining the actual selling price 
or the current market price of the commodity, the value of containers in 
which the commodity is being exported may be excluded. The value for LVS 
purposes is that of the controlled commodity that is being exported, and 
may not be reduced by subtracting the value of any content that would 
not, if shipped separately, be subject to licensing. Where the total 
value of the containers and their contents must be

[[Page 181]]

shown on Shipper's Export Declarations under one Schedule B Number, the 
exporter, in effecting a shipment under this License Exception, must 
indicate the ``net value'' of the contained commodity immediately below 
the description of the commodity.
    (3) Single shipment. All commodities moving at the same time from 
one exporter to one consignee or intermediate consignee on the same 
exporting carrier even though these commodities will be forwarded to one 
or more ultimate consignees. Commodities being transported in this 
manner will be treated as a single shipment even if the commodities 
represent more than one order or are in separate containers.
    (d) Additional eligibility requirements and restrictions--(1) 
Eligible orders. To be eligible for this License Exception, orders must 
meet the following criteria:
    (i) Orders must not exceed the applicable ``LVS'' dollar value 
limits. An order is eligible for shipment under LVS when the ``net 
value'' of the commodities controlled under the same entry on the CCL 
does not exceed the amount specified in the ``LVS'' paragraph for that 
entry. An LVS shipment may include more than one eligible order.
    (ii) Orders may not be split to meet the applicable LVS dollar 
limits. An order that exceeds the applicable LVS dollar value limit may 
not be misrepresented as two or more orders, or split among two or more 
shipments, to give the appearance of meeting the applicable LVS dollar 
value limit. However an order that meets all the LVS eligibility 
requirements, including the applicable LVS dollar value limit, may be 
split among two or more shipments.
    (iii) Orders must be legitimate. Exporters and consignees may not, 
either collectively or individually, structure or adjust orders to meet 
the applicable LVS dollar value limits.
    (2) Restriction on annual value of LVS orders. The total value of 
exports per calendar year to the same ultimate or intermediate consignee 
of commodities classified under a single ECCN may not exceed 12 times 
the LVS value limit for that ECCN; however, there is no restriction on 
the number of shipments provided that value is not exceeded. This annual 
value limit applies to shipments to the same ultimate consignee even 
though the shipments are made through more than one intermediate 
consignee. There is no restriction on the number of orders that may be 
included in a shipment, except that the annual value limit per ECCN must 
not be exceeded.
    (3) Orders where two or more LVS dollar value limits apply. An order 
may include commodities that are controlled under more than one entry on 
the CCL. In this case, the net value of the entire order may exceed the 
LVS dollar value for any single entry on the CCL. However, the net value 
of the commodities controlled under each ECCN entry shall not exceed the 
LVS dollar value limit specified for that entry.

    Example to paragraph (d)(3): An order includes commodities valued at 
$8,000. The order consists of commodities controlled under two ECCN 
entries, each having an LVS value limit of $5000. Commodities in the 
order controlled under one ECCN are valued at $3,500 while those 
controlled under the other ECCN are valued at $4,500. Since the net 
value of the commodities controlled under each entry falls within the 
LVS dollar value limits applicable to that entry, the order may be 
shipped under this License Exception.

    (4) Prohibition against evasion of license requirements. Any 
activity involving the use of this License Exception to evade license 
requirements is prohibited. Such devices include, but are not limited 
to, the splitting or structuring of orders to meet applicable LVS dollar 
value limits, as prohibited by paragraphs (d)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section.
    (e) Reexports. Commodities may be reexported under this License 
Exception, provided that they could be exported from the United States 
to the new country of destination under LVS.
[61 FR 64274, Dec. 4, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 740.4  Shipments to Country Group B countries (GBS).

    License Exception GBS authorizes exports and reexports to Country 
Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) of those commodities 
controlled to the ultimate destination for national security reasons and 
identified by ``GBS--Yes'' on the CCL. License Exception GBS may be used 
to export or

[[Page 182]]

reexport to eligible countries any commodity (but not software) eligible 
for License Exception CIV.
[62 FR 25457, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 740.5  Civil end-users (CIV).

    License Exception CIV authorizes exports and reexports controlled to 
the ultimate destination for national security reasons only and 
identified by ``CIV--Yes'' on the CCL, provided the items are destined 
to civil end-users for civil end-uses in Country Group D:1. (See 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) CIV may not be used for exports and 
reexports to military end-users or to known military uses. Such exports 
and reexports will continue to require a license. In addition to 
conventional military activities, military uses include any 
proliferation activities described and prohibited by part 744 of the 
EAR. A license is also required for transfer to military end-users or 
end-uses in eligible countries of items exported under CIV.
[61 FR 64275, Dec. 4, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 740.6  Technology and software under restriction (TSR).

    (a) Scope. License Exception TSR permits exports and reexports of 
technology and software controlled to the ultimate destination for 
national security reasons only and identified by ``TSR--Yes'' in entries 
on the CCL, provided the software or technology is destined to Country 
Group B. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) A written assurance is 
required from the consignee before exporting or reexporting under this 
License Exception.
    (1) Required assurance for export of technology. You may not export 
or reexport technology under this License Exception until you have 
received from the importer a written assurance that, without a BXA 
license or License Exception, the importer will not:
    (i) Reexport or release the technology to a national of a country in 
Country Groups D:1 or E:2; or
    (ii) Export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the direct product of the 
technology, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to 
national security controls as identified on the CCL (See General 
Prohibition Three, Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR); or
    (iii) If the direct product of the technology is a complete plant or 
any major component of a plant, export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the 
direct product of the plant or major component thereof, if such foreign 
produced direct product is subject to national security controls as 
identified on the CCL or is subject to State Department controls under 
the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121).
    (2) Required assurance for export of software. You may not export or 
reexport software under this License Exception until you have received 
from the importer a written assurance that, without a BXA license or 
License Exception, the importer will neither:
    (i) Reexport or release the software or the source code for the 
software to a national of a country in Country Groups D:1 or E:2; nor
    (ii) Export to Country Groups D:1 or E:2 the direct product of the 
software, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to national 
security controls as identified on the CCL. (See General Prohibition 
Three, Sec. 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR).
    (3) Form of written assurance. The required assurance may be made in 
the form of a letter or any other written communication from the 
importer, or the assurance may be incorporated into a licensing 
agreement that specifically includes the assurances. An assurance 
included in a licensing agreement is acceptable only if the agreement 
specifies that the assurance will be honored even after the expiration 
date of the licensing agreement. If such a written assurance is not 
received, License Exception TSR is not applicable and a license is 
required. The license application must include a statement explaining 
why assurances could not be obtained.
    (4) Other License Exceptions. The requirements in this License 
Exception do not apply to the export of technology or software under 
other License Exceptions, or to the export of technology or software 
included in an application for the foreign filing of a patent, provided 
the filing is in accordance with the regulations of the U.S. Patent 
Office.

Sec. 740.7  Computers (CTP).

    (a) Scope. License Exception CTP authorizes exports and reexports of 
digital computers and specially designed components therefor, exported 
or reexported separately or as part of a system for consumption in 
Computer Tier countries as provided by this section. (Related equipment 
controlled under 4A003.d, .f, and .g is authorized under this License 
Exception, only when exported or reexported with these computers as part

Sec. 740.8  Key management infrastructure.

    (a) Scope. License Exception KMI authorizes the export and reexport 
of certain encryption software and equipment.
    (b) Eligible software and equipment--(1) Recovery encryption items. 
Eligible items are recovery encryption software and equipment controlled 
under ECCNs 5D002 or 5A002 made eligible as a result of a one-time BXA 
review. You may initiate this review by submitting a classification 
request for your product in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section.
    (2) Non-recoverable encryption items. Eligible items are 56-bit DES 
or equivalent strength non-key recovery software and equipment 
controlled under ECCNs 5D002 or 5A002 made eligible as a result of a 
one-time BXA review. You may initiate this review by submitting a 
classification request for your product in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section.
    (c) Eligible destinations. License Exception KMI is available for 
all destinations, except Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, 
and Sudan.
    (d) Additional eligibility requirements--(1) Recovery encryption 
items. Classification requests for recovery encryption software and

    (D) Key recovery agents must comply with all applicable EAR Record 
keeping requirements, including record retention requirements; and
    (E) Key recovery agents must carry out the key holding obligations 
as approved by BXA, and any violation of any of the key holding 
obligations shall also constitute a violation of the EAR. Note that the 
key recovery agent's continuing compliance with key recovery agent 
requirements and key safeguard procedures is a condition for use of 
License Exception KMI. The exporter or reexporter, whether that person 
is the key recovery agent or not, must submit a new classification 
request to BXA if there are any changes (e.g., termination, replacement, 
additions) to the previously approved key recovery agent.
    (ii) Other recoverable encryption items. Requests for one-time 
review of recoverable products which allow government officials to 
obtain, under proper legal authority and without the cooperation or 
knowledge of the user, the plaintext of the encrypted data and 
communications will receive favorable consideration.
    (2) Non-recoverable encryption items. Upon approval of your 
classification request submitted in accordance with this paragraph 
(d)(2), you will become eligible to use License Exception KMI for six 
months. In order to continue using this License Exception, you must 
renew your eligibility by submitting the progress report described in 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. Classification requests for 56-bit 
DES or equivalent strength non-key recovery software and equipment must 
meet the following criteria:
    (i) Initial request must be submitted with a business plan that 
explains in detail the steps the applicant will take during the two-year 
transition period according to the criteria identified in Supplement No. 
7 to part 742 of the EAR;
    (ii) Renewal for use of this License Exception is contingent upon 
progress reports sent to BXA every six months and the applicant's 
adherence to benchmarks and milestones as set forth in the plan 
submitted for the initial classification request.
    (iii) Applicants may inform their authorized distributors that an 
approved classification and plan has been granted to them and the 
distributors' authority to so export or reexport will be for a time 
period ending on the same day the applicant's authority to export or 
reexport ends.
    (e) Reporting requirements. (1) You must provide semiannual reports 
to BXA identifying:
    (i) Ultimate consignee; specific end-user name and address, if 
available; and country of ultimate destination; and
    (ii) Quantities of each encryption item shipped.
    (2) You must submit reports no later than March 1 and no later than 
September 1 of any given year.

described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Commodities and software 
shipped as temporary exports or reexports under the provisions of this 
paragraph (a) must be returned to the country from which they were 
exported as soon as practicable but, except in circumstances described 
in this section, no later than one year from the date of export. This 
requirement does not apply if the commodities and software are consumed 
or destroyed in the normal course of authorized temporary use abroad or 
an extension or other disposition is permitted by the EAR or in writing 
by BXA.
    (2) Eligible commodities and software. The following commodities and 
software are eligible to be shipped under this paragraph (a):
    (i) Tools of trade. Usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of

of the exporter in a lawful enterprise or undertaking of the exporter. 
Eligible commodities and software may include, but are not limited to, 
such equipment as is necessary to commission or service goods, provided 
that the equipment is appropriate for this purpose and that all goods to 
be commissioned or serviced are of foreign origin, or if subject to the 
EAR, have been legally exported or reexported. The commodities and 
software must remain under the effective control of the exporter or the 
exporter's employee. The shipment of commodities and software may 
accompany the individual departing from the United States or may be 
shipped unaccompanied within one month before the individual's departure 
from the United States, or at any time after departure. No tools of 
trade may be taken to Country Group E:2 and Sudan, only the equipment 
necessary to commission or service goods may be taken as tools of trade 
to Country Group D:1. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.)
    (ii) Kits consisting of replacement parts. Kits consisting of 
replacement parts may be exported or reexported to all destinations, 
except Country Group E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), provided 
that:
    (A) The parts would qualify for shipment under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section if exported as one-for-one replacements;
    (B) The kits remain under effective control of the exporter or an 
employee of the exporter; and
    (C) All parts in the kit are returned, except that one-for-one 
replacements may be made in accordance with the requirements of License 
Exception RPL and the defective parts returned (see ``parts'', 
Sec. 740.9(a) of this part).
    (iii) Exhibition and demonstration in Country Group B. Commodities 
and software for exhibition or demonstration in Country Group B (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740) may be exported or reexported under this 
provision provided that the exporter maintains ownership of the 
commodities and software while they are abroad and provided that the 
exporter, an employee of the exporter, or the exporter's designated 
sales representative retains effective control over the commodities and 
software while they are abroad. The commodities and software may not be 
used for their intended purpose while abroad, except to the minimum 
extent required for effective demonstration. The commodities and 
software may not be exhibited or demonstrated at any one site more than 
120 days after installation and debugging, unless authorized by BXA. 
However, before or after an exhibition or demonstration, pending 
movement to another site, return to the United States or the foreign 
reexporter, or BXA approval for other disposition, the commodities and 
software may be placed in a bonded warehouse or a storage facility 
provided that the exporter retains effective control over their 
disposition. The export documentation for this type of transaction must 
show the U.S. exporter as ultimate consignee, in care of the person who 
will have control over the commodities and software abroad.
    (iv) Inspection and calibration. Commodities to be inspected, 
tested, calibrated or repaired abroad may be exported or reexported to 
all destinations under this section, except Country Group E:2, Sudan or 
Syria.
    (v) Containers. Containers for which another License Exception is 
not available and that are necessary for export of commodities. However, 
this ``containers'' provision does not authorize the export of the 
container's contents, which, if not exempt from licensing, must be 
separately authorized for export under either a License Exception or a 
license.
    (vi) Broadcast material. (A) Video tape containing program material 
recorded in the country of export to be publicly broadcast in another 
country.
    (B) Blank video tape (raw stock) for use in recording program 
material abroad.
    (vii) Assembly in Mexico. Commodities to be exported to Mexico under 
Customs entries that require return to the United States after 
processing, assembly, or incorporation into end products by companies, 
factories, or facilities participating in Mexico's in-bond 
industrialization program (Maquiladora), provided that all resulting 
end-products (or the commodities themselves) are returned to the United 
States.

[[Page 187]]

    (viii) News media. (A) Commodities necessary for news-gathering 
purposes (and software necessary to use such commodities) may accompany 
``accredited'' news media personnel (i.e., persons with credentials from 
a news gathering or reporting firm) to Country Groups D:1 or E:2, or 
Sudan (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) if the commodities:
    (1) Are retained under ``effective control'' of the exporting news 
gathering firm;
    (2) Remain in the physical possession of the news media personnel. 
The term physical possession for purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(2)(viii), news media, is defined as maintaining effective measures 
to prevent unauthorized access (e.g., securing equipment in locked 
facilities or hiring security guards to protect the equipment); and
    (3) Are removed with the news media personnel at the end of the 
trip.
    (B) When exporting under this paragraph (a)(2)(viii) from the United 
States, the exporter must send a copy of the packing list or similar 
identification of the exported commodities, to: U.S. Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, Office of Enforcement 
Support, Room H4069, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., 
Washington, DC 20230, or any of its field offices, specifying the 
destination and estimated dates of departure and return. The Office of 
Export Enforcement (OEE) may spot check returns to assure that the 
temporary exports and reexports provisions of this License Exception are 
being used properly.
    (C) Commodities or software necessary for news-gathering purposes 
that accompany news media personnel to all other destinations shall be 
exported or reexported under paragraph (a)(2)(i), tools of trade, of 
this section if owned by the news gathering firm, or if they are 
personal property of the individual news media personnel. Note that 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i), tools of trade and (a)(2)(viii), news media, of 
this section do not preclude independent ``accredited'' contract 
personnel, who are under control of news gathering firms while on 
assignment, from utilizing these provisions, provided that the news 
gathering firm designate an employee of the contract firm to be 
responsible for the equipment.)
    (3) Special restrictions--(i) Destinations. (A) No commodity or 
software may be exported to Country Group E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to 
part 740) except as permitted by paragraph (a)(2)(viii), news media, of 
this section;
    (B) No commodity or software may be exported to Country Group D:1 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) except:
    (1) Commodities and software exported under paragraph (a)(2)(viii), 
news media, of this section;
    (2) Commodities and software exported under paragraph (a)(2)(i), 
tools of trade, of this section; and
    (3) Commodities exported as kits of replacement parts, consistent 
with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (C) These destination restrictions apply to temporary exports to and 
for use on any vessel, aircraft or territory under ownership, control, 
lease, or charter by any country in Country Group D:1 or E:2, or any 
national thereof. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.)
    (ii) Ineligible commodities or software. Commodities or software 
that will be used outside of Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to 
part 740), Iceland, or New Zealand, either directly or indirectly in any 
sensitive nuclear activity as described in Sec. 744.2 of the EAR may not 
be exported or reexported to any destination under the temporary exports 
and reexports provisions of this License Exception.
    (iii) Use or disposition. No commodity or software may be exported 
or reexported under this paragraph (a) if:
    (A) An order to acquire the commodity or software has been received 
before shipment;
    (B) The exporter has prior knowledge that the commodity or software 
will stay abroad beyond the terms described in this paragraph (a); or
    (C) The commodity or software is for lease or rental abroad.
    (4) Return or disposal of commodities and software. All commodities 
and software exported or reexported under these provisions must, if not 
consumed or destroyed in the normal course of authorized temporary use 
abroad, be returned as soon as practicable but no later than one year 
after the date of

[[Page 188]]

export, to the United States or other country from which the commodities 
and software were so exported, or shall be disposed of or retained in 
one of the following ways:
    (i) Permanent export or reexport. If the exporter or the reexporter 
wishes to sell or otherwise dispose of the commodities or software 
abroad, except as permitted by this or other applicable License 
Exception, the exporter must request authorization by submitting a 
license application to BXA at the address listed in part 748 of the EAR. 
(See part 748 of the EAR for more information on license applications.) 
The request should comply with all applicable provisions of the EAR 
covering export directly from the United States to the proposed 
destination. The request must also be supported by any documents that 
would be required in support of an application for export license for 
shipment of the same commodities or software directly from the United 
States to the proposed destination. BXA will advise the exporter of its 
decision.
    (ii) Use of a license. An outstanding license may also be used to 
dispose of commodities or software covered by the provisions of this 
paragraph (a), provided that the outstanding license authorizes direct 
shipment of the same commodity or software to the same new ultimate 
consignee in the new country of destination.
    (iii) Authorization to retain abroad beyond one year. If the 
exporter wishes to retain a commodity or software abroad beyond the 12 
months authorized by paragraph (a) of this section, the exporter must 
request authorization by submitting Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose 
Application, 90 days prior to the expiration of the 12 month period. The 
request must be sent to BXA at the address listed in part 748 of the EAR 
and should include the name and address of the exporter, the date the 
commodities or software were exported, a brief product description, and 
the justification for the extension. If BXA approves the extension 
request, the exporter will receive authorization for a one-time 
extension not to exceed six months. BXA normally will not allow an 
extension for commodities or software that have been abroad more than 12 
months, nor will a second six month extension be authorized. Any request 
for retaining the commodities or software abroad for a period exceeding 
18 months must be made in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) Reexports. Commodities and software legally exported from the 
United States may be reexported to a new country(ies) of destination 
under this paragraph (a) provided its terms and conditions are met and 
the commodities and software are returned to the country from which the 
reexport occurred.
    (b) Exports of items temporarily in the United States: Scope. The 
provisions of this paragraph (b) describe the conditions for exporting 
foreign-origin items temporarily in the United States. The provisions 
include the export of items moving in transit through the United States, 
imported for display at a U.S. exhibition or trade fair, returned 
because unwanted, or returned because refused entry.

    Note 1 to paragraph (b) of this section:
    A commodity withdrawn from a bonded warehouse in the United States 
under a ``withdrawal for export'' customs entry is considered as 
``moving in transit''. It is not considered as ``moving in transit'' if 
it is withdrawn from a bonded warehouse under any other type of customs 
entry or if its transit has been broken for a processing operation, 
regardless of the type of customs entry.
    Note 2 to paragraph (b) of this section: Items shipped on board a 
vessel or aircraft and passing through the United States from one 
foreign country to another may be exported without a license provided 
that (a) while passing in transit through the United States, they have 
not been unladen from the vessel or aircraft on which they entered, and 
(b) they are not originally manifested to the United States.)

    (1) Items moving in transit through the United States. Subject to 
the following conditions, the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section authorize export of items moving in transit through the United 
States under a Transportation and Exportation (T.& E.) customs entry or 
an Immediate Exportation (I.E.) customs entry made at a U.S. Customs 
Office.
    (i) Items controlled for national security, nuclear proliferation, 
missile technology, or chemical and biological

[[Page 189]]

weapons reasons may not be exported to Country Group D:1, 2, 3, or 4 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), respectively, under this paragraph 
(b)(1).
    (ii) Items may not be exported to Country Group E:2 or Sudan under 
this section.
    (iii) The following may not be exported in transit from the United 
States under Sec. 740.8(b)(1):
    (A) Commodities shipped to the United States under an International 
Import Certificate, Form BXA-645P;
    (B) Chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350; or
    (C) Horses for export by sea (refer to short supply controls in part 
754 of the EAR).
    (iv) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) apply to all shipments from 
Canada moving in transit through the United States to any foreign 
destination, regardless of the nature of the commodities or software or 
their origin. For such shipments the customs office at the U.S. port of 
export will require a copy of Form B-13, Canadian Customs Entry, 
certified or stamped by Canadian customs authorities, except where the 
shipment is valued at less than $50.00. (In transit shipments 
originating in Canada that are exempt from U.S. licensing, or made under 
a U.S. license or other applicable U.S. License Exception do not require 
this form.) The commodity or software description, quantity, ultimate 
consignee, country of ultimate destination, and all other pertinent 
details of the shipment must be the same on a required Form B-13, as on 
Commerce Form 7513, or when Form 7513 is not required, must be the same 
as on Customs Form 7512. When there is a material difference, a 
corrected Form B-13 authorizing the shipment is required.
    (2) Items imported for display at U.S. exhibitions or trade fairs. 
Subject to the following conditions, the provisions of this paragraph 
(b)(2) authorize the export of items that were imported into the United 
States for display at an exhibition or trade fair and were either 
entered under bond or permitted temporary free import under bond 
providing for their export and are being exported in accordance with the 
terms of that bond.
    (i) Items may be exported to the country from which imported into 
the United States. However, items originally imported from Cuba or North 
Korea may not be exported unless the U.S. Government had licensed the 
import from that country.
    (ii) Items may be exported to any destination other than the country 
from which imported except:
    (A) Items imported into the United States under an International 
Import Certificate;
    (B) Exports to Country Group E:2 or Sudan (see Supplement No. 1 to 
part 740); or
    (C) Exports to Country Group D:1, 2, 3, or 4 (see Supplement No. 1 
to part 740) of items controlled for national security, missile 
technology, chemical and biological weapons reasons, or nuclear 
proliferation, respectively.
    (3) Return of unwanted shipments. A foreign-origin item may be 
returned to the country from which it was imported if its 
characteristics and capabilities have not been enhanced while in the 
United States. No foreign-origin items may be returned to Cuba, Libya, 
or North Korea.
    (4) Return of shipments refused entry. Shipments of items refused 
entry by the U.S. Customs Service, the Food and Drug Administration, or 
other U.S. Government agency may be returned to the country of origin, 
except to:
    (i) A destination in Cuba, Libya, or North Korea; or
    (ii) A destination from which the shipment has been refused entry 
because of the Foreign Assets Control Regulations of the Treasury 
Department, unless such return is licensed or otherwise authorized by 
the Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (31 CFR part 
500).
    (c) Exports of beta test software--(1) Scope. The provisions of 
paragraph (c) authorize exports and reexports to eligible countries of 
beta test software intended for distribution to the general public.
    (2) Eligible countries. The countries that are eligible to receive 
exports and reexports are all countries except those in Country Group 
E:2.
    (3) Exports of beta test software. All software that is controlled 
by the Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1

[[Page 190]]

to part 774 of the EAR), and under Commerce licensing jurisdiction, is 
eligible for export and reexport, subject to the restrictions of this 
paragraph, except encryption software controlled for EI reasons under 
ECCN 5D002. Certain encryption software may become eligible after a one-
time BXA review (refer to Sec. 742.15(b)(1) of the EAR).
    (4) Conditions for use. Any beta test software program may be 
exported or reexported to eligible countries if all of the conditions 
under this section are met:
    (i) The software producer intends to market the software to the 
general public after completion of the beta testing, as described in the 
General Software Note found in Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR;
    (ii) The software producer provides the software to the testing 
consignee free-of-charge or at a price that does not exceed the cost of 
reproduction and distribution; and
    (iii) The software is designed for installation by the end-user 
without further substantial support from the supplier.
    (5) Importer Statement. Prior to shipping any eligible software, the 
exporter or reexporter must obtain the following statement from the 
testing consignee, which may be included in a contract, non-disclosure 
agreement, or other document that identifies the importer, the software 
to be exported, the country of destination, and the testing consignee.

    We certify that this beta test software will only be used for beta 
testing purposes, and will not be rented, leased, sold, sublicensed, 
assigned, or otherwise transferred. Further, we certify that we will not 
transfer or export any product, process, or service that is the direct 
product of the beta test software.

    (6) Use limitations. Only testing consignees that provide the 
importer statement required by paragraph (c)(5) of this section may 
execute any software received.
    (7) Return or disposal of software. All beta test software exported 
must be destroyed abroad or returned to the exporter within 30 days of 
the end of the beta test period as defined by the software producer or, 
if the software producer does not define a test period, within 30 days 
of completion of the consignee's role in the test. Among other methods, 
this requirement may be satisfied by a software module that will destroy 
the software and all its copies at or before the end of the beta test 
period.

Sec. 740.10  Servicing and replacement of parts and equipment (RPL).

    This License Exception authorizes exports and reexports associated 
with one-for-one replacement of parts or servicing and replacement of 
equipment.
    (a) Parts--(1) Scope. The provisions of this paragraph (a) authorize 
the export and reexport of one-for-one replacement parts for previously 
exported equipment.
    (2) One-for-one replacement of parts. (i) The term replacement parts 
as used in this section means parts needed for the immediate repair of 
equipment, including replacement of defective or worn parts. (It 
includes subassemblies but does not include test instruments or 
operating supplies). (The term subassembly means a number of components 
assembled to perform a specific function or functions within a 
commodity. One example would be printed circuit boards with components 
mounted thereon. This definition does not include major subsystems such 
as those composed of a number of subassemblies.) Items that improve or 
change the basic design characteristics, e.g., as to accuracy, 
capability, performance or productivity, of the equipment upon which 
they are installed, are not deemed to be replacement parts. For kits 
consisting of replacement parts, consult Sec. 740.8(a)(2)(ii) of this 
part.
    (ii) Parts may be exported only to replace, on a one-for-one basis, 
parts contained in commodities that were: legally exported from the 
United States; legally reexported; or made in a foreign country 
incorporating authorized U.S.-origin parts. The conditions of the 
original U.S. authorization must not have been violated. Accordingly, 
the export of replacement parts may be made only by the party who 
originally exported or reexported the commodity to be repaired, or by a 
party that has

[[Page 191]]

confirmed the appropriate authority for the original transaction.
    (iii) The parts to be replaced must either be destroyed abroad or 
returned promptly to the person who supplied the replacement parts, or 
to a foreign firm that is under the effective control of that person.
    (3) Exclusions. (i) No replacement parts may be exported to repair a 
commodity exported under a license if that license included a condition 
that any subsequent replacement parts must be exported only under a 
license.
    (ii) No parts may be exported to be held abroad as spare parts or 
equipment for future use. Replacement parts may be exported to replace 
spare parts that were authorized to accompany the export of equipment, 
as those spare parts are utilized in the repair of the equipment. This 
will allow maintenance of the stock of spares at a consistent level as 
parts are used.
    (iii) No parts may be exported to any destination except Iceland, 
New Zealand, or the countries listed in Country Group A:1 (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740) if the item is to be incorporated into or 
used in nuclear weapons, nuclear explosive devices, nuclear testing 
related to activities described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR, the 
chemical processing of irradiated special nuclear or source material, 
the production of heavy water, the separation of isotopes of source and 
special nuclear materials, or the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel 
containing plutonium, as described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR.
    (iv) No replacement parts may be exported to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, 
Sudan, Syria, Libya, or North Korea (countries designated by the 
Secretary of State as supporting acts of international terrorism) if the 
commodity to be repaired is an ``aircraft'' (as defined in part 772 of 
the EAR) or national security controlled commodity.
    (v) The conditions described in this paragraph (a)(3) relating to 
replacement of parts do not apply to reexports to a foreign country of 
parts as replacements in foreign-origin products, if at the time the 
replacements are furnished, the foreign-origin product is eligible for 
export to such country under any of the License Exceptions in this part 
or the exceptions in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR.
    (4) Reexports. Parts exported from the United States may be 
reexported to a new country of destination, provided that the 
restrictions described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section are 
met. A party reexporting U.S.-origin one-for-one replacement parts shall 
ensure that the commodities being repaired were shipped to their present 
location in accordance with U.S. law and continue to be legally used, 
and that either before or promptly after reexport of the replacement 
parts, the replaced parts are either destroyed or returned to the United 
States, or to the foreign firm in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 
to part 740) that shipped the replacement parts.
    (b) Servicing and replacement--(1) Scope. The provisions of this 
paragraph (b) authorize the export and reexport of items that were 
returned to the United States for servicing and the replacement of 
defective or unacceptable U.S.-origin commodities and software.
    (2) Commodities and software sent to a United States or foreign 
party for servicing.
    (i) Definition. Servicing as used in this section means inspection, 
testing, calibration or repair, including overhaul and reconditioning. 
The servicing shall not have improved or changed the basic 
characteristics, e.g., as to accuracy, capability, performance, or 
productivity of the commodity or software as originally authorized for 
export or reexport.
    (ii) Return of serviced commodities and software. When the serviced 
commodity or software is returned, it may include any replacement or 
rebuilt parts necessary to its repair and may be accompanied by any 
spare part, tool, accessory, or other item that was sent with it for 
servicing.
    (iii) Commodities and software imported from Country Group D:1 
except the PRC. Commodities and software legally exported or reexported 
to a consignee in Country Group D:1 (except the People's Republic of 
China (PRC)) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740) that are sent to the 
United States or a foreign party for servicing may be returned to the 
country from which it was sent, provided that both of the following 
conditions are met:

[[Page 192]]

    (A) The exporter making the shipment is the same person or firm to 
whom the original license was issued; and
    (B) The end-use and the end-user of the serviced commodities or 
software and other particulars of the transaction, as set forth in the 
application and supporting documentation that formed the basis for 
issuance of the license have not changed.
    (iv) Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. No 
repaired commodity or software may be exported or reexported to Cuba, 
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria.
    (3) Replacements for defective or unacceptable U.S.-origin 
equipment. (i) Subject to the following conditions, commodities or 
software may be exported or reexported to replace defective or otherwise 
unusable (e.g., erroneously supplied) items.
    (A) The commodity or software to be replaced must have been 
previously exported or reexported in its present form under a license or 
authorization granted by BXA.
    (B) No commodity or software may be exported or reexported to 
replace equipment that is worn out from normal use, nor may any 
commodity or software be exported to be held in stock abroad as spare 
equipment for future use.
    (C) The replacement item may not improve the basic characteristic, 
e.g., as to accuracy, capability, performance, or productivity, of the 
equipment as originally approved for export or reexport under a license 
issued by BXA.
    (D) No shipment may be made to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, 
Sudan, or Syria, or to any other destination to replace defective or 
otherwise unusable equipment owned or controlled by, or leased or 
chartered to, a national of any of those countries.
    (ii) Special conditions applicable to exports to Country Group B and 
Country Group D:1. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) In addition to 
the general conditions in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the 
following conditions apply to exports or reexports of replacements for 
defective or unacceptable U.S.-origin commodities or software to a 
destination in Country Group B or Country Group D:1:
    (A) By making such an export or reexport, the exporter represents 
that all the requirements of this paragraph (b) have been met and 
undertakes to destroy or return the replaced parts as provided in 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (B) The defective or otherwise unusable equipment must be replaced 
free of charge, except for transportation and labor charges. If 
exporting to the countries listed in Country Group D:1 (except the PRC), 
the exporter shall replace the commodity or software within the warranty 
period or within 12 months of its shipment to the ultimate consignee in 
the country of destination, whichever is shorter.
    (C) The commodity or software to be replaced must either be 
destroyed abroad or returned to the United States, or to a foreign firm 
in Country Group B that is under the effective control of the U.S. 
exporter, or to the foreign firm that is providing the replacement part 
or equipment. The destruction or return must be effected before, or 
promptly after, the replacement item is exported from the United States.
    (D) A party reexporting replacements for defective or unacceptable 
U.S.-origin equipment must ensure that the commodities or software being 
replaced were shipped to their present location in accordance with U.S. 
law and continue to be legally used.

designed to ensure that special nuclear materials and other related 
nuclear facilities, equipment, and material are not diverted from 
peaceful purposes to non-peaceful purposes.
    (ii) Commodities or software consigned to the Euratom Safeguards 
Directorate in Luxembourg, Luxembourg for official international 
safeguards use. Euratom is an international organization of European 
countries with headquarters in Luxembourg. Euratom establishes and 
administers safeguards designed to ensure that special nuclear materials 
and other related nuclear facilities, equipment, and material are not 
diverted from peaceful purposes to non-peaceful purposes.
    (iii) Commodities consigned to IAEA or Euratom may be reexported to 
any country for IAEA or Euratom international safeguards use provided 
that IAEA or Euratom maintains control of or otherwise safeguards the

Sec. 740.12  Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT).

    (a) Gift parcels--(1) Scope. The provisions of paragraph (a) 
authorize exports and reexports of gift parcels by an individual (donor) 
addressed to an individual, or a religious, charitable or educational 
organization (donee) located in any destination for the use of the donee 
or the donee's immediate family (and not for resale). The gift parcel 
must be provided free of charge to the donee. However, payment by the 
donee of any handling charges or of any fees levied by the importing 
country (e.g., import duties, taxes, etc.) is not considered to be a 
cost to the donee for purposes of this definition of ``gift parcel.''

    Note to paragraph (a) of this section: A gift parcel, within the 
context of this paragraph (a), does not include multiple parcels 
exported in a single shipment for delivery to individuals residing in a 
foreign country. Such multiple gift parcels, if subject to the General 
Prohibitions described in Sec. 734.2(b) of the EAR, must be licensed by 
BXA. (See Supplement No. 2 to part 748 of the EAR for licensing of 
multiple gift parcels).

    (2) Commodity, value and other limitations--(i) Eligible 
commodities. The eligible commodities are as follows:
    (A) The commodity must not be controlled for chemical and biological 
weapons (CB), missile technology (MT), national security (NS), or 
nuclear proliferation (NP) (see Commerce Control List, part 774 of the 
EAR); and
    (B) The commodity must be of a type and in quantities normally given 
as gifts between individuals.
    (1) For Cuba, the only commodities that may be included in a gift 
parcel are the following items: food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, 
medical supplies and devices, hospital supplies and equipment, equipment 
for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary 
medicines and supplies, fishing equipment and supplies, soap-making 
equipment, and in addition receive-only radio equipment for reception of 
commercial/civil AM/FM and short

[[Page 195]]

wave publicly available frequency bands, and batteries for such 
equipment.
    (2) For all other destinations, eligible commodities include all 
items described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)(1) of this section as well as 
all other items normally sent as gifts. Gold bullion, gold taels, and 
gold bars are prohibited as are items intended for resale or reexport.

    Example to paragraph (a) of this section. A watch or piece of 
jewelry is normally sent as a gift. However, multiple watches, either in 
one package or in subsequent shipments, would not quality for such gift 
parcels because the quantity exceeds that normally given between 
individuals. Similarly, a sewing machine or bicycle, within the dollar 
limits of this License Exception, may be an appropriate gift. However, 
subsequent shipments of the same item to the same donee would not be a 
gift normally given between individuals.

    (3) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, clothing 
is appropriate, except that export of military wearing apparel to 
Country Group D:1 or E:2 under this License Exception is specifically 
prohibited, regardless of whether all distinctive U.S. military 
insignia, buttons, and other markings are removed.
    (ii) Import requirements. The commodities must be acceptable in type 
and quantity by the recipient country for import as gifts. Commodities 
exceeding the import limits may not be included in gift parcels.
    (iii) Frequency. Except for gift parcels of food to Cuba, not more 
than one gift parcel may be sent from the same donor to the same donee 
in any one calendar month. Parties seeking authorization to exceed this 
limit due to compelling humanitarian concerns (e.g., gifts of medicine 
to relatives) should submit a license application (BXA-748P) with 
complete justification.
    (iv) Value. The combined total domestic retail value of all 
commodities included in a gift parcel may not exceed $400, except for 
gift parcels to Cuba where the value of non-food items may not exceed 
$200. There is no dollar value limit on food contained in a gift parcel 
to Cuba.
    (3) How to export gift parcels. (i) A gift parcel must be sent 
directly to the donee by the individual donor, or for such donor by a 
commercial or other gift-forwarding service or organization. Each gift 
parcel must show, on the outside wrapper, the name and address of the 
donor, as well as the name and address of the donee, regardless of 
whether sent by the donor or by a forwarding service.
    (ii) Each parcel must have the notation ``GIFT--Export License Not 
Required'' written on the addressee side of the package and the symbol 
``GFT'' written on any required customs declaration.
    (b) Humanitarian donations--(1) Scope. The provisions of paragraph 
(b) authorize exports or reexports by groups or organizations of 
donations to meet basic human needs when those groups or organizations 
have experience in maintaining a verifiable system of distribution that 
ensures delivery to the intended beneficiaries.
    (2) Basic human needs. Basic human needs are defined as those 
requirements essential to individual well-being: health, food, clothing, 
shelter, and education. These needs are considered to extend beyond 
those of an emergency nature and those that meet direct needs for mere 
subsistence.
    (3) Eligible donors. Eligible donors are U.S. charitable 
organizations that have an established record of involvement in donative 
programs and experience in maintaining and verifying a system of 
distribution to ensure delivery of commodities and software to the 
intended beneficiaries. Eligible distribution arrangements may consist 
of any one or more of the following:
    (i) A permanent staff maintained in the recipient country to monitor 
the receipt and distribution of the donations to the intended 
beneficiaries;
    (ii) Periodic spot-checks in the recipient country by members of the 
exporter's staff; or
    (iii) An agreement to utilize the services of a charitable 
organization that has a monitoring system in place.
    (4) Donations. To qualify for export under the provisions of this 
paragraph (b), the items must be provided free of charge to the 
beneficiary. The payment by the beneficiary, however, of normal handling 
charges or fees levied by the importing country (e.g., import duties,

[[Page 196]]

taxes, etc.) is not considered to be a cost to the beneficiary for 
purposes of this paragraph (b).
    (5) Ineligible commodities and software. The following commodities 
and software are not eligible:
    (i) Commodities and software controlled for national security, 
chemical or biological weapons, and nuclear nonproliferation, missile 
technology or crime control reasons (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of 
the EAR);
    (ii) Exports for large-scale projects of the kind associated with 
comprehensive economic growth, such as dams and hydroelectric plants; or
    (iii) Exports to Cuba of medical items excluded by Sec. 746.2(a)(3) 
of the EAR.
    (6) Eligible items. Eligible commodities and software are those 
listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 740.
    (7) Additional recordkeeping requirements. In addition to the 
recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR, donors must keep 
records containing the following information:
    (i) The donor organization's identity and past experience as an 
exporter of goods to meet basic human needs;
    (ii) Past and current countries to which the donative programs have 
been and are being directed, with particular reference to donative 
programs in embargoed destinations;
    (iii) Types of projects and commodities involved in the donative 
programs;
    (iv) Specific class(es) of beneficiaries of particular donated goods 
intended to be exported under this License Exception; and
    (v) Information concerning the source of funding for the donative 
programs and the projected annual value of exports of humanitarian 
donations.

Sec. 740.13  Technology and software--unrestricted (TSU).

    This License Exception authorizes exports and reexports of operation 
technology and software; sales technology and software; software updates 
(bug fixes); and ``mass market'' software subject to the General 
Software Note.
    (a) Operation technology and software--(1) Scope. The provisions of 
paragraph (a) permit exports and reexports of operation technology and 
software. ``Operation technology'' is the minimum technology necessary 
for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking), and repair of 
those products that are lawfully exported or reexported under a license, 
a License Exception, or NLR. The ``minimum necessary'' operation 
technology does not include technology for development or production and 
includes use technology only to the extent required to ensure safe and 
efficient use of the product. Individual entries in the software and 
technology subcategories of the CCL may further restrict the export or 
reexport of operation technology.
    (2) Provisions and destinations--(i) Provisions. Operation software 
may be exported or reexported provided that both of the following 
conditions are met:
    (A) The operation software is the minimum necessary to operate 
equipment authorized for export or reexport; and
    (B) The operation software is in object code.
    (ii) Destinations. Operation software and technology may be exported 
or reexported to any destination to which the equipment for which it is 
required has been or is being legally exported or reexported.
    (b) Sales technology--(1) Scope. The provisions of paragraph (b) 
authorize exports and reexports of sales technology. ``Sales 
technology'' is data supporting a prospective or actual quotation, bid,

may be exported or reexported provided that:
    (A) The technology is a type customarily transmitted with a 
prospective or actual quotation, bid, or offer in accordance with 
established business practice; and
    (B) Neither the export nor the reexport will disclose the detailed 
design, production, or manufacture technology, or the means of 
reconstruction, of either the quoted item or its product. The purpose of 
this limitation is to prevent disclosure of technology so

[[Page 197]]

detailed that the consignee could reduce the technology to production.
    (ii) Destinations. Sales technology may be exported or reexported to 
any destination.

    Note: Neither this section nor its use means that the U.S. 
Government intends, or is committed, to approve a license application 
for any commodity, plant, software, or technology that may be the 
subject of the transaction to which such quotation, bid, or offer 
relates. Exporters are advised to include in any quotations, bids, or 
offers, and in any contracts entered into pursuant to such quotations, 
bids, or offers, a provision relieving themselves of liability in the 
event that a license (when required) is not approved by the Bureau of 
Export Administration.

    (c) Software updates. The provisions of paragraph (c) authorize 
exports and reexports of software updates that are intended for and are 
limited to correction of errors (``fixes'' to ``bugs'') in software 
lawfully exported or reexported (original software). Such software 
updates may be exported or reexported only to the same consignee to whom 
the original software was exported or reexported, and such software 
updates may not enhance the functional capacities of the original 
software. Such software updates may be exported or reexported to any 
destination to which the software for which they are required has been 
legally exported or reexported.
    (d) General Software Note: ``mass market'' software--(1) Scope. The 
provisions of paragraph (d) authorize exports and reexports of ``mass 
market'' software subject to the General Software Note (see Supplement 
No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR; also referenced in this section).
    (2) Software not eligible for this License Exception. This License 
Exception is not available for encryption software controlled for ``EI'' 
reasons under ECCN 5D002. (Refer to Secs. 742.15(b)(1) and 748.3(b) of 
the EAR for information on item classifications regarding a one-time BXA 
review for release from EI controls.)
    (3) Provisions and destinations--
    (i) Destinations. ``Mass market'' software is available to all 
destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and 
Syria.
    (ii) Provisions. ``Mass market'' treatment is available for software

States. Personal baggage controlled for chemical and biological weapons 
(CB), missile technology (MT), national security (NS) or nuclear 
nonproliferation (NP) must be shipped within 3 months before or after 
the month in which the consignee or owner departs the United States. 
However, commodities controlled for CB, MT, NS, or NP may not be

Sec. 740.16  Additional permissive reexports (APR).

    This License Exception allows the following reexports:
    (a) Reexports from Country Group A:1 and cooperating countries. 
Reexports may be made from Country Group A:1 or from cooperating 
countries, provided that:
    (1) The reexport is made in accordance with the conditions of an 
export authorization from the government of the reexporting country;
    (2) The commodities being reexported are not controlled for NP, CB, 
MT, SI, or CC reasons; and
    (3) The reexport is destined to either:
    (i) A country in Country Group B that is not also included in 
Country Group D:2, D:3, or D:4; Cambodia; or Laos; and the commodity 
being reexported is both controlled for national security reasons and 
not controlled for export to Country Group A:1; or
    (ii) A country in Country Group D:1 (National Security) (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740), other than Cambodia or Laos, and the 
commodity being reexported is controlled for national security reasons.
    (b) Reexports to and among Country Group A:1 and cooperating 
countries. Reexports may be made to and among Country Group A:1 and 
cooperating countries, provided that eligible commodities are for use or 
consumption within a Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 
740) or cooperating country, or for reexport from such country in 
accordance with other provisions of the EAR. All commodities except the 
following are eligible for reexport to and among Country Group A:1 and 
cooperating countries:
    (1) Computers with a CTP greater than 10,000 MTOPS to Hong Kong and 
South Korea;
    (2) Commodities controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons.
    (c) Reexports to a destination to which direct shipment from the 
United States is authorized under an unused outstanding license may be 
made under the terms of that license. Such reexports shall be recorded 
in the same manner as exports are recorded, regardless of whether the 
license is partially or wholly used for reexport purposes. (See part 762 
of the EAR for recordkeeping requirements.)
    (d) Reexports of any item from Canada that, at the time of reexport, 
may be exported directly from the United States to the new country of 
destination under any License Exception.
    (e) Reexports (return) to the United States of any item. If the 
reexporting party requests written authorization because the government 
of the country from which the reexport will take place requires formal 
U.S. Government approval, such authorization will generally be given.
    (f) Reexports from a foreign destination to Canada of any item if 
the item could be exported to Canada without a license.
    (g) Reexports between Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
    (h) Shipments of foreign-made products that incorporate U.S.-origin 
components may be accompanied by U.S.-origin controlled spare parts, 
provided that they do not exceed 10 percent of the value of the foreign-
made product, subject to the restrictions in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR.
    (i) Reexport to Sudan of items controlled by ECCNs 2A994, 3A993, 
5A992,

5A995, 6A990, 6A994, 7A994, 8A992, 8A994, 9A990, 9A992, and 9A994. In 
addition, items in these ECCNs are not counted as controlled U.S. 
content for purposes of determining license requirements for U.S. parts, 
components, and materials incorporated into foreign-made products.
    (j) Reexports of items controlled by NP Column 1 (see Supplement No. 
1 to part 774 of the EAR) to, among, and from countries described in 
Country Group A:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740), except:

Sec. 742.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Scope. This part describes all the reasons for control reflected 
in the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR. In 
addition, it includes licensing requirements and licensing policies for 
the following items that are not reflected on the Country Chart: 
specially designed implements of torture, high performance computers, 
and communications intercepting devices. This part is organized so that 
it lists each reason for control in the order (reading left to right) in 
which the control appears on the Country Chart. In addition to 
describing the reasons for control and licensing requirements and 
policies, this part describes any applicable contract sanctity 
provisions that may apply to specific controls and includes a 
description of any multilateral regime under which specific controls are 
maintained.
    (b) Reasons for control listed on the CCL not covered by this part. 
This part describes the license requirements and the licensing policies 
for all the ``Reasons for Control'' that are listed on the Commerce 
Control List (CCL) except ``Short Supply'' and ``U.N. Sanctions,'' which 
do not appear on the Country Chart.
    (1) Short Supply. ECCNs containing items subject to short supply 
controls (``SS'') refer the exporter to part 754 of the EAR. These ECCNs 
are: 0A980 (Horses for export by sea); 1C980 (certain inorganic 
chemicals); 1C981 (Crude petroleum, including reconstituted crude 
petroleum, tar sands, and crude shale oil); 1C982 (certain other 
petroleum products); 1C983 (Natural gas liquids and other natural gas 
derivatives); 1C984 (certain manufactured gas and synthetic natural gas 
(except when commingled with natural gas and thus subject to export 
authorization from the Department of Energy); and 1C988 (Western red 
cedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed and worked 
lumber containing wane).
    (2) U.N. Sanctions. The United Nations imposes sanctions, short of 
complete embargoes, against certain countries which may result in 
controls that supplement those otherwise maintained under the EAR for 
that particular country. This part does not address license requirements 
and licensing policies for controls implementing U.N. sanctions. CCL 
entries containing items subject to U.N. sanctions will

[[Page 207]]

refer the exporter to part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special 
Controls, for any supplemental controls that may apply to exports and 
reexports involving these countries.
    (c) Exports and reexports involving Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iraq, 
Iran, and the Bosnian Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This 
part does not cover license requirements and licensing policies that 
apply to exports and reexports to embargoed destinations (Cuba, Libya, 
North Korea, Iraq, Iran and the Bosnian-Serb controlled areas of Bosnia-
Herzegovina). These comprehensive embargoes cover a broader range of 
items than those reflected in the CCL. If you are exporting or 
reexporting to any of these destinations, you should first review part 
746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.
    (d) Anti-terrorism Controls on Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, 
Sudan and Syria. Commerce maintains anti-terrorism controls on Iran, 
Syria and Sudan under section 6(a) of the Export Administration Act. 
Items controlled under section 6(a) to these three countries are 
described in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Commerce also maintains 
controls under section 6(j) of the EAA to Cuba, Libya, Iraq, Iran, North 
Korea, Sudan and Syria. Items controlled to these seven countries under 
EAA section 6(j) are also described in Supplement 2 to part 742. The 
Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify appropriate 
Committees of the Congress 30 days before issuing a license for an item 
controlled under section 6(j) to Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, 
Sudan or Syria. As noted in paragraph (c) of this section, if you are 
exporting or reexporting to Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq and North Korea, you 
should review Part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.
    (e) End-user and end-use based controls. This part does not cover 
prohibitions and licensing requirements for exports of items not 
included on the CCL that are subject to end-use and end-user controls: 
certain nuclear end-uses; certain missile end-uses; certain chemical and 
biological weapons end-uses; certain naval nuclear propulsion end-uses; 
certain activities of U.S. persons; certain exports to and for the use 
of certain foreign vessels or aircraft; and certain exports to all 
countries for Libyan aircraft. Licensing requirements and policies for 
these exports are contained in part 744 of the EAR.
    (f) Overlapping license policies. Many items on the CCL are subject 
to more than one type of control (e.g., national security (NS), missile 
technology (MT), nuclear nonproliferation (NP), regional stability 
(RS)). In addition, applications for all items on the CCL, other than 
those controlled for short supply reasons, may be reviewed for missile 
technology (see Sec. 742.5(b)(3) of this part), nuclear nonproliferation 
(see Sec. 742.3(b)(2) of this part), or chemical and biological weapons 
(see Sec. 742.2(b)(3) of this part), if the end-use or end-user may be 
involved in certain proliferation activities. Finally, many 
multilaterally controlled items are reviewed for anti-terrorism reasons 
if they are destined for a terrorism-supporting country (see paragraph 
(d) of this section). Your application for a license will be reviewed 
under all applicable licensing policies. A license will be issued only 
if an application can be approved under all applicable licensing 
policies.

Sec. 742.2  Proliferation of chemical and biological weapons.

    (a) License requirements. The following controls are maintained in 
support of the U.S. foreign policy of opposing the proliferation and 
illegal use of chemical and biological weapons:
    (1) If CB Column 1 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is 
required to all destinations except Canada for the following:
    (i) Human pathogens, zoonoses, toxins, animal pathogens, genetically 
modified microorganisms and plant pathogens identified in ECCNs 1C351, 
1C352, 1C353 and 1C354; and
    (ii) Technology (ECCNs 1E001 and 1E391) for the production and/or 
disposal of microbiological commodities described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section.
    (2) If CB Column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of

[[Page 208]]

the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is required to 
all destinations except countries in Country Group A:3 (see Supplement 
No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) (Australia Group members) for the 
following:
    (i) Chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350 (precursor and intermediate 
chemicals used in the production of chemical warfare agents).
    (A) This licensing requirement includes chemical mixtures containing 
any chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, except as specified in Note 2 to 
that ECCN.
    (B) This licensing requirement does not include chemical compounds 
created with any chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, unless those 
compounds are also identified in ECCN 1C350.
    (ii) Software (ECCN 1D390) for process control that is specifically 
configured to control or initiate production of the chemical precursors 
controlled by ECCN 1C350.
    (iii) Technology (ECCNs 1E001 and 1E391) for the production and/or 
disposal of chemical precursors described in ECCN 1C350, and technology 
(ECCNs 1E001 and 1E350) involving the following for facilities designed 
or intended to produce chemicals described in 1C350:
    (A) Overall plant design;
    (B) Design, specification, or procurement of equipment;
    (C) Supervision of construction, installation, or operation of 
complete plant or components thereof;
    (D) Training of personnel; or
    (E) Consultation on specific problems involving such facilities.
    (3) If CB Column 3 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is 
required to Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR) for the following:
    (i) Equipment and materials identified in ECCNs 2B350 and 2B351 on 
the CCL, which can be used in the production of chemical weapons 
precursors or chemical warfare agents, and equipment and materials 
identified in ECCN 2B352, which can be used in the production of 
biological agents; and
    (ii) Technology (ECCNs 2E001, 2E002 and 2E301) for development, 
production, or use of the commodities covered in ECCNs 2B350, 2B351 and 
2B352.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) License applications for the items 
described in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered on a case-
by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would make a 
material contribution to the design, development, production, 
stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons. When an export or 
reexport is deemed to make such a contribution, the license will be 
denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered to 
determine what action should be taken on license applications:
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its 
contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use 
of chemical or biological weapons;
    (iii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees against design, 
development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological 
weapons that are given in a particular case; and
    (v) The existence of a pre-existing contract.
    (3) BXA will review license applications in accordance with the 
licensing policy described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for items 
not described in paragraph (a) of this section that:
    (i) Require a license for reasons other than short supply;
    (ii) Are destined to any country except countries in Country Group 
A:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) (Australia Group 
members); and
    (iii) Could be destined for the design, development, production, 
stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons, or for a facility 
engaged in such activities.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates are set forth in 
Supplement No. 1 to part 742. Applicants who wish that a preexisting 
contract be considered in reviewing their license applications must 
submit documentation sufficient to establish the existence of such a 
contract.
    (d) Australia Group. The Australia Group, a multilateral body that 
works

[[Page 209]]

to halt the spread of chemical and biological weapons, has developed 
common control lists of items specifically related to chemical and 
biological weapons. Australia Group members are listed in Country Group 
A:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Controls on items 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section are consistent with lists agreed 
to in the Australia Group.

Sec. 742.3  Nuclear nonproliferation.

    (a) License requirements. Section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Act of 1978 requires BXA to identify items subject to the 
EAR that could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes if used 
for activities other than those authorized at the time of export or 
reexport. ECCNs on the CCL that include the symbol ``NP 1'' or ``NP 2'' 
in the ``Country Chart'' column of the ``License Requirements'' section 
identify items that could be of significance for nuclear explosive 
purposes and are therefore subject to licensing requirements under this 
part and under section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 
1978. These items are referred to as ``The Nuclear Referral List'' and 
are subject to the following licensing requirements:
    (1) If NP Column 1 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is 
required to all destinations except Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) member 
countries (Country Group A:4) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR).
    (2) If NP Column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 
738 of the EAR) is indicated in the applicable ECCN, a license is 
required to Country Group D:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR).
    (3) Other nuclear-related license requirements are described in 
Secs. 744.2 and 744.5 of the EAR.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) To implement the controls in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the following factors are among those used to determine 
what action should be taken on individual applications:
    (i) Whether the items to be transferred are appropriate for the 
stated end-use and whether that stated end-use is appropriate for the 
end-user;
    (ii) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular item;
    (iii) Whether the items to be exported or reexported are to be used 
in research on, or for the development, design, manufacture, 
construction, operation, or maintenance of, any reprocessing or 
enrichment facility;
    (iv) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for 
nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;
    (v) Whether any party to the transaction has been engaged in 
clandestine or illegal procurement activities;
    (vi) Whether an application for a license to export or reexport to 
the end-user has previously been denied, or whether the end-user has 
previously diverted items received under a general license, a License 
Exception, or a validated license to unauthorized activities;
    (vii) Whether the export or reexport would present an unacceptable 
risk of diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded 
nuclear fuel-cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2(a) of the EAR; and
    (viii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, 
based on consideration of the following factors:
    (A) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition of 
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) or to a similar 
international legally-binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement;
    (B) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclear activities, 
facilities, or installations that are operational, being designed, or 
under construction under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards;
    (C) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil uses 
of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country;
    (D) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the government 
of the importing country are in support of nuclear nonproliferation and 
whether that government is in compliance with

[[Page 210]]

its international obligations in the field of non-proliferation;
    (E) The degree to which the government of the importing country 
cooperates in non-proliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness to 
consult on international nonproliferation issues); and
    (F) Information on the importing country's nuclear intentions and 
activities.
    (2) In addition, BXA will review license applications in accordance 
with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b) of this section for 
items not on the Nuclear Referral List that:
    (i) Require a license on the CCL for reasons other than ``short 
supply;'' and
    (ii) Are intended for a nuclear related end-use or end-user.
    (3) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensing policy 
for applications for those items that would make a direct and 
significant contribution to nuclear weapons and their delivery systems 
is extended review or denial.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    (d) Nuclear Suppliers Group. Most items on the Nuclear Referral List 
that require a license under NP Column No. 1 on the Country Chart (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) are contained in the Annex to 
the ``Guidelines for Transfers of Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Equipment, 
Material, and Related Technology'' (the Annex), as published by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency in INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2. The 
adherents to INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2, which includes the Nuclear 
Suppliers Guidelines, have agreed to establish export licensing 
procedures for the transfer of items identified in the Annex. Items that 
are listed as requiring a license under NP Column No. 2 on the Country 
Chart (see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) are not included in 
the Annex and are controlled only by the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 742.4  National security.

    (a) License requirements. It is the policy of the United States to 
restrict the export and reexport of items that would make a significant 
contribution to the military potential of any other country or 
combination of countries that would prove detrimental to the national 
security of the United States. Accordingly, a license is required for 
exports and reexports to all destinations, except Canada, for all items 
in ECCNs on the CCL that include NS Column 1 in the Country Chart column 
of the ``License Requirements'' section. A license is required to all 
destinations except Country Group A:1 and cooperating countries (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740) for all items in ECCNs on the CCL that 
include NS Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the ``License 
Requirements'' section. The purpose of the controls is to ensure that 
these items do not make a contribution to the military potential of 
countries in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR) that would prove detrimental to the national security of the United 
States. License Exception GBS is available for the export and reexport 
of certain national security controlled items to Country Group B (see 
Sec. 740.4 and Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) The policy for national security 
controlled items exported or reexported to any country except a country 
in Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) is to 
approve applications unless there is a significant risk that the items 
will be diverted to a country in Country Group D:1.
    (2) Except for those countries described in paragraphs (b)(5) 
through (b)(7) of this section, the general policy for exports and 
reexports of items to Country Group D:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 
740 of the EAR) is to approve applications when BXA determines, on a 
case-by-case basis, that the items are for civilian use or would 
otherwise not make a significant contribution to the military potential 
of the country of destination that would prove detrimental to the 
national security of the United States.
    (3) To permit such policy judgments to be made, each application is 
reviewed in the light of prevailing policies with full consideration of 
all aspects of the proposed transaction. The review generally includes:

[[Page 211]]

    (i) An analysis of the kinds and quantities of items to be shipped;
    (ii) Their military or civilian uses;
    (iii) The unrestricted availability abroad of the same or comparable 
items;
    (iv) The country of destination;
    (v) The ultimate end-users in the country of destination; and
    (vi) The intended end-use.
    (4) Although each proposed transaction is considered individually, 
items described in Advisory Notes on the Commerce Control List are more 
likely to be approved than others.
    (5) In recognition of efforts made to adopt safeguard measures for 
exports and reexports, Bulgaria, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, 
Mongolia, and Russia are accorded enhanced favorable consideration 
licensing treatment.
    (6) The general policy for Cambodia and Laos is to approve license 
applications when BXA determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the 
items are for an authorized use in Cambodia or Laos and are not likely 
to be diverted to another country or use contrary to the national 
security or foreign policy controls of the United States.
    (7) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensing policy 
is to approve applications, except that those items that would make a 
direct and significant contribution to electronic and anti-submarine 
warfare, intelligence gathering, power projection, and air superiority 
receive extended review or denial. Each application will be considered 
individually. Items may be approved even though they may contribute to 
Chinese military development or the end-user or end-use is military. 
Note that the Advisory Notes in the CCL headed ``Note for the People's 
Republic of China'' provide guidance on equipment likely to be approved 
more rapidly for China.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.

Sec. 742.5  Missile technology.

    (a) License requirements. (1) In support of U.S. foreign policy to 
limit the proliferation of missiles, a license is required to export and 
reexport items related to the design, development, production, or use of 
missiles. These items are identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column 
No. 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' 
section. Licenses for these items are required to all destinations, 
except Canada, as indicated by MT Column 1 of the Country Chart (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).
    (2) The term ``missiles'' is defined as rocket systems (including 
ballistic missile systems, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets) 
and unmanned air vehicle systems (including cruise missile systems, 
target drones, and reconnaissance drones) capable of delivering at least 
500 kilograms (kg) payload to a range of at least 300 kilometers (km).
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications to export and reexport items 
identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chart 
column of the ``License Requirements'' section will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would 
make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. 
Applications for exports and reexports of such items contained in 
Category 7A or described by ECCN 9A101 on the CCL will be considered 
more favorably if such exports or reexports are determined to be 
destined to a manned aircraft, satellite, land vehicle, or marine 
vessel, in quantities appropriate for replacement parts for such 
applications. When an export or reexport is deemed to make a material 
contribution to the proliferation of missiles, the license will be 
denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered in 
reviewing individual applications.
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its 
contribution to the design, development, production, or use of missiles;
    (iii) The capabilities and objectives of the missile and space 
programs of the recipient country;
    (iv) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (v) The types of assurances or guarantees against design, 
development,

[[Page 212]]

production, or use of missiles that are given in a particular case; and
    (vi) The existence of a preexisting contract.
    (3) Controls on other items. BXA will review license applications, 
in accordance with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, for items not described in paragraph (a) of this section 
that:
    (i) Require a validated license for reasons other than short supply; 
and
    (ii) Could be destined for the design, development, production, or 
use of missiles, or for a facility engaged in such activities.
    (c) Contract sanctity. The following contract sanctity dates have 
been established:
    (1) License applications for batch mixers specified in ECCN 1B115.a 
involving contracts that were entered into prior to January 19, 1990, 
will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (2) License applications subject to ECCN 1B115.b or .c that involve 
a contract entered into prior to March 7, 1991, will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (3) Applicants who wish that a pre-existing contract be considered 
in reviewing their license applications must submit documentation 
sufficient to establish the existence of a contract.
    (d) Missile Technology Control Regime. Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR) members are listed in Country Group A:2 (see Supplement 
No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Controls on items identified in paragraph 
(a) of this section are consistent with the list agreed to in the MTCR 
and included in the MTCR Annex.


<R05>
Sec. 742.6  Regional stability.

    (a) License requirements. The following controls are maintained in 
support of U.S. foreign policy to maintain regional stability:
    (1) As indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 1 of the Country Chart 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR), a license is required to 
all destinations, except Canada, for items described on the CCL under 
ECCNs 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3, or .c; 6A003.b.3 and b.4; 6D102 (only 
software for development of items in 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3 or .c); 6E001 
(only technology for development of items in 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3, and 
.c, or 6A003.b.3 and b.4); 6E002 (only technology for production of 
items in 6A002.a.1, a.2, a.3, or .c, or 6A003.b.3 or b.4); 7D001 (only 
software for development or production of items in 7A001, 7A002, or 
7A003); 7E001 (only technology for the development of inertial 
navigation systems, inertial equipment, and specially designed 
components therefor for civil aircraft); 7E002 (only technology for the 
production of inertial navigation systems, inertial equipment, and 
specially designed components therefor for civil aircraft).
    (2) As indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 2 of the Country Chart 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR), a license is required to 
any destination except countries in Country Group A:1 (see Supplement 
No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), Iceland and New Zealand for military 
vehicles and certain commodities (specially designed) used to 
manufacture military equipment, described on the CCL in ECCNs 0A018.c, 
1B018.a, 2B018, and 9A018.a and .b.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications to export and reexport items 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport could 
contribute directly or indirectly to any country's military capabilities 
in a manner that would alter or destabilize a region's military balance 
contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States.
    (2) Applications to export and reexport commodities described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section will generally be considered favorably 
on a case-by-case basis unless there is evidence that the export or 
reexport would contribute significantly to the destabilization of the 
region to which the equipment is destined.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining regional stability controls, at 
this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 742.7  Crime control.

    (a) License requirements. In support of U.S. foreign policy to 
promote the observance of human rights throughout the world, a license 
is required to export and reexport crime control and detection 
equipment, related technology and software as follows:
    (1) Crime control and detection instruments and equipment and 
related technology and software identified in the appropriate ECCNs on 
the CCL under CC Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License 
Requirements'' section. A license is required to countries listed in CC 
Column 1 (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR). Items affected by 
this requirement are identified on the CCL under the following ECCNs: 
0A982, 0A983, 0A984, 0A985, 0E984, 1A984, 3A980, 3A981, 3D980, 3E980, 
4A003 (for fingerprint computers only), 4A980, 4D001 (for fingerprint 
computers only), 4D980, 4E001 (for fingerprint computers only), 4E980, 
6A002 (for police-model infrared viewers only), 6E001 (for police-model 
infrared viewers only), and 9A980.
    (2) Shotguns with a barrel length greater than or equal to 24 
inches, identified in ECCN 0A984 on the CCL under CC Column 2 in the 
Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section regardless 
of end-user to countries listed in CC Column 2 (Supplement No. 1 part 
738 of the EAR).
    (3) Shotguns with a barrel length greater than or equal to 24 
inches, identified in ECCN 0A984 on the CCL under CC Column 3 in the 
Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section only if for 
sale or resale to police or law enforcement entities in countries listed 
in CC Column 3 (Supplement No. 1 part 738 of the EAR).
    (b) Licensing policy. Applications for items controlled under this 
section will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-case basis 
unless there is evidence that the government of the importing country 
may have violated internationally recognized human rights and that the 
judicious use of export controls would be helpful in deterring the 
development of a consistent pattern of such violations or in distancing 
the United States from such violations.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining controls on crime control and 
detection items, at this time these controls are maintained only by the 
United States.

Sec. 742.8  Anti-terrorism: Iran.

    (a) License requirements. (1) If AT column 1 or AT column 2 of the 
Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to Part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in 
the appropriate ECCN, a license is required for export to Iran for anti-
terrorism purposes. In addition, portable electric power generators and 
related software and technology (ECCNs 2A994, 2D994 and 2E994) are 
controlled for export to Iran for anti-terrorism purposes. See paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section for controls maintained by the Department of the 
Treasury.
    (2) If AT column 1 or AT column 2 of the Country Chart (Supplement 
No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a 
license is required for reexport to Iran for anti-terrorism purposes, 
except for ECCNs 2A994, 3A993, 5A992, 5A995, 6A990, 6A994, 7A994, 8A992, 
8A994, 9A990, 9A992 and 9A994. In addition, items in these ECCNs are not 
counted as controlled U.S. content for the purpose of determining 
license requirements for U.S. parts, components or materials 
incorporated into foreign-made products. However, the export from the 
United States to any destination with knowledge that they will be 
reexported directly or indirectly, in whole or in part to Iran is 
prohibited without a license. See Sec. 740.9 of the EAR for additional 
information. See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for controls 
maintained by the Department of the Treasury.
    (3) The Secretary of State has designated Iran as a country whose 
Government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism.
    (4) In support of U.S. foreign policy on terrorism-supporting 
countries,

[[Page 214]]

BXA maintains two types of anti-terrorism controls on the export and 
reexport of items described in Supplement 2 to part 742.
    (i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of 
Supplement No. 2 to part 742 are controlled under section 6(j) of the 
Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA), if destined to military, 
police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users.
    (ii) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of 
Supplement No. 2 to part 742 destined to non-sensitive end-users, as 
well as items described in paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(39) to all end-
users, are controlled to Iran under section 6(a) of the EAA. (See 
Supplement No. 2 to part 742 for more information on items controlled 
under sections 6(a) and 6(j) of the EAA and Sec. 750.6 of the EAR for 
procedures for processing license applications for items controlled 
under EAA section 6(j).)
    (5) Exports and certain reexports to Iran are subject to a 
comprehensive embargo administered by the Department of the Treasury's 
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). If you wish to export or 
reexport to Iran, the Government of Iran or any entity owned or 
controlled by that Government, you should review part 746 of the EAR and 
consult with OFAC. Please note that authorization from OFAC constitutes 
authorization under the EAR and no separate license or authorization 
from BXA is required.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act 
of October 23, 1992, requires BXA to deny licenses for items controlled 
to Iran for national security (section 5 of the 1979 EAA) or foreign 
policy reasons (section 6 of the 1979 EAA), absent contract sanctity or 
a Presidential waiver. License applications for which contract sanctity 
is established may be considered under policies in effect prior to the 
enactment of that Act. Otherwise, licenses for such items to Iran are 
subject to a general policy of denial.
    (2) License applications for items controlled under section 6(a) of 
the EAA will also be reviewed to determine whether requirements of 
section 6(j) apply. Whenever the Secretary of State determines that an 
export or reexport could make a significant contribution to the military 
potential of Iran, including its military logistics capability, or could 
enhance Iran's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the 
Secretaries of State and Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior 
to the issuance of a license.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates and related policies 
for Iran are listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Applicants who wish 
a pre-existing contract to be considered must submit sufficient evidence 
to establish the existence of a contract.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this 
time these controls are maintained only by the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 742.9  Anti-terrorism: Syria.

    (a) License requirements. (1) If AT Column 1 of the Country Chart 
(Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the 
appropriate ECCN, a license is required for export and reexport to Syria 
for anti-terrorism purposes.
    (2) The Secretary of State has designated Syria as a country whose 
government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism.
    (3) In support of U.S. foreign policy against terrorism, BXA 
maintains two types of anti-terrorism controls on the export and 
reexport to Syria of items described in Supplement No. 2 to part 742.
    (i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of 
Supplement No. 2 to part 742, if destined to military, police, 
intelligence or other end-users in Syria, are controlled under section 
6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA).
    (ii) Items listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of Supplement 
No. 2 to part 742 destined to other end-users in Syria, as well as items 
to all end-users listed in (c)(6) through (c)(8), (c)(10) through 
(c)(14), (c)(16) through (c)(19), and (c)(22) through (c)(39) of 
Supplement No. 2 to part 742, are controlled to Syria under section 6(a) 
of the EAA.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) Applications for export and reexport to 
all end-users

[[Page 215]]

in Syria of the following items will generally be denied:
    (i) Items that are controlled for chemical and biological weapons 
proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that contain 
CB Column 1, CB Column 2, or CB Column 3 in the Country Chart column of 
the ``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL.
    (ii) Military-related items controlled for national security reasons 
to any destination. These are items that contain NS Column 1 in the 
Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section in an ECCN 
on the CCL and is controlled by equipment or material entries ending in 
the number ``18.''
    (iii) Items that are controlled for missile proliferation reasons to 
any destination. These are items that have an MT Column 1 in the Country 
Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the 
CCL.
    (iv) All aircraft (powered and unpowered), helicopters, engines, and 
related spare parts and components. These are items controlled to any 
destination for national security reasons and items controlled to Syria 
for anti-terrorism purposes. Such items contain an NS Column 1, NS 
Column 2, or AT Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License 
Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL. Note that, consistent with 
the general rule that applies to computing U.S. parts and components 
content incorporated in foreign made products, all aircraft-related 
items that require a license to Syria will be included as controlled 
U.S. content, except for ECCNs 6A990, 7A994, and 9A994, for purposes of 
such licensing requirements.
    (v) Cryptographic, cryptoanalytic, and cryptologic items controlled 
to any destination for national security reasons. Such items contain an 
AT Column 1 and an NS Column 1 or NS Column 2 in the Country Chart 
column of the ``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL.
    (vi) Explosive device detectors controlled under ECCN 2A993.
    (2) Applications for export and reexport to Syria of all other items 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, and not described by 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, will generally be denied if the export 
or reexport is destined to a military end-user or for military end-use. 
Applications for non-military end-users or for non-military end-uses 
will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), 
of this section, applications for Syria will be considered on a case-by-
case basis if:
    (i) The transaction involves the reexport to Syria of items where 
Syria was not the intended ultimate destination at the time of original 
export from the United States, provided that the exports from the U.S. 
occurred prior to the applicable contract sanctity date (or, where the 
contract sanctity date is December 16, 1986, prior to June 18, 1987).
    (ii) The U.S. content of foreign-produced commodities is 20% or less 
by value; or
    (iii) The commodities are medical items.

    Note to paragraph (b) of this section: Applicants who wish any of 
the factors described in paragraph (b) of this section to be considered 
in reviewing their license applications must submit adequate 
documentation demonstrating the value of the U.S. content, the 
specifications and medical use of the equipment, or the date of export 
from the United States.

    (4) License applications for items reviewed under 6(a) controls will 
also be reviewed to determine the applicability of 6(j) controls to the 
transaction. When it is determined that an export or reexport could make 
a significant contribution to the military potential of Syria, including 
its military logistics capability, or could enhance Syria's ability to 
support acts of international terrorism, the Secretaries of State and 
Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior to issuance of a 
license.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates and related licensing 
policies for Syria are set forth in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. 
Applicants who wish a pre-existing contract to be considered must submit 
sufficient documentation to establish the existence of a contract.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this 
time these

[[Page 216]]

controls are maintained only by the United States.

counted as controlled U.S. content for the purpose of determining 
license requirements for U.S. parts, components or materials 
incorporated into foreign made products. However, the export from the 
United States to any destination with knowledge that they will be 
reexported directly or indirectly, in whole or in part to Sudan is 
prohibited without a license. See Sec. 740.9 of the EAR for additional 
information.
    (3) The Secretary of State has designated Sudan as a country whose 
government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism.

proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that contain 
CB Column 1, CB Column 2, or CB Column 3 in the Country Chart column of 
the ``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL.
    (ii) Military-related items controlled for national security reasons 
to any destination. These are items that contain NS Column 1 in the 
Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN 
on the CCL and is controlled by equipment or material entries ending in 
the number ``18.''
    (iii) Items that are controlled for missile proliferation reasons to 
any destination. These are items that contain a MT Column 1 in the 
Country Chart column of the ``License Requirements'' section of an ECCN 
on the CCL.
    (iv) All aircraft (powered and unpowered), helicopters, engines, and 
related spare parts and components. These are items controlled to any 
destination for national security reasons and items controlled to Sudan 
for anti-terrorism reasons. Such items contain an NS Column 1, NS Column 
2, or AT Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the ``License 
Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL. Note that, consistent with 
the general rule that applies to computing U.S. parts and components 
content incorporated in foreign made products, all aircraft-related 
items that require a license to Sudan will be included as controlled US 
content for purposes of such license requirements.
    (v) Cryptographic, cryptoanalytic, and cryptologic items controlled 
to any destination. These are items that contain an NS Column 1, NS 
Column 2,

[[Page 217]]

AT Column 1 or AT Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the ``License 
Requirements'' section of an ECCN on the CCL.
    (vi) Explosive device detectors controlled under ECCN 2A993.
    (2) Applications for the export and reexport of all other items 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, and not described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, will be denied if the export or 
reexport is destined to a military end-user or for military end-use. 
Applications for non-military end-users or for non-military end-uses 
will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) 
of this section, applications for Sudan will be considered on a case-by-
case basis if:
    (i) The transaction involves the reexport to Sudan of items where 
Sudan was not the intended ultimate destination at the time of original 
export from the United States, provided that the exports from the U.S. 
occurred prior to the applicable contract sanctity date.
    (ii) The U.S. content of foreign-produced commodities is 20% or less 
by value; or
    (iii) The commodities are medical items.

    Note to paragraph (b) of this section: Applicants who wish any of 
the factors described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section to be 
considered in reviewing their license applications must submit adequate 
documentation demonstrating the value of the U.S. content, the 
specifications and medical use of the equipment, or the date of export 
from the United States.

    (4) License applications for items reviewed under 6(a) controls will 
also be reviewed to determine the applicability of 6(j) controls to the 
transaction. When it is determined that an export or reexport could make 
a significant contribution to the military potential of Sudan, including 
its military logistics capability, or could enhance Sudan's ability to 
support acts of international terrorism, the appropriate committees of 
the Congress will be notified 30 days before issuance of a license to 
export or reexport such items.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates and related licensing 
information for Sudan are set forth in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. 
Applicants who wish a pre-existing contract to be considered must submit 
sufficient documentation to establish the existence of a contract.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this 
time these controls are maintained only by the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 742.11  Specially designed implements of torture.

    (a) License requirements. In support of U.S. foreign policy to 
promote the observance of human rights throughout the world, a license 
is required to export specially designed implements of torture 
controlled by 0A983 to all destinations, including Canada.
    (b) Licensing policy. Applications for such licenses will generally 
be denied to all destinations.
    (c) Contract sanctity. The contract sanctity date is November 9, 
1995. Contract sanctity will be a factor in considering only 
applications for export to the NATO countries, Japan, Australia, and New 
Zealand.
    (d) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from 
like-minded countries in maintaining controls on implements of torture, 
at this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 742.12  High performance computers.

    (a) License and recordkeeping requirements. (1) This section 
contains special provisions for exports, reexports, and certain intra-
country transfers of high performance computers, including software, and 
technology. This section affects the following ECCNs: 4A001, 4A002, 
4A003, 4D001, 4D002, and 4E001. It applies to computers with a Composite 
Theoretical Performance (CTP) greater than 2000, stated in Million 
Theoretical Operations Per Second (MTOPS). Licenses are required under 
this section for ECCN's having an ``XP'' under ``Reason for Control'' 
when License Exception CTP is not available (see Sec. 740.7 of the EAR). 
License requirements reflected in this section are based on particular 
destinations, end-users, or end-uses. For the calculation of CTP, see 
the Technical Note that follows the Advisory Notes for Category 4 in the

[[Page 218]]

Commerce Control List. Note that License Exception CTP contains 
restrictions on access by nationals of certain countries, and on 
reexports and transfers of computers.
    (2) In recognition of the strategic and proliferation significance 
of high performance computers, a license is required for the export or 
reexport of high performance computers to destinations, end-users, and 
end-uses, as specified in this section and on the CCL. These license 
requirements supplement requirements that apply for other control 
reasons, such as nuclear nonproliferation provided in Sec. 742.3 of the 
EAR. The license requirements described in this Sec. 742.12 are not 
reflected on the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the 
EAR). Four Computer Country Tiers have been established for the purposes 
of these controls. Countries included in Computer Tiers 1, 2, and 3 are 
listed in License Exception CTP in Sec. 740.7 of the EAR. Computer Tier 
4 consists of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
    (3) Exporters must keep accurate records of each export to any 
destination of a computer with a CTP equal to or greater than 2,000 
MTOPS, irrespective of whether the export is made under License 
Exception or otherwise. These records will be made available to the U.S. 
Government upon request. The records will include the following 
information:
    (i) Date of shipment;
    (ii) Name and address of the end-user and each intermediate 
consignee;
    (iii) CTP of each computer in shipment;
    (iv) Volume of computers in shipment;
    (v) Dollar value of shipment; and
    (vi) End-Use.
    (4) Exporters are hereby notified that consistent with the 
commitments reached with the Wassenaar Arrangement, exporters will be 
required to submit to BXA consolidated reports on exports to certain 
destinations every six months of computers with a CTP equal to or 
greater than 2,000 MTOPS. These reports will include for each such 
export all the information required to be kept pursuant to paragraph (3) 
of Sec. 742.12(a). Exports of computers above 2,000 MTOPS to certain 
destinations will be subject to the reporting requirement once the 
initial elements of the Wassenaar Arrangement are adopted, and the first 
report will be due thereafter.
    (b) Licensing policy. Licensing policies described in this section 
vary according to the country of destination, and the end-use or end-
user involved in the transaction. Note that in addition, license 
applications for items covered by Sec. 742.12 will also be reviewed 
under the nuclear nonproliferation licensing policy in Sec. 742.3(b). In 
certain cases, licenses may be subject to safeguard conditions. The 
specific conditions that may be imposed by BXA will depend on the 
country of destination, and the end-use or end-user of the export. BXA 
may also require end-use certification which, in appropriate cases, is 
certified by the government of the importing country. The range of 
possible safeguard conditions and related information are provided in 
Supplement No. 3 to part 742.
    (1) Computer Tier 1--(i) License requirement. No license is required 
under this Sec. 742.12 for exports or reexports of computers to and 
among countries listed in Computer Tier 1, for consumption in such 
countries or other disposition in accordance with the EAR.
    (ii) Licensing policy. A license is not required under this 
Sec. 742.12.
    (2) Computer Tier 2--(i) License requirement. A license is required 
to export or reexport a computer having a Composite Theoretical 
Performance (CTP) greater than 10,000 Millions of Theoretical Operations 
Per Second (MTOPS) to a country in Computer Tier 2.
    (ii) Licensing policy. License applications for a country in 
Computer Tier 2 will generally be approved.
    (3) Computer Tier 3--(i) License requirement. (A) A license is 
required to export or reexport computers with a CTP greater than 2,000 
MTOPS to countries in Computer Tier 3 to military end-users and end-uses 
and to nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile end-users and end-uses 
defined in part 744 of the EAR in Computer Tier 3 countries.
    (B) A license is required to export or reexport computers with a CTP 
greater

[[Page 219]]

than 7,000 MTOPS to all end-users and end-uses located in countries in 
Computer Tier 3.
    (ii) Licensing policy. License applications for exports and 
reexports to military end-users and end-uses and nuclear, chemical, 
biological, or missile end-users and end-uses defined in part 744 of the 
EAR in countries in Computer Tier 3 will be reviewed on a case-by-case 
basis using the following criteria:
    (A) The presence and activities of countries and end-users of 
national security and proliferation concern and the relationships that 
exist between the government of the importing country and such countries 
and end-users;
    (B) The ultimate consignee's participation in, or support of, any of 
the following:
    (1) Activities that involve national security concerns; or
    (2) Nuclear, chemical, biological or missile proliferation 
activities described in part 744 of the EAR;
    (C) The extent to which the importing country is involved in 
nuclear, chemical, biological, or missile proliferation activities 
described in part 744 of the EAR;
    (D) The end-user, whether the end-use is single-purpose or multiple-
purpose.
    (iii) Licensing policy for other end-uses and end-users. License 
applications for exports and reexports to other end-users and end-uses 
located in countries in Computer Tier 3 will generally be approved.
    (4) Computer Tier 4--(i) License requirement. A license is required 
to export or reexport any items covered by this section to a country in 
Country Tier 4.
    (ii) Licensing policy. The licensing policies for countries in 
Computer Tier 4 are the same as described in the following EAR sections: 
for Sudan see Sec. 742.10(b); for Syria see Sec. 742.9(b); for Cuba see 
Sec. 746.2; for Iran see Sec. 746.7; for Iraq see Sec. 746.3; for Libya 
see Sec. 746.4; and for North Korea see Sec. 746.5.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications involving exports and reexports of 
high performance computers.
    (d) High performance computer regime. The United States and Japan 
participate in a high performance computer regime. Other countries are 
expected to join. The regime provides uniform and effective safeguards 
to protect high performance computers from unauthorized destinations, 
end-users and end-uses.

Sec. 742.13  Communications intercepting devices.

    (a) License requirement. (1) As set forth in ECCN 5A980, a license 
is required for the export or reexport to any destination, including 
Canada, of any electronic, mechanical, or other device primarily useful 
for surreptitious interception of wire or oral communications. This 
control implements a provision of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe 
Streets Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-361). This license requirement is not 
reflected on the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the 
EAR).
    (2) Communications intercepting devices are electronic, mechanical, 
or other devices that can be used for interception of wire or oral 
communications if their design renders them primarily useful for 
surreptitious listening even though they may also have innocent uses. A 
device is not restricted merely because it is small or may be adapted to 
wiretapping or eavesdropping. Some examples of devices to which these 
restrictions apply are: the martini olive transmitter; the infinity 
transmitter; the spike mike; and the disguised microphone appearing as a 
wristwatch, cufflink, or cigarette pack; etc. The restrictions do not 
apply to devices such as the parabolic microphone or other directional 
microphones ordinarily used by broadcasters at sports events, since 
these devices are not primarily useful for surreptitious listening.
    (b) Licensing policy. (1) License applications will generally be 
approved for:
    (i) A provider of wire or electronic communication services or an 
officer, agent, or employee of, or person under contract with, such a 
provider in the normal course of the business of providing that wire or 
electronic communication service; and

[[Page 220]]

    (ii) Officers, agents, or employees of, or person under contract 
with the United States, one of the 50 States, or a political subdivision 
thereof, when engaged in the normal course of government activities.
    (2) Other applications will generally be denied.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications involving exports and reexports of 
communications interception devices.
    (d) U.S. controls. Controls on this equipment are maintained by the 
United States government in accordance with the Omnibus Crime Control 
and Safe Streets Act of 1968.


<R05>
Sec. 742.14  Significant items: commercial communications satellites; hot section technology for the development, production or overhaul of commercial aircraft 
          engines, components, and systems.

    (a) License requirements. Licenses are required for all 
destinations, except Canada, for ECCNs having an ``SI'' under the 
``Reason for Control'' paragraph. These items include commercial 
communications satellites controlled by ECCN 9A004.a., and hot section 
technology for the development, production or overhaul of commercial 
aircraft engines controlled under ECCN 9E003.a.1. through a.12., .f, and 
related controls.
    (b) Licensing policy. Pursuant to section 6 of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA), foreign policy controls 
apply to commercial communications satellites controlled under 9A004.a. 
and technology required for the development, production or overhaul of 
commercial aircraft engines controlled by ECCN 9E003.a.1. through a.12, 
.f, and related controls. These controls supplement the national 
security controls that apply to those items. Applications for export and 
reexport to all destinations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to 
determine whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S. 
national security and foreign policy interests. The following factors 
are among those that will be considered to determine what action will be 
taken on license applications:
    (1) The country of destination;
    (2) The ultimate end-user(s);
    (3) The technology involved;
    (4) The specific nature of the end-use(s); and
    (5) The types of assurance against unauthorized use or diversion 
that are given in a particular case.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this Sec. 742.14.

<R05>
Sec. 742.15  Encryption items.

    Encryption items can be used to maintain the secrecy of information, 
and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm national security, 
foreign policy and law enforcement interests. As the President indicated 
in E.O. 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15, 1996, export of 
encryption software, like export of encryption hardware, is controlled 
because of this functional capacity to encrypt information on a computer 
system, and not because of any informational or theoretical value that 
such software may reflect, contain, or represent, or that its export may 
convey to others abroad. For this reason, export controls on encryption 
software are distinguished from controls on other software regulated 
under the EAR.
    (a) License requirements. Licenses are required for all 
destinations, except Canada, for ECCNs having an ``EI'' (for 
``encryption items'') under the ``Control(s)'' paragraph. Such items 
include: encryption commodities controlled under ECCN 5A002; encryption 
software controlled under ECCN 5D002; and encryption technology 
controlled under ECCN 5E002. (Refer to part 772 of the EAR for the 
definition of ``encryption items'). For encryption items previously on 
the U.S. Munitions List and currently authorized for export or reexport 
under a State Department license, distribution arrangement or any other 
authority of the State Department, U.S. persons holding valid USML 
licenses and other approvals issued by the Department of State prior to 
December 30, 1996 may ship remaining balances authorized by such 
licenses or approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing Shippers 
Export Declarations (SEDs) with District

[[Page 221]]

Directors of Customs, citing the provisions of this section effective on 
December 30, 1996 and the State Department license number. Such 
shipments shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions, 
including the expiration date, existing at the time of issuance of the 
State license. Violations of such authorizations, terms and conditions 
constitute violations of the EAR. Any reports required for distribution 
and other types of agreements previously authorized by the Department of 
State, valid prior to December 30, 1996, should be henceforth submitted 
to BXA at the following address: Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign 
Policy Controls, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of 
Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Room 2705, 
Washington, D.C. 20230.
    (b) Licensing policy. The following licensing policies apply to 
items identified in paragraph (a) of this section. This section refers 
you to Supplements No. 4, No. 5, and No. 7 to this part 742. For 
purposes of these supplements, ``products'' refers to commodities and 
software. Except as otherwise noted, applications will be reviewed on a 
case-by-case basis by BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, to 
determine whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S. 
national security and foreign policy interests.
    (1) Certain mass-market encryption software. Consistent with E.O. 
13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767), certain encryption software 
that was transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce 
Control List pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of November 15, 
1996 may be released from ``EI'' controls and thereby made eligible for 
mass market treatment after a one-time review. To determine eligibility 
for mass market treatment, exporters must submit a classification 
request to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption software may be eligible 
for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software may be 
eligible for 15-day processing. Refer to Supplement No. 6 to part 742 
and Sec. 748.3(b)(3) of the EAR for additional information. Note that 
the one-time review is for a determination to release encryption 
software in object code only unless otherwise specifically requested. 
Exporters requesting release of the source code should refer to 
paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to part 742. If, after a one-
time review, BXA determines that the software is released from EI 
controls, such software is eligible for all provisions of the EAR 
applicable to other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-
market software. If BXA determines that the software is not released 
from EI controls, a license is required for export and reexport to all 
destinations, except Canada, and license applications will be considered 
on a case-by-case basis.
    (2) Key Escrow, Key Recovery and Recoverable encryption software and 
commodities. Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled for 
EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002, including encryption 
equipment designed or modified to use recovery encryption software, may 
be made eligible for license exception KMI after a one-time BXA review. 
License Exception KMI is available for all destinations except Cuba, 
Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Sudan. To determine 
eligibility, exporters must submit a classification request to BXA. 
Requests for one-time review of key escrow and key recovery encryption 
items will receive favorable consideration provided that, prior to the 
export or reexport, a key recovery agent satisfactory to BXA has been 
identified (refer to Supplement No. 5 to part 742) and security policies 
for safeguarding the key(s) or other material/information required to 
decrypt ciphertext as described in Supplement No. 5 to part 742 are 
established to the satisfaction of BXA and are maintained after export 
or reexport as required by the EAR. If the exporter or reexporter 
intends to be the key recovery agent, then the exporter or reexporter 
must meet all of the requirements of a key recovery agent identified in 
Supplement No. 5 to part 742. In addition, the key escrow or key 
recovery system must meet the criteria identified in Supplement No. 4 to 
part 742. Note that eligibility is dependent on continued fulfilment of 
the requirements of a key

[[Page 222]]

recovery agent identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. Since the 
establishment of a key management infrastructure and key recovery agents 
may take some time, BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, 
consider requests for eligibility to export key recovery encryption 
products which facilitate establishment of the key management 
infrastructure before a key recovery agent is named, consistent with 
national security and foreign policy. When BXA approves such cases, 
exporters of products described in Supplement No. 4 to part 742 are 
required to furnish the name of an agent by December 31, 1998. Requests 
for one-time review of recoverable products which allow government 
officials to obtain, under proper legal authority and without the 
cooperation or knowledge of the user, the plaintext of the encrypted 
data and communications will receive favorable consideration.
    (3) Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or 
equivalent strength supported by a satisfactory business and marketing 
plan for exporting recoverable items and services. (i) Manufacturers of 
non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent 
strength will be permitted to export and reexport under the authority of 
License Exception KMI provided that the requirements and conditions of 
the License Exception are met. Exporters must submit a classification 
request for an initial BXA review of the item and a satisfactory 
business and marketing plan that explains in detail the steps the 
applicant will take during the two-year transition period beginning 
January 1, 1997 to develop, produce, and/or market encryption items and 
services with recoverable features. Manufacturers would commit to 
produce key recovery products. Others would commit to incorporate such 
products into their own products or services. Such efforts can include: 
the scale of key recovery research and development, product development, 
and marketing plans; significant steps to reflect potential customer 
demand for key recovery products in the firm's encryption-related 
business; and how soon a key recovery agent will be identified. Note 
that BXA will accept requests for classification of non-recoverable 
encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength 
under this paragraph from distributors, re-sellers, integrators, and 
other entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items. The 
use of License Exception KMI is not automatic; eligibility must be 
renewed every six months. Renewal after each six-month period will 
depend on the applicant's adherence to explicit benchmarks and 
milestones as set forth in the plan approved with the initial license 
classification and amendments as approved by BXA. This relaxation of 
controls and use of License Exception KMI will last through December 31, 
1998. The plan submitted with classifications for the export of non-
recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent 
strength must include the elements in Supplement No. 7 to part 742.
    (ii) BXA will make a determination on such classification requests 
within 15 days of receipt. Exports and reexports of non-recoverable 
encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength will 
be authorized under the provisions of License Exception KMI, contingent 
upon BXA's review and approval of a satisfactory progress report related 
to the ongoing plan submitted by the applicant. The applicant must 
submit a letter to BXA every six months requesting approval of the 
progress report. Note that distributors, re-sellers, integrators, or 
other entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items are 
permitted to use License Exception KMI for exports and reexports of such 
items only in instances where a classification has been granted to the 
manufacturer of the encryption items or a classification has been 
granted to the distributors, re-sellers, integrators, or other entities. 
The authority to so export or reexport will be for a time period ending 
on the same day the producer's authority to export or reexport ends.
    (4) All other encryption items--(i) Encryption licensing 
arrangement. Applicants may submit license applications for exports and 
reexports of certain encryption commodities and software in unlimited 
quantities for all destinations except, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,

[[Page 223]]

North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will be reviewed on a case-
by-case basis. Encryption licensing arrangements may be approved with 
extended validity periods specified by the applicant in block #24 on 
Form BXA-748P. In addition, the applicant must specify the sales 
territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may require the 
license holder to report to BXA certain information such as item 
description, quantity, value, and end-user name and address.
    (ii) Applications for encryption items not authorized under an 
encryption licensing arrangement. Applications for the export and 
reexport of all other encryption items will be considered on a case-by-
case basis.
    (5) Applications for encryption technology. Applications for the 
export and reexport of encryption technology will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not 
available for license applications reviewed under this section.

Supplement No. 2 to Part 742--Anti-Terrorism Controls; Iran, Syria, and 
           Sudan Contract Sanctity Dates and Related Policies

    Note: Exports and reexports of items in performance of contracts 
entered into before the applicable contract sanctity date(s) will be 
eligible for review on a case-by-case basis or other applicable 
licensing policies that were in effect prior to the contract sanctity 
date. The contract sanctity dates set forth in this supplement are for 
the guidance of exporters. Contract sanctity dates are established in 
the course of the imposition of foreign policy controls on specific 
items and are the relevant dates for the purpose of licensing 
determinations involving such items. If you believe that a specific 
contract sanctity date is applicable to your transaction, you should 
include all relevant information with your license application. BXA will 
determine any applicable contract sanctity date at the time an 
application with relevant supporting documents is submitted.

    (a) Terrorist-supporting countries. The Secretary of State has 
designated Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria as 
countries whose governments have repeatedly provided support for acts of 
international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export Administration 
Act (EAA).
    (b) Items controlled under EAA sections 6(j) and 6(a). Whenever the 
Secretary of State determines that an export or reexport to any of these 
countries could make a significant contribution to the military 
potential of such country, including its military logistics capability, 
or could enhance the ability of such country to support acts of 
international terrorism, the item is subject to mandatory control under 
section EAA 6(j) and the Secretaries of Commerce and State are required 
to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before a 
license for such an item may be issued.
    (1) On December 28, 1993, the Secretary of State determined that the 
export to Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan or Syria of items 
described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this supplement, if 
destined to military, police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users, 
are controlled under EAA section 6(j). Therefore, the 30-day advance 
Congressional notification requirement applies to the export or reexport 
of these items to sensitive end-users in any of these countries.
    (2) License applications for items controlled to designated 
terrorist-supporting countries under EAA section 6(a) will also be 
reviewed to determine whether the Congressional notification 
requirements of EAA section 6(j) apply.
    (3) Items controlled for anti-terrorism reasons under section 6(a) 
to Iran, Sudan and Syria are:
    (i) items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) to non-
sensitive end-users, and
    (ii) the following items to all end-users: for Iran, items in 
paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(39) of this supplement; for Sudan, items 
in paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(14), and (c)(16) through (c)(39) of 
this supplement; for Syria, items in paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(8), 
(c)(10) through (c)(14), (c)(16) through (c)(19), and (c)(22) through 
(c)(39) of this supplement.
    (c) The license requirements and licensing policies for items 
controlled for anti-terrorism reasons to Iran, Syria and Sudan are 
generally described in Secs. 742.8, 742.9 and 742.10 of this part. This 
supplement provides guidance on licensing policies for Syria and Sudan 
and related contract sanctity dates that may be available for 
transactions benefitting from pre-existing contracts involving Syria and 
Sudan. This supplement also provides information on licensing policies 
and contract sanctity dates for Iran. Exporters are advised that the 
Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control administers a 
comprehensive trade and investment embargo against Iran (See Executive 
Orders 12957 and 12959 of March 15, 1995 and May 6, 1995, respectively.) 
Exporters are further advised that exports and reexports to Iran of 
items that are listed on the CCL as requiring a license for national 
security or foreign policy reasons are subject to a policy of denial 
under the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of October 23, 1992 (50 
U.S.C. 1701 note (1994)). Transactions involving Iran and benefitting 
from a contract that pre-dates October 23, 1992 may be considered under 
the applicable licensing policy in effect prior to that date.

  Supplement No. 3 to Part 742--High Performance Computers; Safeguard 
                   Conditions and Related Information

    This supplement sets forth the security conditions and safeguard 
plans for the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of high 
performance computers that may be imposed

[[Page 234]]

by BXA to certain destinations. The licensing policies for the export, 
reexport, or in-country transfer of high performance computers are set 
forth in Sec. 742.12 of this part.
    (a) Safeguard conditions. Following interagency review of the 
application, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) will instruct the 
exporter to submit a safeguard plan signed by the ultimate consignee and 
certified by the export control authorities of the importing country 
(see Certification by export control authorities of importing country in 
this supplement). The safeguard plan must indicate that the ultimate 
consignee agrees to implement those safeguards required by the BXA as a 
condition of issuing the license. BXA will inform exporters concerning 
which of the following safeguards will be imposed as license conditions:
    (1) The applicant will assume responsibility for providing adequate 
security against physical diversion of the computer during shipment 
(e.g., delivery by either attended or monitored shipment, using the most 
secure route possible--this precludes using the services or facilities 
of any country in Computer Tier 4).
    (2) There will be no reexport or intra-country transfer of the 
computer without prior written authorization from BXA.
    (3) The computer systems will be used only for those activities 
approved on the license or reexport authorization.
    (4) There will be no changes either in the end-users or the end-uses 
indicated on the license without prior written authorization by BXA.
    (5) Only software that supports the approved end-uses will be 
shipped with the computer system.
    (6) The end-user will station security personnel at the computer 
using facility to ensure that the appropriate security measures are 
implemented.
    (7) The exporter will station representatives at the computer using 
facility, or make such individuals readily available, to guide the 
security personnel in the implementation and operation of the security 
measures.
    (8) The security personnel will undertake the following measures 
under the guidance of the exporter's representatives:
    (i) The physical security of the computer using facility;
    (ii) The establishment of a system to ensure the round-the-clock 
supervision of computer security;
    (iii) The inspection, if necessary, of any program or software to be 
run on the computer system in order to ensure that all usage conforms to 
the conditions of the license;
    (iv) The suspension, if necessary, of any run in progress and the 
inspection of any output generated by the computer to determine whether 
the program runs or output conform with the conditions of the license;
    (v) The inspection of usage logs daily to ensure conformity with the 
conditions of the license and the retention of records of these logs for 
at least a year;
    (vi) The determination of the acceptability of computer users to 
ensure conformity with the conditions of the license;
    (vii) The immediate reporting of any security breaches or suspected 
security breaches to the government of the importing country and to the 
exporter's representatives;
    (viii) The execution of the following key tasks:
    (A) Establishment of new accounts;
    (B) Assignment of passwords;
    (C) Random sampling of data;
    (D) Generation of daily logs;
    (ix) The maintenance of the integrity and security of tapes and data 
files containing archived user files, log data, or system backups.
    (9) The exporter's representatives will be present when certain key 
functions are being carried out (e.g., the establishment of new 
accounts, the assignment of passwords, the random sampling of data, the 
generating of daily logs, the setting of limits to computer resources 
available to users in the development mode, the certification of 
programs for conformity to the approved end-uses before they are allowed 
to run in the production mode, and the modification to previously 
certified production programs).
    (10) The security personnel and the exporter's representatives will 
provide monthly reports on the usage of the computer system and on the 
implementation of the safeguards.
    (11) The computer system will be housed in one secure building and 
protected against theft and unauthorized entry at all times.
    (12) Restricted nationals, i.e., nationals of Computer Tier 4 
countries, will not be allowed access to computers:
    (i) No physical or computational access to computers may be granted 
to restricted nationals without prior written authorization from BXA, 
except that commercial consignees as described in this supplement are 
prohibited only from giving such nationals user-accessible 
programmability without prior written authorization;
    (ii) No passwords or IDs may be issued to restricted nationals;
    (iii) No work may be performed on the computer on behalf of 
restricted nationals; and
    (iv) No conscious or direct ties may be established to networks 
(including their subscribers) operated by restricted nationals.
    (13) Physical access to the computer, the operator consoles, and 
sensitive storage areas of the computer using facility will be 
controlled by the security personnel, under the guidance and monitoring 
of the exporter's representatives, and will be limited to

[[Page 235]]

the fewest number of people needed to maintain and run the computer 
system.
    (14) The computer will be equipped with the necessary software to: 
Permit access to authorized persons only, detect attempts to gain 
unauthorized access, set and maintain limits on usage, establish 
accountability for usage, and generate logs and other records of usage. 
This software will also maintain the integrity of data and program 
files, the accounting and audit system, the password or computational 
access control system, and the operating system itself.
    (i) The operating system will be configured so that all jobs can be 
designated and tracked as either program development jobs or as 
production jobs.
    (ii) In the program development mode, users will be free, following 
verification that their application conforms to the agreed end-use, to 
create, edit, or modify programs, to use utilities such as editors, 
debuggers, or compilers and to verify program operation. Programs in the 
development mode will be subject to inspection as provided by paragraph 
(a)(8)(iii) of this supplement.
    (iii) In the production mode, users will have access to the full 
range of computer resources, but will be prohibited from modifying any 
program or using utilities that could modify any program. Before being 
allowed to run in the production mode, a program will have to be 
certified for conformity to approved end-uses by the security personnel 
and the exporter's representatives.
    (iv) Programs certified for execution in the production mode will be 
protected from unauthorized modification by appropriate software and 
physical security measures. Any modifications to previously certified 
production programs will be approved by the security personnel under the 
guidance and monitoring of the exporter's representatives.
    (v) The computer will be provided with accounting and audit software 
to ensure that detailed logs are maintained to record all computer 
usage. A separate log of security-related events will also be kept.
    (vi) For each job executed in the production mode, the operating 
system will record execution characteristics in order to permit 
generation of a statistical profile of the program executed.
    (15) The source code of the operating system will be accessible only 
to the exporter's representatives. Only those individuals will make 
changes in this source code.
    (16) The security personnel, under the guidance of the exporter's 
representatives, will change passwords for individuals frequently and at 
unpredictable intervals.
    (17) The security personnel, under the guidance of the exporter's 
representatives, will have the right to deny passwords to anyone. 
Passwords will be denied to anyone whose activity does not conform to 
the conditions of the license.
    (18) Misuse of passwords by users will result in denial of further 
access to the computer.
    (19) The exporter's representatives will install a strict password 
system and provide guidance on its implementation.
    (20) Only the exporter's representatives will be trained in making 
changes in the password system and only they will make such changes.
    (21) No computer will be networked to other computers outside the 
computer center without prior authorization from BXA.
    (22) Generally, remote terminals will not be allowed outside the 
computer using facility without prior authorization by BXA. If remote 
terminals are specifically authorized by the license:
    (i) The terminals will have physical security equivalent to the 
safeguards at the computer using facility;
    (ii) The terminals will be constrained to minimal amounts of 
computer resources (CPU time, memory access, number of input-output 
operations, and other resources);
    (iii) The terminals will not be allowed direct computational access 
to the computer (i.e., the security personnel, under the guidance of the 
exporter's representatives, will validate the password and identity of 
the user of any remote terminals before any such user is permitted to 
access the computer); all terminals will be connected to the computer 
system by a dedicated access line and a network access controller.
    (23) There will be no direct input to the computer from remote 
terminals. Any data originating from outside the computer using 
facility, except for direct input from terminals within the same 
compound as the computer using facility, will first be processed by a 
separate processor or network access controller in order to permit 
examination of the data prior to its entry into the computer.
    (24) The exporter will perform all maintenance of the computer 
system.
    (25) Spare parts kept on site will be limited to the minimum amount. 
Spares will be kept in an area accessible only to the exporter's 
representatives. These representatives will maintain a strict audit 
system to account for all spare parts.
    (26) No development or production technology on the computer system 
will be sent with the computer to the ultimate consignee.
    (27) The end-user must immediately report any suspicions or facts 
concerning possible violations of the safeguards to the exporter and to 
the export control authorities of the importing country.
    (28) The exporter must immediately report any information concerning 
possible violations of the safeguards to BXA. A violation of the 
safeguards might constitute grounds for suspension or termination of the 
license, preventing the shipment of unshipped spare

[[Page 236]]

parts, or the denial of additional licenses for spare parts, etc.
    (29) The end-user will be audited quarterly by an independent 
consultant who has been approved by the export control authorities of 
the importing and exporting countries, but is employed at the expense of 
the end-user. The consultant will audit the computer usage and the 
implementation of the safeguards.
    (30) The installation and operation of the computer will be 
coordinated and controlled by the following management structure:
    (i) Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will comprise 
nationals of the importing country who will oversee the management and 
operation of the computer.
    (ii) Security Staff. The Security Staff will be selected by the end-
user or the government of the importing country to ensure that the 
required safeguards are implemented. This staff will be responsible for 
conducting an annual audit to evaluate physical security, administrative 
procedures, and technical controls.
    (iii) Technical Consultative Committee. This committee will comprise 
technical experts from the importing country and the exporting company 
who will provide guidance in operating and maintaining the computer. At 
least one member of the committee will be an employee of the exporter. 
The committee will approve all accounts and maintain an accurate list of 
all users. In addition, the committee will advise the Steering Committee 
and the Security Staff concerning the security measures needed to ensure 
compliance with the safeguards required by the license.
    (31) An ultimate consignee who is a multiple-purpose end-user, such 
as a university, will establish a peer review group comprising experts 
who represent each department or application area authorized for use on 
the computer under the conditions of the license. This group shall have 
the following responsibilities:
    (i) Review all requests for computer usage and make recommendations 
concerning the acceptability of all projects and users;
    (ii) Submit these recommendations to the Security Staff and 
Technical Consultative Committee for review and approval (see paragraph 
(a)(28) of this supplement);
    (iii) Establish acceptable computer resource parameters for each 
project and review the results to verify their conformity with the 
authorized end-uses, restrictions, and parameters; and
    (iv) Prepare monthly reports that would include a description of any 
runs exceeding the established parameters and submit them to the 
security staff.
    (32) The end-user will also cooperate with any post-shipment 
inquiries or inspections by the U.S. Government or exporting company 
officials to verify the disposition and/or use of the computer, 
including access to the following:
    (i) Usage logs, which should include, at a minimum, computer users, 
dates, times of use, and amount of system time used;
    (ii) Computer access authorization logs, which should include, at a 
minimum, computer users, project names, and purpose of projects.
    (33) The end-user will also cooperate with the U.S. Government or 
exporting company officials concerning the physical inspection of the 
computer using facility, on short notice, at least once a year and will 
provide access to all data relevant to computer usage. This inspection 
will include:
    (i) Analyzing any programs or software run on the computer to ensure 
that all usage complies with the authorized end-uses on the license. 
This will be done by examining user files (e.g., source codes, machine 
codes, input/output data) that are either on-line at the time of the 
inspection or that have been previously sampled and securely stored.
    (ii) Checking current and archived usage logs for conformity with 
the authorized end-uses and the restrictions imposed by the license.
    (iii) Verifying the acceptability of all computer users in 
conformity with the authorized end-uses and the restrictions imposed by 
the license.
    (34) Usage requests that exceed the quantity of monthly CPU time 
specified on the license shall not be approved without prior written 
authorization from the BXA. Requests for computational access approval 
shall include a description of the intended purpose for which access is 
sought.
    (35) In addition to, or in lieu of, the normal access by on-site 
exporting company staff or its representatives, the company, when 
required by the exporting government, will provide a separate remote 
electronic access capability to the computer for the purposes of 
maintenance, troubleshooting, inspection of work in progress, and 
auditing of all work performed on the computer. On-site and central 
exporting company hardware and software maintenance facilities, at the 
direction of the exporting company staff or its representatives, to 
gather information such as:
    (i) Statistical profiles of production jobs;
    (ii) Logs of jobs run in both production and development mode;
    (iii) Logs and reports of security related events.
    If such method is used, the remote maintenance facilities will be 
considered part of the operating system and protected accordingly, and 
will be available only to exporting company operational staff or its 
representatives. The maintenance hardware and software and associated 
communication links will be protected to ensure the integrity and 
authenticity of data and programs and to prevent tampering with 
hardware.

[[Page 237]]

    (36) The export company staff or its representatives will be 
required to provide personnel for a specified period of time at the 
computer facility for management, operation, and safeguarding of the 
computer.
    (b) Certification by export control authorities of importing 
country. (1) The following importing government certification may be 
required under Sec. 742.12 of this part:

    This is to certify that (name of ultimate consignee) has declared to 
(name of appropriate foreign government agency) that the computer (model 
name) will be used only for the purposes specified in the end-use 
statement and that the ultimate consignee will establish and adhere to 
all the safeguard conditions and perform all other undertakings 
described in the end-use statement.
    The (name of appropriate foreign government agency) will advise the 
United States Government of any evidence that might reasonably indicate 
the existence of circumstances (e.g., transfer of ownership) that could 
affect the objectives of the security safeguard conditions.

    (2) Other importing government assurances regarding prohibited 
activities may also be required on a case-by-case basis.
    (c) Commercial consignees. Exports or reexports of computers that 
are solely dedicated to the following non-scientific and non-technical 
commercial business uses will usually be eligible for a reduced set of 
security safeguard conditions:
    (1) Financial services (e.g., banking, securities and commodity 
exchanges);
    (2) Insurance;
    (3) Reservation systems;
    (4) Point-of-sales systems;
    (5) Mailing list maintenance for marketing purposes;
    (6) Inventory control for retail/wholesale distribution.

   Supplement No. 4 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery Products 
                                Criteria

                          Key Recovery Feature

    (1) The key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt 
ciphertext shall be accessible through a key recovery feature.
    (2) The product's cryptographic functions shall be inoperable until 
the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext 
is recoverable by government officials under proper legal authority and 
without the cooperation or knowledge of the user.
    (3) The output of the product shall automatically include, in an 
accessible format and with a reasonable frequency, the identity of the 
key recovery agent(s) and information sufficient for the key recovery 
agent(s) to identify the key(s) or other material/information required 
to decrypt the ciphertext.
    (4) The product's key recovery functions shall allow access to the 
key(s) or other material/information needed to decrypt the ciphertext 
regardless of whether the product generated or received the ciphertext.
    (5) The product's key recovery functions shall allow for the 
recovery of all required decryption key(s) or other material/information 
required to decrypt ciphertext during a period of authorized access 
without requiring repeated presentations of access authorization to the 
key recovery agent(s).

                        Interoperability Feature

    (6) The product's cryptographic functions may interoperate with:
    (i) Other key recovery products that meet these criteria, and shall 
not interoperate with products whose key recovery feature has been 
altered, bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered inoperative; and
    (ii) Non-key recovery products only when the key recovery product 
permits access to the key(s) or other material/information needed to 
decrypt ciphertext generated or received (i.e., one direction at a 
minimum) by the key recovery product.

            Design, Implementation and Operational Assurance

    (7) The product shall be resistant to efforts to disable or 
circumvent the attributes described in criteria one through six.

recovery agent(s) (who may be a key recovery agent(s) internal to the 
user's organization) acceptable to BXA, pursuant to the criteria in 
Supplement No. 5 to part 742. Since the establishment of a key 
management infrastructure and key recovery agents may take some time, 
BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, consider exports of 
key recovery encryption products which facilitate establishment of the 
key management infrastructure before a key recovery agent is named.
    Exporters of products described in this Supplement No. 4 to part 742 
are required to furnish the name of an agent by December 31, 1998.

Supplement No. 5 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Criteria, 
      Security Policies, and Key Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures

 Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Requirements; Security Policies; Key 
                    Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures

    This supplement sets forth criteria that the Department of Commerce 
will use to approve key recovery agents to support approval of the 
export or reexport of key recovery encryption items controlled for EI 
reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Any arrangements between the 
exporter or reexporter and the key recovery agent must reflect the 
provisions contained in this supplement in a manner satisfactory to BXA, 
in conjunction with other agencies. This supplement outlines the 
criteria for employing key recovery agent personnel for key recovery 
procedures. An applicant for eligibility to export or reexport key 
recovery items shall provide, or cause the proposed key recovery agent 
to provide, to BXA sufficient information concerning any proposed key 
recovery agent arrangements to permit BXA's evaluation of the key 
recovery agent's security policies, key recovery procedures, and 
suitability and trustworthiness to maintain the confidentiality of the 
key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext. The 
key recovery agent, who must be approved by BXA, may be the applicant 
for the classification request. When there is no key recovery agent 
involved, or the customer will self-escrow abroad, with or without a 
legal obligation to the exporter, the customer must be approved by BXA. 
BXA retains the right, in addition to any other remedies, to revoke 
eligibility for License Exception KMI if BXA determines that a key 
recovery agent no longer meets these criteria. The requirements related 
to the suitability and trustworthiness, security policies, and key 
recovery procedures of the key recovery agent shall be made terms and 
conditions of the License Exception for key recovery items. BXA shall 
require the key recovery agent to provide a representation that it will 
comply with such terms and conditions.

    Note: Use of key recovery agents located outside the U.S. is 
permitted if acceptable to BXA in consultation with the host government, 
as appropriate.

                   I. Key Recovery Agent Requirements

    (1)(a) A key recovery agent must identify by name, date and place of 
birth, and social security number, individual(s) who:
    (i) Is/are directly involved in the escrowing of key(s) or other 
material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or
    (ii) Have access to key(s) or other material/information required to 
decrypt ciphertext, or
    (iii) Have access to information concerning requests for key(s) or 
other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or
    (iv) Respond to requests for key(s) or other material/information 
required to decrypt ciphertext; or
    (v) Is/are in control of the key recovery agent and have access or 
authority to obtain key(s) or other material/information required to 
decrypt ciphertext, and
    (b) Must certify that such individual(s) meet the requirements of 
the following paragraphs (b)(i) or (b)(ii). BXA reserves the right to 
determine at any time the suitability and trustworthiness of such 
individual(s). Evidence of an individual's suitability and 
trustworthiness shall include:
    (i) Information indicating that the individual(s):
    (A) Has no criminal convictions of any kind or pending criminal 
charges of any kind;
    (B) Has not breached fiduciary responsibilities (e.g., has not 
violated any surety or performance bonds); and
    (C) Has favorable results of a credit check; or,
    (ii) Information that the individual(s) has an active U.S. 
government security clearance of Secret or higher issued or updated 
within the last five years.
    (2) The key recovery agent shall timely disclose to BXA when an 
individual no longer meets the requirements of paragraphs I.(1)(b)(i) or 
(ii).
    (3) A key recovery agent must, to remain eligible for License 
Exception KMI, identify to BXA by name, date and place of birth, and 
social security number any new individual(s) who will assume the 
responsibilities set forth in paragraph I.(1)(a) of this supplement. 
Before that individual(s) assumes such responsibilities, the key 
recovery agent must certify to BXA that the individual(s) meets the 
criteria set forth in subparagraphs I.(1)(b)(i) or (b)(ii) of this 
supplement. BXA reserves the right to determine at any time the 
suitability and trustworthiness of such personnel.
    (4) If ownership or control of a key recovery agent is transferred, 
no export may take place under previously issued approvals until the 
successor key recovery agent complies with the criteria of this 
supplement.
    (5) Key recovery agents shall submit suitable evidence of the key 
recovery agent's corporate viability and financial responsibility (e.g., 
a certificate of good standing from the state of incorporation, credit 
reports, and errors/omissions insurance).
    (6) Key recovery agents shall disclose to BXA any of the following 
which have occurred within the ten years prior to the application:

[[Page 239]]

    (a) Federal or state felony convictions of the business;
    (b) Material adverse civil fraud judgments or settlements; and
    (c) Debarments from federal, state, or local government contracting.
    The applicant shall also timely disclose to BXA the occurrence of 
any of the foregoing during the use of License Exception KMI.
    (7) Key recovery agent(s) shall designate an individual(s) to be the 
security and operations officer(s).
    (8) A key recovery agent may be internal to a user's organization 
and may consist of one or more individuals. BXA may approve such key 
recovery agents if sufficient information is provided to demonstrate 
that appropriate safeguards will be employed in handling key recovery 
requests from government entities. These safeguards should ensure: the 
key recovery agent's structural independence from the rest of the 
organization; security; and confidentiality.

                          II. Security Policies

    (1) Key recovery agents must implement security policies that assure 
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the key(s) or other 
material/information required for decryption of the ciphertext.
    (a) Procedures to assure confidentiality shall include:
    (i) Encrypting all key(s) or other material/information required to 
decrypt ciphertext while in storage, transmission, or transfer; or
    (ii) Applying reasonable measures to limit access to the database 
(e.g. using keyed or combination locks on the entrances to escrow 
facilities and limiting the personnel with knowledge of or access to the 
keys/combinations).
    (b) Procedures to assure the integrity of the database (i.e. 
assuring the key(s) and other material/information required to decrypt 
ciphertext are protected against unauthorized changes) shall include the 
use of access controls such as database password controls, digital 
signatures, system auditing, and physical access restrictions.
    (c) Procedures to assure the availability of the database (i.e. 
assuring that key(s) and other material/information required to decrypt 
ciphertext are retrievable at any time) shall include system redundance, 
physical security, and the use of cryptography to control access.
    (2) Policies and procedures shall be designed and operated so that a 
failure by a single person, procedure, or mechanism does not compromise 
the confidentiality, integrity and availability of key(s)or other 
material/information required to decrypt ciphertext. Security policies 
and procedures may include, but are not limited to, multi-person control 
of access to recoverable keys, split keys, and back-up capabilities.
    (3) Key recovery agents shall implement policies that protect 
against unauthorized disclosure of information regarding whose 
encryption material is stored, the fact that key(s) or other material/
information required to decrypt ciphertext was requested or provided, 
and the identity of a requester. Procedures to assure the 
confidentiality of this information shall include those described in 
paragraph II.(1)(a) of this supplement.
    (4) Key recovery agents shall provide to BXA prompt notice of a 
compromise of a security policy or of the confidentiality of key(s) or 
other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext.

                      III. Key Recovery Procedures

    (1) Key recovery agents shall maintain the ability to make the 
key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext 
available until notified otherwise by BXA. Key recovery agents shall 
make requested key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt 
ciphertext available, to the extent required by the request, within two 
hours from the time they receive a request from a government agency 
acting under appropriate legal authority.
    (2) Key recovery agents shall maintain data regarding key recovery 
requests received, release of key(s) or other material/information 
required to decrypt ciphertext, database changes, system administration 
access, and dates of such events for purposes of audits by BXA.
    (3) The key recovery agent must transfer all key recovery equipment, 
key(s) and/or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, 
key recovery database, and all administrative information necessary to 
its key recovery operations to another key recovery agent approved by 
BXA in the event that:
    (a) The key recovery agent dissolves or otherwise terminates 
escrowing operations, or
    (b) BXA determines that there is a risk of such dissolution or 
termination, or
    (c) BXA determines that the key recovery agent is no longer suitable 
or trustworthy.

Sec. 744.1  General provisions.

    (a) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are references 
to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part contains prohibitions 
against exports, reexports, and selected transfers to certain end-users 
and end-uses as introduced under General Prohibition Four (Denial 
Orders) and prohibitions against exports or reexports to certain end-
uses as introduced, under General Prohibition Five (End-use/End-users). 
Sections 744.2, 744.3, 744.4, and 744.5 prohibit exports and reexports 
of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear, missile, chemical and 
biological weapons, and nuclear maritime end-uses. Section 744.6 
prohibits certain activities by U.S. persons in support of certain 
nuclear, missile, chemical, or biological end-uses regardless of whether 
that support involves the export or reexport of items subject to the 
EAR. Sections 744.7 and 744.8 prohibit exports and reexports of certain 
items for certain aircraft and vessels. In addition, these sections 
include license review standards for export license applications 
submitted as required by these sections. It should also be noted that 
part 764 of the EAR prohibits exports, reexports and certain in-country 
transfers of items subject to the EAR to denied parties.
    (b) Steps. The following are steps you should follow in using the 
provisions of this part:
    (1) Review end-use and end-user prohibitions. First, review each 
end-use and end-user prohibition described in this part to learn the 
scope of these prohibitions.
    (2) Determine applicability. Second, determine whether any of the 
end-use and end-user prohibitions described in this part are applicable 
to your planned export, reexport, or other activity. See Supplement No. 
1 to part 732 for guidance.
    (c) A list of entities is included in Supplement No. 4 to this part 
744 of the EAR (Entity List). Exporters are hereby informed that these 
entities are ineligible to receive any items subject to the EAR without 
a license to the extent specified in the supplement. License 
applications will be reviewed under the license review standards set 
forth in this part 744. No License Exceptions are available for exports 
or reexports to listed entities of specified items.

<R05>
Sec. 744.2  Restrictions on certain nuclear end-uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements for 
items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport to any 
destination, other than countries in the Supplement No. 3 to this part, 
any item subject to the EAR without a license if at the time of the 
export or reexport you

[[Page 243]]

know <SUP>1</SUP> the item will be used directly or indirectly in any 
one or more of the following activities described in paragraphs (a)(1), 
(a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\  Part 772 of the EAR defines ``knowledge'' for all of the EAR 
except part 760, Restrictive Trade Practices and Boycotts. The 
definition, which includes variants such as ``know'' and ``reason to 
know'', encompasses more than positive knowledge. Thus, the use of 
``know'' in this section in place of the former wording ``know or have 
reason to know'' does not lessen or otherwise change the 
responsibilities of persons subject to the EAR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Nuclear explosive activities. Nuclear explosive activities, 
including research on or development, design, manufacture, construction, 
testing or maintenance of any nuclear explosive device, or components or 
subsystems of such a device.\2\ \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \2\ Nuclear explosive devices and any article, material, equipment, 
or device specifically designed or specially modified for use in the 
design, development, or fabrication of nuclear weapons or nuclear 
explosive devices are subject to export licensing or other requirements 
of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State, or 
the licensing or other restrictions specified in the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended. Similarly, items specifically designed or 
specifically modified for use in devising, carrying out, or evaluating 
nuclear weapons tests or nuclear explosions (except such items as are in 
normal commercial use for other purposes) are subject to the same 
requirements.
    \3\ Also see Secs. 744.5 and 748.4 of the EAR for special provisions 
relating to technical data for maritime nuclear propulsion plants and 
other commodities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Activities including research 
on, or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation, or 
maintenance of any nuclear reactor, critical facility, facility for the 
fabrication of nuclear fuel, facility for the conversion of nuclear 
material from one chemical form to another, or separate storage 
installation, where there is no obligation to accept International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards at the relevant facility or 
installation when it contains any source or special fissionable material 
(regardless of whether or not it contains such material at the time of 
export), or where any such obligation is not met.
    (3) Safeguarded and unsafeguarded nuclear activities. Safeguarded 
and unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activities, including research on 
or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation or 
maintenance of any of the following facilities, or components for such 
facilities: \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \4\  Such activities may also require a specific authorization from 
the Secretary of Energy pursuant to Sec. 57.b.(2) of the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, as amended, as implemented by the Department of Energy's 
regulations published in 10 CFR 810.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Facilities for the chemical processing of irradiated special 
nuclear or source material;
    (ii) Facilities for the production of heavy water;
    (iii) Facilities for the separation of isotopes of source and 
special nuclear material; or
    (iv) Facilities for the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel 
containing plutonium.
    (b) Additional prohibition on exporters or reexporters informed by 
BXA. BXA may inform an exporter or reexporter, either individually by 
specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is 
required for export or reexport of specified items to specified end-
users, because BXA has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of 
use in, or diversion to, any of the activities described in paragraph 
(a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the 
direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. 
When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written 
notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does not 
excuse the exporter or reexporter from compliance with the license 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Exceptions. Despite the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section, you may export technology subject to the EAR 
under the operation technology and software or sales technology and 
software provisions of License Exception TSU (see Sec. 740.13 (a) and 
(b)), but only to and for use in countries listed in Country Group A:1 
(see Supplement No. 1 to

[[Page 244]]

part 740 of the EAR), Iceland and New Zealand. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of part 740 of the EAR, the provisions of Sec. 740.13 (a) and 
(b) will only overcome general prohibition five for countries listed in 
Country Group A:1, Iceland and New Zealand.
    (d) License review standards. The following factors are among those 
used by the United States to determine whether to grant or deny license 
applications required under this section:
    (1) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be 
transferred are appropriate for the stated end-use and whether that 
stated end-use is appropriate for the end-user;
    (2) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular 
commodity, software, or technology;
    (3) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be exported 
are to be used in research on or for the development, design, 
manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance of any reprocessing 
or enrichment facility;
    (4) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for 
nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;
    (5) Whether the end-user has been engaged in clandestine or illegal 
procurement activities;
    (6) Whether an application for a license to export to the end-user 
has previously been denied, or whether the end-use has previously 
diverted items received under a license, License Exception, or NLR to 
unauthorized activities;
    (7) Whether the export would present an unacceptable risk of 
diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear fuel-
cycle activity described in Sec. 744.2 of this part; and
    (8) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, based 
on consideration of the following factors:
    (i) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition of 
Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) (see Supplement 
No. 2 to part 742 of the EAR), or to a similar international legally-
binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement;
    (ii) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclear 
activities, facilities or installations that are operational, being 
designed, or under construction, under International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards;
    (iii) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil 
uses of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country;
    (iv) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the government 
of the importing country are in support of nuclear nonproliferation and 
whether that government is in compliance with its international 
obligations in the field of nonproliferation;
    (v) The degree to which the government of the importing country 
cooperates in nonproliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness to 
consult on international nonproliferation issues);
    (vi) Intelligence data on the importing country's nuclear intentions 
and activities.

<R05>
Sec. 744.3  Restrictions on certain missile end-uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements for 
items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport an item 
subject to the EAR without a license if at the time of the export or 
reexport you know the item:
    (1) Is destined to or for a project listed in the footnote to 
Country Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (2) Will be used in the design, development, production or use of 
missiles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4, whether or not 
that use involves a listed project.
    (b) Additional prohibition on exporters informed by BXA. BXA may 
inform the exporter or reexporter, either individually by specific 
notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for a 
specific export or reexport, or for exports or reexports of specified 
items to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk of 
use in or diversion to activities described in paragraph (a) of this 
section,

[[Page 245]]

anywhere in the world. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the 
direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. 
When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written 
notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Export Administration. However, the absence of any such notification 
does not excuse the exporter from compliance with the license 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. An illustrative list of 
projects is included in a footnote to Country Group D:4. Exporters and 
reexporters are deemed to have been informed that an individual license 
is required to export or reexport to these projects. Exporters should be 
aware that the list of projects in Country Group D:4 is not 
comprehensive; extra caution should be exercised when making any 
shipments to a country listed in Country Group D:4.
    (c) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions 
described in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) License review standards for certain missile end-uses. (1) 
Applications to export the items subject to this section will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export would 
make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. When an 
export is deemed to make a material contribution, the license will be 
denied.
    (2) The following factors are among those that will be considered to 
determine what action should be taken on an application required by this 
section:
    (i) The specific nature of the end-use;
    (ii) The significance of the export in terms of its contribution to 
the design, development, production, or use of missiles;
    (iii) The capabilities and objectives of the missile and space 
programs of the recipient country;
    (iv) The non-proliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (v) The types of assurances or guarantees against design, 
development, production or use for missiles delivery purposes that are 
given in a particular case; and
    (vi) The existence of a pre-existing contract.

by a country listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 
740 of the EAR).
    (b) Additional prohibition on exporters informed by BXA. BXA may 
inform the exporter or reexporter, either individually by specific 
notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for a 
specific export or reexport, or for export or reexport of specified 
items to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk of 
use in or diversion to such activities, anywhere in the world. Specific 
notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is 
provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two 
working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export 
Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not 
excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions 
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) License review standards. (1) Applications to export or reexport 
items subject to this section will be considered on a case-by-case basis

Sec. 744.5  Restrictions on certain maritime nuclear propulsion end-uses.

    (a) General prohibition. In addition to the license requirements for 
items specified on the CCL, you may not export or reexport certain 
technology subject to the EAR without a license if at the time of the 
export or reexport you know the item is for use in connection with a 
foreign maritime nuclear propulsion project. This prohibition applies to 
any technology relating to maritime nuclear propulsion plants, their 
land prototypes, and special facilities for their construction, support, 
or maintenance, including any machinery, devices, components, or 
equipment specifically developed or designed for use in such plants or 
facilities.
    (b) Exceptions. The exceptions provided in part 740 of the EAR do 
not apply to the prohibitions described in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) License review standards. It is the policy of the United States 
Government not to participate in and not to authorize United States 
firms or individuals to participate in foreign naval nuclear propulsion 
plant projects, except under an Agreement for Cooperation on naval 
nuclear propulsion executed in accordance with Sec. 123(d) of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954. However, it is the policy of the United States 
Government to encourage United States firms and individuals to 
participate in maritime (civil) nuclear propulsion plant projects in 
friendly foreign countries provided that United States naval nuclear 
propulsion information is not disclosed.

<R05>
Sec. 744.6  Restrictions on certain activities of U.S. persons.

    (a) General prohibitions--(1) Activities related to exports. (i) No 
U.S. person as defined in paragraph (c) of this section may, without a 
license from BXA, export, reexport, or transfer to or in any country any 
item where that person knows that such items:
    (A) Will be used in the design, development, production, or use of 
nuclear explosive devices in or by a country listed in Country Group D:2 
(see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (B) Will be used in the design, development, production, or use of 
missiles in or by a country listed in Country Group D:4 (see Supplement 
No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (C) Will be used in the design, development, production, 
stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons in or by a country 
listed in Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR).
    (ii) No U.S. person shall, without a license from BXA, knowingly 
support an export, reexport, or transfer that does not have a license as 
required by this section. Support means any action, including financing, 
transportation, and freight forwarding, by which a person facilitates an 
export, reexport, or transfer without being the actual exporter or 
reexporter.
    (2) Other activities unrelated to exports. No U.S. person shall, 
without a license from BXA:
    (i) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S. 
person knows will directly assist in the design, development, 
production, or use of missiles in or by a country listed in Country 
Group D:4 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or
    (ii) Perform any contract, service, or employment that the U.S. 
person knows directly will directly assist in

[[Page 247]]

the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or 
biological weapons in or by a country listed in Country Group D:3 (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (3) Whole plant requirement. No U.S. person shall, without a license 
from BXA, participate in the design, construction, export, or reexport 
of a whole plant to make chemical weapons precursors identified in ECCN 
1C350, in countries other than those listed in Country Group A:3 
(Australia Group) (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (b) Additional prohibitions on U.S. persons informed by BXA. BXA may 
inform U.S. persons, either individually or through amendment to the 
EAR, that a license is required because an activity could involve the 
types of participation and support described in paragraph (a) of this 
section anywhere in the world.
    Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice 
is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two 
working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export 
Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not 
excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the 
term U.S. person includes:
    (1) Any individual who is a citizen of the United States, a 
permanent resident alien of the United States, or a protected individual 
as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3);
    (2) Any juridical person organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States, including foreign 
branches; and
    (3) Any person in the United States.
    (d) Exceptions. No License Exceptions apply to the prohibitions 
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (e) License review standards. Applications to engage in activities 
otherwise prohibited by this section will be denied if the activities 
would make a material contribution to the design, development, 
production, stockpiling, or use of nuclear explosive devices, chemical 
or biological weapons, or of missiles.

Korea or Country Group D:1 (excluding the PRC) (see Supplement No. 1 to 
part 740) or a national of such country;
    (iii) In usual and reasonable kinds and quantities; and
    (iv) Shipped as cargo for which a Shipper's Export Declaration (SED)

manufacture outside the United States of encryption commodities and 
software that, if of United States origin, would be controlled for 
``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5A002 or 5D002. Note that this prohibition 
does not apply if the U.S. person providing the assistance has a license 
or is otherwise entitled to export the encryption commodities and 
software in question to the foreign person(s) receiving the assistance. 
Note in addition that the mere teaching or discussion of information 
about cryptography, including, for example, in an academic setting, by

[[Page 249]]

itself would not establish the intent described in this section, even 
where foreign persons are present.
    (b) Definition of U.S. person. For purposes of this section, the 
term U.S. person includes:
    (1) Any individual who is a citizen or permanent resident alien of

<R05>
Sec. 746.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. This part implements broad based controls for items 
and activities subject to the EAR imposed to implement U.S. government 
policies. Two categories of controls are included in this part.
    (a) Comprehensive controls. This part contains or refers to all the 
BXA licensing requirements, licensing policies, and License Exceptions 
for countries subject to general embargoes, currently Cuba, Libya, North 
Korea, Iran and Iraq. This part is the focal point for all the EAR 
requirements for transactions involving these countries.
    (1) Cuba, Libya, North Korea. All the items on the Commerce Control 
List (CCL) require a license to Cuba, Libya, or North Korea. In 
addition, most other items subject to the EAR, but not included on the 
CCL, designated by the Number ``EAR99'', require a license to Cuba, 
Libya, and North Korea. Most items requiring a license to these 
destinations are subject to a general policy of denial. Because these 
controls extend to virtually all exports, they do not appear in the 
Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR, nor are they reflected in the 
Commerce Control List in part 774 of the EAR.
    (2) Iran and Iraq. While BXA maintains controls on exports and 
reexports to Iran and Iraq, comprehensive embargoes on transactions 
involving these countries are administered by the Department of the 
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
    (b) Rwanda. The second category of controls that apply to Rwanda are 
supplemental to the controls described in the Country Chart in part 738 
of the EAR. Such controls are listed under each affected ECCN on the CCL 
in part 774 of the EAR.
    (c) This part also contains descriptions of controls maintained by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Treasury Department and by 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls in the Department of State. 
Comprehensive embargoes and supplemental controls implemented by BXA 
under the EAR usually also involve controls on items and activities 
maintained by these agencies. This part sets forth the allocation of 
licensing responsibilities between BXA and these other agencies. 
References to the requirements of other agencies are informational; for 
current, complete, and authoritative requirements, you should consult 
the appropriate agency's regulations.
    (d) Supplement No. 1 to this part provides you with general 
information on United Nations sanctions administered by the Department 
of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) (31 CFR part 
590) on UNITA in Angola.
    (e) Supplement No. 2 to this part provides you with general 
information on

[[Page 251]]

United Nations arms embargoes administered by the Department of State 
(22 CFR parts 120 through 130) on all the countries of the former 
Yugoslavia (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Slovenia), Liberia and Somalia.
    (f) Supplement No. 3 to this part provides you with information on 
embargoes on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) 
and certain areas of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina administered by OFAC 
(31 CFR part 585).

Sec. 746.2  Cuba.

    (a) License requirements. As authorized by section 6 of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA) and by the Trading with the 
Enemy Act of 1917, as amended, you will need a license to export or 
reexport all items subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR for the 
scope of items subject to the EAR) to Cuba, except as follows.
    (1) License Exceptions. You may export or reexport without a license 
if your transaction meets all the applicable terms and conditions of any 
of the following License Exceptions. To determine the scope and 
eligibility requirements, you will need to turn to the sections or 
specific paragraphs of part 740 of the EAR (License Exceptions). Read 
each License Exception carefully, as the provisions available for 
embargoed countries are generally narrow.
    (i) Temporary exports and reexports (TMP) by the news media (see 
Sec. 740.9(a)(2)(viii) of the EAR).
    (ii) Operation technology and software (TSU) for legally exported 
commodities (see Sec. 740.13(a) of the EAR).
    (iii) Sales technology (TSU) (see Sec. 740.13(b) of the EAR).
    (iv) Software updates (TSU) for legally exported software (see 
Sec. 740.13(c) of the EAR).
    (v) Parts (RPL) for one-for-one replacement in certain legally 
exported commodities (see Sec. 740.10(a) of the EAR).
    (vi) Baggage (BAG) (see Sec. 740.14 of the EAR).
    (vii) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see 
Sec. 740.11 of the EAR).
    (viii) Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT) (see 
Sec. 740.12 of the EAR).
    (ix) Items in transit (TMP) from Canada through the U.S. (see 
Sec. 740.9(b)(1)(iv) of the EAR).
    (x) Aircraft and vessels (AVS) for certain aircraft on temporary 
sojourn (see Sec. 740.15(a) of the EAR).
    (xi) Permissive reexports of certain spare parts in foreign-made 
equipment (see Sec. 740.16(h) of the EAR).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Licensing policy. Items requiring a license are subject to a 
general policy of denial, except as follows:
    (1) Medicines, medical supplies, instruments and equipment. 
Applications to export medicines, medical supplies, instruments and 
equipment will generally be approved, except:
    (i) To the extent restrictions would be permitted under section 5(m) 
of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA), or section 
203(b)(2) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act;
    (ii) If there is a reasonable likelihood that the item to be 
exported will be used for purposes of torture or other human rights 
abuses;
    (iii) If there is a reasonable likelihood that the item to be 
exported will be reexported;
    (iv) If the item to be exported could be used in the production of 
any biotechnological product; or
    (v) If it is determined that the United States government is unable 
to verify, by on-site inspection or other means, that the item to be 
exported will be used for the purpose for which it was intended and only 
for the use and benefit of the Cuban people, but this exception shall 
not apply to donations of medicines for humanitarian purposes to a 
nongovernmental organization in Cuba.
    (2) Telecommunications commodities may be authorized on a case-by-
case basis, provided the commodities are part of an FCC-approved project 
and are necessary to provide efficient and adequate telecommunications 
services between the United States and Cuba.

[[Page 252]]

    (3) Exports from third countries to Cuba of non-strategic foreign-
made products that contain an insubstantial proportion of U.S.-origin 
materials, parts, or components will generally be considered favorably 
on a case-by-case basis, provided all of the following conditions are 
satisfied:
    (i) The local law requires, or policy favors, trade with Cuba;
    (ii) The U.S.-origin content does not exceed 20 percent of the value 
of the product to be exported from the third country. Requests where the 
U.S.-origin parts, components, or materials represent more than 20 
percent by value of the foreign-made product will generally be denied. 
See Supplement No. 2 to part 734 of the EAR for instructions on how to 
calculate value; and
    (iii) You are not a U.S.-owned or -controlled entity in a third 
country as defined by OFAC regulations, 31 CFR part 515, or you are a 
U.S.-owned or controlled entity in a third country and one or more of 
the following situations applies:
    (A) You have a contract for the proposed export that was entered 
into prior to October 23, 1992.
    (B) Your transaction involves the export of foreign-produced 
medicine, or medical supplies, instruments, or equipment incorporating 
U.S.-origin parts, components or materials, in which case the 
application will be reviewed according to the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (C) Your transaction is for the export of foreign-produced 
telecommunications commodities incorporating U.S.-origin parts, 
components and materials, in which case the application will be reviewed 
under the licensing policy set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (D) Your transaction is for the export of donated food to 
individuals or non-governmental organizations in Cuba and does not 
qualify for the humanitarian License Exception.
    (4) Applications for licenses may be approved, on a case-by-case 
basis, for certain exports to Cuba intended to provide support for the 
Cuban people, as follows:
    (i) Applications for licenses for exports of certain commodities and 
software may be approved to human rights organizations, or to 
individuals and non-governmental organizations that promote independent 
activity intended to strengthen civil society in Cuba when such exports 
do not give rise to U.S. national security or counter-terrorism 
concerns. Examples of such commodities include fax machines, copiers, 
computers (e.g., 486-level/CTP of 24.8 MTOPS or less), business/office 
software, document scanning equipment, printers, typewriters, and other 
office or office communications equipment. Applicants may donate or sell 
the commodities or software to be exported. Reexport to other end-users 
or end-uses is not authorized.
    (ii) Commodities and software may be approved for export to U.S. 
news bureaus in Cuba whose primary purpose is the gathering and 
dissemination of news to the general public. In addition to the examples 
of commodities and software listed in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section, certain telecommunications equipment necessary for the

Sec. 746.3  Iraq.

    (a) License requirements. OFAC administers an embargo against Iraq 
under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
of 1977, as amended, and the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, 
as amended, and in conformance with United Nations Security Council 
Resolutions. The applicable OFAC regulations, the Iraqi Sanctions 
Regulations,

[[Page 253]]

are found in 31 CFR part 575. You should consult with OFAC for 
authorization to export or reexport items subject to U.S. jurisdiction 
to Iraq, or to any entity owned or controlled by, or specially 
designated as acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iraq. Under 
the EAR, you need a license to export or reexport to Iraq any item on 
the CCL containing a CB Column 1, CB Column 2, CB Column 3, NP Column 1, 
NP Column 2, NS Column 1, NS Column 2, MT Column 1, RS Column 1, RS 
Column 2, CC Column 1, CC Column 2, CC Column 3 in the Country Chart

however, to avoid duplication, an authorization from OFAC constitutes 
authorization under the EAR, and no separate BXA authorization is 
necessary. Except as noted in Sec. 746.3(a)(1) of this part, you may not 
use any BXA License Exception or other BXA authorization to export or 
reexport to Iraq.
    (1) License Exceptions. You may export or reexport without a license 
if your transaction meets all the applicable terms and conditions of one 
of the following License Exceptions. Read each License Exception 
carefully, as the provisions available for embargoed countries are 
generally narrow.
    (i) Baggage (BAG) (see Sec. 740.14 of the EAR).
    (ii) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see 
Sec. 740.11 of the EAR).
    (2) Exports for the official use of the United Nations, its 
personnel or agencies (excluding its relief or developmental agencies). 
You must consult with OFAC to determine what transactions are eligible.
    (b) Iraq has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country 
that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism. For anti-terrorism controls, see Supplement 2 to part 742 of 
the EAR.
    (c) Related controls. OFAC maintains controls on the activities of 
U.S. persons, wherever located, involving transactions with Iraq or any 
specially designated Iraqi national, as provided in 31 CFR part 575.

Sec. 746.4  Libya.

    (a) Introduction. The Department of the Treasury and the Department 
of Commerce maintain comprehensive controls on exports and reexports to 
Libya. OFAC maintains comprehensive controls on exports and 
transshipments to Libya under the Libyan Sanctions Regulations (31 CFR 
part 550). To avoid duplicate licensing procedures, OFAC and BXA have 
allocated licensing responsibility as follows: OFAC licenses direct 
exports and transshipments to Libya; BXA licenses reexports, exports of 
foreign-manufactured items containing U.S.-origin parts, components or 
materials, and exports of foreign-produced direct product of U.S. 
technology or software. Issuance of an OFAC license also constitutes 
authorization under the EAR, and no license from BXA is necessary. 
Exports and reexports subject to the EAR that are not subject to the 
Libyan Sanctions Regulations continue to require authorization from BXA.
    (b) License requirements.
    (1) Exports. OFAC and BXA both require a license for virtually all 
exports (including transshipments) to Libya. Except as noted in 
paragraph (b) of this section or specified in OFAC regulation, you may 
not use any BXA License Exception or other BXA authorization to export 
or transship to Libya. You will need a license from OFAC for all direct 
exports and transshipments to Libya except those eligible for the 
following BXA License Exceptions:
    (i) Baggage (BAG) (see Sec. 740.14 of the EAR).
    (ii) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see 
Sec. 740.11 of the EAR).
    (iii) Gift parcels (GFT) (see Sec. 740.12(a) of the EAR).
    (2) Reexports. You will need a license from BXA to reexport any 
U.S.-origin item from a third country to Libya, any foreign-manufactured 
item containing U.S.-origin parts, components or materials, as defined 
in Sec. 734.2(b)(2) of the EAR, or any national security-

[[Page 254]]

controlled foreign-produced direct product of U.S. technology or 
software, as defined in Sec. 734.2(b)(3) of the EAR, exported from the 
U.S. after March 12, 1982. You will need a license from BXA to reexport 
all items subject to the EAR (see part 734 of the EAR) to Libya, except:
    (i) Food, medicines, medical supplies, and agricultural commodities;
    (ii) Reexports eligible for the following License Exceptions (read 
each License Exception carefully, as the provisions available for 
embargoed countries are generally narrow):
    (A) Temporary exports and reexports (TMP): reexports by the news 
media (see Sec. 740.9(a)(2)(viii) of the EAR).
    (B) Operation technology and software (TSU) for legally exported 
commodities (see Sec. 740.13(a) of the EAR).
    (C) Sales technology (TSU) (see Sec. 740.13(b) of the EAR).

Sec. 740.13(c) of the EAR).
    (E) Parts (RPL) for one-for-one replacement in certain legally 
exported commodities (Sec. 740.10(a) of the EAR).
    (F) Baggage (BAG) (Sec. 740.14 of the EAR).
    (G) Aircraft and vessels (AVS) for vessels only (see 
Sec. 740.15(c)(1) of the EAR).
    (H) Governments and international organizations (GOV) (see 
Sec. 740.11 of the EAR).
    (I) Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT) (see Sec. 740.12 
of the EAR).
    (J) Permissive reexports of certain spare parts in foreign-made 
equipment (see Sec. 740.16(h) of the EAR).
    (c) Licensing policy. (1) You should consult with OFAC regarding 
licensing policy for transactions subject to OFAC regulation.
    (2) The licensing policy for BXA controls is as follows. Licenses 
will generally be denied for:
    (i) Items controlled for national security purposes and related 
technology and software, including controlled foreign produced products 
of U.S. technology and software exported from the United States after 
March 12, 1982; and
    (ii) Oil and gas equipment and technology and software, if listed in 
paragraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section, or if determined by BXA not to be 
readily available from sources outside the United States; and
    (iii) Commodities, software, and technology destined for the 
petrochemical processing complex at Ras Lanuf, if listed in paragraph 
(c)(2)(vii) of this section, or where such items would contribute 
directly to the development or construction of that complex (items 
destined for the township at Ras Lanuf, or for the public utilities or 
harbor facilities associated with that township, generally will not be 
regarded as making such a contribution where their functions will be 
primarily related to the township, utilities or harbor);
    (iv) Aircraft (including helicopters) or aircraft parts, components, 
or accessories to Libya or the provision of engineering and maintenance 
servicing of Libyan aircraft or aircraft components;
    (v) Arms and related material of all types, including the sale or

maintenance of Libyan civilian or military airfields and associated 
facilities and equipment or any engineering or other services or 
components destined for the maintenance of any Libyan civil or military 
airfields or associated facilities and equipment, except emergency 
equipment and equipment and services directly related to civilian air 
traffic control; and
    (vii) Items listed in paragraphs (c)(2)(vii) (A) through (E) and 
equipment and supplies for the manufacture or maintenance of such items:

terminals, but which because of its large capacity can be used for this 
purpose, as follows:
    (1) Loading pumps of large capacity (4000 m \3\/h) and small head 
(10 bars);
    (2) Boosting pumps within the same range of flow rates;

    (E) Spare parts for any of the items described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(vii) of this section.
    (3) Notwithstanding the presumptions of denial in paragraphs (c)(2) 
(i) through (iii) of this section, licenses will generally be issued for 
items not included in paragraphs (c)(2) (iv) through (vii) of this 
section when the transaction involves:
    (i) The export or reexport of commodities or technology and software 
under a contract in effect prior to March 12, 1982, where failure to 
obtain a license would not excuse performance under the contract;
    (ii) Reexport of items not controlled for national security purposes 
that had been exported from the United States prior to March 12, 1982 or 
exports of foreign products incorporating such items as components; or
    (iii) Incorporation of U.S.-origin parts, components, or materials 
in foreign-manufactured products destined for Libya, where the U.S.

such items are not included in paragraph (c)(2) (iv) through (vii):
    (i) Reexports of items subject to national security controls that

objectives of the United States; or
    (ii) Items destined for use in the development or construction of 
the petrochemical processing complex at Ras Lanuf, where the transaction

with contractual commitments in effect before March 12, 1982.
    (6) Licenses will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-
case basis for the reexport of reasonable quantities for civil use of 
off-highway wheel tractors of carriage capacity of 9t (10 tons) or more, 
as defined in ECCN 9A992, provided such tractors are not for uses 
described in paragraph (c)(2) (iv) through (vi) of this section.
    (7) All other reexports not covered by United Nations resolutions 
will generally be approved, subject to any other licensing policies 
applicable to a particular transaction.

Sec. 746.7  Iran.

    The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) 
administers a comprehensive trade and investment embargo against Iran 
under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
of 1977, as amended, section 505 of the International Security and 
Development Cooperation Act of 1985, and Executive Orders 12957 and 
12959 of March 15, 1995 and May 6, 1995, respectively. This embargo 
includes prohibitions on export and certain reexport transactions 
involving Iran, including transactions dealing with items subject to the 
EAR. (See OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 560.) BXA 
continues to maintain licensing requirements on exports and reexports to 
Iran under the EAR as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. No 
person may export or reexport items subject to both the EAR and OFAC's 
Iranian Transactions Regulations without prior OFAC authorization.
    (a) License requirements--(1) OFAC administered embargo. You should 
consult with OFAC if:
    (i) You seek authorization to export from the United States; or
    (ii) You are a United States person (as defined in OFAC's Iranian 
Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 560) and seek authorization to 
export or reexport from a third country; or
    (iii) You seek authorization to reexport U.S.-origin items that were 
subject to any export license application requirements prior to 
Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995.
    (2) BXA license requirements. A license is required under the EAR:
    (i) To export to Iran any item on the CCL containing a CB Column 1, 
CB Column 2, CB Column 3, NP Column 1, NP Column 2, NS Column 1, NS 
Column 2, MT Column 1, RS Column 1, RS Column 2, CC Column 1, CC Column 
2, CC Column 3, AT Column 1 or AT Column 2 in the Country Chart Column 
of the License Requirements section of an ECCN, or classified under 
ECCNs 1C980, 1C981, 1C982, 1C983, 1C984, 5A980, 0A980, and 0A983; or
    (ii) To reexport to Iran any of the items identified in 
Sec. 746.7(a)(2)(i), except for ECCNs 2A994, 3A993, 5A992, 5A995, 6A990, 
6A994, 7A994, 8A992, 8A994, 9A990, 9A992, or 9A994. However, the export 
of these items from the United States to any destination with knowledge 
that they will be reexported, in whole or in part, to Iran, is 
prohibited without a license; or
    (iii) To export or reexport items subject to the general 
prohibitions, including proliferation end-use prohibitions (see part 736 
of the EAR).
    (3) BXA authorization. To avoid duplication, exporters or 
reexporters are not required to seek separate authorization from BXA for 
an export or reexport subject both to the EAR and to OFAC's Iranian 
Transactions Regulations. Therefore, if OFAC authorizes an export or 
reexport, no separate authorization from BXA is necessary.
    (4) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term ``United 
States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident 
alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States (including 
foreign branches), or any person in the United States; the term 
``foreign person'' means those not defined as United States persons.
    (b) Iran has been designated by the Secretary of State as a country 
that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
terrorism. For anti-terrorism controls, see Sec. 742.8 of the EAR and 
Supplement 2 to part 742.

Sec. 746.8  Rwanda.

    (a) Introduction. In addition to the controls on Rwanda reflected on 
the Country Chart in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR, there are 
special controls on items that fall within the scope of a United Nations 
Security Council arms embargo.
    (b) License requirements. (1) Under Executive Order 12918 of May 26, 
1994, and in conformity with United Nations Security Council (UNSC)

to Rwanda of arms and related materiel of all types and regardless of 
origin, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and 
equipment, paramilitary police equipment, and spare parts for such 
items. You will therefore need a license for the sale, supply or export 
to Rwanda of

[[Page 258]]

embargoed items, as listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this 
section, from the territory of the United States by any person. You will 
also need a license for the export, reexport, sale or supply to Rwanda 
of such items by any United States person in any foreign country or 
other location. (Reexport controls imposed by this embargo apply only to 
reexports by U.S. persons.) You will also need a license for the use of 
any U.S.-registered aircraft or vessel to supply or transport to Rwanda 
any such items. These requirements apply to embargoed items, regardless 
of origin.
    (i) Crime Control and Detection Equipment as identified on the CCL 
under CC Columns No. 1, 2 or 3 in the Country Chart column of the 
``License Requirements'' section of the applicable ECCN.

and 0A988.
    (2) This embargo became effective at 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 26, 1994.
    (3) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the term:

association, partnership, society, trust, or any other entity, 
organization or group, including governmental entities; and
    (ii) United States person means any citizen or national of the 
United States, any lawful permanent resident of the United States, or 
any corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or 
any other entity, organization or group, including governmental 
entities, organized under the laws of the United States (including 
foreign branches).
    (c) Licensing policy. Applications for export or reexport of all 
items listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are 
subject to a general policy of denial. Consistent with United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 918 and the United Nations Participation 
Act, this embargo is effective notwithstanding the existence of any 
rights or obligations conferred or imposed by any international 
agreement or any contract entered into or any license or permit granted 
prior to that date, except to the extent provided in regulations, 
orders, directives or licenses that may be issued in the future under 
Executive Order 12918 or under the EAR.
    (d) Related controls. The Department of State, Office of Defense 
Trade Controls, maintains controls on arms and military equipment under

Country Chart in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR. (See also 
Sec. 746.7 of this part.) In addition, OFAC administers sanctions 
against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). 
Under Executive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993, and consistent with 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 864 of September 15, 1993, 
OFAC administers an embargo on the sale or supply of arms and related

entry designated by the Secretary of the Treasury continue to require a 
license from BXA. In addition, all other items controlled on the CCL to 
Angola continue to require a license from BXA.

Trade Controls (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), regarding exports of 
weapons and military equipment.

   Supplement No. 3 to Part 746--Controls on the Federal Republic of 
    Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia 
          Administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control

    Note: OFAC administers a comprehensive embargo on the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), certain areas of 
Croatia, and Bosnian Serb-controlled areas of the Republic of Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Effective January 16, 1996, OFAC suspended the application 
of sanctions on Croatia and Serbia and Montenegro. Therefore, exporters 
should consult the Country Chart in Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the 
EAR for BXA controls. OFAC controls on Bosnian Serb-controlled area of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina remain in effect. (See amendment to the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Bosnian Serb-
Controlled Areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Sanctions 
Regulations in the Federal Register of January 19, 1996 (61 FR 1282) (31 
CFR part 585).) This suspension affects paragraphs (a) and (c) of this 
supplement.

    (a) Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia & Montenegro). OFAC 
administers an embargo on exports and reexports to the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (FRY(S & M)). OFAC administers 
this embargo under Executive Orders 12808 of May 30, 1992, 12810 of June 
5, 1992, 12831 of January 15, 1993, 12846 of April 25, 1993, and 12934 
of October 25, 1994, and consistent with United Nations Security Council 
Resolutions 757 of May 30, 1992, 787 of November 16, 1992, 820 of April 
17, 1993, and 942 of September 23, 1994. Under this embargo, no items 
subject to U.S. jurisdiction may be exported, directly or indirectly, to 
the FRY (S & M), or to any entity operated from the FRY (S & M), or 
owned or controlled by, or specially designated as acting for or on 
behalf of the Government of the FRY (S & M). The applicable OFAC 
regulations, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) 
Sanctions Regulations, are found in 31 CFR part 585. Exporters should 
apply to OFAC for authorization to export or reexport items subject to 
the EAR to the FRY (S & M). An authorization from OFAC constitutes 
authorization under the EAR, and no BXA license is necessary.
    (b) Bosnia-Herzegovina. (1) BXA maintains the controls reflected on 
the Country Chart in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR on Bosnia-
Herzegovina, except to the extent OFAC maintains controls on exports or 
reexports to that country.
    (2) OFAC maintains a comprehensive embargo on trade, including 
exports from the United States or by U.S. persons to, or through, those 
areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the control of the 
Bosnian Serb forces, or activity of any kind that promotes or is 
intended to promote such dealing. OFAC maintains this embargo under 
Executive Orders 12846 of April 25, 1993 and 12934 of October 25, 1994, 
and consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 820 of 
April 17, 1993 and 942 of September 23, 1994. The applicable OFAC 
regulations, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) 
Sanctions Regulations, are found in 31 CFR part 585. U.S. persons should 
apply to OFAC for authorization to engage in trade-related transactions 
involving those areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the 
control of the Bosnian Serb forces. An authorization from OFAC 
constitutes authorization under the EAR, and no BXA license is 
necessary. You

[[Page 260]]

will need a license from BXA for items controlled on the CCL to Bosnia-
Herzegovina when the export or reexport is destined to areas in the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina not controlled by the Bosnian Serb 
forces. You may need a license from BXA to reexport U.S.-origin items 
from third countries to areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
under the control of the Bosnian Serb forces.
    (c) Croatia. (1) BXA maintains the controls reflected on the Country 
Chart in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR on Croatia, except to the 
extent OFAC maintains controls on exports or reexports to that country.
    (2) OFAC prohibits any dealing by a U.S. person relating to the 
export to, or transshipment through, the United Nations Protected Areas 
in the Republic of Croatia. OFAC maintains this embargo under Executive 
Order 12846 of April 25, 1993, and consistent with United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 820 of April 17, 1993. The applicable OFAC 
regulations, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) 
Sanctions Regulations, are found in 31 CFR part 585. U.S. persons should 
apply to OFAC for authorization to engage in trade-related transactions 
involving the United Nations Protected Areas in the Republic of Croatia. 
An authorization from OFAC constitutes authorization under the EAR, and 
no BXA license is necessary. You will need a license from BXA for items 
controlled on the CCL to Croatia when the export or reexport is destined 
to areas other than the United Nations Protected Areas in the Republic 
of Croatia. Foreign persons may need a license from BXA to reexport 
U.S.-origin items from third countries to the United Nations Protected 
Areas in the Republic of Croatia.

Sec. 748.1  General provisions.

    (a) Scope. In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 
CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The provisions of this part involve 
applications, whether submitted in writing or electronically, for 
classifications, advisory opinions or licenses subject to the Export 
Administration Regulations (EAR). All terms, conditions, provisions, and 
instructions, including the applicant and consignee certifications, 
contained in such form(s) are incorporated as part of the EAR. For the 
purposes of this part, the term ``application'' refers to the Form BXA-
748P: Multipurpose Application or its electronic equivalent. If a 
provision contained in this part relates solely to a license application 
the term ``license application'' will appear.
    (b) BXA responses. BXA will give a formal classification, advisory 
opinion or licensing decision only through the review of a properly 
completed application supported by all relevant facts and required 
documentation submitted in writing or electronically to BXA.
    (c) Confidentiality. Consistent with section 12(c) of the Export 
Administration Act, as amended, information obtained for the purposes of 
considering

[[Page 261]]

license applications, and other information obtained by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce concerning license applications, will not be made 
available to the public without the approval of the Secretary of 
Commerce.

accept applications sent C.O.D.


<R05>
Sec. 748.3  Classification and Advisory Opinions.

    (a) Introduction. In light of your responsibility to classify your 
item, you may ask BXA to provide you with the correct Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) to the paragraph (or subparagraph if 
appropriate). BXA will advise you whether or not your item is subject to 
the EAR and, if applicable, the appropriate ECCN. This type of request 
is commonly referred to as a ``Classification Request''. If requested, 
for a given end-use, end-user, and/or destination, BXA will advise you 
whether a license is required, or likely to be granted, for a particular 
transaction. Note that these responses do not bind BXA to issuing a 
license in the future. This type of request, along with requests for 
guidance regarding other interpretations of the EAR are commonly 
referred to as ``Advisory Opinions''.
    (b) Classification requests. You must submit your Classification 
Request using Form BXA-748P or its electronic equivalent. See the 
instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 748 to complete the 
Blocks identified for this type of request. Classification Requests must 
be sent to BXA at one of the addresses listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of this 
part or submitted electronically. Be certain that your request is 
complete and does not omit any essential information.
    (1) Each Classification Request must be limited to six items. 
Exceptions may be granted by BXA on a case-by-case basis for several 
related items if the relationship between the items is satisfactorily 
substantiated in the request. Classification requests must be supported 
by any descriptive literature, brochures, precise technical 
specifications or papers that describe the items in sufficient technical 
detail to enable classification by BXA.
    (2) When submitting a Classification Request, you must complete 
Blocks 1 through 5, 14, 22 (a), (b), (c), (d), and (i), 24, and 25 on 
Form BXA-748P. You must provide a recommended classification in Block 
22(a) and explain the basis for your recommendation based on the 
technical parameters specified in the appropriate ECCN in Block 24. If 
you are unable to determine a recommended classification for your item, 
include an explanation in Block 24, identifying the ambiguities or 
deficiencies that precluded you from making a recommended 
classification.
    (3) Classification requests for a one-time Department of Commerce 
review of encryption software transferred from the U.S. Munitions List 
consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996

[[Page 262]]

(61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date 
are required prior to export to determine eligibility for release from 
EI controls. Refer to Supplement No. 6 to part 742 for instructions on 
submitting such requests for mass market encryption software. For 
requests for Key Escrow, Key Recovery, or Recovery encryption products, 
include the word ``Encryption'' in Block 24: Additional Information.
    (c) Advisory Opinions. Advisory Opinions must be submitted in 
writing to the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of the EAR. Both your 
letter and envelope must be marked ``Advisory Opinion.''
    (1) Your letter must contain the following information if you are 
requesting guidance regarding interpretations of the EAR:
    (i) The name, title, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the 
person to contact,
    (ii) Your complete address comprised of street address, city, state, 
country, and postal code; and
    (2) If you are requesting BXA to determine whether a license is 
required, or the licensing policy related to a particular end-use, end-
user, and/or destination, in addition to the information required in 
Sec. 748.3(c)(1) you must also include:
    (i) All available information on the parties to the transaction and 
the proposed end-use or end-user,
    (ii) The model number for each item, where appropriate,
    (iii) The Export Control Classification Number, if known, for each 
item; and
    (iv) Any descriptive literature, brochures, technical specifications 
or papers that describe the items in sufficient technical detail to 
enable BXA to verify the correct classification.
[61 FR 12812, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68585, Dec. 30, 1996; 
62 FR 25461, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 748.4  Basic guidance related to applying for a license.

    (a) Disclosure and substantiation of facts on license applications. 
You, as the applicant, are required to make the complete disclosure of 
all parties in interest to the transaction so that BXA may decide on the 
license application with the fullest knowledge of all relevant facts. If 
the license application is filed for an account other than that of the 
applicant, the agent, as applicant must disclose the name of the agent's 
principal. Where there is any doubt as to which of several persons 
should be named as a party to the license, you must disclose the names 
of all such persons and the functions to be performed by each in Block 
24 on your application or an attachment to your license application.
    (b) Applications for the export of items from the United States. A 
license application to export items from the United States may be made 
only by a person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who is 
in fact the exporter, or by the applicant's duly authorized agent. This 
limitation does not apply to applications for the reexport of items 
previously exported. An application may be made on behalf of a person 
not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States by an authorized 
agent in the United States, who then becomes the applicant.
    (c) Prohibited from applying for a license. No person convicted of a 
violation of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the Export 
Administration Act, as amended, at the discretion of the Secretary of 
Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up to 10 years from the 
date of the conviction. See Sec. 766.25 of the EAR.
    (d) Prior action on a shipment. If you have obtained a license 
without disclosure of the facts described in this section, the license 
will be deemed to have been obtained without disclosure of all facts 
material to the granting of the license and the license so obtained will 
be deemed void. See part 764 of the EAR for other sanctions that may 
result in the event a violation occurs.
    (1) Licenses for items subject to detention or seizure. If you 
submit a license application for items that you know have been detained 
or seized by the Office of Export Enforcement or by the U.S. Customs 
Service, you must disclose this fact to BXA when you submit your license 
application.
    (2) Licenses for items previously exported. You may not submit a 
license application to BXA covering a shipment that is already laden 
aboard the

[[Page 263]]

exporting carrier, exported or reexported. If such export or reexport 
should not have been made without first securing a license authorizing 
the shipment, you must send a letter of explanation to the Office of 
Export Enforcement, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Pennsylvania 
Avenue, N.W., H4520, Washington, D.C., 20230. The letter must state why 
a license was not obtained and disclose all facts concerning the 
shipment that would normally have been disclosed on the license 
application. You will be informed of any action and furnished any 
instructions by the Office of Export Enforcement.
    (e) Multiple shipments. Your license application need not be limited 
to a single shipment, but may represent a reasonable estimate of items 
to be shipped throughout the validity of the license. Do not wait until 
the license you are using expires before submitting a new application. 
You may submit a new application prior to the expiration of your current 
license in order to ensure uninterrupted shipping.
    (f) Second application. You may not submit a second license 
application covering the same proposed transaction while the first is 
pending action by BXA.
    (g) Resubmission. If a license application is returned without 
action to you by BXA or your application represents a transaction 
previously denied by BXA, and you want to resubmit the license 
application, a new license application must be completed in accordance 
with the instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 748. Cite 
the Application Control Number on your original application in Block 24 
on the new license application.
    (h) Emergency processing. If you believe an emergency situation 
beyond your control necessitates expedited processing of your license 
application, you should contact BXA's Exporter Counseling Division of 
the Office of Exporter Services. This office may be reached by telephone 
on (202) 482-4811 or by facsimile on (202) 482-3617. These procedures do 
not apply to emergency handling of Special Comprehensive License 
applications.
    (1) How to request emergency handling. If your license application 
is already pending with BXA, contact the Exporter Counseling Division 
directly on either number listed in paragraph (h) of this section. If 
you have not yet submitted your license application, include a written 
letter with the title ``Emergency Handling Request'' with your license 
application. The letter must include:
    (i) A justification for the request, supported, where appropriate, 
with copies of orders, communications, or other documentation to 
substantiate that your request constitutes a valid emergency. You may be 
specifically requested to supply other documents not included with your 
submission.
    (ii) An acknowledgement by you that any license issued under these 
emergency procedures will have a limited validity period as described in 
Sec. 750.7(g) of the EAR, and that it generally will not be extended.
    (2) Prompt delivery of emergency handling requests. You are 
responsible for prompt delivery of your request and license application 
to BXA. You may hand-carry your request and license application or use 
the services of an overnight courier to ensure prompt delivery. If you 
desire to hand-carry your request and license application, you may hand 
deliver it to the Exporter Counseling Division at the address stated in 
Sec. 748.2(a) of this part. If you decide to use an overnight courier, 
use the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part. The envelope 
containing your license application should be labeled ``Attn: Exporter 
Counseling Division, Emergency Handling Request Enclosed''.
    (3) Review of emergency handling requests. BXA views an emergency as 
an unforeseeable situation over which you have no control. On the day of 
receipt, BXA will evaluate your license application and decide whether 
emergency handling is warranted. Frequent emergency request will be 
given particularly close scrutiny. This procedure is not designed to 
become a substitute for timely filing of license applications.
    (4) Action on license applications processed under emergency 
procedures. If you have submitted an emergency request, you will be 
contacted by the Exporter Counseling Division informing you of

[[Page 264]]

whether or not your request for emergency processing has been granted. 
If your license is approved under emergency handling procedures, you 
will be notified by BXA of the approval by telephone or in person. You 
will be given the license number and verbal authorization to effect 
shipment immediately, without waiting for the actual license. Any 
license approved under these emergency handling procedures will have a 
limited validity period as described in Sec. 750.7(g) of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 748.5  Parties to the transaction on a license application.

    (a) Applicant. (1) The ``applicant'' is defined as the person who, 
as the principal party in interest in the transaction, has the power and 
responsibility for determining and controlling the exporting or 
reexporting of the items. BXA is primarily concerned with the identity 
of the applicant and the applicant's role in the transaction, and not 
the terms of sale.
    (2) Ordinarily, a seller who delivers items in the United States to 
a foreign buyer, or to the latter's forwarder or other agent, would not 
be in a position to assume responsibility for the export and would not 
be a proper applicant. This would normally be the situation where sale 
is made f.o.b. factory, although such terms of sale may relate only to 
price and are not necessarily inconsistent with the assumption by the 
seller of full responsibility for effecting the export or reexport. The 
seller can still be liable if the seller knows that the importer or its 
agent will not obtain the required license.
    (3) If the seller intends to leave the responsibility for effecting 
an export or reexport in the hands of the foreign importer or the 
latter's forwarding or purchasing agent in the United States, the 
foreign importer should apply for the license in the foreign importer's 
own name if the foreign importer is subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States at the time of export. Otherwise, the importer's 
forwarding or purchasing agent or other person subject to the 
jurisdiction of the U.S. must appear as applicant and exporter. In this 
situation you, as the applicant, must disclose your role as agent and 
the name of your principal.
    (b) Order party. The order party is that person in the United States 
who conducted the direct negotiations or correspondence with the foreign 
purchaser or ultimate consignee and who, as a result of these 
negotiations, received the order from the foreign purchaser or ultimate 
consignee.
    (c) Purchaser. The purchaser is that person abroad who has entered 
into the transaction with the applicant to purchase an item for delivery 
to the ultimate consignee. A bank, freight forwarder, forwarding agent, 
or other intermediary is not the purchaser. The purchaser and ultimate 
consignee may be the same entity.
    (d) Intermediate consignee. The intermediate consignee is the bank, 
forwarding agent, or other intermediary (if any) who acts in a foreign 
country as an agent for the exporter or reexporter, the purchaser, or 
the ultimate consignee, for the purpose of effecting delivery of the 
export or reexport to the ultimate consignee.
    (e) Ultimate consignee. The ultimate consignee is the person located 
abroad who is the true party in interest in actually receiving the 
export for the designated end-use. A bank, freight forwarder, forwarding 
agent, or other party, when acting as an intermediary, is not acceptable 
as the ultimate consignee.


<R05>
Sec. 748.6  General instructions for license applications.

    (a) Form and instructions. An application for license, whether to 
export or reexport, must be submitted on Form BXA-748P, Multipurpose 
Application (revised June 15, 1996 or later), and Form BXA-748P-A, Item 
Appendix, and Form BXA-748P-B, End-User Appendix. Facsimiles or copies 
of these forms are not acceptable. Instructions for preparing Form BXA-
748P are contained in Supplement No. 1 to this part 748. See 
Sec. 748.7(a) of this part for instructions on submitting license 
applications electronically.
    (b) Application Control Number. Each application form includes a 
preprinted Application Control Number. The Application Control Number, 
consisting of a letter followed by six digits, is for

[[Page 265]]

use by BXA when processing applications, and by applicants when 
communicating with BXA concerning pending applications. This number is 
used for tracking purposes within the U.S. Government. The Application 
Control Number is not a license number.
    (c) Approval or denial in entirety. License applications may be 
approved in whole or in part, denied in whole or in part, or returned 
without action. However, you may specifically request that your license 
application be considered as a whole and either approved or denied in 
its entirety.
    (d) Combining items on license applications. Any items may be 
combined on a single application, however, if the items differ 
dramatically (e.g., computers and shotguns) the number of BXA offices to 
which a license application may be referred for review may increase 
significantly. Accordingly, it is recommended that you limit items on 
each license application to those that are similar and/or related.
    (e) Assembly and additional information. All documents or 
correspondence accompanying your license application should bear the 
Application Control Number, and be stapled together. Where necessary, 
BXA may require you to submit additional information beyond that stated 
in the EAR confirming or amplifying information contained in your 
license application.
    (f) Changes in facts. Answers to all items on the license 
application will be deemed to be continuing representations of the 
existing facts or circumstances. Any material or substantive change in 
the terms of the order, or in the facts relating to the transaction, 
must be promptly reported to BXA, whether a license has been granted or 
the license application is still under consideration. If a license has 
been granted and such changes are not excepted in Sec. 750.7(c) of the 
EAR, they must be reported immediately to BXA, even though shipments 
against the license may be partially or wholly completed, during the 
validity period of the license.
    (g) Request for extended license validity period. An extended 
validity period will generally be granted if your transaction is related 
to a multi-year project, when production lead time will not permit 
export or reexport during the normal validity period or for other 
similar circumstances. A continuing requirement to supply spare or 
replacement parts will not normally justify an extended validity period. 
To request an extended validity period, include justification for your 
request in Block 24 on the application.


<R05>
Sec. 748.7  Applying electronically for a license or Classification request.

    (a) Authorization. You may apply electronically once you have been 
authorized to do so by BXA. An authorization to submit applications 
electronically may be limited or withdrawn by BXA at any time. There are 
no prerequisites for obtaining permission to submit electronically or 
limitations in terms of country eligibility. However, BXA may direct for 
any reason that any electronic application be resubmitted in writing, in 
whole or in part
    (1) Requesting approval to submit applications electronically. To 
submit applications electronically, your company must submit a written 
request to BXA at one of the addresses identified in Sec. 748.2(c) of 
this part. Both the envelope and letter must be marked ``Attn: 
Electronic Submission Request''. Your letter must contain your company's 
name, and the address, telephone number, and name of the principal 
contact person in your company. Before approving your request, BXA will 
provide you with language for a number of required certifications. Once 
you have completed the necessary certifications, you may be approved by 
BXA to submit applications electronically.
    (2) Assignment and use of company and personal identification 
numbers. (i) Each company granted permission to submit applications 
electronically will be assigned a company identification number. Each 
person approved by BXA to submit applications electronically for the 
company will be assigned a personal identification number (``PIN'') 
telephonically by BXA. A PIN will be assigned to you only if your 
company has certified to BXA that you are authorized to act for it in 
making electronic submissions under the EAR.
    (ii) Your company may reveal the assigned company identification 
number

[[Page 266]]

only to the PIN holders, their supervisors, employees, or agents of the 
company with a commercial justification for knowing the company 
identification number.
    (iii) An individual PIN holder may not:
    (A) Disclose the PIN to anyone;
    (B) Record the PIN either in writing or electronically;
    (C) Authorize another person to use the PIN; or
    (D) Use the PIN following termination by BXA or your company of your 
authorization or approval for PIN use.
    (iv) To prevent misuse of the PIN:
    (A) If a PIN is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, the company 
and the PIN holder must report the loss, theft or compromise of the PIN 
immediately by telephoning BXA at (202) 482-0436. You must confirm this 
notification in writing within two business days to BXA at the address 
provided in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part.
    (B) Your company is responsible for immediately notifying BXA 
whenever a PIN holder leaves the employ of the company or otherwise 
ceases to be authorized by the company to submit applications 
electronically on its behalf.
    (v) No person may use, copy, steal or otherwise compromise a PIN 
assigned to another person; and no person may use, copy, steal or 
otherwise compromise the company identification number where the company 
has not authorized such person to have access to the number.
    (b) Electronic submission of applications. (1) All applications. 
Upon submission of the required certifications and approval of the 
company's request to use electronic submission, BXA will provide 
instructions both on the method to transmit applications electronically 
and the process for submitting required supporting documents and 
technical specifications. These instructions may be modified by BXA from 
time to time.
    (2) License Applications. The electronic submission of an 
application for license will constitute an export control document. Such 
submissions must provide the same information as written applications 
and are subject to the recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR. 
The applicant company and PIN holder submitting the application will be 
deemed to make all representations and certifications as if the 
submission were made in writing by the company and signed by the 
submitting PIN holder. Electronic submission of a license application 
will be considered complete upon the transmittal of the application to 
BXA or to an entity under contract to receive such applications for BXA.
    (c) Maintenance of a log. Your company must maintain a log, either 
manually or electronically, specifying the date and time of each 
electronic submission, the ECCNs of items on each electronic submission, 
and the name of the employee or agent submitting the license 
application. This log may not be altered. Written corrections must be 
made in a manner that does not erase or cover original entries. If the 
log is maintained electronically, corrections may only be made as 
notations.
    (d) Updating. An applicant company must promptly notify BXA of any 
change in its name or address. If your company wishes to have an 
individual added as a PIN holder, your company must advise BXA and 
follow the instructions provided by BXA. Your company should conduct 
periodic reviews to ensure that PINs are held only by individuals whose 
current responsibilities make it necessary and appropriate that they act 
for the company in this capacity.

Sec. 748.9  Support documents for license applications.

    (a) Exemptions. If you plan to submit a license application 
involving one of the following situations, no support documentation is 
required. Simply submit the license application.
    (1) All exports and reexports involving ultimate consignees located 
in any of the following destinations:

Bahamas
Barbados
Belize
Bermuda
Bolivia
Brazil
Canada
Chile
Colombia
Costa Rica
Dominican Republic
Ecuador
El Salvador
French West Indies
French Guiana
Greenland
Guatemala
Guyana
Haiti
Honduras
Jamaica
Leeward and Windward Islands
Mexico
Miquelon and St. Pierre Islands
Netherlands Antilles
Nicaragua
Panama
Paraguay
Peru
Surinam
Trinidad and Tobago
Uruguay
Venezuela

    (2) The ultimate consignee or purchaser is a foreign government(s) 
or foreign government agency(ies). To determine whether the parties to 
your transaction meet the definition of ``government agency'' refer to 
the definition contained in part 772 of the EAR. Remember, if either the 
ultimate consignee or purchaser is not a foreign government or foreign 
government agency, a statement is required from the nongovernmental 
party. However, support documents are required from governments of the 
People's Republic of China, India, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland, Romania, and Slovakia.
    (3) The license application is filed by, or on behalf of, a relief 
agency registered with the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Foreign Aid, 
U.S. Agency for International Development, for export to a member agency 
in the foreign country.
    (4) The license application is submitted to export or reexport items 
for temporary exhibit, demonstration, or testing purposes.
    (5) The license application is submitted for items controlled for 
short supply reasons (see part 754 of the EAR).
    (6) The license application is submitted under the Special 
Comprehensive License procedure described in part 752 of the EAR.
    (7) The license application is submitted to export or reexport 
software or technology, except for software or technology subject to 
national security controls destined for Bulgaria, Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, Romania, or Slovakia.
    (b) Support document requirements. License applications not exempt 
under paragraph (a) of this section generally must be supported by 
documents designed to elicit information concerning the disposition of 
the items intended for export or reexport. These support documents must 
be either submitted at the time the license application is filed or 
retained in the applicant's files in accordance with the recordkeeping 
provisions of part 762 of the EAR. The type of support documentation 
required is dependent on the item involved and the country of ultimate 
destination. To determine which type of support documentation is 
required, answer the following questions:
    (1) Does your transaction involve items controlled for national 
security reasons?

[[Page 268]]

    (i) If yes, continue with question number 2 in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (ii) If no, your transaction may require a Statement by Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser. Read the remainder of this section beginning 
with paragraph (c) of this section, then proceed to Sec. 748.11 of the 
EAR.
    (2) Does your transaction involve items controlled for national 
security reasons destined for one of the following countries? (This 
applies only to those overseas destinations specifically listed.)

Argentina
Australia
Austria
Belgium
Bulgaria
China (PRC)
Czech Republic
Denmark
Finland
France
Germany
Greece
Hong Kong
Hungary
India
Ireland, Republic of
Italy
Japan
Korea, Republic of
Liechtenstein
Luxembourg
Netherlands
New Zealand
Norway
Pakistan
Poland
Portugal
Romania
Singapore
Slovakia
Spain
Sweden
Switzerland
Taiwan
Turkey
United Kingdom

    (i) If yes, your transaction may require an Import or End-User 
Certificate. Note that if the destination is the People's Republic of 
China, a Statement of Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser may be 
substituted for a PRC End-User Certificate under the following 
conditions:
    (1) The item to be exported is described in an Advisory Note for 
Country Group D:1 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) on the 
CCL; or
    (2) The item to be exported (i.e., replacement parts and sub-
assemblies) is for servicing previously exported items and is valued at 
$75,000 or less; or
    (3) The End-User is not a Chinese entity.
    (ii) If no, your transaction may require a Statement by Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser. Read the remainder of this section beginning 
with paragraph (c) of this section, then proceed to Sec. 748.11 of the 
EAR.
    (c) License applications requiring support documents. License 
applications requiring support by either a Statement by the Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser or an Import or End-User Certificate must 
indicate the type of support document obtained in Block 6 or 7 on your 
application with an ``X'' in the appropriate box. If the support 
document is an Import or End User Certificate, you must also identify 
the originating country and number of the Certificate in Block 13 on 
your application. If a license application is submitted without either 
the correct Block or Box marked on the application or the required 
support document, the license application will be immediately returned 
without action unless the satisfactory reasons for failing to obtain the 
document are supplied in Block 24 or in an attachment to your license 
application.
    (1) License applications supported by an Import or End User 
Certificate. If submission of the original certificate is not required 
by Sec. 748.10(g) of this part, you may submit your license application 
upon receipt of a facsimile or other legible copy of the Import or End 
User Certificate provided that no shipment is made against any license 
issued based upon the Import or End User Certificate prior to receipt 
and retention of the original statement by the applicant. If 
Sec. 748.10(g) of this part requires submission of the original 
certificate with your license application, you must submit the original. 
Copies will not be accepted.
    (2) License applications supported by Ultimate Consignee and 
Purchaser statements. These types of license applications may be 
submitted upon receipt of a facsimile or other legible copy of the 
original statement provided that the applicant receives the manually-
signed original within 60 days from the date the original is signed by 
the ultimate consignee.
    (d) Exceptions to obtaining the required support document. BXA will 
consider the granting of an exception to the requirement for supporting 
document where the requirements cannot be met due to circumstances 
beyond your control. An exception will not be granted contrary to the 
objectives of the U.S. export control laws and regulations. Refer to 
Sec. 748.12(d) of this part for specific instructions on procedures for 
requesting an exception.

[[Page 269]]

    (e) Validity period. (1) When an Import or End-User Certificate or a 
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser is required to support one 
or more license applications, you must submit the first license 
application within the validity period shown on the Certificate, or 6 
months from the date the Certificate was issued or Statement signed, 
whichever is shorter.
    (2) All subsequent license applications supported by the same Import 
or End-Use Certificate must be submitted to BXA within one year from the 
date that the first license application supported by the same Import or 
End-Use Certificate was submitted to BXA.
    (3) All subsequent license applications supported by the same 
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser must be submitted within 
two years of the first application if the statement was completed as a 
single transaction statement. If the statement was completed as a 
multiple transaction statement, all applications must be submitted 
within two years of signature by the consignee or purchaser, whichever 
was last.
    (f) English translation requirements. All abbreviations, coded 
terms, or other expressions on support documents having special 
significance in the trade or to the parties to the transaction must be 
explained on an attachment to the document. Documents in a language 
other than English must be accompanied by an attachment giving an 
accurate English translation, either made by a translating service or 
certified by you to be correct. Explanations or translations should be 
provided on a separate piece of paper, and not entered on the support 
documents themselves.
    (g) Responsibility for full disclosure. (1) Information contained in 
a support document cannot be construed as extending or expanding or 
otherwise modifying the specific information supplied in a license 
application or license issued by BXA. The license application covering 
the transaction discloses all facts pertaining to the transaction. The 
authorizations contained in the resulting license are not extended by 
information contained in an Import Certificate, End-User Certificate or 
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser regarding reexport from 
the country of destination or any other facts relative to the 
transaction that are not reported on the license application.
    (2) Misrepresentations, either through failure to disclose facts, 
concealing a material fact, or furnishing false information, will 
subject responsible parties to administrative action by BXA. 
Administrative action may include suspension, revocation, or denial of 
licensing privileges and denial of other participation in exports from 
the United States.
    (3) In obtaining the required support document, you as the applicant 
are not relieved of the responsibility for full disclosure of any other 
information concerning the ultimate destination and end-use, end-user of 
which you know, even if inconsistent with the representations made in 
the Import Certificate, End-User Certificate, or Statement by Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser. You are responsible for promptly notifying BXA 
of any change in the facts contained in the support document that comes 
to your attention.
    (h) Effect on license application review. BXA reserves the right in 
all respects to determine to what extent any license will be issued 
covering items for which an Import or End-User Certificate has been 
issued by a foreign government. BXA will not seek or undertake to give 
consideration to recommendations from the foreign government as to the 
action to be taken on a license application. A supporting document 
issued by a foreign government will be only one of the factors upon 
which BXA will base its licensing action, since end-uses and other 
considerations are important factors in the decision making process.
    (i) Request for return of support documents submitted to BXA. If an 
applicant is requested by a foreign importer to return an unused or 
partially used Import or End-User Certificate submitted to BXA in 
support of a license application, the procedure provided in this 
paragraph (i) should be followed:
    (1) The applicant must send a letter request for return of an Import 
or End-User Certificate to the address stated

[[Page 270]]

in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part, ``Attn: Import/End-User Certificate 
Request''.
    (2) The letter request must include the name and address of the 
importer, the Application Control Number under which the original Import 
or End-User Certificate was submitted, the Application Control Numbers 
for any subsequent license applications supported by the same 
certificate, and one of the following statements, if applicable:
    (i) If the certificate covers a quantity greater than the total 
quantity identified on the license application(s) submitted against it, 
a statement that the certificate will not be used in connection with 
another license application.
    (ii) If you do not intend to make any additional shipments under a 
license covered by the certificate, or are in possession of an expired 
license covered by the certificate, a statement to this effect, 
indicating the unshipped items.
    (j) Recordkeeping requirements for returning certificates retained 
by the applicant. (1) Though the recordkeeping provisions of the EAR 
require that all original support documents be retained for a period of 
five years, an unused or partially used certificate may be returned at 
the request of a foreign importer provided that you submit the original 
certificate, accompanied by a letter of explanation, a copy of each 
license covered by the certificate, and a list of all shipments made 
against each license to BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c). BXA 
will notify you in writing whether your request has been granted. The 
following information must be contained in your letter of explanation:
    (i) A statement citing the foreign importer's request for return of 
the certificate;
    (ii) The license number(s) that have been issued against the 
certificate (including both outstanding and expired licenses); and
    (iii) If the certificate covers a quantity greater that the total 
quantity stated on the license(s), you must include a statement that the 
certificate will not be used in connection with another license 
application.
    (2) If your request is granted, BXA will return the certificate to 
you. You must make a copy of the certificate before you return the 
original to the importer. This copy must show all the information 
contained on the original certificate including any notation made on the 
certificate by BXA. The copies must be retained on file along with your 
correspondence in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions in part 
762 of the EAR.

<R05>
Sec. 748.10  Import and End-User Certificates.

    (a) Scope. There are a variety of Import and End-User Certificates 
currently in use by various governments. The control exercised by the 
government issuing the Import or End-User Certificate is in addition to 
the conditions and restrictions placed on the transaction by BXA. The 
laws and regulations of the United States are in no way modified, 
changed, or superseded by the issuance of an Import or End-User 
Certificate. This section describes exceptions and relationships true 
for both Import and End-User Certificates, and applies only to 
transactions involving national security controlled items destined for 
one of the countries identified in Sec. 748.9(b)(2) of this part.
    (b) Import or End-User Certificate. An Import or End-User 
Certificate must be obtained, unless your transaction meets one of the 
exemptions stated in Sec. 748.9(a) of this part, if:
    (1) Any commodities on your license application are controlled for 
national security (NS) reasons, or you have software or technology that 
is controlled for NS reasons and is destined for Bulgaria, Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, or Slovakia.
    (2) The ultimate destination is a country listed in Sec. 748.9(b)(2) 
of this part; and
    (3) Your license application involves the export of commodities and 
software classified in a single entry on the CCL, the total value of 
which exceeds $5,000.
    (i) Your license application may list several separate CCL entries. 
If any entry controlled for national security reasons exceeds $5,000, 
then an Import or End-User Certificate must be obtained covering all 
items controlled for national security reasons on your license 
application;

[[Page 271]]

    (ii) If your license application involves a lesser transaction that 
is part of a larger order for items controlled for national security 
reasons in a single ECCN exceeding $5,000, an Import or End-User 
Certificate must be obtained.
    (iii) You may be specifically requested by BXA to obtain an Import 
Certificate for a transaction valued under $5,000.
    (c) How to obtain an Import or End-User Certificate. (1) Applicants 
must request that the importer (e.g., ultimate consignee or purchaser) 
obtain the Import or End-User Certificate, and that it be issued 
covering only those items that are controlled for national security 
reasons. Importers should not be requested to obtain an Import or End-
User Certificate for items that are controlled for reasons other than 
national security. Upon receipt, the importer must transmit the original 
document to the applicant.
    (2) The applicant's name must appear on the Import or End-User 
Certificate submitted to BXA as either the applicant, supplier, or order 
party. The Import Certificate may be made out to either the ultimate 
consignee or the purchaser, even though they are different parties, as 
long as both are located in the same country.

    Note to paragraph (c) of this section: You should furnish the 
consignee with the item description contained in the CCL to be used in 
applying for the Import or End-User Certificate. It is also advisable to 
furnish a manufacturer's catalog, brochure, or technical specifications 
if the item is new.

    (3) If your transaction requires support of a PRC End-User 
Certificate, you must ensure the following information is included on 
the PRC End-User Certificate signed by an official of the Department of 
Science and Technology of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation (MOFTEC) with MOFTEC's seal affixed to it:
    (i) Title of contract and contract number (optional);
    (ii) Names of importer and exporter;
    (iii) End-User and end-use;
    (iv) Description of the item, quantity and dollar value; and
    (v) Signature of the importer and date.
    (d) Where to obtain Import and End-User Certificates. See Supplement 
No. 4 to this part for a list of the authorities administering the 
Import Certificate/Delivery Verification and End-User Certificate 
Systems in other countries.
    (e) Triangular symbol on International Import Certificates. (1) In 
accordance with international practice, the issuing government may stamp 
a triangular symbol on the International Import Certificate (IIC). This 
symbol is notification that the importer does not intend to import or 
retain the items in the country issuing the certificate, but that, in 
any case, the items will not be delivered to any destination except in 
accordance with the export regulations of the issuing country.
    (2) If you receive an IIC bearing a triangular symbol, you must 
identify all parties to the transaction on the license application, 
including those located outside the country issuing the IIC. If the 
importer declines to provide you with this information, you may advise 
the importer to provide the information directly to BXA, through a U.S. 
Foreign Commercial Service office, or in a sealed envelope to you marked 
``To be opened by BXA only''.
    (f) Multiple license applications supported by one certificate. An 
Import or End-User Certificate may cover more than one purchase order 
and more than one item. Where the certificate includes items for which 
more than one license application will be submitted, you must include in 
Block 24 on your application, or in an attachment to each license 
application submitted against the certificate, the following 
certification:

    I (We) certify that the quantities of items shown on this license 
application, based on the Certificate identified in Block 13 of this 
license application, when added to the quantities shown on all other 
license applications submitted to BXA based on the same Certificate, do 
not total more than the total quantities shown on the above cited 
Certificate.

    (g) Submission of Import and End-User Certificates. If a PRC End-
User Certificate is required for your proposed transaction, you must 
submit the original certificate with your license

[[Page 272]]

application. Copies will not be accepted. All other certificates must be 
retained on file by the applicant in accordance with the recordkeeping 
provisions of part 762 of the EAR, and not submitted with the license 
application.
    (h) Alterations. After an Import or End-User Certificate is issued 
by a foreign government, no corrections, additions, or alterations may 
be made on the Certificate by any person. If you desire to explain any 
information contained on the Certificate, you may attach a signed 
statement to the Certificate.
    (i) Request for Delivery Verification. BXA will, on a selective 
basis, require Delivery Verification documents for shipments supported 
by Import Certificates. You will be notified if Delivery Verification is 
required at the time of issuance of the license. Please refer to 
Sec. 748.13 of this part for detailed information on these procedures.
    (j) Retention procedures. You must retain on file the original copy 
of any certificate issued in support of a license application submitted 
to BXA, unless the original is submitted with the license application. 
All recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR apply to 
this requirement, except that reproductions may not be substituted for 
the officially authenticated original in this instance.
[61 FR 12812, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25461, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 748.11  Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser.

    (a) Exceptions to completing a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and 
Purchaser. A Statement by the Ultimate Consignee and/or Purchaser 
involved in a transaction must be completed unless:
    (1) An International Import Certificate, a People's Republic of 
China End-User Certificate, an Indian Import Certificate, or a 
Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian or Slovak Import 
Certificate is required in support of the license application;
    (2) The applicant is the same person as the ultimate consignee, 
provided the required statements are contained in Block 24 on the 
license application. This exemption does not apply where the applicant 
and consignee are separate entities, such as parent and subsidiary, or 
affiliated or associated firms;
    (3) The application is valued at $5000 or less, and is not part of a 
larger transaction; or
    (4) The transaction meets one of the exemptions stated in 
Sec. 748.9(a) of this part.
    (b) Submission of the Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser. 
A copy of the statement must be submitted with your license application 
if the country of ultimate destination is listed in either Country Group 
D:2, D:3, or D:4 (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). The copy 
submitted by the applicant must be of sufficient quality to ensure all 
assertions made on the statement are legible and that the signatures are 
sufficiently legible to permit identification of the signature as that 
of the signer. The applicant must receive the manually-signed original 
within 60 days from the date the original is signed by the ultimate 
consignee. The applicant must, upon receipt, retain the manually-signed 
original, and both the ultimate consignee and purchaser should retain a 
copy of the statement in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions 
contained in part 762 of the EAR.
    (c) Form or letter. The ultimate consignee and purchaser must 
complete either a statement on company letterhead in accordance with 
paragraph (e) of this section or Form BXA-711, Statement by Ultimate 
Consignee and Purchaser. If the consignee and purchaser elect to 
complete the statement on letterhead and both the ultimate consignee and 
purchaser are the same entity, only one statement is necessary. If the 
ultimate consignee and purchaser are separate entities, separate 
statements must be prepared and signed. If the ultimate consignee and 
purchaser elects to complete Form BXA-711, only one Form BXA-711 
(containing the signatures of the ultimate consignee and purchaser) need 
be completed. Whether your ultimate consignee and purchaser sign a 
written statement or complete Form BXA-711, the following constraints 
apply:
    (1) Responsible officials representing the ultimate consignee and 
purchaser must sign the statement. ``Responsible

[[Page 273]]

official'' is defined as someone with personal knowledge of the 
information included in the statement, and authority to bind the 
ultimate consignee or purchaser for whom they sign, and who has the 
power and authority to control the use and disposition of the licensed 
items.
    (2) The authority to sign the statement may not be delegated to any 
person (agent, employee, or other) whose authority to sign is not 
inherent in his or her official position with the ultimate consignee or 
purchaser for whom he or she signs. The signing official may be located 
in the U.S. or in a foreign country. The official title of the person 
signing the statement must also be included.
    (3) The consignee and/or purchaser must submit information that is 
true and correct to the best of their knowledge and must promptly send a 
new statement to the applicant if changes in the facts or intentions 
contained in their statement(s) occur after the statement(s) have been 
forwarded to the applicant. Once a statement has been signed, no 
corrections, additions, or alterations may be made. If a signed 
statement is incomplete or incorrect in any respect, a new statement 
must be prepared, signed and forwarded to the applicant.
    (d) Instructions for completing Form BXA-711. Instructions on 
completing Form BXA-711 are contained in Supplement No. 3 to this part. 
The ultimate consignee and purchaser may sign a legible copy of Form 
BXA-711. It is not necessary to require your ultimate consignee and 
purchaser sign an original Form BXA-711, provided all information

Sec. 748.12  Special provisions for support documents.

    (a) Grace periods. Whenever the requirement for an Import or End-
User Certificate or Statement by Ultimate Consignee or Purchaser is 
imposed or extended by a change in the regulations, the license 
application need not conform to the new support documentation 
requirements for a period of 45 days after the effective date of the 
regulatory change published in the Federal Register.
    (1) Requirements are usually imposed or extended by virtue of one of 
the following:
    (i) Addition or removal of national security controls over a 
particular item; or
    (ii) Development of an Import Certificate/Delivery Verification or 
End-User Certificate program by a foreign country; or
    (iii) Removal of an item from eligibility under the Special 
Comprehensive License described in part 752 of the EAR, when you hold 
such a special license and have been exporting the item under that 
license.
    (2) License applications filed during the 45 day grace period must 
be accompanied by any evidence available to you that will support 
representations concerning the ultimate consignee, ultimate destination, 
and end use, such as copies of the order, letters of credit, 
correspondence between you and ultimate consignee, or other documents 
received from the ultimate consignee. You must also identify the 
regulatory change (including its effective date) that justifies exercise 
of the 45 day grace period. Note that an Import or End-User Certificate 
will not be accepted, after the stated grace period, for license 
applications involving items that are no longer controlled for national 
security reasons. If an item is removed from national security controls, 
you must obtain a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser as

[[Page 275]]

described in Sec. 748.11 of this part. Likewise, any item newly 
controlled for national security purposes requires support of an Import 
or End-User Certificate as described in Sec. 748.10 of this part after 
expiration of the stated grace period.
    (b) Reexports. If a support document would be required for an export 
from the United States, the same document would be required for reexport 
to Country Group D:1 and E:2 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the 
EAR).
    (c) Granting of exceptions to the support documentation requirement. 
An exception to obtaining the required support documentation will be 
considered by BXA, however, an exception will not be granted contrary to 
the objectives of the U.S. export control program. A request for 
exception may involve either a single transaction, or where the reason 
necessitating the request is continuing in nature, multiple 
transactions. If satisfied by the evidence presented, BXA may waive the 
support document requirement and accept the license application for 
processing. Favorable consideration of a request for exception generally 
will be given in instances where the support document requirement:
    (1) Imposes an undue hardship on you and/or ultimate consignee 
(e.g., refusal by the foreign government to issue an Import or End-User 
Certificate and such refusal constitutes discrimination against you); or
    (2) Cannot be complied with (e.g., the items will be held in a 
foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse for subsequent distribution in 
one or more countries); or
    (3) Is not applicable to the transaction (e.g., the items will not 
be imported for consumption into the named country of destination).
    (d) Procedures for requesting an exception. (1) Requests for 
exception must be submitted with the license application to which the 
request relates. Where the request relates to more than one license 
application it should be submitted with the first license application 
and referred to in Block 24 on any subsequent license application. The 
request for exception must be submitted in writing on the applicant's 
letterhead.
    (2) In instances where you are requesting exception from obtaining 
an Import or End-User Certificate, the request must be accompanied by a 
manually-signed original Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser 
as described in Sec. 748.11 of this part.
    (3) At a minimum, the letter request must include:
    (i) Name and address of ultimate consignee;
    (ii) Name and address of purchaser, if different from ultimate 
consignee;
    (iii) Location of foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse if the 
items will be exported to a foreign trade zone or bonded warehouse;
    (iv) Type of request, i.e., whether for a single transaction or 
multiple transactions;
    (v) Full explanation of the reason(s) for requesting the exception;
    (vi) Nature and duration of the business relationship between you 
and ultimate consignee and purchaser shown on the license application;
    (vii) Whether you have previously obtained and/or submitted to BXA 
an Import or End-User Certificate issued in the name of the ultimate 
consignee and/or purchaser, and a list of the Application Control 
Number(s) to which the certificate(s) applied; and
    (viii) Any other facts to justify granting an exception.
    (4) Action by BXA. (i) Single transaction request. Where a single 
transaction is involved, BXA will act on the request for exception at 
the same time as the license application with which the request is 
submitted. In those instances where the related license application is 
approved, the issuance of the license will serve as an automatic notice 
to the applicant that the exception was approved. If any restrictions 
are placed on granting of the exception, these will appear on the 
approval. If the request for exception is not approved, BXA will advise 
you by letter.
    (ii) Multiple transactions request. Where multiple transactions are 
involved, BXA will advise you by letter of the action taken on the 
exception request. The letter will contain any conditions or 
restrictions that BXA finds necessary to impose (including an

[[Page 276]]

exception termination date if appropriate). In addition, a written 
acceptance of these conditions or restrictions may be required from the 
parties to the transaction.
    (e) Availability of original. The original certificate or statement 
must be kept on file, and made available for inspection in accordance 
with the provisions of part 762 of the EAR. To ensure compliance with 
this recordkeeping requirement, BXA will require applicants, on a random 
basis, to submit specific original certificates and statements that have 
been retained on file. Applicants will be notified in writing of any 
such request.
[61 FR 12812, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25461, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 748.13  Delivery Verification (DV).

    (a) Scope. (1) BXA may request the licensee to obtain verifications 
of delivery on a selective basis. A Delivery Verification Certificate 
(DV) is a document issued by the government of the country of ultimate 
destination after the export has taken place and the items have either 
entered the export jurisdiction of the recipient country or are 
otherwise accounted for by the importer to the issuing government. 
Governments that issue DVs are listed in Supplement No. 4 to this part.
    (2) If BXA decides to request verification of delivery, the request 
will appear as a condition on the face of the license. If the license is 
sent directly to a party other than the applicant authorized to receive 
the license (e.g., agent, forwarder, broker, etc.), such party is 
responsible for notifying the licensee immediately in writing that a DV 
is required.
    (b) Exception to obtaining Delivery Verification. The DV requirement 
for a particular transaction is automatically canceled if, subsequent to 
the issuance of a license, the item is no longer controlled for national 
security reasons. In this instance, the licensee must send a letter to 
BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) of this part, stating that 
the items on the license are no longer controlled for national security 
reasons, and accordingly, the request for DV will not be fulfilled by 
the licensee.
    (c) Procedure for obtaining Delivery Verification. When notified 
that a DV is required by BXA, the licensee must transmit to the importer 
a written request for a DV at the time of making each shipment under the 
license (whenever possible, this request should be submitted together 
with the related bill of lading or air waybill). The request must 
include the number of the Import or End-User Certificate for the 
transaction referred to on the license, and notify the importer that 
this same Import or End-User Certificate number should be shown on the 
DV.
    (1) The importer must obtain the DV from the appropriate government 
ministry identified in Supplement No. 4 to this part, and forward the 
completed DV to the licensee. The DV must cover the items described on 
the license that have been shipped. Note that BXA must be able to relate 
the description provided in the DV to the approved license. In order to 
ensure the same terminology is used, the licensee should provide the 
importer with the description as it appears on the license.
    (2) The original copy of the DV must be sent to BXA within 90 days 
after the last shipment has been made against the license. If 
verification of delivery is required for items covered by a license 
against which partial shipments have been made, the licensee shall 
obtain the required DV for each partial shipment, and retain these on 
file until all shipments have been made against the license. Once all 
shipments against the license have been made (or the licensee has 
determined that none will be), the licensee must forward, in one 
package, all applicable DVs to BXA at the address listed in 
Sec. 748.2(c) of this part.
    (3) The documents must be forwarded with a dated letter giving the 
license number, the name, title and signature of the authorized 
representative, and one of the following statements:
    (i) The total quantity authorized by license number ______ has been 
exported, and all delivery verification documents are attached.
    (ii) A part of the quantity authorized by license number ______ will 
not be exported. Delivery verification documents covering all items 
exported are attached.
    (iii) No shipment has been made against this license, and none is 
contemplated.

[[Page 277]]

    (d) Inability to obtain Delivery Verification Certificates. If a 
licensee is unable to obtain the required DV (within the time frame 
stated above, or at all) from the importer, the licensee must promptly 
notify BXA and, upon request, make available all information and 
records, including correspondence, regarding the attempt to obtain the 
DV.

    (f) Units. The ``Unit'' paragraph within each ECCN will list a 
specific ``Unit'' for those items controlled by the entry. The ``Unit'' 
must be entered on all license applications submitted to BXA. If an item 
is licensed in terms of ``$ value'', the unit of quantity commonly used 
in the trade must also be shown on the license application. This Block 
may be left blank on license applications only if the ``Unit'' for the 
ECCN entered in Block 22(a) is shown as ``N/A'' on the CCL.
    (g) Unit Price. Provide the fair market value of the items you wish 
to export or reexport. Round all prices to the nearest whole dollar 
amount. Give the exact unit price only if the value is less than $0.50.

wish to export, reexport, or have BXA classify. Provide details when 
necessary to identify the specific item(s), include all characteristics 
or parameters shown in the applicable ECCN using measurements identified 
in the ECCN (e.g., basic ingredients, composition, electrical 
parameters, size, gauge, grade, horsepower, etc.). These characteristics 
must be identified for the items in the proposed transaction when they 
are different than the characteristics described in promotional 
brochure(s).
    Block 23: Total Application Dollar Value. Enter the total value of 
all items contained on the application in U.S. Dollars. The use of other 
currencies is not acceptable.
    Block 24: Additional Information. Enter additional data pertinent to 
the application as required in the EAR. Include special certifications, 
names of parties of interest not disclosed elsewhere, explanation of 
documents attached, etc. Do not include information concerning Block 22 
in this space.
    If your application represents a previously denied application, you 
must provide the Application Control Number from the original 
application.
    If you are requesting BXA to classify your product, use this space 
to explain why you believe the ECCN entered in Block 22(a) is 
appropriate. This explanation must contain an analysis of the item in 
terms of the technical control parameters specified in the appropriate 
ECCN. If you have not identified a recommended classification in Block 
22(a), you must state the reason you cannot determine the appropriate 
classification, identifying anything in the regulations that you believe 
precluded you from determining the correct classification.
    If additional space is necessary, use Block 24 on Form BXA-748P-A or 
B.
    Block 25: You, as the applicant or duly authorized agent of the 
applicant, must manually sign in this Block. Rubber-stamped or 
electronic signatures are not acceptable. If you are an agent of the 
applicant, in addition to providing your name and title in this Block,

   Supplement No. 5 to Part 748--U.S. Import Certificate and Delivery 
                         Verification Procedure

    The United States participates in an Import Certificate/Delivery 
Verification procedure. Under this procedure, U.S. importers are 
sometimes required to provide their foreign suppliers with an U.S. 
International Import Certificate that is validated by the U.S. 
Government. This certificate tells the government of the exporter's 
country that the items covered by the certificate will be imported into 
the U.S. Economy and will not be reexported except as authorized by U.S. 
export control regulations. In addition, in some cases, the exporter's 
government may require a delivery verification. Under this procedure, 
the U.S. Customs Service validates a certificate confirming that the 
items have entered the U.S. economy. The U.S. importer must return this 
certificate to the foreign exporter.
    This supplement establishes the procedures and requirements of BXA 
with respect to both of these programs. Paragraph (a) of this supplement 
contains the requirements and procedures of the U.S. International 
Import Certificate procedure. Paragraph (b) of this supplement contains 
the requirements and procedures of the Delivery Verification procedure.
    (a) U.S. International Import Certificates. If you are a U.S. 
importer, a foreign supplier may request you to obtain a U.S. import 
certificate. The reason for this request is that the exporter's 
government requires a U.S. import certificate as a condition to issuing

[[Page 287]]

an export license. To obtain such a certificate you will have to fill in 
and execute the U.S. International Import Certificate form (Form BXA-
645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53) and submit it to the U.S. government agency that 
has jurisdiction over the items you are importing. In doing so, you will 
be making a representation to the United States Government that you will 
import the items described in the certificate into the United States or 
if not so imported, you will not divert, transship or reexport them to 
another destination with the explicit approval of the U.S. government 
agency that has jurisdiction over those items. (Representations that 
items will be entered into the U.S. do not preclude the temporary 
unloading of items in a foreign trade zone for subsequent entry into the 
economy of the U.S.) If the items described in the certificate are 
subject to U.S. Department of Commerce jurisdiction, the Department will 
validate the certificate and return it to you. You may then send the 
certificate to your foreign supplier. In this way the government of the 
exporting country is assured that the items will become subject to the 
export control laws of the United States.
    (1) Items for which the U.S. Department of Commerce issues U.S. 
International Import Certificates and forms to use. The Department of 
Commerce issues U.S. International Import Certificates for the following 
types of items.
    (i) Items controlled for National Security reasons. Items under the 
export licensing jurisdiction of BXA that are identified as controlled 
for national security reasons on the Commerce Control List (Supplement 
No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). You will need to submit in triplicate a 
completed Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53;
    (ii) Nuclear equipment and materials. Items subject to the export 
licensing jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for nuclear 
equipment and materials. (see 10 CFR part 110). You will need to submit 
in quadruplicate a completed Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53; and
    (iii) Munitions Items. Items listed on the U.S. Munitions List (see 
22 CFR part 121) that do not appear on the more limited U.S. Munitions 
Import List (27 CFR 47.21). You will need to submit in triplicate a 
completed Form BXA-645P. For triangular transactions (See paragraph 
(a)(5) of this supplement) involving items on the U.S. Munitions List, 
you must contact the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade 
Controls and use Form BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53. You should contact the 
Treasury Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for items 
appearing on the U.S. Munitions Import List. You will need to use Form 
ATF-4522.
    (2) Where to submit forms. U.S. International Import Certificates 
and requests to amend certificates may be presented for validation 
either in person or by mail at the following locations.
    (i) By mail to the Bureau of Export Administration, P.O. Box 273, 
Washington D.C. 20044, Attn: Import Certificate Request; or
    (ii) In person or by mail at one of the following Department of 
Commerce U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service District Offices:

Boston, MA
Buffalo, NY
Chicago, IL
Cincinnati, OH
Cleveland, OH
Dallas, TX
Detroit, MI
Houston, TX
Kansas City, MO
Los Angeles, CA
Miami, FL
New Orleans, LO
New York, NY
Philadelphia, PA
Phoenix, AZ
Pittsburgh, PA
Portland, OR
St. Louis, MO
San Francisco, CA
Savannah, GA
Seattle, WA
Trenton, NJ

    (3) U.S. International Import Certificate validity periods. The U.S. 
International Import Certificate must be submitted to the foreign 
government within six months from the date of certification by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce. The expiration of this six-month period in no 
way affects the responsibility of the importer to fulfill the 
commitments made in obtaining the certificate. If the certificate is not 
presented to the government of the exporting country before the 
expiration of its validity period, the exporter must apply for a new 
certificate. The original unused U.S. International Import Certificate 
must be returned to BXA at the address specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) 
of this supplement.
    (4) Statements on the certificate or amendments are representations 
to the U.S. Government which continue in effect.
    (i) All statements and representations made in a U.S. International 
Import Certificate or an amendment thereto, will be deemed to be 
continuing in nature until the transaction described in the certificate 
is completed and the items are delivered into the economy of the 
importing country.
    (ii) Any change of fact or intention in regard to the transaction 
described in the certificate shall be promptly disclosed to BXA by the 
U.S. importer by presentation of an amended certificate. The amended 
certificate must describe all of the changes and be accompanied by the 
original certificate bearing the certification of BXA. If the original 
certificate has been transferred to the foreign exporter, you must, 
where possible, attempt to obtain the original certificate prior to 
applying for an amendment. If the original certificate is unobtainable 
because the foreign exporter has submitted it to the appropriate foreign 
government, or for any other reason, then you must submit a written 
statement with your amendment giving the reasons for your failure to 
submit the original certificate.

[[Page 288]]

    (5) Certificates for Triangular transaction (items will not enter 
the U.S. or applicant is not sure that they will enter the United 
States).
    (i) In accordance with international practice, BXA will, upon 
request, stamp the certificate with a triangular symbol as notification 
to the government of the exporting country that the U.S. importer is 
uncertain whether the items will be imported into the U. S. or knows 
that the items will not be imported into the U.S., but that, in any 
case, the items will not be delivered to any other destination except in 
accordance with the EAR.
    (ii) The triangular symbol on a certificate U.S. International 
Import Certificate is not, in and of itself, an approval by BXA to 
transfer or sell items to a foreign consignee. Note that a triangular 
Certificate will not be issued covering foreign excess property sold 
abroad by the U.S. Department of Defense.
    (6) Approval to export items to a foreign consignee prior to 
delivery under a U.S. International Import Certificate. The written 
approval of BXA is required before items covered by a U.S. International 
Import Certificate (whether or not bearing a triangular symbol) may be 
shipped to a destination other than the U.S. or Canada or sold to a 
foreign purchaser, and before title to or possession of such items may 
be transferred to a foreign transferee. This requirement does not apply 
after the items have been delivered in accordance with the undertaking 
set forth in the Certificate or if at the time of such shipment, sale, 
passage of possession or passage of title, a License Exception or a NLR 
provision of the EAR would authorize the transaction.
    (i) If prior approval is required, a letter requesting authorization 
to release the shipment shall be submitted to BXA at the address listed 
in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.
    (ii) The letter must contain the certificate number; date issued; 
location of the issuing office; names, addresses, and identities of all 
parties to the complete transaction; and the quantity, dollar value, and 
description of the items. The letter must be accompanied by the U.S. 
International Import Certificate, and all other documentation required 
by the EAR for the item and country of ultimate destination, as 
identified in part 748 of the EAR. If requirements stated in part 748 of 
the EAR do not apply to your transaction, you must identify the intended 
end-use of the items in your letter.
    (iii) Where the letter request is approved and is supported by a 
foreign import certificate, no further approval from BXA is required for 
the purchaser or transferee to resell or again transfer the items. 
However, where BXA approves a request that was not supported by a 
foreign import certificate, the person to whom approval is granted is 
required to inform the purchaser or transferee, in writing, that the 
items are to be shipped to the approved destination only and that no 
other disposition of the items is permitted without the approval of BXA.
    (iv) If the transaction is approved, a validated letter of approval 
will be sent to the U.S. purchaser for retention in his records. Where a 
DV or other official government confirmation of delivery is required, 
the letter will so indicate.
    (v) If the items covered by a certificate have been imported into a 
destination other than the U.S. and the foreign exporter of the items 
requests a Delivery Verification, the person who obtained the 
certificate must obtain a DV from the person to whom the items were 
delivered in the actual importing country. (If a DV is unobtainable, 
other official government confirmation of delivery must be obtained.) 
The DV or other official government confirmation of delivery must be 
submitted to BXA together with an explanatory letter giving the U.S. 
International Import Certificate number, date issued, and location of 
issuing office. BXA will then issue Form ITA-6008, Delivery Compliance 
Notice, in two copies, the original of which must be forwarded to the 
country of origin in order to serve as evidence to the exporting country 
that the requirements of the U.S. Government have been satisfied with 
respect to delivery of the items.
    (vi) Delivery, sale, or transfer of items to another U.S. purchaser.
    (A) Items covered by a U.S. International Import Certificate may not 
be sold, and title to or possession of such items may not be 
transferred, to another U.S. purchaser or transferee before the items 
are delivered to the U.S. (or to an approved foreign destination, as 
provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this supplement), except in accordance 
with the provisions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this supplement. 
The provisions of this paragraph do not apply after the items have been 
delivered in accordance with the undertaking set forth in the 
certificate.
    (B) Resale or transfer to another U.S. purchaser or transferee 
requires the prior approval of BXA only in cases where the buyer or 
transferee is listed in Supplement No. 1 to part 766 of the EAR. 
However, you, as the person who obtained the certificate are required to 
notify BXA of any change in facts or intentions relating to the 
transaction, and in all cases you will be held responsible for the 
delivery of the items in accordance with the EAR. You are required in 
all cases to secure, prior to sale or transfer, and to retain in your 
files in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in part 
762 of the EAR, written acceptance by the purchaser or transferee of:
    (1) All obligations undertaken by, and imposed under the EAR, upon 
the holder of the certificate; and

[[Page 289]]

    (2) An undertaking that all subsequent sales or transfers will be 
made subject to the same conditions.
    (iii) The responsibility of the certificate holder for obtaining a 
DV also applies to those cases where the items are resold to a U.S. 
purchaser (See paragraph (b)(1) of this supplement.
    (vii) Reexport or transshipment of items after delivery to U.S. 
Items imported into the U.S. under the provisions of a U.S. 
International Import Certificate may not be reexported to any 
destination under the intransit provisions of License Exception TMP (see 
Sec. 740.9(b)(1) of the EAR). However, all other provisions of the EAR 
applicable to items of domestic origin shall apply to the reexport of 
items of foreign origin shipped to the U.S. under a U.S. International 
Import Certificate.
    (viii) Lost or destroyed U.S. International Import Certificates. If 
a U.S. International Import Certificate is lost or destroyed, a 
duplicate copy may be obtained by the person in the U.S. who executed 
the original U.S. International Import Certificate by submitting to any 
of the offices listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement new Form 
BXA-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53 in the same way as an original request, except 
that the forms shall be accompanied by a letter detailing the 
circumstances under which the original certificate was lost or destroyed 
and certifying:
    (A) That the original U.S. International Import Certificate No. 
______, dated ______, issued to (name and address of U.S. importer) for 
import from (foreign exporter's name and address) has been lost or 
destroyed; and
    (B) That if the original U.S. International Import Certificate is 
found, the applicant agrees to return the original or duplicate of the 
certificate to the Bureau of Export Administration.
    (ix) Unused U.S. International Import Certificates. If the 
transaction will not be completed and the U.S. International Import 
Certificate will not be used, return the certificate for cancellation to 
BXA at the address listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.
    (b) Delivery Verification Certificate. U.S. importers may be 
requested by their foreign suppliers to furnish them with a certified 
Form BXA-647P, Delivery Verification Certificate, covering items 
imported into the U.S. These requests are made by foreign governments to 
assure that strategic items shipped to the U.S. are not diverted from 
their intended destination. In these instances, the issuance of an 
export license by the foreign country is conditioned upon the subsequent 
receipt of a Delivery Verification Certificate from the U.S. importer. 
Accordingly, your compliance with your foreign exporter's request for a 
Delivery Verification is necessary to ensure your foreign exporter 
fulfills its government obligations and is able to participate in future 
transactions with you. Failure to comply may subject your exporter to 
penalties that may prevent future trade.
    (1) The responsibility of a person or firm executing a U.S. 
International Import Certificate for providing the foreign exporter with 
confirmation of delivery of the items includes instances where the items 
are resold or transferred to another U.S. person or firm prior to actual 
delivery to the U.S. or to an approved foreign destination. The person 
who executed the U.S. International Import Certificate shall secure in 
writing from the U.S. purchaser or transferee, and retain in your files 
in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions stated in part 762 of 
the EAR:
    (i) Acceptance of the obligation to provide the purchaser or 
transferee with either the Delivery Verification (or other official 
government confirmation of delivery if a Delivery Verification is 
unobtainable) or assurance that this document was submitted to BXA; and
    (ii) An undertaking that each succeeding U.S. transferee or 
purchaser will assume the same obligation or assurance. In each case the 
seller or transferor must transmit to the U.S. purchaser or transferee 
the U.S. International Import Certificate number covering the export 
from the foreign country and request that they pass it on to any other 
U.S. purchasers or transferees.
    (2) Completion and certification of Delivery Verification 
Certificates. If you are requested by your foreign exporter to provide a 
Delivery Verification, you must obtain Form BXA-647P from a U.S. customs 
office or one of the offices listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
supplement and complete all blocks (except those below the line titled 
``To be completed by U.S. Customs Service'') on the form. The language 
used in the block titled ``Description of Goods'' must describe the 
items in the same terms as those shown on the applicable U.S. 
International Import Certificate. Upon completion Form BXA-647P must be 
presented, in duplicate, to a U.S. customs office. The U.S. customs 
office will certify Form BXA-647P only where the import is made under a 
warehouse or consumption entry.
    (3) Disposition of certified Delivery Verification Certificates. The 
importer must send the original certified Delivery Verification 
Certificate to the foreign exporter or otherwise dispose of it in 
accordance with the instructions of the exporting country. The duplicate 
copy will be retained by the U.S. customs office.
    (4)(i) Issuance of a U.S. Delivery Compliance Notice in lieu of a 
Delivery Verification Certificate. If you are requested to provide a 
Delivery Verification Certificate but do not wish to disclose the name 
of your customer

[[Page 290]]

to the foreign exporter (e.g., in the event that the items are resold or 
transferred to another person or firm before the items enter the U.S.), 
you may submit an originally completed Form BXA-647P together with an 
explanatory letter requesting a Delivery Compliance Notice, to BXA at 
the address listed in (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.
    (ii) BXA will provide you with a notice signifying that the items 
were imported into the U.S. and that a satisfactory DV has been 
submitted to BXA. You must then forward the original notice to your 
foreign exporter for submission to the foreign government. A copy of the 
notice should be retained in your files in accordance with the 
recordkeeping provisions stated in part 762 of the EAR.
    (5)(i) Lost or destroyed Delivery Verification Certificate. When a 
Delivery Verification Certificate is lost or destroyed, the U.S. 
importer must submit a letter to BXA at the address listed in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this supplement certifying that:
    (A) The original Delivery Verification Certificate has been lost or 
destroyed;
    (B) The circumstances under which it was lost or destroyed;
    (C) The type of customs entry (warehouse or consumption), entry 
number, and date of entry; and
    (D) The number and date of the related U.S. International Import 
Certificate.
    (ii) BXA will, in applicable cases, notify the exporting government 
that a Delivery Verification Certificate been issued.
    (c) Penalties and sanctions for violations. The enforcement 
provisions of part 764 and Supplement No. 2 to part 736 of the EAR apply 
to transactions involving imports into the U.S. covered by this 
supplement and to both foreign and U.S. parties involved in a violation 
of this supplement. Any provisions of part 764 and Supplement No. 2 to 
part 736 of the EAR which, by their terms, relate to ``exports'' or 
``exports from the U.S.'' are also deemed to apply and extend to imports 
into the U.S., applications for U.S. International Import Certificates 
(Forms BXA-645P presented to U.S. Department of Commerce for 
certification), U.S. International Import Certificates, and Delivery 
Verification Certificates, described in this supplement. (Applications 
the documents described in this supplement, are included within the 
definition of export control documents provided in part 772 of the EAR.) 
Refer to Sec. 764.3 of the EAR for more information.

Sec. 750.2  Processing of Classification Requests and Advisory Opinions.

    (a) Classification requests. All classification requests submitted 
in accordance with procedures described in Sec. 748.3 (a) and (b) of the 
EAR will be answered within 14 calendar days after receipt. All 
responses will inform the person of the proper classification (e.g., 
whether or not the item is subject to the Export Administration 
Regulations (EAR) and, if applicable, the appropriate Export Control 
Classification Number [ECCN]).

[[Page 291]]

    (b) Advisory Opinion requests. All advisory opinions submitted in 
accordance with procedures described in Sec. 748.3(a) and (c) of the EAR 
will be answered within 30 calendar days after receipt.


<R05>
Sec. 750.3  Review of license applications by BXA and other government agencies and departments.

    (a) Review by BXA. In reviewing specific license applications, BXA 
will conduct a complete analysis of the license application along with 
all documentation submitted in support of the application. In addition 
to reviewing the item and end-use, BXA will consider the reliability of 
each party to the transaction and review any available intelligence 
information. To the maximum extent possible, BXA will make licensing 
decisions without referral of license applications to other agencies, 
however, BXA may consult with other U.S. departments and agencies 
regarding any license application.
    (b) Review by other departments or agencies. (1) The Departments of 
Defense, Energy, State, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency 
(ACDA) have the authority to review any license application submitted 
under the EAR. In addition, BXA may, where appropriate, refer license 
applications to other U.S. government departments or agencies. These 
agencies and departments will be referred to as ``agencies'' for the 
purposes of this part. Though these agencies have the authority to 
review any license application, they may determine that they do not need 
to review certain types of license applications. In these instances, the 
agency will provide BXA with a Delegation of Authority to process those 
license applications without review by that particular agency.
    (2) The Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and ACDA are 
generally concerned with license applications involving items controlled 
for national security, missile technology, nuclear nonproliferation, and 
chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons or destined for 
countries and/or end uses of concern. In particular, these agencies are 
concerned with reviewing license applications as follows:
    (i) The Department of Defense is concerned primarily with items 
controlled for national security and regional stability reasons;
    (ii) The Department of Energy is concerned primarily with items 
controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons;
    (iii) The Department of State is concerned primarily with items 
controlled for regional stability, anti-terrorism, crime control 
reasons, and sanctions; and
    (iv) ACDA is concerned primarily with items controlled for national 
security, nuclear nonproliferation, regional stability, and anti-
terrorism reasons.
    (v) The Department of Justice is concerned with controls relating to 
encryption items.

Sec. 750.4  Procedures for processing license applications.

    (a) Overview. (1) All license applications will be resolved or 
referred to the President no later than 90 calendar days from the date 
of BXA's registration of the license application. Processing times for 
the purposes of this section are defined in calendar days. The 
procedures and time limits described in this part apply to all license 
applications registered on or after February 4, 1996. The procedures and 
time limits in effect prior to December 6, 1995 will apply to license 
applications registered prior to February 4, 1996.
    (2) Properly completed license applications will be registered 
promptly upon receipt by BXA. Registration is defined as the point at 
which the application is entered into BXA's electronic license 
processing system. If your application contains deficiencies that 
prevent BXA from registering your application, BXA will attempt to 
contact you to correct the deficiencies, however, if BXA is unable to 
contact you, the license application will be returned without being 
registered. The specific deficiencies requiring return will be 
enumerated in a notice accompanying the returned license application. If 
a license application is registered, but BXA is unable to correct 
deficiencies crucial to processing the license application, it will be 
returned without action. The notice will identify the deficiencies and 
the action necessary to

correct the deficiencies. If you decide to resubmit the license 
application, it will be treated as a new license application when 
calculating license processing time frames.
    (b) Actions not included in processing time calculations. The 
following actions will not be counted in the time period calculations 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the processing of 
license applications:
    (1) Agreement by the applicant to the delay. BXA may request 
applicants to provide additional information in support of their license 
application, respond to questions arising during processing, or accept 
proposed conditions or riders on their license application. If BXA has 
provided the applicant with an intent to deny letter described in 
Sec. 750.6 of this part, processing times may be suspended in order to 
negotiate modifications to a license application and obtain agreement to 
such modifications from the foreign parties to the license application.
    (2) Pre-license checks. If a pre-license check, to establish the 
identity and reliability of the recipient of the controlled items, is 
conducted through government channels, provided that:
    (i) The need for such a pre-license check is established by the 
Secretary, or by another agency, if the request for a pre-license check 
is made by such agency and the request is made in accordance with the 
following time frames;
    (A) The pre-license check is requested within 5 days of the 
determination that it is necessary; and
    (B) The analysis resulting from the pre-license check is completed 
within 5 days.
    (3) Government-to-Government assurances. Requests for government-to-
government assurances of suitable end-use of items approved for export 
or reexport when failure to obtain such assurances would result in 
rejection of the license application, provided that:
    (i) The request for such assurances is sent to the Secretary of 
State within five days of the determination that the assurances are 
required;
    (ii) The Secretary of State initiates the request of the relevant 
government within 10 days of receipt of the request for such assurances; 
and
    (iii) The license is issued within 5 days of the Secretary's receipt 
of the requested assurances.
    (4) Consultations. Consultation with other governments, if such 
consultation is provided for by a relevant bilateral arrangement or 
multilateral regime as a precondition for approving a license.
    (5) Multilateral reviews. Multilateral review of a license 
application if such review is required by the relevant multilateral 
regime.
    (6) Congressional notification. Under Section 6(j) of the Export 
Administration Act, as amended (EAA), the Secretaries of Commerce and 
State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 
days prior to issuing a license to any country designated by the 
Secretary of State as being terrorist-supporting for any items that 
could make a significant contribution to the military potential of such 
countries, or could enhance the ability of such countries to support 
acts of international terrorism. Accordingly, the issuance of any 
license subject to this requirement will be delayed for 30 days.
    (i) Designated countries. The following countries have been 
designated by the Secretary of State as terrorist-supporting countries: 
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
    (ii) Items subject to notification requirement. License applications 
involving the export or reexport of the following items to the military, 
police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users are subject to this 
notification requirement:
    (A) All items controlled for national security reasons, except 
digital computers with a Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP) less 
than 500 Mtops;
    (B) All items controlled for chemical and biological weapons 
proliferation reasons;
    (C) All items controlled for missile technology reasons;
    (D) All items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons; and
    (E) All items controlled by the CCL where the entry heading 
identifies the items controlled as those contained in the International 
Munitions List.
    (iii) Additional notifications. The Secretaries of Commerce and 
State must

[[Page 293]]

also notify the appropriate Congressional committees 30 days before a 
license is issued for the export or reexport of any item controlled on 
the CCL to a designated country if the Secretary of State determines 
that the export or reexport ``could make a significant contribution to 
the military potential of such country, including its military logistics 
capability, or could enhance the ability of such country to support acts 
of international terrorism.''
    (c) Initial processing. Within 9 days of license application 
registration, BXA will, as appropriate:
    (1) Contact the applicant if additional information is required, if 
the license application is improperly completed, or required support 
documents are missing, to request additional or corrected information;
    (2) Assure the stated classification on the license application is 
correct;
    (3) Return the license application if a license is not required with 
a statement notifying the applicant that a license is not required;
    (4) Approve the license application or notify the applicant of the 
intent to deny the license application; or
    (5) Refer the license application electronically along with all 
necessary recommendations and analysis concurrently to all agencies 
unless the application is subject to a Delegation of Authority. Any 
relevant information not contained in the electronic file will be 
simultaneously forwarded in paper copy.
    (d) Review by other agencies and/or interagency groups. (1) Within 
10 days of receipt of a referral the reviewing agency must advise BXA of 
any information not contained in the referral as described in paragraph 
(c)(5) of this section. BXA will promptly request such information from 
the applicant. The time that elapses between the date the information is 
requested by the reviewing agency and the date the information is 
received by the reviewing agency will not be counted in processing time 
frames.
    (2) Within 30 days of receipt of the initial referral, the reviewing 
agency will provide BXA with a recommendation either to approve (with or 
without conditions or riders) or deny the license application. As 
appropriate, such a recommendation may be made with the benefit of 
consultation and/or discussions in interagency groups established to 
provide expertise and coordinate interagency consultation. These 
interagency groups consist of:
    (i) The Missile Technology Export Control Group (MTEC). The MTEC, 
chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications 
involving items controlled for missile technology reasons. The MTEC also 
reviews license applications involving items not controlled for missile 
technology (MT) reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-
user of MT concern.
    (ii) The SubGroup on Nuclear Export Coordination (SNEC). The SNEC, 
chaired by the Department of State, reviews license applications 
involving items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons. The 
SNEC also reviews license applications involving items not controlled 
for nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons, but destined for a country 
and/or end-use/end-user of NP concern.
    (iii) The Shield. The Shield, chaired by the Department of State, 
reviews license applications involving items controlled for chemical and 
biological weapons reasons. The Shield also reviews license applications 
involving items not controlled for chemical and biological weapons (CBW) 
reasons, but destined for a country and/or end-use/end-user of CBW 
concern.
    (e) Recommendations by reviewing agencies. Reviewing agencies 
recommending denial of a license application must provide a statement of 
reasons, consistent with the provisions of the EAA or EAR, and cite both 
the statutory and the regulatory basis for the recommendation to deny. A 
reviewing agency that fails to provide a recommendation within 30 days 
with a statement of reasons supported by the statutory and regulatory 
basis shall be deemed to have no objection to the final decision of BXA.
    (f) Interagency dispute resolution and escalation procedures--(1) 
Escalation to the Operating Committee (OC). (i) In any instance where 
the reviewing agencies are not in agreement on final disposition of a 
license application, it will be escalated to the OC for resolution. The

[[Page 294]]

Chair of the OC will consider the recommendations of the reviewing 
agencies and any information provided by the applicant in person during 
an open OC session. Each agency will be informed of the Chair's decision 
on the license application within 14 days after the deadline for 
receiving agency recommendations.
    (ii) If any agency disagrees with the OC Chair's decision, the 
agency may escalate the decision by appealing to the Chair of the 
Advisory Committee on Export Policy for resolution. If such a request 
for escalation is not made within 5 days of the decision of the OC 
Chair, the Chair's decision will be final.
    (2) Escalation to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP). 
Requests for escalation to the ACEP must be in writing from an official 
appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, or 
a person properly acting in such capacity, and cite both the statutory 
and the regulatory basis for the appeal. The ACEP will review all 
relevant information and recommendations. The Chair of the ACEP will 
inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote decision of the ACEP 
within 11 days from the date of receipt of the escalation request. 
Within 5 days of the decision, any dissenting agency may appeal in 
writing the ACEP's decision to the Secretary of Commerce in the 
Secretary's capacity as the Chair of the Export Administration Review 
Board. The written request must be made by the head of the agency 
requesting escalation and cite both the statutory and the regulatory 
basis for the appeal. Within the same period of time, the Secretary may 
initiate a meeting on his or her own initiative to consider a license 
application. In the absence of a timely appeal, the decision of the ACEP 
will be final.
    (3) Escalation to the Export Administration Review Board (EARB). The 
EARB will review all relevant information and recommendations, and such 
other export control matters as may be appropriate. The Secretary of 
Commerce will inform the reviewing agencies of the majority vote 
decision of the EARB within 11 days from the date of receipt of the 
appeal. Within 5 days of the decision, any agency dissenting from the 
decision of the EARB may appeal the decision to the President. The 
appeal must be in writing from the head of the dissenting agency. In the 
absence of a timely appeal, the decision of the EARB will be final.

<R05>
Sec. 750.6  Denial of license applications.

    (a) Intent to deny notification. If BXA intends to deny your license 
application, BXA will notify you in writing within 5 days of the 
decision. The notification will include:
    (1) The intent to deny decision;

[[Page 295]]

    (2) The statutory and regulatory basis for the denial;
    (3) To the extent consistent with the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States, the specific considerations that led to the 
decision to deny the license application;
    (4) What, if any, modifications or restrictions to the license 
application would allow BXA to reconsider the license application;
    (5) The name of the BXA representative in a position to discuss the 
issues with the applicant; and
    (6) The availability of appeal procedures.
    (b) Response to intent to deny notification. You will be allowed 20 
days from the date of the notification to respond to the decision before 
the license application is denied. If you respond to the notification, 
BXA will advise you if, as a result of your response, the decision to 
deny has been changed. Unless you are so advised by the 45th day after 
the date of the notification, the denial will become final, without 
further notice. You will then have 45 days from the date of final denial 
to exercise the right to appeal under part 756 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7  Issuance of licenses.

    (a) Scope. A license authorizes only a specific transaction, or 
series of transactions, as described in the license application and any 
supporting documents. A license application may be approved in whole or 
in part or further limited by conditions or other restrictions appearing 
on the license itself or in the EAR. When a license application is 
approved by BXA, a license is issued as described in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Issuance of a license. After a license application is approved, 
a computer generated license is issued by the Department of Commerce 
bearing the license number and a validation date. Where appropriate, the 
license will also show an expiration date. Where necessary, attachments 
to a license will also be validated with the Department of Commerce seal 
and the date of validation. Exporters must use the complete license 
number when preparing a Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) and other 
export control documents, and in communicating with the Department of 
Commerce concerning the license.
    (c) Changes to the license. The following non-material changes do 
not require submission of a ``Replacement'' license or any other 
notification to BXA. (If you wish to make any change not identified in 
this paragraph, you will need to submit a ``Replacement'' license in 
accordance with the instructions contained in Supplement No. 1 to part 
748 of the EAR, Block 11):
    (1) Decrease in unit price or total value;
    (2) Increase in price or quantity if permitted under the shipping 
tolerances in Sec. 750.11 of this part;
    (3) Increase in price that can be justified on the basis of changes 
in point of delivery, port of export, or as a result of transportation 
cost, drayage, port charges, warehousing, currency fluctuations, etc.;
    (4) Establishment of unit or total price in conformance with a 
``price statement'' on a license that permits price to be based on the 
market price at a specified date plus an exporter's mark-up, or like 
basis;
    (5) Change in intermediate consignee if the new intermediate 
consignee is located in the country of ultimate destination as shown on 
the license, except a change in, or addition of, an intermediate 
consignee involving a consolidated shipment;
    (6) Change in continuity of shipment by unloading from carrier at a 
country listed in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of 
the EAR) port not in the country of ultimate destination, without the 
designation of an intermediate consignee on the shipping documents and 
license, provided:
    (i) The purpose is to transfer the shipment to another vessel, 
barge, or vehicle, solely for onforwarding to the country of destination 
shown on the shipping documents and the license;
    (ii) The shipment is moving on a through bill of lading;
    (iii) The carrier is not registered in, owned or controlled by, or 
under charter or lease to a country in Country Group D:1 or E:2 (see 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), or a national of any of these 
countries;

[[Page 296]]

    (iv) The carrier retains custody of the shipment until it is 
delivered to the ultimate consignee; and
    (v) The original bill of lading or air waybill first issued at the 
port of export is delivered with the shipment to the ultimate consignee;
    (7) Change in address of purchaser or ultimate consignee if the new 
address is located within the same country shown on the license; or
    (8) Change in ECCN, unit of quantity, unit price, or wording of the 
item description (where necessary only for the purpose of conforming to 
an official revision in the CCL). This does not cover an actual change 
in the item to be shipped, or an increase in the price or quantity.
    (d) Responsibility of the licensee. If a license is issued to you, 
you become the licensee. The licensee will be held accountable for use 
of the license, whether as a principal (exporting for your own account) 
or as an agent (including an agent acting for the account of a foreign 
principal who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States). 
You, as the licensee, assume responsibility for effecting the export or 
reexport, for proper use of the license, and for due performance of all 
of the license's terms and conditions. The obligations arising under the 
provisions of the EAA and the EAR are the same whether the license 
application is submitted and issued in writing or electronically.
    (e) Prohibited use of a license. No person convicted of a violation 
of any statute specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion 
of the Secretary of Commerce, may apply for any license for a period up 
to 10 years from the date of the conviction. See Sec. 766.25 of the EAR.
    (f) Quantity of commodities authorized. Unlike software and 
technology, commodities will be approved with a quantity or dollar value 
limit. The ``Unit'' paragraph within each CCL commodity entry will list 
a specific ``Unit'' for those commodities controlled by that entry. Any 
license resulting from a license application to export or reexport 
commodities will be licensed in terms of the specified ``Unit''. If a 
commodity is licensed in terms of ``$ value'', the unit of quantity 
commonly used in trade may also be shown on the license. Though this 
unit may be shown on the approved license, the quantity of commodities 
authorized is limited entirely by the total dollar value shown on the 
approved license.
    (g) License validity period. Licenses involving the export or 
reexport of items will generally have a 24-month validity period, unless 
a different validity period has been requested and specifically approved 
by BXA. Exceptions from the 24-month validity period include, license 
applications reviewed and approved as an ``emergency'' (see Sec. 748.4 
(h) of the EAR), license applications for items controlled for short 
supply reasons, and Special Comprehensive Licenses.
    Emergency licenses will expire no later than the last day of the 
calendar month following the month in which the emergency license is 
issued. Licenses for items controlled for short supply reasons will be 
limited to a 12-month validity period. The expiration date will be 
clearly stated on the face of the license. If the expiration date falls 
on a legal holiday (Federal or State), the validity period is 
automatically extended to midnight of the first day of business 
following the expiration date. (See part 752 of the EAR for validity 
periods for Special Comprehensive Licenses.)
    (1) Extended validity period. Validity periods in excess of 24 
months generally will not be granted. BXA will consider granting a 
validity period exceeding 24 months when extenuating circumstances 
warrant such an extension, however, no changes will be approved related 
to any other particular on the license (e.g., parties to the 
transaction, countries of ultimate destination, etc.). For example, an 
extended validity period will generally be granted where the transaction 
is related to a multi-year project, when production lead time will not 
permit an export or reexport during the original validity period of the 
license, when an unforeseen emergency prevents shipment within the 24-
month validity of the license, or for other similar circumstances. A 
continuing requirement to supply spare or replacement parts will not 
normally justify an extended

[[Page 297]]

validity period. Licenses issued in accordance with the emergency 
clearance provisions contained in Sec. 748.4(h) of the EAR will not be 
extended. See Sec. 752.9 of the EAR for information relating to the 
extension of a Special Comprehensive License.
    (2) Request for extension. (i) The applicant must submit a letter in 
writing to request an extension in the validity period of a previously 
approved license. The subject of the letter must be titled: ``Request 
for Validity Period Extension'' and contain the following information:
    (A) The name, address, and telephone number of the requestor;
    (B) A copy of the original license, with the license number, 
validation date, and current expiration date legible; and
    (C) Justification for the extension;
    (ii) It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that all 
applicable support documents remain valid and are in the possession of 
the applicant. If the request for extension is approved, BXA will 
provide the applicant with a written response.
    (h) Specific types of licenses--(1) Licenses for temporary exports 
or reexports. If you have been granted a license for the temporary 
export or reexport of items and you decide not to return the items to 
the United States, you must submit a license application requesting 
authorization to dispose of the items. Except when the items are to be 
used on a temporary basis at a new destination (and returned to the 
United States after such use), you must ensure that your license 
application is accompanied by all documents that would be required if 
you had requested a license to export or reexport the same item directly 
to the new destination.
    (2) Intransit within the United States. If you have been issued a 
license authorizing an intransit shipment (that does not qualify for the 
intransit provisions of License Exception TMP) through the United 
States, your license will be valid only for the export of the intransit 
shipment wholly of foreign origin and for which a Transportation and 
Exportation customs entry or an Immediate Exportation customs entry is 
outstanding.
    (3) Intransit outside the United States. If you have been issued a 
license authorizing unlading or transit through a country listed in the 
General Prohibition Eight contained in Sec. 736.2(b)(8) of the EAR, and 
you did not know the identity of the intermediate consignee at the time 
of the original license application, you must notify BXA in writing once 
you have ascertained the identity of the intermediate consignee. Your 
notification must contain the original license number, and the complete 
name, address, and telephone number of the intermediate consignee. The 
written request must be submitted to BXA at the address listed in 
Sec. 748.2(c) of the EAR.
    (4) Replacement license. If you have been issued a ``replacement'' 
license (for changes to your original license that were not covered in 
paragraph (c) of this section), you must attach the ``replacement'' 
license to the original, and retain both.
    (i) Records. If you have been issued a license you must retain the 
license, and maintain complete records in accordance with part 762 of 
the EAR including any licenses (whether used or unused, valid or 
expired) and all supporting documents and shipping records.
[61 FR 12829, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 64285, Dec. 4, 1996; 62 
FR 25463, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 750.8  Revocation or suspension of licenses.

    (a) Revocation. All licenses for exports or reexports are subject to 
revision, suspension, or revocation, in whole or in part, without notice 
whenever it is known that the EAR have been violated or that a violation 
is about to occur. BXA's Office of Exporter Services may revoke any 
license in which a person who has been convicted of one of the statutes 
specified in section 11(h) of the EAA, at the discretion of the 
Secretary of Commerce, has an interest in the license at the time of the 
conviction. It may be necessary for BXA to stop a shipment or an export 
or reexport transaction at any stage in the process (e.g., in order to 
prevent an unauthorized export or reexport). If a shipment is already en 
route, it may be further necessary for

[[Page 298]]

BXA to order the return or unloading of such shipment at any port of 
call in accordance with the provisions of the EAA.
    (b) Return of revoked or suspended licenses. If BXA revokes or 
suspends a license, the licensee shall return the license immediately 
upon notification that the license has been suspended or revoked. The 
license must be returned to BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) 
of the EAR, Attn:'' Return of Revoked/Suspended License''. All 
applicable supporting documents and records of shipments must be 
retained by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions 
of part 762 of the EAR. If the licensee fails to return a license 
immediately upon notification that it has been suspended or revoked, BXA 
may impose sanctions provided for in part 764 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 750.9  Duplicate licenses.

    (a) Lost, stolen or destroyed. If a license is lost, stolen or 
destroyed, you, as the licensee, may obtain a duplicate of the license 
by submitting a letter to the BXA at the address listed in Sec. 748.2(c) 
of the EAR, Attention: Duplicate License Request''. You must certify in 
your letter:
    (1) That the original license ([number] issued to [name and address 
of licensee]) has been lost, stolen or destroyed;
    (2) The circumstances under which it was lost, stolen or destroyed; 
and
    (3) If the original license is found, the licensee will return 
either the original or duplicate license to the BXA. Note that if 
shipment was made against the original license, those shipments must be 
counted against the duplicate license. If you are issued a duplicate 
license you must retain the duplicate license in accordance with the 
recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR.
    (b) Hong Kong Trade Department. BXA will automatically issue a 
duplicate license whenever the license lists a party in Hong Kong as the 
intermediate consignee, or when Hong Kong is identified as the country 
from which the reexport will take place. The duplicate license will be 
labeled ``Duplicate for Hong Kong Trade Department''. This duplicate 
must be forwarded to the reexporter or intermediate consignee for 
submission to the Hong Kong Trade Department. The original license must 
be retained on file by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeeping 
provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 750.10  Transfers of licenses for exports.

    (a) Authorization. As the licensee, you may not transfer a license 
issued for the export of items from the United States to any other 
party, except with the prior written approval of BXA. BXA may authorize 
a transfer of a license for export to a transferee who is subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, is a principal party in interest, and 
will assume all powers and responsibilities under the license for the 
control of the shipment of the items out of the United States. BXA will 
approve only one transfer of the same license and only transfers of 
licenses to export items.
    (b) How to request the transfer of licenses--(1) Letter from 
licensee. You, as the licensee, must submit a letter in writing to 
request a transfer of a license or licenses. The letter must contain the 
following information:
    (i) The reasons for the requested transfer;
    (ii) Either a list of the outstanding license numbers or a statement 
that all outstanding licenses in the name of the licensee are to be 
transferred, and the total number of such outstanding licenses;
    (iii) A list of all license applications for export to be 
transferred that are pending with BXA, identifying the Application 
Control Number for each, or other information that will assist in 
identifying the pending license applications;
    (iv) Name and address of the person you intend to transfer the 
licenses and license applications to;
    (v) The facts necessitating transfer;
    (vi) A statement as to whether or not any consideration has been, or 
will be, paid for the transfer; and
    (vii) Identification by name of the legal document (certificate, 
agreement, etc.) or other authority by which the new firm name is 
legally established, the new corporation or firm created, or

[[Page 299]]

the assets transferred and showing the effective date of such document 
and the state where filed or recorded.
    (2) Information from transferee. The person to whom you wish to 
transfer your license(s) must provide you a signed letter, that must be 
submitted with your request, containing the following:
    (i) That the transferee is a principal party in interest in the 
transaction covered by the license, or is acting as agent for a 
principal party in interest;
    (ii) That the transferee is subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States;
    (iii) That the transferee assumes all powers and responsibilities 
under the license for the control of the shipment of the items out of 
the United States;
    (iv) Whether any consideration has been, has not been, or will be 
paid for the transfer;
    (v) The name and address of the foreign principal in instances where 
the transferee will make the export as an agent on behalf of a foreign 
principal; and
    (vi) If the license is to be transferred to a subsidiary or firm, or 
if you transfer to the transferee all, or a substantial portion, of your 
assets or business, the transferee must certify that the legal authority 
changing the exporter imposes on the transferee the responsibility to 
accept and fulfill the obligations of the transferor under the 
transactions covered by the license; and
    (vii) The following certification:

    The undersigned hereby certifies that, if license number(s) 
____________ is (are) transferred in accordance with my (our) request, 
any and all documents evidencing the order covered by this (these)

Sec. 750.11  Shipping tolerances.

    (a) Applicability and use of shipping tolerances. Under some 
circumstances, you may use a license issued for the export of items from 
the United States to export more than the quantity or value shown on 
that license. This additional amount is called a shipping tolerance. 
This section tells you, as the licensee, when you may take advantage of 
a shipping tolerance and the amount of shipping tolerance you are 
permitted to use.
    (1) If you have already shipped the full amount approved on your 
license, you may not use this shipping tolerance provision. No further 
shipment may be made under the license.
    (2) The amount of shipping tolerance you are permitted is based on 
the ``Unit'' specified for the item you want to export in the applicable 
ECCN on the CCL (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). You must 
calculate shipping tolerance based on the applicable ``Unit'' whether 
that be Number, Dollar Value, or Area, Weight, or other Measure. You may 
not use any other unit that may appear on your license.
    (b) Calculating shipping tolerances. There are three basic rules, 
one for items licensed by ``Dollar Value'', one for items licensed by 
``Number'', and another for items licensed by ``Area, Weight or other 
Measure''.
    (1) Items licensed by ``Dollar Value''. If the ``Unit'' paragraph in 
the ECCN applicable to your item reads ``Sec. value'' or ``in 
Sec. value'', there is no shipping tolerance. You may not ship more than 
the total dollar value stated on your license.
    (2) Items licensed by ``Number''. If the ``Unit'' paragraph in the 
ECCN applicable to your item reads ``Number'' or ``in Number'', there is 
no shipping tolerance with respect to the number of

[[Page 300]]

units. However, the value of all of your shipments under one license may 
exceed the total dollar value stated on that license by up to 25%.
    (3) Items licensed by ``Area, Weight or Measure''. If the ``Unit'' 
paragraph in the ECCN applicable to your item reads ``kilograms'' or 
``square meters'' or some other unit of area, weight or measure, your 
shipment may exceed the unshipped balance of the area, weight or other 
measure listed on your license by up to 10% and the total dollar value 
shown on your license by up to 25%, unless;
    (i) Your license stipulates a specific shipping tolerance; or
    (ii) Your item is controlled for short supply reasons and a smaller 
tolerance has been established. (See part 754 of the EAR).
    (c) Examples of shipping tolerances.--(1) A license authorizes the 
export of 100,000 kilograms of an item controlled by an ECCN where the 
``Unit'' is stated as ``kilograms'', the total cost of which is 
$1,000,000:
    (i) One shipment. If one shipment is made, the quantity that may be 
exported may not exceed 110,000 kg (10% tolerance on the unshipped Area, 
Weight, or Measure balance), and the total cost of that one shipment may 
not exceed $1,250,000:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
$1,000,000..  (the total value shown on the license)                    
+250,000....  (25% of the total value shown on the license)             
-------------                                                           
$1,250,000..                                                            
                                                                        

    (ii) Two shipments. If the first shipment is for 40,000 kg (valued 
at $400,000), the second shipment may not exceed 66,000 kg (10% of the 
unshipped balance of 60,000 kg (6,000 kg) plus the unshipped balance), 
and the total cost of the second shipment shall not exceed $850,000:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
$600,000....  (the value of the unshipped balance of 60,000 kg)         
+250,000....  (25% of the original total value shown on the license)    
-------------                                                           
$850,000....                                                            
                                                                        

    (iii) Three shipments. If the first shipment is for 40,000 kg 
(valued at $400,000) the second shipment is for 20,000 kg (valued at 
$200,000), the third shipment may not exceed 44,000 kg (10% of the 
unshipped balance of 40,000 kg (4,000 kg) plus the unshipped balance), 
and the total cost of the third shipment can not exceed $650,000:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
$400,000....  (the value of the unshipped balance of 40,000 kg)         
+250,000....  (25% of the original total value on the license)          
-------------                                                           
$650,000....                                                            
                                                                        

    (2) A license authorizes the export of an item controlled by an ECCN 
where the ``Unit'' is stated as ``$ value'', the total cost of which is 
$5,000,000. There is no shipping tolerance on this license because the 
items are controlled by an ECCN where ``$ value'' is the stated 
``Unit''.
    (3) A license authorizes the export of 10 pieces of equipment 
controlled by an ECCN where the ``Unit'' is stated as ``Number'', with a 
total value of $10,000,000 and the export of parts and accessories 
covered by that same entry valued at $1,000,000:
    (i)(A) If one shipment is made, the quantity of equipment that may 
be exported may not exceed 10 pieces of equipment because there is no 
shipping tolerance on the ``number'' of units. That one shipment of 
equipment may not exceed $12,500,000:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
$10,000,000.  (the total value shown on the license)                    
+2,500,000..  (25% of the total value shown on the license)             
-------------                                                           
$12,500,000.                                                            
                                                                        

    (B) If the one shipment includes parts and accessories, those parts 
and accessories may not exceed $1,000,000 because there is no shipping 
tolerance on any commodity licensed in terms of dollar value.
    (ii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valued at 
$4,000,000, the second shipment may not exceed 6 pieces of equipment (no 
tolerance on ``number'') valued at no more than $8,500,000:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
$6,000,000..  (the value of the unshipped 6 pieces).                    
+2,500,000..  (25% of the original total value shown on the license).   
-------------                                                           
$8,500,000..                                                            
                                                                        

    (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts and 
accessories, the second shipment may not exceed $700,000 of parts and 
accessories because there is no shipping tolerance on any commodity 
licensed in terms of dollar value.
    (iii)(A) If the first shipment is for 4 pieces of equipment valued 
at $4,000,000

[[Page 301]]

and the second shipment is for 3 pieces of equipment valued at 
$3,000,000, the third shipment may not exceed 3 pieces of equipment (no 
tolerance on ``number'') valued at no more than $5,500,000:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
$3,000,000..  (the value of the unshipped 3 pieces).                    
+2,500,000..  (25% of the original value shown on the license),         
-------------                                                           
$5,500,000..                                                            
                                                                        

    (B) If the first shipment includes $300,000 of parts and accessories 
and the second shipment includes another $300,000, the third shipment 
may not exceed $400,000 because there is no shipping tolerance on 
commodities licensed in terms of dollar value.

Sec. 752.1  Scope.

    (a)(1) Introduction. In this part, references to the EAR are 
references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part describes the 
provisions of the Special Comprehensive License (SCL). You may apply for 
an SCL, when appropriate, in lieu of a license described in part 748 of 
the EAR, or a License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR, for 
multiple exports and reexports of items subject to the EAR. The SCL 
provides authorization to make specified exports and reexports that are 
otherwise prohibited by General Prohibitions One, Two, and Three 
described in part 736 of the EAR. The existence of an SCL does not 
supersede an exporter's obligation to request a separate license as may 
be required by part 744 of the EAR. Because the Bureau of Export 
Administration (BXA) does not review each individual transaction 
authorized by an SCL, parties to the SCL must have the mechanisms in 
place to ensure that each export and reexport made under an SCL meets 
all the terms and conditions of the license and are in accordance with 
all applicable provisions of the EAR. It is through the design and 
effective implementation of an Internal Control Program (ICP) that the 
SCL holder and the SCL consignee (referred to as ``consignee'' for 
purposes of this part) assure that exports and reexports are not made 
contrary to the EAR.
    (2) Definitions--(i) SCL holder. As used in this part, ``SCL 
holder'' is that party approved on an SCL to perform activities approved 
under the SCL.
    (ii) SCL consignee. As used in this part, ``SCL consignee'' or 
``consignee'' means any party authorized to receive items under the SCL 
and named as a consignee on an approved Form BXA-752, Statement by 
Consignee in Support of Special Comprehensive License.
    (b) ICP requirement. To qualify for an SCL, you must develop an ICP. 
Section 752.11 of this part includes a general description of the 
elements of the ICP, and guidance on which elements your company must 
implement before making shipments under the SCL. The elements of the ICP 
your company will develop reflect the complexity of the activities 
authorized under the SCL, the countries and items involved, and

[[Page 302]]

the relationship between the SCL holder and the approved consignees. BXA 
may require you to include in your ICP any combination of elements, 
depending upon the nature of your SCL application. During your pre-
application consultation required by Sec. 752.5(a)(1), BXA will provide 
you guidance on which elements you must implement.

<R05>
Sec. 752.2  Eligible activities.

    (a) Possible authorizations. Under the SCL, BXA may authorize you to 
perform any number of activities, which can be grouped under the general 
categories of ``service'', ``end-user'', ``distribution'' and ``other'' 
activities. Examples of the general categories include:
    (1) Service activities. Exporting items subject to the EAR as spare 
and replacement parts for servicing or stocking.
    (2) End-user activities. Exporting and reexporting items subject to 
the EAR for use as capital equipment.
    (3) Distribution activities. Exporting and reexporting items subject 
to the EAR for the purpose of resale and reexport by consignees.
    (4) Other activities. Other activities not included in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section may be authorized by BXA under the 
SCL on a case-by-case basis.
    (b) Prohibited activities. The general prohibitions described in 
Sec. 736.2(b)(4) through (10) of the EAR apply to all exports and 
reexports by, and conduct of, all parties approved on your SCL, unless 
you are specifically authorized under the SCL to perform such 
activities, or the particular activity otherwise qualifies for a License 
Exception described in part 740 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 752.3  Eligible items.

    (a) All items subject to the EAR, including items eligible for 
License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR, are eligible for 
export and reexport under the SCL, except:
    (1) Items controlled for missile technology reasons that are 
identified by the letters MT in the applicable ``Reason for Control'' 
paragraph on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (see Supplement No. 1 to 
part 774 of the EAR);

precursors and chemical warfare agents, to destinations listed in 
Country Group D:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR);
    (4) Items controlled for short supply reasons that are identified by 
the letters ``SS'' in the applicable ``Reason for Control'' paragraph on 
the CCL;
    (5) Maritime (civil) nuclear propulsion systems or associated design 
or production software and technology identified in Sec. 744.5 of the 
EAR;
    (6) Communications intercepting devices controlled by ECCN 5A980 on

9A004.a on the CCL;
    (8) Hot section technology for the development, production or 
overhaul of commercial aircraft engines controlled under ECCN 9E003.a.1. 
through a.12. .f, and related controls;
    (9) Items specifically identified as ineligible by BXA on your 
approved SCL; and
    (10) Additional items consistent with international commitments.
    (b) Items controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons that are 
identified by the letters NP in the applicable ``Reason for Control'' 
paragraph on the CCL may be authorized on a case-by-case basis provided 
controls are in place to screen for proscribed end-users or end-uses.
[61 FR 12835, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 54543, Oct. 21, 1996; 
62 FR 25463, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 752.4  Eligible countries.

    (a) General provisions. All countries are eligible under the SCL 
except:
    (1) Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
    (2) Other countries that BXA may designate on a case-by-case basis 
as ineligible to receive items under the SCL.

[[Page 303]]

    (b) Servicing prohibitions. Under the SCL, you may not service any 
item when you know that the item is owned or controlled by, or under the 
lease or charter of, entities in countries identified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section or any national of such countries.


<R05>
Sec. 752.5  Steps you must follow to apply for an SCL.

    (a) Step One: Establish applicant reliability--(1) Pre-application 
consultation. To apply for an SCL, BXA must determine your reliability 
as a potential SCL holder. BXA usually does this through consultation 
with company officials and a review of the criteria identified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section. To determine whether your company 
requires a consultation before you apply for an SCL, contact BXA at the 
address, phone, or telefacsimile numbers included in Sec. 752.17 of this 
part.
    (2) Criteria for determining eligibility. BXA will review the 
following criteria to help determine SCL holder eligibility:
    (i) Evidence of past licensing history and projected, continuous 
large volume exports;
    (ii) Reliability of all parties relative to their compliance with 
the EAR;
    (iii) Commitment of all parties of the necessary resources to 
implement and maintain an adequate ICP; and
    (iv) Evidence of all parties knowledge of all provisions of the EAR.
    (b) Step Two: Establish consignee reliability--(1) Requirements. You 
must make an initial determination of the reliability of all consignees 
that are listed on your application for an SCL, based upon the criteria 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Determining reliability. The criteria that you should take into 
consideration include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Criteria. (A) The proposed consignee has a satisfactory record 
established through BXA pre-license checks, or extensive experience as a 
consignee under any license issued by BXA;
    (B) The proposed consignee is a wholly-owned subsidiary or a

    (C) You have evidence of an established, on-going business 
relationship with the proposed consignee.
    (ii) Exception. The provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section do not preclude the authority of BXA to determine the 
reliability and eligibility of a proposed consignee. BXA may, based upon 
any negative information on the proposed consignees, deny a proposed 
consignee.
    (c) Step Three: Prepare your documentation. Complete Form BXA-748P, 
Multipurpose Application, Form BXA-748P-A, Item Appendix, Form BXA-748P-

Sec. 752.11 of this part. You must indicate whether any of the elements 
of the ICP will not be implemented and explain why these elements were 
deemed inapplicable. Existence of a properly constructed ICP will not 
relieve you of your responsibility to comply with requirements of all 
applicable regulations pertaining to your SCL;
    (4) Comprehensive narrative statement. Prepare a comprehensive 
narrative statement on your company letterhead that includes the 
following information:
    (i) An overview of the total business activity that will be

all records required by Sec. 752.12 of this part and part 762 of the 
EAR.
    (8) Additional certifications. (i) Temporary exports. Proposed 
consignees that plan to exhibit or demonstrate items in countries other 
than those in which they are located or are authorized under an SCL, an 
approved Form BXA-752, or a License Exception provision described in 
Sec. 740.8(a)(2)(iii) of the EAR may obtain permission to do so by 
including the following additional certification on company letterhead, 
and attaching it to Form BXA-752.

    I (We) request authorization to reexport temporarily, for exhibit or

<R05>
Sec. 752.8  SCL application review process.

    (a) Scope. Under an SCL, you are authorized to make multiple exports 
and reexports without review and approval of each individual transaction 
by BXA. To approve an SCL, BXA must be satisfied that the persons 
benefiting from this license will adhere to the conditions of the 
license and the EAR, and that approval of the application will not be 
detrimental to U.S. national security, nonproliferation, or foreign 
policy interests. In reviewing and approving a specific SCL request, BXA 
retains the right to limit the eligibility of items or to prohibit the 
export, reexport, or transfer of items under the SCL to specific firms, 
individuals, or countries.
    (b) Elements of review. To permit BXA to make such judgments, BXA 
will thoroughly analyze your past export and reexport transactions, 
inspect your export and reexport documents, and interview company 
officials of both the applicant and the consignees, as necessary. If BXA 
cannot verify that an appropriate ICP will be implemented upon approval 
of the SCL by BXA, or establish the reliability of the proposed parties 
to the application, it may deny the application, or modify it by 
eliminating certain consignees, items, countries, or activities.
    (c) Order requirement. You do not need to have in your possession an 
order from the proposed consignee at the time you apply for an SCL. 
However, evidence of a consignee's firm intention to place orders on a 
continuing basis is required.
    (d) Criteria for review. BXA will consider the following factors 
during the processing of your SCL application:
    (1) The specific nature of proposed end-use and end-uses;
    (2) The significance of the export in terms of its contribution to 
the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of nuclear or 
chemical or biological weapons, or missiles;
    (3) The types of assurances against design, development, production, 
stockpiling, or use of nuclear or chemical and biological weapons, or 
missiles that are included in the ICP;
    (4) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
    (5) Corporate commitment of the resources necessary to implement and 
maintain an adequate ICP;
    (6) Evidence of past licensing history of the applicant and 
consignees, and projected, continuous large volume exports and/or 
reexports;
    (7) Reliability of all parties;
    (8) Information on all parties' compliance with the provisions of 
the EAR; and
    (9) All parties' knowledge of the EAR.
    (e) Application processing time-frames. Upon receiving an SCL 
application, BXA may review the application for up to two weeks to 
determine whether the SCL application is complete. When all 
documentation requirements are met, BXA will register the application. 
After the date of registration, the SCL application will be processed 
according to the procedures described in part 750 of the EAR.

you remove an item from your SCL. After review of the change by BXA, BXA 
will send you a validated Form BXA-748P and Form BXA-748P-A, if 
applicable. The SCL holder must send a copy of each validated form to 
all applicable consignees and attach a copy to their BXA-752.

will return to the SCL holder two validated copies of Form BXA-752 and 
Form BXA-748P-B, which will include any special instructions that may be 
necessary. You must send one copy of Forms BXA-752 and BXA-748P to the 
relevant consignee.

Sec. 752.11  Internal Control Programs.

    (a) Scope--(1) Introduction. It is through Internal Control Programs 
(ICPs) that the SCL holder and the consignee assure that exports and 
reexports are not made contrary to the EAR. The elements of your ICP 
will reflect the complexity of the activities authorized under the SCL, 
the countries and items involved, and the relationship between the SCL 
holder and the approved consignees.
    (2) General requirements. Prior to making any exports and reexports 
under an SCL, you and your consignees, when required, must implement an 
ICP that is designed to ensure compliance with the SCL and the EAR. This 
section provides an overview of the elements that comprise an ICP. You 
may obtain from BXA at the address found in Sec. 752.17 of this part 
guidelines to assist you in developing an adequate ICP. You must submit 
with your application for an SCL a copy of your proposed ICP, along with 
any consignee ICPs, when required, incorporating the elements described 
in this section, as appropriate. BXA may require you to modify your ICP 
depending upon the activities, items, and destinations requested on your 
application for an SCL.
    (b) Requirements. You may not make any shipments under an SCL until 
you and your consignees, when appropriate, implement all the elements of 
the required ICP. If there are elements that you consider inapplicable, 
you must explain the reasons for this determination at the time of 
application for an SCL. Existence of a properly constructed ICP will not 
relieve the SCL holder of liability for improper use or failure to 
comply with the requirements of the EAR.
    (c) Elements of an ICP. Following is a list of ICP elements. The 
specific elements that should be included in your ICP depend upon the 
complexity of the activities authorized under your SCL, the countries 
and items involved, and the relationship between the SCL holder and the 
approved consignees.
    (1) A clear statement of corporate policy communicated to all levels 
of the firm involved in exports and reexports, traffic, and related 
functions, emphasizing the importance of SCL compliance;
    (2) Identification of positions (and maintenance of current list of 
individuals occupying the positions) in the SCL holder firm and 
consignee firms responsible for compliance with the requirements of the 
SCL procedure;
    (3) A system for timely distribution to consignees and verification 
of receipt by consignees of the Denied Persons List (Supplement No. 2 to 
part 764 of the EAR) and other regulatory materials necessary to ensure 
compliance;
    (4) A system for screening items, training and servicing 
transactions against Denied Persons List (Supplement No. 2 to part 764 
of the EAR) and any relevant updates to the Denied Persons List;
    (5) A system for assuring compliance with items and destination 
restrictions, including controls over reexports by consignees and direct 
exports to consignee customers;
    (6) A compliance review program covering the SCL holder and 
extending to all consignees;
    (7) A system for assuring compliance with controls on exports and 
reexports of nuclear items and to nuclear end-uses described in 
Secs. 742.3 and 744.2 of the EAR;
    (8) An on-going program for informing and educating employees 
responsible for processing transactions involving items received under 
the SCL about applicable regulations, limits, and restrictions of the 
SCL;
    (9) A program for recordkeeping as required by the EAR;

[[Page 312]]

    (10) An order processing system that documents employee clearance of 
transactions in accordance with applicable elements of the company ICP;
    (11) A system for monitoring in-transit shipments and shipments to 
bonded warehouses and free trade zones;
    (12) A system for notifying BXA promptly if the SCL holder knows 
that a consignee is not in compliance with terms of the SCL;
    (13) A system to screen against customers who are known to have, or 
are suspected of having, unauthorized dealings with specially designated 
regions and countries for which nonproliferation controls apply;
    (i) The signs of potential diversion that you should take into 
consideration include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (A) The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant to offer 
information about the end-use (or end-user) of a product.
    (B) The product's capabilities do not fit the buyer's line of 
business; for example, a small bakery places an order for several 
sophisticated lasers.
    (C) The product ordered is incompatible with the technical level of 
the country to which the product is being shipped. For example, 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment would be of little use in a 
country without an electronics industry.
    (D) The customer has little or no business background. For example, 
financial information unavailable from normal commercial sources and 
corporate principals unknown by trade sources.
    (E) The customer is willing to pay cash for a very expensive item 
when the terms of the sale call for financing.
    (F) The customer is unfamiliar with the product's performance 
characteristics but still wants the product.
    (G) Routine installation, training or maintenance services are 
declined by the customer.
    (H) Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are planned for out-of-
the-way destinations.
    (I) A freight forwarding firm is listed as the product's final 
destination.
    (J) The shipping route is abnormal for the product and destination.
    (K) Packaging is inconsistent with the stated method of shipment or 
destination.
    (L) When questioned, the buyer is evasive or unclear about whether 
the purchased product is for domestic use, export, or reexport.
    (M) Customer uses only a ``P.O. Box'' address or has facilities that 
appear inappropriate for the items ordered.
    (N) Customer's order is for parts known to be inappropriate, or for 
which the customer appears to have no legitimate need (e.g., there is no 
indication of prior authorized shipment of system for which the parts 
are sought).
    (O) Customer is known to have, or is suspected of having 
unauthorized dealings with parties and/or destinations in ineligible 
countries.
    (ii) When any of the above characteristics have been identified, but 
through follow-up inquiries or investigation have not been 
satisfactorily resolved, the consignee should not transact any business 
with the customer under the SCL. Apply for a license according to part 
748 of the EAR. You should explain the basis for the concern regarding 
the proposed customer, and state that you are an SCL consignee. Also, 
cite the SCL number, and your consignee number;
    (14) A system for assuring compliance with controls over exports and 
reexports for missile-related end-uses and end-users described in 
Sec. 744.3 of the EAR;
    (15) A system for assuring compliance with control over exports and 
reexports of chemical precursors and biological agents and related items 
and end-uses described in Secs. 742.2 and 744.4 of the EAR;
[61 FR 12835, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25466, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 752.12  Recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) SCL holder and consignees. In addition to the recordkeeping 
requirements of part 762 of the EAR, the SCL holder and each consignee 
must maintain copies of manuals, guidelines, policy statements, internal 
audit procedures, reports, and other documents making up the ICP of each 
party included under an SCL. Also, all parties must maintain copies of 
the most current Denied Persons List (see Supplement No. 2 to

[[Page 313]]

part 764 of the EAR) as well as all updates, and all other regulatory 
materials necessary to ensure compliance with the SCL, such as relevant 
changes to the EAR, product classification, additions, deletions, or 
other administrative changes to the SCL, transmittal letters and 
consignee's confirmations of receipt of these materials.
    (b) Consignees. All consignees must retain all records of the types 
of activities identified in Sec. 752.2(a)(3) of this part. Records on 
such sales or reexports must include the following:
    (1) Full name and address of individual or firm to whom sale or 
reexport was made;
    (2) Full description of each item sold or reexported;
    (3) Units of quantity and value of each item sold or reexported; and
    (4) Date of sale or reexport.


<R05>
Sec. 752.13  Inspection of records.

    (a) Availability of records. You and all consignees must make 
available all of the records required by Sec. 752.12 of this part and 
Sec. 762.2 of the EAR for inspection, upon request, by BXA or by any 
other representative of the U.S. Government, in accordance with part 762 
of the EAR.
    (b) Relationship of foreign laws. Foreign law may prohibit 
inspection of records by a U.S. Government representative in the foreign 
country where the records are located. In that event, the consignee must 
submit with the required copies of Form BXA-752 an alternative 
arrangement for BXA to review consignee activities and determine whether 
or not the consignee has complied with U.S. export control laws and 
regulations, which must be approved by BXA.
    (c) Failure to comply. Parties failing to comply with requests to 
inspect documents may be subject to orders denying export privileges 
described in part 764 of the EAR or to the administrative actions 
described in part 766 of the EAR.


<R05>
Sec. 752.14  System reviews.

    (a) Post-license system reviews. BXA may conduct system reviews of 
the SCL holder as well as any consignee. Generally, BXA will give 
reasonable notice to SCL holders and consignees in advance of a system 
review. The review will involve interviews with company officials, the 
inspection of records, and the review of ICPs. BXA may conduct special 
unannounced system reviews if BXA has reason to believe an SCL holder or 
consignee has improperly used or has failed to comply with the SCL.
    (b) Other reviews. BXA may require an SCL holder or consignee to 
submit to its office a list of all sales made under the SCL during a 
specified time-frame. Also, BXA may request from any consignee a list of 
transactions during a specified period involving direct shipments of 
items received under SCLs to customers of other consignees and sales to 
customers in reexport territories authorized by BXA on the consignee's 
validated Form BXA-752.


<R05>
Sec. 752.15  Export clearance.

    (a) Shipper's Export Declaration (SED). The SED covering an export 
made under an SCL must be prepared in accordance with standard 
instructions described in Sec. 758.3 of the EAR. If the SCL holder has 
implemented the Bureau of Census Monthly Reporting System, the SCL 
holder must comply with the Census requirements.
    (1) Item descriptions. Item descriptions on the SED must indicate 
specifically the ECCN and item description conforming to the applicable 
CCL description and incorporating any additional information where 
required by Schedule B; (e.g., type, size, name of specific item, etc.).
    (2) Value of shipments. There is no value limitation on shipments 
under the SCL; however, you must indicate the value of each shipment on 
the SED.
    (3) SCL number. The SED must include the SCL number followed by a 
blank space, and then the consignee number identifying the SCL's 
approved consignee to whom the shipment is authorized.
    (b) Destination control statement. The SCL holder and consignees 
must enter a destination control statement on all copies of the bill of 
lading or air way-bill, and the commercial invoice covering exports 
under the SCL, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 758.6 of the 
EAR. Use of a destination control

[[Page 314]]

statement does not preclude the consignee from reexporting to any of the 
SCL holder's other approved consignees or to other countries for which 
specific prior approval has been received from BXA. In such instances, 
reexport is not contrary to U.S. law and, therefore, is not prohibited. 
Another destination control statement may be required or approved by BXA 
on a case-by-case basis.
[61 FR 12835, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25466, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 752.16  Administrative actions.

    (a)(1) If BXA is not satisfied that you or other parties to the SCL 
are complying with all conditions and requirements of the SCL, or that 
ICPs employed by parties to such licenses are not adequate, BXA may, in 
addition to any enforcement action pursuant to part 764 of the EAR, take 
any licensing action it deems appropriate, including the following:
    (i) Suspend the privileges under the SCL in whole or in part, or 
impose other restrictions;
    (ii) Revoke the SCL in whole or in part;
    (iii) Prohibit consignees from receiving items authorized under the 
SCL, or otherwise restrict their activities under the SCL;
    (iv) Restrict items that may be shipped under the SCL;
    (v) Require that certain exports, transfers or reexports be 
individually authorized by BXA;
    (vi) Restrict parties to whom consignees may sell under the SCL; and
    (vii) Require that an SCL holder provide an audit report to BXA of 
selected consignees or overseas operations.
    (2) Whenever necessary to protect the national interest of the U.S., 
BXA may take any licensing action it deems appropriate, without regard 
to contracts or agreements entered into before such administrative 
action, including those described in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (vii) 
of this section.
    (b) Appeals. Actions taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
may be appealed under the provisions of part 756 of the EAR.

<R05>
Sec. 754.2  Crude oil.

    (a) License requirement. As indicated by the SS notation in the 
``License Requirements'' section of ECCN 1C981 on the CCL (Supplement 
No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR), a license is required for the export of 
crude oil to all destinations, including Canada. See paragraph (h) of 
this section for a License Exception permitting the export of certain 
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, paragraph (i) of this section 
for a License Exception for certain shipments of samples, and paragraph 
(j) of this section for a License Exception for exports of oil 
transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted pursuant to section 
203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1652). 
``Crude oil'' is defined as a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in 
liquid phase in underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric 
pressure after passing through surface separating facilities and which 
has not been processed through a crude oil distillation tower. Included 
are reconstituted crude petroleum, and lease condensate and liquid 
hydrocarbons produced from tar sands, gilsonite, and oil shale. Drip 
gases are also included, but topped crude oil, residual oil, and other 
finished and unfinished oils are excluded.
    (b) License policy. (1) BXA will approve applications to export 
crude oil for the following kinds of transactions if BXA determines that 
the export is consistent with the specific requirements pertinent to 
that export:
    (i) Exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet (see paragraph (d) of this 
section);
    (ii) Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein (see paragraph 
(e) of this section);
    (iii) Exports in connection with refining or exchange of strategic 
petroleum reserve oil (see paragraph (f) of this section);
    (iv) Exports of heavy California crude oil up to an average volume 
not to exceed 25 MB/D (see paragraph (g) of this section);
    (v) Exports that are consistent with international agreements as 
described in the statutes listed in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (vi) Exports that are consistent with findings made by the President 
under an applicable statute, including the statutes described in 
paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (vii) Exports of foreign origin crude oil where, based on written 
documentation satisfactory to BXA, the exporter can demonstrate that the 
oil is not of U.S. origin and has not been commingled with oil of U.S. 
origin. See paragraph (h) of this section for the provisions of License 
Exception SPR permitting exports of certain crude oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve.
    (2) BXA will review other applications to export crude oil on a 
case-by-case basis and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, generally will approve such applications if BXA determines that 
the proposed export is consistent with the national interest and the 
purposes of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). Although BXA 
will consider all applications for approval, generally, the following 
kinds of transactions will be among those that BXA will determine to be 
in the national interest and consistent with the purposes of EPCA.
    (i) The export is part of an overall transaction:
    (A) That will result directly in the importation into the United 
States of an equal or greater quantity and an equal or better quality of 
crude oil or of a quantity and quality of petroleum products listed in 
Supplement No. 1 to this part that is not less than the quantity and 
quality of commodities that would be derived from the refining of the 
crude oil for which an export license is sought;
    (B) That will take place only under contracts that may be terminated 
if the petroleum supplies of the United States are interrupted or 
seriously threatened; and

[[Page 319]]

    (C) In which the applicant can demonstrate that, for compelling 
economic or technological reasons that are beyond the control of the 
applicant, the crude oil cannot reasonably be marketed in the United 
States.
    (ii) Exports involving temporary exports or exchanges that are 
consistent with the exceptions from the restrictions of the statutes 
listed in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Additional statutory controls. (1) The following statutes 
provide controls on the export of domestically produced crude oil based 
on its place of origin or mode of transport. If such other statutory 
controls apply, an export may only be approved if the President makes 
the findings required by the applicable law.
    (i) Section 201 of Public Law 104-58, entitled ``Exports of Alaskan 
North Slope Oil,'' provides for exports of domestically produced crude 
oil transported by pipeline over rights-of-way granted pursuant to 
section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 
1652) (``TAPS crude oil''). The President made a determination on April 
28, 1996.
    (ii) The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 restricts exports of 
domestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over rights-of-
way granted pursuant to section 28(u) of that Act (30 U.S.C. 185(u)) 
(``MLA'').
    (iii) The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act restricts exports of 
crude oil produced from the outer Continental Shelf (29 U.S.C. 1354) 
(``OCSLA'').
    (iv) The Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act restricts the 
export of crude oil produced from the naval petroleum reserves (10 
U.S.C. 7430) (``NPRPA'').
    (2) Supplement No. 3 to this part describes the relevant statutory 
provisions. In cases where a particular statute applies, a Presidential 
finding is necessary before the export can be authorized. You should 
note that in certain cases it is possible that more than one statute 
could apply to a particular export of crude oil.
    (d) Exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet. The licensing policy is to 
approve applications for exports of crude oil that was derived from the 
state-owned submerged lands of Alaska's Cook Inlet and has not been, or 
will not be, transported by a pipeline over a federal right-of-way 
subject to the MLA or the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization 
Act.<SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\ On November 6, 1985, the Secretary of Commerce determined that 
the export of crude oil derived from State waters in Alaska's Cook Inlet 
is consistent with the national interest and the purposes of the Energy 
Policy and Conservation Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Exports to Canada for consumption or use therein. (1) Except for 
TAPS crude oil, the licensing policy is to approve applications for 
exports of crude oil to Canada for consumption or use therein.
    (2) The licensing policy for TAPS crude oil is to approve 
applications for an average of no more than 50,000 barrels of oil per 
day for consumption or use in Canada, subject to the following 
procedures and conditions:
    (i) Any ocean transportation of the commodity will be made by 
vessels documented for United States coastwise trade under 46 U.S.C. 
12106. Only barge voyages between the State of Washington and Vancouver, 
British Columbia, and comparable barge movements across waters between 
the U.S. and Canada may be excluded from this requirement. The Bureau of 
Export Administration will determine, in consultation with the Maritime 
Administration, whether such transportation is ``ocean'' transportation; 
and
    (ii) Authorization to export TAPS crude oil will be granted on a 
quarterly basis. Applications will be accepted by BXA no earlier than 
two months prior to the beginning of the calendar quarter in question, 
but must be received no later than the 25th day of the second month 
preceding the calendar quarter. For example, for the calendar quarter 
beginning April 1 and ending June 30, applications will be accepted 
beginning February 1, but must be received no later than February 25.
    (iii) The quantity stated on each application must be the total 
number of barrels for the quarter, not a per-day rate. This quantity 
must not exceed 50,000 barrels times the number of calendar days in the 
quarter.
    (iv) Each application must include support documents providing 
evidence that the applicant has either:

[[Page 320]]

    (A) Title to the quantity of barrels stated in the application; or
    (B) A contract to purchase the quantity of barrels stated in the 
application.
    (v) The quantity of barrels authorized on each license for export 
during the calendar quarter will be determined by the BXA as a prorated 
amount based on:
    (A) The quantity requested on each license application; and
    (B) The total number of barrels that may be exported by all license 
holders during the quarter (50,000 barrels per day multiplied by the 
number of calendar days during the quarter).
    (vi) Applicants may combine their licensed quantities for as many as 
four consecutive calendar quarters into one or more shipments, provided 
that the validity period of none of the affected licenses has expired.
    (vii) BXA will carry forward any portion of the 50,000 barrels per 
day quota that has not been allocated during a calendar quarter, except 
that no un-allocated portions will be carried over to a new calendar 
year. The un-allocated volume for a calendar quarter will be added, 
until expended, to the quotas available for each quarter through the end 
of the calendar year.
    (f) Refining or exchange of Strategic Petroleum Reserve Oil. (1) 
Exports of crude oil withdrawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
(SPR) will be approved if BXA, in consultation with the Department of 
Energy, determines that such exports will directly result in the 
importation into the United States of refined petroleum products that 
are needed in the United States and that otherwise would not be 
available for importation without the export of the crude oil from the 
SPR.
    (2) Licenses may be granted to export, for refining or exchange 
outside of the United States, SPR crude oil that will be sold and 
delivered, pursuant to a drawdown and distribution of the SPR, in 
connection with an arrangement for importing refined petroleum products 
into the United States.
    (3) BXA will approve license applications subject to the following 
conditions:
    (i) You must provide BXA evidence of the following:
    (A) A title to the quantity of barrels of SPR crude stated in the 
application; or
    (B) A contract to purchase, for importation, into the United States 
the quantity of barrels of SPR crude stated in the application.
    (ii) The following documentation must be submitted to BXA no later 
than fourteen days following the date that the refined petroleum 
products are imported in the U.S. in exchange for the export of SPR 
crude:
    (A) Evidence that the exporter of the SPR crude has title to or a 
contract to purchase refined petroleum product;
    (B) A copy of the shipping manifest that identifies the refined 
petroleum products; and
    (C) A copy of the entry documentation required by the U.S. Customs 
Service that show the refined petroleum products were imported into the 
United States, or a copy of the delivery receipt when the refined 
petroleum products are for delivery to the U.S. military outside of the 
United States.
    (4) You must complete both the export of the SPR crude and the 
import of the refined petroleum products no later than 30 days following 
the issuance of the export license, except in the case of delivery to 
the U.S. military outside of the United States, in which case the 
delivery of the refined petroleum products must be completed no later 
than the end of the term of the contract with the Department of Defense.
    (g) Exports of certain California crude oil. The export of 
California heavy crude oil having a gravity of 20.0 degrees API or 
lower, at an average volume not to exceed 25 MB/D, will be authorized as 
follows.
    (1) Applicants must submit their applications on Form BXA-748 to the 
following address: Office of Exporter Services, ATTN: Short Supply 
Program--Petroleum, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of 
Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
    (2) The quantity stated on each application must be the total number 
of barrels proposed to be exported under the license--not a per-day 
rate. This quantity must not exceed 25 percent of the annual authorized 
export quota.

[[Page 321]]

Potential applicants may inquire of BXA as to the amount of the annual 
authorized export quota available.
    (3) Each application shall be accompanied by a certification by the 
applicant that the California heavy crude oil:
    (i) Has a gravity of 20.0 degrees API or lower;
    (ii) Was produced within the state of California, including its 
submerged state lands;
    (iii) Was not produced or derived from a U.S. Naval Petroleum 
Reserve; and
    (iv) Was not produced from submerged lands of the U.S. Outer 
Continental Shelf.
    (4) Each license application must be based on an order, and be 
accompanied by documentary evidence of such an order (e.g., a letter of 
intent).
    (5) BXA will adhere to the following procedures for licensing 
exports of California heavy crude oil:
    (i) BXA will issue licenses for approved applications in the order 
in which the applications are received (date-time stamped upon receipt 
by BXA), with the total quantity authorized for any one license not to 
exceed 25 percent of the annual authorized volume of California heavy 
crude oil.
    (ii) BXA will approve only one application per month for each 
company and its affiliates.
    (iii) BXA will consider the following factors (among others) when 
determining what action should be taken on individual license 
applications:
    (A) The number of licenses to export California heavy crude oil that 
have been issued to the applicant or its affiliates during the then-
current calendar year;
    (B) The number of applications pending in BXA that have been 
submitted by applicants who have not previously been issued licenses 
under this section to export California heavy crude oil during the then-
current calendar year; and
    (C) The percentage of the total amount of California heavy crude oil 
authorized under other export licenses previously issued to the 
applicant pursuant to this section that has actually been exported by 
the applicant.
    (iv) BXA will approve applications contingent upon the licensee 
providing documentation meeting the requirements of both 
paragraphs(g)(5)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section prior to any export 
under the license:
    (A) Documentation showing that the applicant has or will acquire 
title to the quantity of barrels stated in the application. Such 
documentation shall be either:
    (1) An accepted contract or bill of sale for the quantity of barrels 
stated in the application; or
    (2) A contract to purchase the quantity of barrels stated in the 
application, which may be contingent upon issuance of an export license 
to the applicant.
    (B) Documentation showing that the applicant has a contract to 
export the quantity of barrels stated in the application. The contract 
may be contingent upon issuance of the export license to the applicant.
    (v) BXA will carry forward any portion of the 25 MB/D quota that has 
not been licensed, except that no unallocated portions will be carried 
forward more than 90 days into a new calendar year. Applications to 
export against any carry-forward must be filed with BXA by January 15 of 
the carry-forward year.
    (vi) BXA will return to the available authorized export quota any 
portion of the 25 MB/D per day quota that has been licensed, but not 
shipped, during the 90-day validity period of the license.
    (vii) BXA will not carry over to the next calendar year pending 
applications from the previous year.
    (6) License holders:
    (i) Have 90 calendar days from the date the license was issued to 
export the quantity of California heavy crude oil authorized on the 
license. Within 30 days of any export under the license, the exporter 
must provide BXA with a certified statement confirming the date and 
quantity of California heavy crude oil exported.
    (ii) Must submit to BXA, prior to any export under the license, the 
documentation required by paragraph (g)(5)(iv) of this section.

[[Page 322]]

    (iii) May combine authorized quantities into one or more shipments, 
provided that the validity period of none of the affected licenses has 
expired.
    (iv) Are prohibited from transferring the license to another party 
without prior written authorization from BXA.
    (7) BXA will allow a 10 percent tolerance on the unshipped balance 
based upon the volume of barrels it has authorized. BXA will allow a 25 
percent shipping tolerance on the total dollar value of the license. See 
Sec. 750.11 of the EAR for an explanation of shipping tolerances.
    (h) License Exception for certain shipments from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserves (SPR). Subject to the requirements set forth in this 
paragraph, License Exception SPR may be used to export without a license 
foreign origin crude oil imported and owned by a foreign government or 
its representative which is imported for storage in, and stored in, the 
United States Strategic Petroleum Reserves pursuant to an appropriate 
agreement with the U.S. Government or an agency thereof. If such foreign 
origin oil is commingled with other oil in the SPR, such export is 
authorized under License Exception SPR only if the crude oil being 
exported is of the same quantity and of comparable quality as the 
foreign origin crude oil that was imported for storage in the SPR and 
the Department of Energy certifies this fact to BXA.
    (1) The requirements and restrictions described in Secs. 740.1 and 
740.2 of the EAR that apply to all License Exceptions also apply to the 
use of License Exception SPR.
    (2) A person exporting crude oil pursuant to this License Exception 
must enter on any required Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) the letter 
code ``SS-SPR.''
    (i) License Exception for certain sample shipments. Subject to the 
requirements set forth in this paragraph, License Exception SS-SAMPLE 
may be used to export crude oil for analytic and testing purposes.
    (1) An exporter may ship up to 10 barrels of crude oil to any one 
end-user annually, up to an annual cumulative limit of 100 barrels per 
exporter.
    (2) The requirements and restrictions described in Secs. 740.1 and 
740.2 of the EAR that apply to all License Exceptions also apply to the 
use of License Exception SPR.
    (3) A person exporting crude oil pursuant to this License Exception 
must enter on any required Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) the letter 
code ``SS-SAMPLE''.
    (j) License Exception for exports of TAPS Crude Oil. (1) License 
Exception TAPS may be used to export oil transported over right-of-way 
granted pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline 
Authorization Act (TAPS), provided the following conditions are met:
    (i) The TAPS oil is transported by a vessel documented under the 
laws of the United States and owned by a citizen of the United States 
(in accordance with section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. app. 
802));
    (ii) All tankers involved in the TAPS export trade use the same 
route that they do for shipments to Hawaii until they reach a point 300 
miles due south of Cape Hinchinbrook Light and then turn toward Asian 
destinations. After reaching that point, tankers in the TAPS oil export 
trade must remain outside of the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic 
Zone, as defined in 16 U.S.C. 1802(6). Tankers returning from foreign 
ports to Valdez, Alaska must abide by the same restrictions, in reverse, 
on their return route. This condition shall not be construed to limit 
any statutory, treaty or Common Law rights and duties imposed upon and 
enjoyed by tankers in the TAPS oil export trade, including, but not 
limited to, force majeure and maritime search and rescue rules; and
    (iii) The owner or operator of a tanker exporting TAPS oil shall:
    (A) Adopt a mandatory program of deep water ballast exchange (i.e., 
at least 2,000 meters water depth). Exceptions can be made at the 
discretion of the captain only in order to ensure the safety of the 
vessel and crew. Records must be maintained in accordance with paragraph 
(j)(3) of this section.
    (B) Be equipped with satellite-based communications systems that 
will enable the Coast Guard independently to determine the tanker's 
location; and
    (C) Maintain a Critical Area Inspection Plan for each tanker in the 
TAPS

[[Page 323]]

oil export trade in accordance with the U.S. Coast Guard's Navigation 
and Inspection Circular No. 15-91 as amended, which shall include an 
annual internal survey of the vessel's cargo block tanks.
    (2) Shipper's Export Declaration. In addition to the requirements of 
paragraph (j)(1) of this section, for each export under License 
Exceptions TAPS, the exporter must file with BXA a Shipper's Export 
Declaration (SED) covering the export not later than 21 days after the 
export has occurred. The SED shall be sent to the following address: 
Manager, Short Supply Program, Department of Commerce, Office of 
Chemical and Biological Controls and Treaty Compliance, Bureau of Export 
Administration, Room 2075, Washington, D.C. 20230.
    (3) Recordkeeping requirements for deep water ballast exchange. (i) 
As required by paragraph (j)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the master of 
each vessel carrying TAPS oil under the provisions of this section shall 
keep records that include the following information, and provide such 
information to the Captain of the Port (COTP), U.S. Coast Guard, upon 
request:
    (A) The vessel's name, port of registry, and official number or call 
sign;

Supplement No. 3 to Part 754--Statutory Provisions Dealing With Exports 
                              of Crude Oil

[The statutory material published in this supplement is for the 
information of the reader only. See the U.S. Code for the official text 
of this material.]

                            Public Law 104-58

              SEC. 201. EXPORTS OF ALASKAN NORTH SLOPE OIL.

    Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 185(s)) is amended 
by amending subsection(s) to read as follows:

                  ``EXPORTS OF ALASKAN NORTH SLOPE OIL

    (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subsection and 
notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or any other provision 
of laws (including any regulation) applicable to the export of oil 
transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted pursuant to section 
203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1652), 
such oil may be exported unless the President finds that exportation of 
this oil is not in the national interest. The President shall make his 
national interest determination within five months of the date of 
enactment of this subsection. In evaluating whether exports of this oil 
are in the national interest, the President shall at a minimum 
consider--
    (A) whether exports of this oil would diminish the total quantity or 
quality of petroleum available to the United States;
    (B) the results of an appropriate environmental review, including 
consideration of appropriate measures to mitigate any potential adverse 
effects of exports of this oil on the environment, which shall be 
completed within four months of the date of the enactment of this 
subsection; and
    (C) whether exports of this oil are likely to cause sustained 
material oil supply shortages or sustained oil prices significantly 
above world market levels that would cause sustained material adverse 
employment effects in the United States or that would cause substantial 
harm to consumers, including noncontiguous States and Pacific 
territories.
    If the President determines that exports of this oil are in the 
national interest, he may impose such terms and conditions (other than a 
volume limitation) as are necessary or appropriate to ensure that such 
exports are consistent with the national interest.
    (2) Except in the case of oil exported to a country with which the 
United States entered into a bilateral international oil supply 
agreement before November 26, 1979, or

[[Page 328]]

to a country pursuant to the International Emergency Oil Sharing Plan of 
the International Energy Agency, any oil transported by pipeline over 
right-of-way granted pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-Alaska 
Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1652) shall, when exported, be 
transported by a vessel documented under the laws of the United States 
and owned by a citizen of the United States (as determined in accordance 
with section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. App. 802)).
    (3) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the authority of the 
President under the Constitution, the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act ( ) 
U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or Part B of title II of the Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271-76) to prohibit exports.
    (4) The Secretary of Commerce shall issue any rules necessary for 
implementation of the President's national interest determination, 
including any licensing requirements and conditions, within 30 days of 
the date of such determination by the President. The Secretary of 
Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in administering the 
provisions of this subsection.
    (5) If the Secretary of Commerce finds that exporting oil under 
authority of this subsection has caused sustained material oil supply 
shortage or sustained oil prices significantly above world market levels 
and further finds that these supply shortages or price increases have 
caused or are likely to cause sustained material adverse employment 
effects in the United States, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation 
with the Secretary of Energy, shall recommend, and the President may 
take, appropriate action concerning exports of this oil, which may 
include modifying or revoking authority to export such oil.
    (6) Administrative action under this subsection is not subject to 
sections 551 and 553 through 559 of title 5, United States Code.

                        MINERAL LANDS LEASING ACT

                            30 U.S.C. 185(u)

                          Limitations on Export

    Any domestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over 
rights-of-way granted pursuant to this section, except such crude oil 
which is either exchanged in similar quantity for convenience or 
increased efficiency of transportation with persons or the government of 
an adjacent foreign state, or which is temporarily exported for 
convenience or increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an 
adjacent foreign state and reenters the United States, shall be subject 
to all of the limitations and licensing requirements of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 and following) and, in 
addition, before any crude oil subject this section may be exported 
under the limitations and licensing requirements and penalty and 
enforcement provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979 the 
President must make and publish an express finding that such exports 
will not diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum available 
to the United States, and are in the national interest and are in accord 
with the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979: Provided, 
That the President shall submit reports to the Congress containing 
findings made under this section, and after the date of receipt of such 
report Congress shall have a period of sixty calendar days, thirty days 
of which Congress must have been in session, to consider whether exports 
under the terms of this section are in the national interest. If the 
Congress within this time period passes a concurrent resolution of 
disapproval stating disagreement with the President's finding concerning 
the national interest, further exports made pursuant to the 
aforementioned Presidential finding shall cease.

                 NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVES PRODUCTION ACT

                             10 Sec. 7430(e)

    Any petroleum produced from the naval petroleum reserves, except 
such petroleum which is either exchanged in similar quantities for 
convenience or increased efficiency of transportation with persons or 
the government of an adjacent foreign state, or which is temporarily 
exported for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation 
across parts of an adjacent foreign state and reenters the United 
States, shall be subject to all of the limitations and licensing 
requirements of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 
2401 et seq.) and, in addition, before any petroleum subject to this 
section may be exported under the limitations and licensing requirement 
and penalty and enforcement provisions of the Export Administration Act 
of 1979, the President must make and publish an express finding that 
such exports will not diminish the total quality or quantity of 
petroleum available to the United States and that such exports are in 
the national interest and are in accord with the Export Administration 
Act of 1979.

                    OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF LANDS ACT

                             43 U.S.C. 1354

    (a) Application of Export Administration provisions.
    Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, any oil or gas 
produced from the outer Continental Shelf shall be subject to the 
requirements and provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1969. 
Note that

[[Page 329]]

the Export Administration Act of 1969, referred to in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of the Supplement, terminated on September 30, 1979, pursuant to the 
terms of that Act.
    (b) Condition precedent to exportation; express finding by President 
of no increase in reliance on imported oil or gas.
    Before any oil or gas subject to this section may be exported under 
the requirements and provisions of the Export Administration Act of 
1969, the President shall make and publish an express finding that such 
exports will not increase reliance on imported oil or gas, are in the 
national interest, and are in accord with the provisions of the Export 
Administration Act of 1969.
    (c) Report of findings by President to Congress; joint resolution of 
disagreement with findings of President.
    The President shall submit reports to Congress containing findings 
made under this section, and after the date of receipt of such reports 
Congress shall have a period of sixty calendar days, thirty days of 
which Congress must have been in session, to consider whether export 
under the terms of this section are in the national interest. If the 
Congress within such time period passes a concurrent resolution of 
disapproval stating disagreement with the President's finding concerning 
the national interest, further exports made pursuant to such 
Presidential findings shall cease.
    (d) Exchange or temporary exportation of oil and gas for convenience 
or efficiency of transportation.
    The provisions of this section shall not apply to any oil or gas 
which is either exchanged in similar quantity for convenience or 
increase efficiency of transportation with persons or the government of 
a foreign state, or which is temporarily exported for convenience or 
increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an adjacent 
foreign state and reenters the United States, or which is exchanged or 
exported pursuant to an existing international agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 756.2  Appeal from an administrative action.

    (a) Review and appeal officials. The Under Secretary may delegate to 
the Deputy Under Secretary for Export Administration or to another BXA 
official the authority to review and decide the appeal. In addition, the 
Under Secretary may designate any BXA official to be an appeals 
coordinator to assist in the review and processing of an appeal under 
this part. The responsibilities of an appeals coordinator may include 
presiding over informal hearings.
    (b) Appeal procedures--(1) Filing. An appeal under this part must be 
received by the Under Secretary for Export Administration, Bureau of 
Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-3886C, 14th 
Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20230, not later 
than 45 days after the date appearing on the written notice of 
administrative action.
    (2) Content of appeal. The appeal must include a full written 
statement in support of appellant's position. The appeal must include a 
precise statement of why the appellant believes the administrative 
action has a direct and adverse effect and should be reversed or 
modified. The Under Secretary may request additional information that

[[Page 330]]

would be helpful in resolving the appeal, and may accept additional 
submissions. The Under Secretary will not ordinarily accept any 
submission filed more than 30 days after the filing of the appeal or of 
any requested submission.
    (3) Request for informal hearing. In addition to the written 
statement submitted in support of an appeal, an appellant may request, 
in writing, at the time an appeal is filed, an opportunity for an 
informal hearing. The Under Secretary may grant or deny a request for an 
informal hearing. Any hearings will be held in the District of Columbia 
unless the Under Secretary determines, based upon good cause shown, that 
another location would be better.
    (4) Informal hearing procedures--(i) Presentations. The Under 
Secretary shall provide an opportunity for the appellant to make an oral 
presentation based on the materials previously submitted by the 
appellant or made available by the Department in connection with the 
administrative action. The Under Secretary may require that any facts in 
controversy be covered by an affidavit or testimony given under oath or 
affirmation.
    (ii) Evidence. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law do 
not apply, and all evidentiary material deemed by the Under Secretary to 
be relevant and material to the proceeding, and not unduly repetitious, 
will be received and considered.
    (iii) Procedural questions. The Under Secretary has the authority to 
limit the number of people attending the hearing, to impose any time or 
other limitations deemed reasonable, and to determine all procedural 
questions.
    (iv) Transcript. A transcript of an informal hearing shall not be 
made, unless the Under Secretary determines that the national interest 
or other good cause warrants it, or the appellant requests a transcript. 
If the appellant requests a transcript, the appellant will be 
responsible for paying all expenses related to production of the 
transcript.
    (v) Report. When the Under Secretary designates another BXA official 
to conduct an informal hearing, that official will submit a written 
report containing a summary of the hearing and recommended action to the 
Under Secretary.
    (c) Decisions--(1) Determination of appeals. In addition to the 
documents specifically submitted in connection with the appeal, the 
Under Secretary shall consider any recommendations, reports, or relevant 
documents available to BXA in determining the appeal, but shall not be 
bound by any such recommendation, nor prevented from considering any 
other information, or consulting with any other person or groups, in 
making a determination. The Under Secretary may adopt any other 
procedures deemed necessary and reasonable for considering an appeal. 
The Under Secretary shall decide an appeal within a reasonable time 
after receipt of the appeal. The decision shall be issued to the 
appellant in writing and contain a statement of the reasons for the 
action.
    (2) Effect of the determination. The decision of the Under Secretary 
shall be final.

<R05>
Sec. 758.1  Export clearance requirements.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Responsibility of licensee, exporter and agent. (1) If you are 
issued a BXA license, or you rely on a License Exception described in 
part 740 of the EAR, you are responsible for the proper use of that 
license or License Exception and for the performance of all of its terms 
and conditions.
    (2) If you export without either a license issued by BXA or a 
License Exception, you are responsible for determining that the 
transaction is outside the scope of the EAR or the export is designated 
as ``No License Required'' as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (3)(i) ``No License Required''. Items that are listed on the 
Commerce Control List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) 
but that do not require a license by reason of the Country Chart 
contained in Supplement 1 to part 738 of the EAR, and items designated 
EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled ``Scope of the EAR'') must 
be designated as ``NLR'', or ``no license required'', on your shipping 
documents in accordance with the provisions of this part.
    (ii) NLR notation. Entering the symbol NLR is a representation to 
the U.S. Government that the items being exported are listed on the CCL 
but do not require a license by reason of the Country Chart or that they 
are within the scope of EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled 
``Scope of the EAR''); that they do not require a license under General 
Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports), Two (Parts and Components 
Reexports), or Three (Foreign-produced Direct Product Reexports); that 
General Prohibitions Four through Ten do not apply to the given export, 
reexport, or other activity; and that the items are subject to the EAR.
    (4) License Exception symbol. Entering a License Exception symbol on 
an export control document is a representation to the U.S. Government 
that the transaction meets all of the terms and conditions of the 
License Exception cited. (See part 740 of the EAR for details regarding 
License Exceptions.)
    (5) Software and technology not subject to the EAR. If you are 
exporting software or technology that is outside the scope of the EAR as 
described in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR, you may use the 
symbol TSPA. Use of this symbol is optional; however, if you enter it on 
an export control document, you are making a representation to the U.S. 
Government that the technology or software is outside the scope of the 
EAR.
    (b) Forwarding agent--(1) Authorizing a forwarding agent. A 
forwarding agent is a person the exporter authorizes to perform services 
that facilitate the export described on the Shipper's Export Declaration 
(SED). The agent must be authorized to act on behalf of the exporter 
either for the specific transaction for which the agent is submitting 
the SED or under a general power of attorney. The Foreign Trade 
Statistics Regulations of the Bureau of the Census (15 CFR part 30) 
provide the specific requirements for obtaining authorization as a 
forwarding agent.
    (2) Forwarding agent as licensee. If the forwarding agent is 
appointed at the suggestion of a foreign buyer, the seller may insist 
that the agent apply for the export license. See Sec. 748.5(a)(1) of the 
EAR which defines parties to a transaction.
    (3) Record and proof of agent's authority. The power-of-attorney or 
other authorization from the exporter must be retained on file in the 
forwarding agent's office while the authorization is in force and for a 
period of five years after the last action taken by the forwarding agent 
under the authority. During this retention period, the forwarding agent 
must make its delegation of authority from the exporter available for 
inspection on demand, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 762.6 of 
the EAR. This recordkeeping and inspection requirement also applies to 
any redelegation of the forwarding agent's authority and to any person 
to whom the forwarding agent redelegates its authority. (For further 
recordkeeping requirements see part 762 of the EAR).
    (c) Responsibility for compliance. Acting through a forwarding 
agent, or

[[Page 332]]

other agent or delegation or redelegation of authority, does not relieve 
anyone of responsibility for compliance with the EAR. Forwarding agents, 
carriers and others who participate in transactions that are subject to 
the EAR are also responsible for complying with the EAR.
    (d) Exports by U.S. Mail----(1)  Exports made under a license issued 
by BXA. Before making an export by U.S. Mail that is authorized by a 
license issued by BXA, you must enter the license number on the address 
side of the parcel and submit a properly executed SED to the post office 
at the place of mailing, when required by the regulations in this part 
and/or the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations of the U.S. Bureau of 
the Census. <SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\ The Shipper's Export Declaration (U.S. Department of Commerce 
form 7525-V) may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or it may be privately 
printed. Form 7525-V-Alt (Intermodal), must be privately printed. 
Privately printed forms must strictly conform to the official form in 
all respects. Samples of these forms may be obtained from the Bureau of 
the Census, Washington, DC 20233, local Customs offices, and the U.S. 
Department of Commerce District Offices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Shipments without a license. The requirements of this paragraph 
apply whenever you export items that do not require a license under the 
EAR. These requirements apply regardless of whether your transaction 
does not require a license because the item you are going to ship is 
encompassed with EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled ``Scope of 
the EAR''), because the item, although on the list, does not require a 
license to be exported to the destination to which you intend to ship or 
because the transaction qualifies for a License Exception as described 
in part 740 of the EAR.
    (i) Shipments to Canada for consumption therein. An SED is not 
required for exports of items to Canada if the items are for consumption 
in Canada and the export transaction does not require a license from 
BXA. Note that if the item you are exporting to Canada is controlled by 
another government agency, the regulations of that agency may require 
you to file a SED.
    (ii) Shipments to Puerto Rico or U.S. territories or possessions. 
Exports of items to Puerto Rico or the U.S. territories or possessions 
do not require a license issued by BXA. However, the regulations of the 
Census Bureau (15 CFR part 30) may still require you to file a SED.
    (iii) Shipments valued over $500. When mailing an item from one 
business concern to another where the total value of the items being 
shipped exceeds $500, you must present an executed SED to the post 
office at the place of mailing unless the EAR or the Bureau of the 
Census Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations specifically provide an 
exception to this requirement. If either the exporter or recipient is 
not a business concern, no SED is required.
    (iv) Designation on SED and/or parcel. If you are exporting an item 
that is encompassed within EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the EAR entitled 
``Scope of the EAR''), or one that is listed on the CCL but no license 
is required to the destination to which you are shipping, or you are 
exporting pursuant to a License Exception, as described in part 740 of 
the EAR, you must enter the appropriate symbol indicating the absence of 
a license requirement either NLR, meaning ``No License Required'' or the 
applicable License Exception symbol, on the SED and on the address side 
of the parcel along with the phrase ``Export License Not Required.'' If 
your transaction is one for which you are not required to file a SED, 
you must enter the appropriate symbol NLR, meaning no license required 
or of the applicable License Exception on the address side of the parcel 
along with the phrase ``Export License Not Required.'' If you are 
exporting technology or software that is outside the scope of the EAR as 
described in Sec. 734.7 through 734.11 you may enter the symbol TSPA.
    (A) By entering the symbol NLR you are representing to the U.S. 
Government that the items you are exporting are listed on the CCL (See 
Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) but do not require a license by 
reason of the Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) or 
because they are encompassed within the EAR99 (See Sec. 734.3(c) of the 
EAR entitled ``Scope of the

[[Page 333]]

EAR''); that they do not require a license under General Prohibitions 
One (Exports and reexports of controlled items to listed countries), Two 
(Parts and Components Reexports), or Three (Foreign Produced Direct 
Product Reexports); that General Prohibitions Four through Ten do not 
apply to the given export, reexport, or other activity; and that the 
item is subject to the EAR.
    (B) By entering a License Exception symbol, you are representing to 
the U.S. Government that your transaction meets all of the terms and 
conditions of the License Exception you are using. (See part 740 of the 
EAR for details regarding License Exceptions).
    (C) By entering the symbol TSPA you are representing to the U.S. 
Government that the technology or software you are exporting is outside 
the scope of the EAR.
    (v) Gift parcels. If you are sending a gift parcel pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec. 746.16 of the EAR, you must enter the phrase 
``Gift--export license not required'' on any customs declaration 
documents and on the address side of the parcel.
    (vi) Software and technology. If you are exporting software or 
technology, the export of which is authorized under the License 
Exceptions in Sec. 740.6 or Sec. 740.13 of the EAR, you do not need to 
make any notation on the package. If you are exporting software or 
technology that is outside the scope of the EAR, check to see if any 
other agency's regulations require specific markings on the package.
    (3) When you enter any of the symbols or phrases referred to in 
paragraph (d) of this section on the documents or packages, you are 
certifying to the post office and to BXA that you are exporting the 
package in compliance with all of the terms and provisions of an 
applicable License Exception or other authority to export.
    (e) Exports by means other than U.S. Mail. (1) When SEDs are 
required to be submitted, the exporter or the exporter's agent must 
present a duly executed SED to the exporting carrier before the vessel, 
aircraft, or overland transport depart.
    (i) Exemptions to SED. A SED is not required for:
    (A) Any shipment, other than a shipment made under a license issued 
by BXA, to any country in Country Group B (see Supplement No. 1 to part 
740 of the EAR) or to the People's Republic of China if the shipment is 
valued at $2,500 or less per Schedule B Number (or other number 
acceptable to the Foreign Trade Division, Bureau of the Census). The 
Schedule B number of an item is shown in the current edition of the 
Schedule B, Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign 
Commodities Exported from the United States. In paragraph (e) of this 
section, ``shipment'' means all items classified under a single Schedule 
B number (or other number acceptable to the Foreign Trade Statistics 
Division, Bureau of the Census), shipped on the same carrier, from one 
exporter to one importer. The Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations of 
the Bureau of the Census (15 CFR part 30) shall govern the valuation of 
items when determining whether a shipment meets the $2,500 threshold of 
this paragraph.
    (B) Any shipment reported under the provisions of the Monthly 
Reporting Procedure (Sec. 758.3(o) of this part); or
    (C) Any shipment made under any other exception to the SED 
requirements found in Subpart B of the Bureau of the Census' Foreign 
Trade Statistics Regulations.
    (ii) Exceptions from SED requirements. (A) Statement on shipping 
documents. If you are exempt by paragraph (e)(1) of this section from 
the requirement of filing a SED, the Bureau of the Census Foreign Trade 
Statistics Regulations (FTSR) (15 CFR 30.50), require you to make a 
statement on the bill of lading, air waybill, or other loading document 
describing the basis for the exemption and referencing the specific 
section of the FTSR where the exemption is provided, unless the 
exemption is based on value and destination. If the exemption is based 
on the value and destination of your shipment, you must state the basis 
for the exemption, but you do not have to cite a reference to the 
specific section of the FTSR containing the exemption.
    (B) Monthly reporting procedures. (1) All forwarders or brokers who 
use the monthly reporting procedures described in FTSR Sec. 30.39 (15 
CFR 30.39) on

[[Page 334]]

behalf of exporters who are not themselves exempt from the individual 
filing requirement must also include on the bill of lading, air waybill 
(including house air waybill), or other loading document either the 
number of and expiration date of an export license issued by BXA, or the 
appropriate symbol indicating the inapplicability of an export license 
requirement (either NLR, meaning ``No License Required'' or of the 
applicable License Exception, from part 740 of the EAR).
    (2) The notation required by paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B)(1) of this 
section applies to any bill of lading or other loading document, 
including one issued by a consolidator (indirect carrier) for an export 
included in a consolidated shipment. However, this requirement does not 
apply to a ``master'' bill of lading or other loading document issued by 
a carrier to cover a consolidated shipment. The bill of lading or other 
loading document must be available for inspection along with the goods 
or data prior to lading on the carrier.
    (2) Export carrier SED information. The exporting carrier, or if 
none is utilized, the exporter or agent is responsible for the accuracy 
of the following items of information (where required) on the SED:
    (i) Name of carrier (including flag of vessel),
    (ii) U.S. Customs port of export,
    (iii) Method of transportation,
    (iv) Foreign port of unloading,
    (v) Bill of lading or air waybill number, and
    (vi) Whether or not containerized.
    (3) Exports not requiring a license. Even if your shipment does not 
require a license from BXA, it may still require a SED. Before shipping, 
check the Bureau of the Census Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations for 
the complete SED requirements.
    (f) Shipments transiting Canada en route to other countries--(1) 
Shipments moving under individual SED. When an export to a foreign 
country is made in transit through Canada, and the shipment is one for 
which an individual SED is required by this part 758, the U.S. exporter 
must submit to the Canadian Customs authorities at the Canadian port of 
entry a copy of the U.S. SED, Form 7525-V, certified by the exporter as 
``A True Copy'' of the original SED.
    (2) Shipments for which individual SED are not required. When an 
export to a foreign country is made in transit through Canada, and the 
shipment is one for which an individual SED is not required because:
    (i) The forwarder or broker is authorized to report export 
information to Census by means other than an individual SED; or
    (ii) The shipment qualifies for a specific exemption (listed in 
Subpart D of the Census Bureau Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations), 
the forwarder or broker must include the number of and expiration date 
of the license issued by BXA, or the appropriate symbol indicating the 
inapplicability of an export license requirement (either NLR, meaning 
``No License Required'' or the applicable License Exception from part 
740 of the EAR on the bill of lading or other loading document as 
directed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section). The bill of lading or 
other loading document properly annotated with respect to the FTSR SED 
exemption or exception, along with the license authorization, when 
required, must be displayed to the Canadian Customs authorities at the 
Canadian port of entry and a copy provided, if requested by the Canadian 
authorities.

<R05>
Sec. 758.2  Use of export license.

    (a) License valid for shipment from any port. A license issued by 
BXA authorizes exports from the United States from any U.S. port of 
export unless the license notes otherwise. Items that leave the United 
States at one port, cross adjacent foreign territory, and reenter the 
United States at another port before final export to a foreign country 
will be treated as an export from the last U.S. port of export.
    (b) Shipments against expiring license. (1) Any item that has not 
departed from the last U.S. port of export by midnight of the expiration 
date of the license may not be exported under that license unless the 
shipment meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section.

[[Page 335]]

    (i) BXA grants an extension; or
    (ii) Prior to midnight of the expiration date of the license, the 
items:
    (A) Were laden aboard the vessel; or
    (B) Were located on a pier ready for loading and not for storage, 
and were booked for a vessel that was at the pier ready for loading; or
    (2) When the vessel is expected to be available at the pier for 
loading before the license expires, but exceptional and unforeseen 
circumstances delay it, the items may be exported without an extension 
of the license, if in the judgment of the U.S. Customs Service or BXA, 
undue hardship would otherwise result.
    (c) Reshipment of undelivered items. If the consignee does not 
receive an export made under a license because the carrier failed to 
deliver it, the exporter may reship the same or an identical item 
subject to the same limitations as to quantity or value as described on 
the license to the same consignee and destination under the same 
license. Before reshipping, the exporter must submit to the BXA 
satisfactory evidence of the original export and of the delivery 
failure, together with a satisfactory explanation of the delivery 
failure. If an item is to be reshipped to any person other than the 
original consignee, the shipment is deemed to be a new export and is 
subject to all current EAR regarding the specific item and destination.

<R05>
Sec. 758.3  Shipper's Export Declaration (SED).

    (a) SED presentation requirement. Both the Foreign Trade Statistics 
Regulations of the Census Bureau (15 CFR part 30) and these Export 
Administration Regulations require that SED's be submitted to the U.S. 
Government. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but if you are 
required to submit a SED you must prepare it in accordance with the 
rules of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (FTSR) and present the 
number of copies specified in the FTSR at the port of export.
    (b) SED is a statement to the U.S. Government. Your SED is a 
statement to the U.S. Government in which you assert that all of the 
information shown on the SED is true. You may execute and submit the SED 
only if you are the exporter or the duly authorized forwarding agent of 
an exporter.
    (c) Limitation on time when SED may be used. No one may use a SED to 
export, or facilitate or effect an export, after the expiration of the 
applicable license or after the termination of the applicable License 
Exception or provisions of the EAR that authorize export without a 
license, except as provided in Sec. 750.7(f) (License validity period) 
of the EAR and Sec. 758.2(b) (Shipments against expiring license) of 
this part.
    (d) Additional copies of the SED. You are required to submit 
additional copies of the SED when:
    (1) BXA or one of its component offices asks you to send it copies 
of the SED for exports:
    (i) Authorized by a license (see paragraph (l) of this section);
    (ii) Authorized by a Special Comprehensive License (see 
Sec. 752.16(a)(5) of the EAR; or
    (iii) The items are controlled for short supply reasons (see part 
754 of the EAR); or
    (iv) Required by Sec. 758.1(f) (shipments transiting Canada) of this 
part.
    (2) You are required under the provisions of Sec. 754.2(j)(2) of the 
EAR.
    (e) Statements on SED. Whenever a SED is presented to a carrier, a 
customs office, or a postmaster, the exporter represents that:
    (1) All statements and information on the SED have been furnished by 
the exporter or on the exporter's behalf to effect an export under the 
provisions of the EAR;
    (2) Export of the items described on the SED is authorized under the 
``No License Required'' provisions of the EAR as described in 
Sec. 758.1(a) of this part, a License Exception described in part 740 of 
the EAR or the license identified on the SED;
    (3) Statements contained on the SED are consistent with the contents 
of the license or the terms, provisions, and conditions of the 
applicable License Exception or of the applicable ``No License 
Required'' provisions of the EAR as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this 
part; and

[[Page 336]]

    (4) All other terms, provisions, and conditions of the EAR 
applicable to the export have been met.
    (f) Items that may be listed on the same SED--(1) General. Except as 
described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, more than one item may be 
listed on the same SED provided they are contained in one shipment on 
board a single carrier and are going from the same exporter to the same 
consignee. Even if some of the items are being shipped under authority 
of a license and others under a License Exception or the ``No License 
Required'' (NLR) provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of 
this part), they may still be shown on one SED. For the second and 
subsequent authorizations used, the applicable license number and 
expiration date, License Exception symbol, or the symbol NLR must be 
shown along with the descriptions (including quantity, if required, 
Schedule B number or other number acceptable to the Foreign Trade 
Division, Bureau of the Census, and value) to which each authorization 
applies must be shown under each of the properly aligned line item 
descriptions. The following apply for notations made on the SED:
    (i) Entering the license number and expiration date is a 
representation to the U.S. Government that the transaction is authorized 
by the license cited.
    (ii) Entering a License Exception symbol, or ``NLR'' is a 
representation to the U.S. Government that the shipment meets one of the 
applicable provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 758.1 of this part.
    (2) Exception. Separate SED's must be prepared and presented for 
each vehicle when more than one vehicle is used to make the shipment. 
Customs Directors may waive this requirement if a shipment is made under 
a single bill of lading or other loading document and all the items 
listed on the SED are cleared simultaneously.
    (g) Schedule B number and item description. (1) Schedule B number. 
You must enter the Schedule B number (or other number acceptable to the 
Foreign Trade Division, Bureau of the Census), as shown in the current 
edition of Schedule B, Statistical Classification of Domestic and 
Foreign Commodities Exported from the United States, in the designated 
column of the SED or other number acceptable to the Foreign Trade 
Division, Bureau of the Census regardless of whether the shipment is 
being exported under authority of a license issued by BXA, a License 
Exception described in part 740 of the EAR, or the ``No License 
Required'' (NLR) provisions of the EAR as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of 
this part.
    (2) Item description for exports under a license--(i) General. If 
your export is being made under the authority of a license issued by 
BXA, you must enter the item description shown on the license on the 
SED. However, if part of the description on the license is underlined, 
you need place only the underlined portions on the SED. The item 
description on the license will be stated in CCL terms, which may be 
inadequate to meet Census Bureau requirements. In this event, the item 
description you place on the SED must be given enough additional detail 
to permit verification of the Schedule B number (or other number 
acceptable to the Foreign Trade Division, Bureau of the Census) (e.g., 
size, material, or degree of fabrication).
    (ii) Distinguishing characteristics or specifications. If a 
commodity classification in Schedule B (or other schedule acceptable to 
the Foreign Trade Division, Bureau of the Census) has instructions such 
as ``specify by name'', ``state species'', etc., you must furnish that 
information in the column of the SED provided for the commodity 
description. When a single SED covers more than one item classifiable 
under a single classification carrying the ``specify by name'' or 
similar requirement, you must enter each item separately in this column. 
However, if more than five items are involved, all classifiable under 
one Schedule B number or ``other number acceptable to the Foreign Trade 
Division, Bureau of the Census'' only the five items of greatest value 
in the classification need be shown separately. Separate quantities, 
values, and shipping weights for individual items are not required in 
either case.
    (3) Item description for License Exception shipments or shipments 
for which no license is required. For items that may

[[Page 337]]

be exported under authority of a License Exception, or under the NLR 
provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this part), you 
must enter a description in sufficient detail to permit review by the 
U.S. Government and verification of the Schedule B number or ``other 
number acceptable to the Foreign Trade Division, Bureau of the Census'' 
entered on the SED.
    (h) License number or other authorization designation--(1) Exports 
under the authority of a license issued by BXA. You must show the 
license number and expiration date, the Export Control Classification 
Number (ECCN) and the item description, in the designated spaces of a 
SED covering an export under a license issued by BXA (the space for the 
item description on the SED form may be headed ``commodity 
description''). If you intend to include other items on the SED that may 
be exported under a License Exception, or under the ``No License 
Required'' (NLR) provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of 
this part) you must show the License Exception or NLR symbol, along with 
the specific description (quantity, Schedule B number or ``other number 
acceptable to the Foreign Trade Division, Bureau of the Census'', value) 
of the item(s) to which the authorization applies in the designated 
spaces on the SED continuation sheet.
    (2) Exports not needing a license. In addition to the item 
description, the appropriate License Exception symbol, or the ``No 
License Required'' symbol (NLR) must be shown in the appropriate column 
of each SED or SED continuation sheet covering a shipment under 
authority of a License Exception (see part 740 of the EAR), or ``No 
License Required'' provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) 
of this part). If several authorizations are to be listed on one SED, 
the SED and continuation sheets must be completed as described in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section. If the item(s) will be exported under 
the provisions of License Exceptions GBS, CIV, or LVS, or under the 
``NLR'' provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this 
part) and the item(s) are covered by entries on the Commerce Control 
List that have the column identifier ``NS Column 2'' controlled for 
``NS'' reasons, the ECCN must also be shown in the designated space on 
the SED or SED continuation sheet. The following apply for notations 
made on SED:
    (i) Entering the license number and expiration date is a 
representation to the U.S. Government that the transaction is authorized 
by the license cited.
    (ii) Entering a License Exception symbol, or ``NLR'' is a 
representation to the U.S. Government that the shipment meets one of the 
applicable provisions of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(4) of Sec. 758.1 
of this part.
    (3) If you are exporting technology or software that is outside the 
scope of the EAR as described in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR, 
you may enter the symbol TSPA on the SED. Use of this symbol is 
optional, however, if you enter it, you are representing to the U.S. 
Government that the software or technology you are exporting is outside 
the scope of the EAR.
    (i) Optional ports of unlading--(1) Applicability. If, prior to the 
departure of the exporting carrier, the exporter does not know at what 
port the shipment will be unloaded, the exporter may designate optional 
ports of unlading on the SED and bill of lading or air waybill in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. There are restrictions 
on the countries in which these optional ports may be located. The 
restrictions depend on whether the export is authorized under the ``No 
license Required'' provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) 
of this part), the License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR, 
or a license (See paragraph (j)(3) of this section).
    (2) Exemptions. You may never designate an optional port of unlading 
for a shipment destined directly or indirectly to Country Group D:1 in 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR (except for the People's 
Republic of China), Libya, Cuba, or North Korea.
    (3) Shipments for which no license is required or which are 
authorized by a License Exception. (i) For exports under the authority 
of the ``No License Required'' provisions of the EAR (as described in 
Sec. 758.1(a) of this part), if the exporter does not know which of 
several countries in Country Group B or the People's Republic of China 
is the

[[Page 338]]

country of ultimate destination, the exporter may name optional ports of 
unlading in one or more of these countries.
    (ii) When an export under any License Exception is shipped in 
transit through a country other than the country of ultimate 
destination, the exporter may designate optional ports of unlading in 
one or more countries, together with the name and address of the 
intermediate consignee in each country designated.
    (4) Restrictions on optional ports of unlading. The optional ports 
of unlading, which the exporter designates on the SED pursuant to 
paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section, must be in a country to which the 
item being unloaded may be exported directly from the United States 
under the same or another applicable ``No License Required'' provision 
of the EAR (described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this part), or License 
Exception contained in the EAR.
    (5) Shipments under a license issued by BXA. For exports under a 
license, optional ports of unlading are restricted to the country of 
ultimate destination, unless either the transaction complies with the 
provisions of Sec. 750.7 of the EAR dealing with continuity of 
shipments, or the license designates intermediate consignees in other 
countries. In the latter case, the optional ports of unlading must be 
designated as optional intransit points on the SED, or if there is no 
SED, on the Shipper's Letter of Instructions, or, if there is neither, 
the optional port of unlading must appear on another document containing 
instructions that the exporter conveys (either directly or through an 
agent) to the carrier, and on the bill of lading or air waybill.
    (6) Correcting the SED. As soon as the exporter, or the exporter's 
forwarding agent or carrier determines at which port the shipment is to 
be unloaded (whether in the country of ultimate destination or in a 
country of transit), that person must correct the SED to show the 
specific port of unloading and the name and address of the intermediate 
consignee to whom delivery is to be made. An intermediate consignee must 
be shown if the port of unloading is located in a country other than the 
country of destination. If the export is unloaded at more than one port, 
the quantity and value unloaded at each port and the name and address of 
each intermediate consignee must be given. The procedures for correcting 
and filing SEDs may be found in paragraph (n) of this section.
    (j) Signature on SED. The exporter or the exporter's authorized 
forwarding agent, or an authorized employee of either, may sign the SED. 
In general, the requisite authority rests with employees who, by their 
official titles, are apparently vested with power to deal with exports, 
such as export managers or such corporate officers as the president, 
vice president, treasurer, and secretary of a corporation, any partner 
of a partnership, and any responsible head of any other form of private 
or quasi-governmental organization, and assistant officers. The 
signature of such person, whether that of the exporter or authorized 
agent or employee, constitutes a representation by the exporter that all 
statements and information in the SED are true and correct. In addition, 
if the signature is that of the forwarding agent, or the forwarding 
agent's duly authorized officer or employee, such signature constitutes 
a like representation by the forwarding agent.
    (k) Attachment to SED. (1) If you need additional space for any 
information on the SED, you may use additional copies of the SED or 
copies of the continuation sheet. In such cases, only one SED need be 
signed. You must number the additional sheets in sequence and securely 
attach them to the executed SED. You must insert the following statement 
on the last line of the description line of the SED form itself:

    This SED consists of this sheet and ________ continuation sheets.

    (2) No portion of any form attached as a continuation sheet may be 
torn off or removed.
    (l) Special requirements for additional information and documents. 
(1) A license may bear on its face a requirement to submit a SED or 
other documents (or information) to the Office of Export Enforcement in 
addition to that furnished when the application was filed. The exporter 
and the person submitting the documents represent that the

[[Page 339]]

documents are complete, truthful and accurate. The Export Administration 
Regulations prohibit the making of false representations to the U.S. 
Government in any export control matter (see Sec. 764.2(g) of the EAR). 
The licensee must furnish the documents to: Office of Export 
Enforcement, Room H-4520, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and 
Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) When required, the licensee must:
    (i) Prepare one copy of the SED in addition to the number of copies 
otherwise required;
    (ii) Enter the additional information called for by the license in 
the space between the column provided for marks and numbers of the 
shipment and the column provided for its value on all copies of the SED; 
and
    (iii) Unless otherwise specified on the license, attach the required 
documents (either original or certified copy) to the extra copy of the 
SED.
    (m) SED for shipments moving in- transit. (1) Applicability. Use the 
SED for In-transit Goods, Commerce Form 7513,<SUP>2</SUP> for the 
following types of transactions:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \2\  Form 7513 may be purchased from the Superintendent of 
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, the 
local customs offices, or may be privately printed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Items departing the United States by vessel, which transited 
through, or transshipped in, ports of the United States, destined from 
one foreign country or area to another.
    (ii) Foreign merchandise exported from a General Order Warehouse and 
the export of foreign-origin merchandise that was rejected after 
government inspection or examination. Shipments in bond transiting the 
United States being exported by means of any carrier other than a vessel 
may be cleared for export without presenting a Form 7513, unless a 
license is required for the export.
    (2) Exports from Foreign Trade Zones. You may not use Form 7513 for 
any exports from Foreign Trade Zones. Such shipments require the filing 
of the SED (Form 7525-V), unless otherwise exempted, with the applicable 
zone number reported on the Document.
    (3) Additional information. The following additional information 
must be entered on a SED for In-transit Goods:
    (i) The name and address of the intermediate consignee in a foreign 
destination, if any, must be shown below the description of the items.
    (ii) Underneath the name and address of the intermediate consignee, 
one of the following statements, whichever is appropriate, must be 
entered:
    (A) For intransit shipments of foreign-origin merchandise (see part 
772 of the EAR for a definition of ``foreign-origin,''), enter the 
following statement:
    The merchandise described herein is of foreign-origin.
    (B) For intransit shipments of domestic (U.S.) merchandise, enter 
the following statement:
    The merchandise described herein is of the growth, production, or 
manufacture of the United States.
    (C) For intransit shipments of items of U.S.-origin eligible for the 
intransit provisions of License Exception TMP (see Sec. 740.9(b) of the 
EAR), enter the following statement:

    The merchandise described herein is of the growth, production, or 
manufacture of the United States, but has been so altered by further 
processing, manufacture, or assembly in a foreign country that it has 
either been substantially enhanced in value, or has lost its original 
identity with respect to form.

    (iii) The items must be described in terms of Schedule B, including 
the appropriate Schedule B number or ``other number acceptable to the 
Foreign Trade Division, Bureau of the Census''.
    (4) See Sec. 30.8 of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (15 
CFR 30.8) for additional requirements concerning the information that 
must be placed on a SED for In-transit Goods.
    (n) Correction, change, alteration, or amendment of SED--(1) Methods 
of changing SED's. The exporter or the exporter's agent must report 
corrections, cancellations, additions or amendments to information 
reported on SEDs to the Customs Director at the port of exportation (or, 
in the case of mail shipments, to the Postmaster at the post office 
where the shipment was mailed) as soon as the need for such changes is 
determined. See the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (15 CFR

[[Page 340]]

part 30) for additional information about how to correct SEDs and file 
the corrections. If you are required by paragraph (l) of this section to 
file a copy of the original SED with the Office of Export Enforcement 
(OEE), a copy of the changed SED should be sent to OEE at the address 
shown in paragraph (l) of this section with the words ``Correction 
Copy'' conspicuously shown in the upper right portion of the form.
    (2) Responsibility. Nothing in this section relieves you or any 
person or firm making changes on the SED from responsibility for any 
such changes. Acceptance of a changed SED by the Customs office does not 
imply approval of any act involved in the shipment or acceptance of the 
truth or accuracy of the information provided.
    (o) Summary monthly reports in lieu of individual SED's--(1) Scope. 
This paragraph contains only basic information about the monthly filing 
procedures for the SED. Details of the procedure may be found in 
Sec. 30.39 of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (FTSR) of the 
Bureau of the Census (15 CFR 30.39). Exporters interested in the 
procedure should consult Sec. 30.39 of the FTSR to ascertain 
qualifications, how to apply for the privilege of participating, how to 
file electronically after approval is given, and other pertinent facts.
    (2) Applicability. Approved parties may file monthly SEDs with the 
Bureau of the Census for export to destinations in Country Groups B and 
D (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR).
    (3) How to request monthly reporting privileges--(i) Addresses. (A) 
A request for the privilege of participating in monthly reporting 
procedures should be forwarded to: Foreign Trade Division, Bureau of the 
Census, Washington, D.C. 20233.
    (B) A copy of all requests must be sent to: Office of Export 
Enforcement, Room H-4616, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th St. and 
Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230.
    (ii) Certification requirements. The request must include the 
following certification by the applicant:

    I (We) certify that I (we) have established adequate internal 
procedures and safeguards to assure compliance with the requirements set 
forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration 
Regulations and Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations. Among other 
things, these procedures and safeguards assure:
    (1) A proper determination as to whether a license is required for a 
particular export;
    (2) Actual receipt of the export license, if required, before the 
shipment is exported;
    (3) Compliance with all the terms of the license, License Exception, 
or NLR provisions of the EAR as applicable;
    (4) Return of licenses to BXA in accordance with Sec. 750.8(b) of 
the Export Administration Regulations, if requested;
    (5) Compliance with the destination control statement provisions of 
Secs. 758.5 and 758.6 of the Export Administration Regulations;
    (6) Compliance with the prohibition against export transactions that 
involve persons who have been denied U.S. export privileges; and
    (7) Compliance with the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of 
the EAR and, in addition, I (we) agree that my (our) office records will 
be made available for inspection by the Bureau of the Census, BXA or the 
U.S. Customs Service, upon request, to verify that a given shipment was 
properly included in a particular monthly report.

    (4) Exporter's agent. If the exporter intends to authorize a 
forwarding agent to file electronically on the exporter's behalf, the 
exporter's request must include the name and address of each such 
forwarding agent.
    (5) Authorization by Census to use monthly reporting procedure. Any 
authorization to file summary monthly reports in lieu of individual SEDs 
may be granted only by the Bureau of the Census with the concurrence of 
BXA.
    (6) Export clearance. (i) Destination control statement. In addition 
to the exporter's responsibility for assuring that the proper 
destination control statement is placed on the commercial invoice as 
required by Sec. 758.6 of this part, the exporter or the exporter's 
forwarding agent is responsible for assuring that the carrier places the 
proper destination control statement on the related bill of lading or 
air waybill.
    (ii) Detention and examination. Shipments being reported under the 
summary filing procedure described in this paragraph are subject to 
inspection, examination and detention, as provided in Sec. 758.7 of this 
part, whenever an official of BXA, a customs officer, or a

[[Page 341]]

postmaster deems such action necessary to assure compliance with the 
EAR.
    (7) Revocation of authorization. An authorization to file summary 
monthly reports in lieu of individual SED's, granted under the 
provisions of Sec. 30.39 of the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations (15 
CFR 30.39) and this paragraph, may be revoked, suspended, or revised at 
any time.
    (8) Effect of other provisions. Insofar as consistent with the 
provisions of this paragraph that relate specifically to filing 
electronically in lieu of individual SED's, the other provisions of this 
part 758 apply to exports reported under this procedure.

FR 64285, Dec. 4, 1996; 62 FR 25468, May 9, 1997]

Sec. 758.4  Conformity of documents for shipments under export licenses.

    (a) Applicability. The rules of conformity in this section apply to 
shipping documents used in connection with any shipment under the 
authority of a license issued by BXA except ``master'' air waybills 
issued by consolidators. These rules apply to any individual air waybill 
issued by a consolidator (indirect carrier) for an export included in a 
consolidated shipment and to any air waybill issued by anyone in 
connection with an export not included in a consolidated shipment.
    (b) Compliance. You may not issue, prepare, or procure a bill of 
lading that is contrary to the provisions of this section. Officials of 
BXA and the U.S. Customs Service are authorized to require any document 
or to use any other appropriate methods to ensure compliance with the 
rules of conformity in this section.
    (c) Rules of conformity--(1) General. The following documents must 
be consistent with each other:
    (i) The license issued by BXA;
    (ii) One of the following applicable documents:
    (A) The SED;
    (B) If there is no SED, the Shipper's Letter of Instructions; or
    (C) If there is neither, another document containing instructions 
that the exporter conveys (either directly or through an agent) to the 
carrier; and
    (iii) The outbound bill of lading (including a railroad through bill 
of lading) covering a particular export shipment must be consistent with 
one another.
    (2) Signs of inconsistent documents. The bill of lading, whether in 
negotiable or nonnegotiable form, is not consistent with those other 
documents if:
    (i) It does not provide for delivery of the shipment (cargo) at a 
port located in the country of either the ultimate or intermediate 
consignee named in the documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section;
    (ii) It contains any indication that the shipment is intransit to a 
country of ultimate destination different from that named in the 
appropriate one of the documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section, or that the shipment is not for consumption in such 
country of ultimate destination. For example, it would be inconsistent 
to consign a shipment to the ultimate destination with a qualifying 
phrase indicating the shipment is ``in transit'' at that destination, or 
to consign the shipment to a free zone or free port;
    (iii) It names as shipper any person other than the licensee (the 
person to whom a license is issued) or the licensee's duly authorized 
forwarding agent. Where shipments from more than one licensee are 
consolidated on a single bill of lading, the shipper named on the bill 
of lading must also appear as the authorized forwarding agent for each 
exporter on each document described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (iv) The name and address of the ultimate consignee are not shown 
either in the space provided for ``consignee'' or in the body of the 
bill of lading under the caption ``ultimate consignee and notify party'' 
or, in the case of the air waybill, under the caption ``also notify.'' 
However, where shipments to more than one ultimate consignee are 
consolidated on one bill of lading and not all are shown in the body of 
the bill of lading, the name of the intermediate consignee (customs 
broker or consolidator's agent in the foreign

[[Page 342]]

country) who will receive and distribute the items to the ultimate 
consignees must appear on the bill of lading, the export license(s), and 
documents listed in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (3) Additional rules for negotiable bills of lading. A negotiable 
bill of lading (an ``order'' bill of lading) is deemed consistent with 
the appropriate one of the documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) 
of this section only if the consignee or order party named on the bill 
of lading is also named in the SED, the Shipper's Letter of Instructions 
or the other document.
    (i) Sometimes ``order'' bills of lading consign the items they cover 
to the order of the shipper, to the order of an intermediate consignee 
such as a bank, foreign freight forwarder, or other intermediary, or to 
the order of a purchaser who is not the same person as the ultimate 
consignee. An ``order'' bill of lading issued in any of these forms 
constitutes a representation by the shipper that:
    (A) The items covered by the appropriate one of the documents 
described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and bill of lading are 
ultimately destined to the ultimate consignee stated on the license;
    (B) The ``order'' bill of lading has not been used for the purpose 
of evading the terms and conditions of the license; and
    (C) Pursuant to the contract of carriage, the items will be 
delivered at a port located in the country of the ultimate consignee or 
of the intermediate consignee named on the appropriate one of the 
documents described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (4) Item description. On the bill of lading the items may be 
described in terms of the freight tariff classification or other type of 
classification, but may not be inconsistent with the description shown 
on the appropriate one of the documents described in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii). These documents must include the same item description as 
shown on the related license, and, in addition, it must include more 
detailed information where required by the Bureau of the Census.
    (5) Carrier's manifest. If the carrier's outward foreign manifest 
filed with the U.S. customs office contains the names of shippers or 
consignees, these names must not be inconsistent with the names shown on 
the bill of lading and the appropriate one of the documents described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 758.5  General destination control requirements.

    (a) Scope. This section sets forth some actions the parties to a 
transaction authorized by a license issued by BXA are prohibited from 
taking. The purpose of these prohibitions is to prevent items licensed 
for export from being diverted while in transit or thereafter. It also 
sets forth the duties of the parties when the goods are unloaded in a 
country other than that of the ultimate consignee or intermediate 
consignee as stated on the export license.
    (b) Destination on bill of lading or air waybill--(1) Requirements 
to prevent diversions--(i) Statements on bill of lading or air waybill. 
(A) A carrier (or any other person on behalf of any carrier) may not 
issue a bill of lading or air waybill providing for delivery of cargo at 
any foreign port located outside the country of the ultimate consignee, 
or the intermediate consignee, named on the appropriate one of the 
documents described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of this part.
    (B) Optional ports on bill of lading or air waybill. No carrier may 
issue a bill of lading or air waybill providing for delivery of cargo at 
optional ports to the ultimate consignee named on one of the appropriate 
documents described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this part where 
one of such optional ports is not in the country of ultimate destination 
named on the license or SED, or if there is no SED, the Shipper's Letter 
of Instructions, or if there is neither, another document containing 
instructions that the exporter conveys (either directly or through an 
agent) to the carrier, without prior written authorization from BXA. 
However, where the appropriate document described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1) 
(i) and (ii) of this part provide for delivery of cargo to optional 
intermediate consignees located in ports in different countries, the 
carrier

[[Page 343]]

may issue a bill of lading or air waybill providing for delivery at such 
optional ports.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Delivery of cargo. No carrier may deliver cargo to any country 
other than the country of the ultimate consignee, or the intermediate 
consignee, named on the appropriate one of the documents described in 
Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of this part at the request or option of the 
shipper, consignor, exporter, purchaser, or ultimate consignee, or their 
agents, or any other person having custody or control of the shipment, 
without prior written authorization from BXA to the carrier or its 
agent.
    (c) Duties when items are unloaded in a unauthorized country. If the 
items are unloaded in a country other than that of the intermediate or 
ultimate consignee as stated on the appropriate one of the documents 
described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of this part, the procedures described 
in this paragraph must be followed.
    (1) Reasons beyond carrier's control. Nothing contained in the EAR 
shall be deemed to prohibit a carrier from unloading cargo at a port 
outside the country of intermediate or ultimate destination shown on the 
appropriate one of the documents described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of 
this part, where for reasons beyond the control of the carrier (as set 
forth in the standard provisions of the carrier's bill of lading or air 
waybill, such as acts of God, perils of the sea, damage to the carrier, 
strikes, war, political disturbances, or insurrections), it is not 
feasible to deliver the cargo at the licensed port of destination.
    (2) Required actions for unscheduled unloading. (i) If the item is 
unloaded in a country to which that item may be exported without a 
license issued by BXA, no one is required to notify BXA of the 
unloading. The exporter may dispose of the items in that country without 
approval of BXA. When making such a disposition you must still comply 
with any conditions or requirements of the License Exception or other 
provisions of the EAR that would authorize the export of the item being 
unloaded to the country in which you are disposing of it, and any 
regulations of other government agencies that apply to the transaction. 
This paragraph does not authorize anyone to take any action with 
knowledge that a violation of the Export Administration Act, the EAR, or 
any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, has occurred, is 
about to occur or is intended to occur, or to deliver to a denied party 
or to take any other action prohibited by the EAR.
    (ii) If a license issued by BXA would be required to export the item 
to the country in which it is unloaded:
    (A) No person may take any steps to effect delivery or entry of the 
items into the commerce of the country where unloaded without prior 
approval of BXA;
    (B) The carrier must take steps to assure that the items are placed 
in custody under bond or other guaranty not to enter the commerce of 
such country or any country other than the countries of the ultimate and 
intermediate consignees shown on the appropriate one of the documents 
described in Sec. 758.4(c)(1)(ii) of this part, without prior approval 
of BXA;
    (iii) The carrier, the carrier's agent located in the United States, 
and the exporter each have specific responsibilities to notify BXA 
regarding any unscheduled unloading. The specific responsibilities of 
each party are as follows:
    (A) The carrier must, within 10 days after date of unloading, report 
the facts to the nearest American Consulate and to the agent of the 
carrier located in the United States. Within 10 days after receipt of 
such report, the agent must send a copy of the report to BXA. The report 
must include:
    (1) A copy of the manifest of such diverted cargo;
    (2) A statement of the place of unloading; and;
    (3) The name and address of the person in whose custody the items 
were delivered.
    (B) BXA will inform the exporter of the unloading. Within 10 days 
following receipt of this notice, the exporter must inform BXA of the 
proposed disposition of the items. The exporter may not dispose of the 
items without approval of BXA.

<R05>
Sec. 758.6  Destination control statement.

    (a) Requirement for destination control statement. (1) The 
destination control statement shown in paragraph (b) of this section 
must be entered on all copies of the bill of lading, the air waybill and 
the commercial invoice covering any export from the United States if:
    (i) The export is made under authority of a license, including the 
Special Comprehensive License;
    (ii) The export is made under the authority of the following License 
Exceptions: LVS, GBS, CIV, CTP, TMP, or RPL; or
    (iii) The export is made under the ``No License Required'' 
provisions of the EAR (as described in Sec. 758.1(a) of this part) if 
the reason for control of the item as stated in the entry on the CCL is 
NS or NP.
    (2) An exporter or the exporter's agent may enter a destination 
control statement on the shipping documents for exports for which no 
destination control statement is required.
    (b) Text of destination control statement.

    These commodities, technology or software were exported from the 
United States in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations. 
Diversion contrary to U.S. law prohibited.

    (c) Additional destination information. In addition to the 
destination control statement, an exporter or exporter's agent may 
supply additional information on the shipping documents, including the 
country(ies) to which export or reexport is authorized.
    (d) Permissive reexports. If reexport or diversion from the original 
transaction is contemplated and the change from the original transaction 
is consistent with the license, License Exception, the NLR provisions of 
the EAR or other authorization and with all other requirements of the 
EAR, the exporter may so advise its foreign importer without obtaining 
further authorization from BXA.
    (e) Responsibility for assuring that the destination control 
statement is used--(1) Exporters. The exporter is responsible for 
assuring entry of the destination control statement on the commercial 
invoice, regardless of whether the exporter actually prepares this 
document. The exporter has this responsibility even if the invoice is 
prepared by an order party or the exporter acts through an agent.
    (2) Agents of exporters (forwarding agents). Agents of exporters are 
also responsible for assuring entry of the destination control statement 
on the commercial invoice.
    (i) If the agent receives from the exporter a copy of a commercial 
invoice without the correct destination control statement, the agent 
must:
    (A) Notify the exporter in writing;
    (B) Request written assurance from the exporter that:
    (1) The destination control statement has been properly entered on 
all other copies of the commercial invoice; and
    (2) Any person who received an invoice without the statement has 
been informed in writing of the restrictions in the statement;
    (ii) And either:
    (A) Enter the appropriate statement on the agent's copy of the 
invoice; or
    (B) Return it to the exporter for completion; and
    (iii) Keep and make available for inspection, in accordance with 
part 762 of the EAR, a copy of that person's notification to the 
exporter and the original of the exporter's assurance required by 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section. (For further recordkeeping 
requirements, see part 762 of the EAR.)
    (iv) If the agent prepares the invoice, the agent's responsibilities 
are governed by paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (3) Forwarders, carriers and other parties who prepare invoices. If 
a forwarder, a carrier acting as a forwarder, or any other party 
prepares, presents, and/or executes the invoice, the forwarder, carrier, 
or other party is also responsible for assuring that an appropriate 
statement is entered on the invoice.
    (4) Carriers and other parties who issue bills of lading or air 
waybills. The carrier, or any other party that issues the bill of lading 
or air waybill, is responsible for assuring that the destination control 
statement appearing on the corresponding invoice also appears on the 
bill of lading or air waybill.
    (f) Responsibility for distributing copies of the invoice. The 
exporter or other person issuing any invoice containing a

[[Page 345]]

destination control statement must send copies in a manner which assures 
their arrival either with or prior to arrival of the items being 
exported to:
    (1) The ultimate consignee and the purchaser named in the SED;
    (2) The intermediate consignee; and
    (3) Any other persons named in the invoice who are located in a 
foreign country. Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to 
limit the persons or classes of persons to whom such invoices, bills of 
lading or air waybills are usually and customarily sent in the course of 
export trade. The shipper or other person issuing the commercial invoice 
may comply with the requirements of this section even if the copy of the 
invoice sent to any of the persons listed in paragraphs (f)(1) or (2) 
this section omits all reference to price or sales commission provided 
such invoice otherwise adequately identifies the shipment. As an 
alternative in lieu of a copy of the commercial invoice, such person may 
send a copy of the bill of lading or air waybill containing the 
destination control statement.
    (g) Requirements for bill of lading or air waybill--(1) General. No 
carrier may issue (and no one may prepare or procure) a bill of lading 
or air waybill covering an export for which a destination control 
statement is required under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
section, unless all copies of such bill of lading or air waybill 
(including all non-negotiable and office copies) contain the destination 
control statement in clearly legible form.
    (2) Exception for ``master'' air waybills. In the case of shipments 
by air (other than airmail or air parcel post), the requirement of 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section applies to any air waybill, 
including one issued by a consolidator (indirect carrier) for an export 
included in a consolidated shipment. However, the provisions of 
paragraph (f) of this section do not apply to a ``master'' air waybill 
issued by a carrier to cover a consolidated shipment.
    (h) Requirements for the commercial invoice. No licensee, shipper, 
consignor, exporter, agent, or any other person may prepare or issue a 
commercial invoice for a shipment for which a destination control 
statement is required under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
section, unless all copies of the invoice(s) contain the statement in 
clearly legible form.
    (i) Carrier's responsibility before releasing cargo. No carrier may 
release custody of a shipment covered by the provisions of this section 
to any party without surrender by that party, to the carrier, of a copy 
of the bill of lading or air waybill bearing on its face the applicable 
destination control statement, unless either:
    (1) Simultaneously with the release, the carrier delivers to such 
party a written copy of the destination control statement, contained in 
the carrier's copy of the bill of lading or air waybill for the 
shipment. The written copy must identify the shipment by bill of lading 
or air waybill number, name of carrier, voyage or flight number, date, 
and port of arrival. The carrier must also secure either a signed 
receipted copy of the written statement or other equivalent written 
evidence that the statement has been delivered by the carrier; or,
    (2) The regulations of the importing country require the carrier to 
deliver the items directly into the physical possession and control of 
customs or other government agency for delivery to the consignee or the 
consignee's agent. In this case, the carrier need not give to, or 
receive from, the customs or other government agency, or the consignee 
or the consignee's agent, any document bearing the destination control 
statement.

<R05>
Sec. 758.7  Authority of the Office of Export Enforcement, the Bureau of Export Administration, Customs offices and Postmasters in clearing shipments

    (a) Actions to assure compliance with the EAR. Officials of BXA, the 
Office of Export Enforcement, the U.S. Customs Service and postmasters, 
including post office officials, are authorized and directed to take 
appropriate action to assure compliance with the EAR. This includes 
assuring that:
    (1) Exports without a license issued by BXA are either outside the 
scope of the license requirements of the Export

[[Page 346]]

Administration Regulations or authorized by a License Exception; and
    (2) Exports purporting to be authorized by licenses issued by BXA 
are, in fact, so authorized and the transaction complies with the terms 
of the license.
    (b) Types of actions. The officials designated in paragraph (a) of 
this section are authorized to take the following types of actions:
    (1) Inspection of items--(i) Purpose of inspection. All items 
declared for export are subject to inspection for the purpose of 
verifying the items specified in the SED, or if there is no SED, the 
bill of lading or other loading document covering the items about to be 
exported, and the value and quantity thereof, and to assure observance 
of the other provisions of the Export Administration Regulations. This 
authority applies to all exports within the scope of the Export 
Administration Act or Export Administration Regulations whether or not 
such exports require a license issued by BXA. The inspection may 
include, but is not limited to, item identification, technical appraisal 
(analysis), or both.
    (ii) Place of inspection. Inspection shall be made at the place of 
lading or where officials authorized to make those inspections are 
stationed for that purpose.
    (iii) Technical identification. Where, in the judgment of the 
official making the inspection, the item cannot be properly identified, 
a sample may be taken for more detailed examination or for laboratory 
analysis.
    (A) Obtaining samples. The sample will be obtained by the official 
making the inspection in accordance with the provisions for sampling 
imported merchandise. The size of the sample will be the minimum 
representative amount necessary for identification or analysis. This 
will depend on such factors as the physical condition of the material 
(whether solid, liquid, or gas) and the size and shape of the container.
    (B) Notification to exporter and consignee. When a sample is taken, 
the exporter (or the exporter's agent) and the ultimate consignee will 
be notified by letter from one of the official designated in paragraph 
(a) of this section, showing the port of export, date of sampling, 
export license number (if any) or other authorization, invoice number 
quantity of sample taken, description of item, marks and packing case 
numbers, and manufacturer's number for the item. The original letter 
will be sent to the exporter or the exporter's agent, the duplicate will 
be placed in the container that had been opened, and the triplicate will 
be retained by the inspecting office.
    (C) Disposal of samples. Samples will be disposed of in accordance 
with the U.S. Customs Service procedure for imported commodities.
    (2) Inspection of documents--(i) General. Officials designated in 
paragraph (a) of this section are authorized to require exporters or 
their agents, and owners and operators of exporting carriers or their 
agents, to produce for inspection or copying: invoices, orders, letters 
of credit, inspection reports, packing lists, shipping documents and 
instructions, correspondence, and any other relevant documents, as well 
as furnish other information bearing upon a particular shipment being 
exported or intended to be exported.
    (ii) Cartridge and shell case scrap. When cartridge or shell cases 
are being exported as scrap (whether or not they have been heated, 
flame-treated, mangled, crushed, or cut) from the United States, the 
U.S. Customs Service is authorized to require the exporter to furnish 
information bearing on the identity and relationships of all parties to 
the transaction and produce a copy of the bid offer by the armed 
services in order to assure that the terms of the Export Administration 
Regulations are being met and that the material being shipped is scrap.
    (3) Questioning of individuals. Officials designated in paragraph 
(a) of this section are authorized to question the owner or operator of 
an exporting carrier and the carrier's agent(s), as well as the exporter 
and the exporter's agent(s), concerning a particular shipment exported 
or intended to be exported.
    (4) Prohibiting lading. Officials designated in paragraph (a) of 
this section are authorized to prevent the lading of items on an 
exporting carrier whenever those officials have reasonable cause to 
believe that the export or removal from the United States is contrary to

[[Page 347]]

the Export Administration Regulations.
    (5) Inspection of exporting carrier. The U.S. Customs Service is 
authorized to inspect and search any exporting carrier at any time to 
determine whether items are intended to be, or are being, exported or 
removed from the United States contrary to the Export Administration 
Regulations. Officials of the Office of Export Enforcement may conduct 
such inspections with the concurrence of the U.S. Customs Service.
    (6) Seizure and detention. Customs officers are authorized, under 
Title 22 of the United States Code, section 401, et seq., to seize and 
detain any items whenever an attempt is made to export such items in 
violation of the Export Administration Regulations, or whenever they 
know or have probable cause to believe that the items are intended to 
be, are being, or have been exported in violation of the EAR. Seized 
items are subject to forfeiture. In addition to the authority of Customs 
officers to seize and detain items, both Customs officials and officials 
of the Office of Export Enforcement are authorized to detain any 
shipment held for review of the SED, or if there is no SED, the bill of 
lading or other loading document covering the items about to be 
exported, or for physical inspection of the items, whenever such action 
is deemed to be necessary to assure compliance with the EAR.
    (7) Preventing departure of carrier. The U.S. Customs Service is 
authorized under Title 22 of the U. S. Code, section 401, et seq., to 
seize and detain, either before or after clearance, any vessel or 
vehicle or air carrier that has been or is being used in exporting or 
attempting to export any item intended to be, being, or having been 
exported in violation of the EAR.
    (8) Ordering the unloading. The U.S. Customs Service is authorized 
to unload, or to order the unloading of, items from any exporting 
carrier, whenever the U.S. Customs Service has reasonable cause to 
believe such items are intended to be, or are being, exported or removed 
from the United States contrary to the EAR.
    (9) Ordering the return of items. If, after notice that an 
inspection of a shipment is to be made, a carrier departs without 
affording the U.S. Customs Service, Office of Export Enforcement, or BXA 
personnel an adequate opportunity to examine the shipment, the owner or 
operator of the exporting carrier and the exporting carrier's agent(s) 
may be ordered to return items exported on such exporting carrier and 
make them available for inspection.
    (10) Designating time and place for clearance. The U.S. Customs 
Service is authorized to designate times and places at which U.S. 
exports may move by land transportation to countries contiguous to the 
United States.

<R05>
Sec. 758.8  Return or unloading of cargo at direction of BXA, the Office of Export Enforcement or Customs Service.

    (a) Exporting carrier. As used in this section, the term ``exporting 
carrier'' includes a connecting or on-forwarding carrier, as well as the 
owner, charterer, agent, master, or any other person in charge of the 
vessel, aircraft, or other kind of carrier, whether such person is 
located in the United States or in a foreign country.
    (b) Ordering return or unloading of shipment. Where there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of the Export 
Administration Regulations has occurred, or will occur, with respect to 
a particular export from the United States, BXA, the Office of Export 
Enforcement, or the U.S. Customs Service may order any person in 
possession or control of such shipment, including the exporting carrier, 
to return or unload the shipment. Such person must, as ordered, either:
    (1) Return the shipment to the United States or cause it to be 
returned or;
    (2) Unload the shipment at a port of call and take steps to assure 
that it is placed in custody under bond or other guaranty not to enter 
the commerce of any foreign country without prior approval of BXA. For 
the purpose of this section, the furnishing of a copy of the order to 
any person included within the definition of exporting carrier will be 
sufficient notice of the order to the exporting carrier.

[[Page 348]]

    (c) Requirements regarding shipment to be unloaded. The provisions 
of Sec. 758.5(b) and (c) of this part, relating to reporting, 
notification to BXA, and the prohibition against unauthorized delivery 
or entry of the item into a foreign country, shall apply also when items 
are unloaded at a port of call, as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (d) Notification. Upon discovery by any person included within the 
term ``exporting carrier,'' as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, 
that a violation of the EAR has occurred or will occur with respect to a 
shipment on board, or otherwise in the possession or control of the 
carrier, such person must immediately notify both:
    (1) The Office of Export Enforcement at the following address: Room 
H-4520, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Ave., 
N.W., Washington D.C. 20230, Telephone: (202) 482 1208, Facsimile: (202) 
482-0964; and
    (2) The person in actual possession or control of the shipment.


<R05>
Sec. 758.9  Other applicable laws and regulations.

    The provisions of this part 758 apply only to exports regulated by 
BXA. Nothing contained in this part 758 shall relieve any person from 
complying with any other law of the United States or rules and 
regulations issued thereunder, including those governing SEDs and 
manifests, or any applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Customs 
Service.

Sec. 760.1  Definitions.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Definition of Person. For purposes of this part, the term person 
means any individual, or any association or organization, public or 
private, which is organized, permanently established, resident, or 
registered to do business, in the United States or any foreign country. 
This definition of person includes both the singular and plural and, in 
addition, includes:
    (1) Any partnership, corporation, company, branch, or other form of 
association or organization, whether organized for profit or non-profit 
purposes;
    (2) Any government, or any department, agency, or commission of any 
government;
    (3) Any trade association, chamber of commerce, or labor union;
    (4) Any charitable or fraternal organization; and
    (5) Any other association or organization not specifically listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (b) Definition of ``United States Person''. (1) This part applies to 
United States persons. For purposes of this part, the term United States 
person

[[Page 349]]

means any person who is a United States resident or national, including 
individuals, domestic concerns, and ``controlled in fact'' foreign 
subsidiaries, affiliates, or other permanent foreign establishments of 
domestic concerns. This definition of United States person includes both 
the singular and plural and, in addition, includes:
    (i) The government of the United States or any department, agency, 
or commission thereof;
    (ii) The government of any State of the United States, the District 
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any subdivision, department, agency, 
or commission of any such government;
    (iii) Any partnership, corporation, company, association, or other 
entity organized under the laws of paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section;
    (iv) Any foreign concern's subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, 
branch, office, or other permanent establishment in any state of the 
United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States; and
    (v) Any domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership, 
affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment 
which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern. (See paragraph (c) 
of this section on ``Definition of 'Controlled in Fact'.'')
    (2) The term domestic concern means any partnership, corporation, 
company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws 
of, any jurisdiction named in paragraph (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of this 
section, or any permanent domestic establishment of a foreign concern.
    (3) The term foreign concern means any partnership, corporation, 
company, association, or other entity of, or organized under the laws 
of, any jurisdiction other than those named in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or 
(ii) of this section.
    (4) The term United States person does not include an individual 
United States national who is resident outside the United States and who 
is either employed permanently or temporarily by a non-United States 
person or assigned to work as an employee for, and under the direction 
and control of, a non-United States person.

                  Examples of ``United States Person''

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
whether a person is a ``United States person.'' They are illustrative, 
not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. bank A has a branch office in foreign country P. Such 
branch office is a United States person, because it is a permanent 
foreign establishment of a domestic concern.
    (ii) Ten foreign nationals establish a manufacturing plant, A, in 
the United States, incorporating the plant under New York law.
    A is a United States person, because it is a corporation organized 
under the laws of one of the states of the United States.
    (iii) A, a foreign corporation, opens an office in the United States 
for purposes of soliciting U.S. orders. The office is not separately 
incorporated.
    A's U.S. office is a United States person, because it is a permanent 
establishment, in the United States, of a foreign concern.
    (iv) A, a U.S. individual, owns stock in foreign corporation B.
    A is a United States person. However, A is not a ``domestic 
concern,'' because the term ``domestic concern'' does not include 
individuals.
    (v) A, a foreign national resident in the United States, is employed 
by B, a foreign corporation.
    A is a United States person, because he is resident in the United 
States.
    (vi) A, a foreign national, who is resident in a foreign country and 
is employed by a foreign corporation, makes occasional visits to the 
United States, for purposes of exploring business opportunities.
    A is not a United States person, because he is not a United States 
resident or national.
    (vii) A is an association of U.S. firms organized under the laws of 
Pennsylvania for the purpose of expanding trade.
    A is a United States person, because it is an association organized 
under the laws of one of the states of the United States.
    (viii) At the request of country Y, A, an individual employed by 
U.S. company B, is transferred to company C as an employee. C is a 
foreign company owned and controlled by country Y. A, a U.S. national 
who will reside in Y, has agreed to the transfer provided he is able to 
retain his insurance, pension, and other benefits. Accordingly, company 
B has agreed to keep A as an employee in order to protect his employee 
benefits, and company C has agreed to pay for A's salary. At all times 
while he works for C, A will be under C's direction and control.
    A is not a United States person while under C's direction and 
control, because he

[[Page 350]]

will be resident outside the United States and assigned as an employee 
to a non-United States person. The arrangement designed to protect A's 
insurance, pension, and other benefits does not destroy his status as an 
employee of C so long as he is under the direction and control of C.
    (ix) A, a U.S. citizen, has resided in Europe for three years, where 
he is a self-employed consultant for United States and foreign companies 
in the communications industry.
    A is a United States person, because he is a U.S. national and 
because he is not a resident outside the United States who is employed 
by other than a United States person.

    (c) Definition of ``Controlled in Fact''. (1) This part applies to 
any domestic concern's foreign subsidiary, partnership, affiliate, 
branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment which is 
controlled in fact by such domestic concern. Control in fact consists of 
the authority or ability of a domestic concern to establish the general 
policies or to control day-to-day operations of its foreign subsidiary, 
partnership, affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign 
establishment.
    (2) A foreign subsidiary or affiliate of a domestic concern will be 
presumed to be controlled in fact by that domestic concern, subject to 
rebuttal by competent evidence, when:
    (i) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whether 
directly or indirectly) more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting 
securities of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate;
    (ii) The domestic concern beneficially owns or controls (whether 
directly or indirectly) 25 percent or more of the voting securities of 
the foreign subsidiary or affiliate, if no other person owns or controls 
(whether directly or indirectly) an equal or larger percentage;
    (iii) The foreign subsidiary or affiliate is operated by the 
domestic concern pursuant to the provisions of an exclusive management 
contract;
    (iv) A majority of the members of the board of directors of the 
foreign subsidiary or affiliate are also members of the comparable 
governing body of the domestic concern;
    (v) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the majority of 
the members of the board of directors of the foreign subsidiary or 
affiliate; or
    (vi) The domestic concern has authority to appoint the chief 
operating officer of the foreign subsidiary or affiliate.
    (3) A brokerage firm or other person which holds simple record 
ownership of securities for the convenience of clients will not be 
deemed to control the securities.
    (4) A domestic concern which owns, directly or indirectly, 
securities that are immediately convertible at the option of the holder 
or owner into voting securities is presumed to own or control those 
voting securities.
    (5) A domestic concern's foreign branch office or other 
unincorporated permanent foreign establishment is deemed to be 
controlled in fact by such domestic concern under all circumstances.

                   Examples of ``Controlled in Fact''

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which a foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other 
permanent foreign establishment of a domestic concern is ``controlled in 
fact.'' They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Fifty-one 
percent of the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (ii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Ten percent of 
the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B. A has an exclusive 
management contract with B pursuant to which A is operated by B.
    As long as such contract is in effect, A is presumed to be 
controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be rebutted by competent 
evidence showing that control does not, in fact, lie with B.
    (iii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Ten percent of 
the voting stock of A is owned by U.S. company B. A has 10 persons on 
its board of directors. Six of those persons are also members of the 
board of directors of U.S. company B.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (iv) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Thirty percent 
of the voting securities of A is owned by U.S. company B and no other 
person owns or controls an equal or larger share.

[[Page 351]]

    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (v) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. In A's articles 
of incorporation, U.S. company B has been given authority to appoint A's 
board of directors.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (vi) Company A is a joint venture established in a foreign country, 
with equal participation by U.S. company B and foreign company C. U.S. 
Company B has authority to appoint A's chief operating officer.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B. This presumption may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control does not, in fact, 
lie with B.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that B has no authority to appoint A's 
chief operating officer.
    B is not presumed to control A, absent other facts giving rise to a 
presumption of control.
    (viii) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. U.S. 
companies B, C, and D each own 20 percent of A's voting securities and 
regularly cast their votes in concert.
    A is presumed to be controlled in fact by B, C, and D, because these 
companies are acting in concert to control A.
    (ix) U.S. bank B located in the United States has a branch office, 
A, in a foreign country. A is not separately incorporated.
    A is deemed to be controlled in fact by B, because A is a branch 
office of a domestic concern.
    (x) Company A is incorporated in a foreign country. Fifty-one 
percent of the voting stock of A is owned by company B, which is 
incorporated in another foreign country. Fifty-one percent of the voting 
stock of B is owned by C, a U.S. company.
    Both A and B are presumed to be controlled in fact by C. The 
presumption of C's control over B may be rebutted by competent evidence 
showing that control over B does not, in fact, lie with C. The 
presumption of B's control over A (and thus C's control over A) may be 
rebutted by competent evidence showing that control over A does not, in 
fact, lie with B.
    (xi) B, a U.S. individual, owns 51 percent of the voting securities 
of A, a manufacturing company incorporated and located in a foreign 
country.
    A is not ``controlled in fact'' under this part, because it is not 
controlled by a ``domestic concern.''

    (d) Definition of ``Activities in the Interstate or Foreign Commerce 
of the United States''.

 Activities Involving United States Persons Located in the United States

    (1) For purposes of this part, the activities of a United States 
person located in the United States are in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States if they involve the sale, purchase, or 
transfer of goods or services (including information) between:
    (i) Two or more of the several States (including the District of 
Columbia);
    (ii) Any State (including the District of Columbia) and any 
territory or possession of the United States;
    (iii) Two or more of the territories or possessions of the United 
States; or
    (iv) A State (including the District of Columbia), territory or 
possession of the United States and any foreign country.
    (2) For purposes of this part, the export of goods or services from 
the United States and the import of goods or services into the United 
States are activities in United States commerce. In addition, the action 
of a domestic concern in specifically directing the activities of its 
controlled in fact foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent 
foreign establishment is an activity in United States commerce.
    (3) Activities of a United States person located in the United 
States may be in United States commerce even if they are part of or 
ancillary to activities outside United States commerce. However, the 
fact that an ancillary activity is in United States commerce does not, 
in and of itself, mean that the underlying or related activity is in 
United States commerce.
    (4) Hence, the action of a United States bank located in the United 
States in providing financing from the United States for a foreign 
transaction that is not in United States commerce is nonetheless itself 
in United States commerce. However, the fact that the financing is in 
United States commerce does not, in and of itself, make the underlying 
foreign transaction an activity in United States commerce, even if the 
underlying transaction involves a foreign company that is a United 
States person within the meaning of this part.
    (5) Similarly, the action of a United States person located in the 
United

[[Page 352]]

States in providing financial, accounting, legal, t ransportation, or 
other ancillary services to its controlled in fact foreign subsidiary, 
affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment in connection with a 
foreign transaction is in United States commerce. But the provision of 
such ancillary services will not, in and of itself, bring the foreign 
transaction of such subsidiary, affiliate, or permanent foreign 
establishment into United States commerce.

 Activities of Controlled in Fact Foreign Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and 
                 Other Permanent Foreign Establishments

    (6) Any transaction between a controlled in fact foreign subsidiary, 
affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment of a domestic 
concern and a person located in the United States is an activity in 
United States commerce.
    (7) Whether a transaction between such a foreign subsidiary, 
affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment and a person located 
outside the United States is an activity in United States commerce is 
governed by the following rules.

                  Activities in United States Commerce

    (8) A transaction between a domestic concern's controlled in fact 
foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment 
and a person outside the United States, involving goods or services 
(including information but not including ancillary services) acquired 
from a person in the United States is in United States commerce under 
any of the following circumstances--
    (i) If the goods or services were acquired for the purpose of 
filling an order from a person outside the United States;
    (ii) If the goods or services were acquired for incorporation into, 
refining into, reprocessing into, or manufacture of another product for 
the purpose of filling an order from a person outside the United States;
    (iii) If the goods or services were acquired for the purpose of 
fulfilling or engaging in any other transaction with a person outside 
the United States; or
    (iv) If the goods were acquired and are ultimately used, without 
substantial alteration or modification, in filling an order from, or 
fulfilling or engaging in any other transaction with, a person outside 
the United States (whether or not the goods were originally acquired for 
that purpose). If the goods are indistinguishable as to origin from 
similar foreign-trade goods with which they have been mingled in a 
stockpile or inventory, the subsequent transaction involving the goods 
is presumed to be in United States commerce unless, at the time of 
filling the order, the foreign-origin inventory on hand was sufficient 
to fill the order.
    (9) For purposes of this section, goods or services are considered 
to be acquired for the purpose of filling an order from or engaging in 
any other transaction with a person outside the United States where:
    (i) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or 
other permanent foreign establishment upon the receipt of an order from 
or on behalf of a customer with the intention that the goods or services 
are to go to the customer;
    (ii) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or 
other permanent foreign establishment to meet the needs of specified 
customers pursuant to understandings with those customers, although not 
for immediate delivery; or
    (iii) They are purchased by the foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or 
other permanent foreign establishment based on the anticipated needs of 
specified customers.
    (10) If any non-ancillary part of a transaction between a domestic 
concern's controlled foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent 
foreign establishment and a person outside the United States is in 
United States commerce, the entire transaction is in United States 
commerce. For example, if such a foreign subsidiary is engaged in 
filling an order from a non-United States customer both with goods 
acquired from the United States and with goods acquired elsewhere, the 
entire transaction with that customer is in United States commerce.

[[Page 353]]

                Activities Outside United States Commerce

    (11) A transaction between a domestic concern's controlled foreign 
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment and a 
person outside the United States, not involving the purchase, sale, or 
transfer of goods or services (including information) to or from a 
person in the United States, is not an activity in United States 
commerce.
    (12) The activities of a domestic concern's controlled foreign 
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment with 
respect to goods acquired from a person in the United States are not in 
United States commerce where:
    (i) They were acquired without reference to a specific order from or 
transaction with a person outside the United States; and
    (ii) They were further manufactured, incorporated into, refined 
into, or reprocessed into another product.
    (13) The activities of a domestic concern's controlled foreign 
subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent foreign establishment with 
respect to services acquired from a person in the United States are not 
in United States commerce where:
    (i) They were acquired without reference to a specific order from or 
transaction with a person outside the United States; or
    (ii) They are ancillary to the transaction with the person outside 
the United States.
    (14) For purposes of this section, services are ancillary services 
if they are provided to a controlled foreign subsidiary, affiliate, or 
other permanent foreign establishment primarily for its own use rather 
than for the use of a third person. These typically include financial, 
accounting, legal,transportation, and other services, whether provided 
by a domestic concern or an unrelated entity.
    (15) Thus, the provision of the project financing by a United States 
bank located in the United States to a controlled foreign subsidiary 
unrelated to the bank is an ancillary service which will not cause the 
underlying transaction to be in United States commerce. By contrast, 
where a domestic concern, on behalf of its controlled foreign 
subsidiary, gives a guaranty of performance to a foreign country 
customer, that is a service provided to the customer and, as such, 
brings that subsidiary's transaction with the customer into United 
States commerce. Similarly, architectural or engineering services 
provided by a domestic concern in connection with its controlled foreign 
subsidiary's construction project in a third country are services passed 
through to the subsidiary's customer and, as such, bring that 
subsidiary's foreign transaction into United States commerce.

                                 General

    (16) Regardless of whether the subsequent disposition of goods or 
services from the United States is in United States commerce, the 
original acquisition of goods or services from a person in the United 
States is an activity in United States commerce subject to this part. 
Thus, if a domestic concern's controlled foreign subsidiary engages in a 
prohibited refusal to do business in stocking its inventory with goods 
from the United States, that action is subject to this part whether or 
not subsequent sales from that inventory are.
    (17) In all the above, goods and services will be considered to have 
been acquired from a person in the United States whether they were 
acquired directly or indirectly through a third party, where the person 
acquiring the goods or services knows or expects, at the time he places 
the order, that they will be delivered from the United States.

                            Letters of Credit

    (18) Implementation of a letter of credit in the United States by a 
United States person located in the United States, including a permanent 
United States establishment of a foreign concern, is an activity in 
United States commerce.
    (19) Implementation of a letter of credit outside the United States 
by a United States person located outside the United States is in United 
States commerce where the letter of credit (a) specifies a United States 
address for the beneficiary, (b) calls for documents indicating shipment 
from the United

[[Page 354]]

States, or (c) calls for documents indicating that the goods are of 
United States origin.
    (20) See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part on ``Letters of Credit'' to 
determine the circumstances in which paying, honoring, confirming, or 
otherwise implementing a letter of credit is covered by this part.

  Examples of Activities in the Interstate or Foreign Commerce of the 
                              United States

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which an activity is in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

            United States Person Located in the United States

    (i) U.S. company A exports goods from the United States to a foreign 
country. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, because A is exporting goods 
from the United States.
    (ii) U.S. company A imports goods into the United States from a 
foreign country. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, because A is 
importing goods into the United States.
    (iii) U.S. engineering company A supplies consulting services to its 
controlled foreign subsidiary, B. A's activity is in U.S. commerce, 
because A is exporting services from the United States.
    (iv) U.S. company A supplies consulting services to foreign company 
B. B is unrelated to A or any other U.S. person.
    A's activity is in U.S. commerce even though B, a foreign-owned 
company located outside the United States, is not subject to this part, 
because A is exporting services from the United States.
    (v) Same as (iv), except A is a bank located in the United States 
and provides a construction loan to B.
    A's activity is in U.S. commerce even though B is not subject to 
this part, because A is exporting financial services from the United 
States.
    (vi) U.S. company A issues policy directives from time to time to 
its controlled foreign subsidiary, B, governing the conduct of B's 
activities with boycotting countries.
    A's activity in directing the activities of its foreign subsidiary, 
B, is an activity in U.S. commerce.

     Foreign Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and Other Permanent Foreign 
                   Establishments of Domestic Concerns

    (i) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, purchases 
goods from the United States.
    A's purchase of goods from the United States is in U.S. commerce, 
because A is importing goods from the United States. Whether A's 
subsequent disposition of these goods is in U.S. commerce is irrelevant. 
Similarly, the fact that A purchased goods from the United States does 
not, in and of itself, make any subsequent disposition of those goods an 
activity in U.S. commerce.
    (ii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, receives 
an order from boycotting country Y for construction materials. A places 
an order with U.S. company B for the materials.
    A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, because the 
materials are purchased from the United States for the purpose of 
filling the order from Y.
    (iii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, receives 
an order from boycotting country Y for construction materials. A places 
an order with U.S. company B for some of the materials, and with U.S. 
company C, an unrelated company, for the rest of the materials.
    A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, because the 
materials are purchased from the United States for the purpose of 
filling the order from Y. It makes no difference whether the materials 
are ordered from B or C.
    (iv) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is in the 
wholesale and retail appliance sales business. A purchases finished air 
conditioning units from the United States from time to time in order to 
stock its inventory. A's inventory is also stocked with air conditioning 
units purchased outside the United States. A receives an order for air 
conditioning units from Y, a boycotting country. The order is filled 
with U.S.-origin units in A's inventory.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because its U.S.-origin 
goods are resold without substantial alteration.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that A is in the chemicals distribution 
business. Its U.S.-origin goods are mingled in inventory with foreign-
origin goods.
    A's sale to Y of unaltered goods from its general inventory is 
presumed to be in U.S. commerce unless A can show that at the time of 
the sale the foreign-origin inventory on hand was sufficient to cover 
the shipment to Y.
    (vi) A, a foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, receives an order 
from boycotting country Y for computers. A places an order with U.S. 
company B for some of the components; with U.S. company C, an unrelated 
company, for other components; and with foreign company D for the rest 
of the components. A then assembles the computers and ships them to Y.
    A's transaction with Y is an activity in U.S. commerce, because some 
of the components are acquired from the United States for purposes of 
filling an order from Y.

[[Page 355]]

    (vii) Same as (vi), except A purchases all the components from non-
U.S.sources.
    A's transaction with Y is not an activity in U.S. commerce, because 
it involves no export of goods from the United States. It makes no 
difference whether the technology A uses to manufacture computers was 
originally acquired from its U.S. parent.
    (viii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, 
manufactures computers. A stocks its general components and parts 
inventory with purchases made at times from the United States and at 
times from foreign sources. A receives an order from Y, a boycotting 
country, for computers. A fills that order by manufacturing the 
computers using materials from its general inventory.
    A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce, because the U.S.-
origin components are not acquired for the purpose of meeting the 
anticipated needs of specified customers in Y. It is irrelevant that A's 
operations may be based on U.S.-origin technology.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that in anticipation of the order from 
Y, A orders and receives the necessary materials from the United States.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because the U.S.-origin 
goods were acquired for the purpose of filling an anticipated order from 
Y.
    (x) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, 
manufactures typewriters. It buys typewriter components both from the 
United States and from foreign sources. A sells its output in various 
places throughout the world, including boycotting country Y. Its sales 
to Y vary from year to year, but have averaged approximately 20 percent 
of sales for the past five years. A expects that its sales to Y will 
remain at approximately that level in the years ahead although it has no 
contracts or orders from Y on hand.
    A's sales of typewriters to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the 
U.S. components are not acquired for the purpose of filling an order 
from Y. A general expectancy of future sales is not an ``order'' within 
the meaning of this section.
    (xi) U.S. company A's corporate counsel provides legal advice to B, 
its controlled foreign subsidiary, on the applicability of this Part to 
B's transactions.
    While provision of this legal advice is itself an activity in U.S. 
commerce, it does not, in and of itself, bring B's activities into U.S. 
commerce.
    (xii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is in 
the general construction business. A enters into a contract with 
boycotting country Y to construct a power plant in Y. In preparing 
engineering drawings and specifications, A uses the advice and 
assistance of B.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's services are 
used for purposes of fulfilling the contract with Y. B's services are 
not ancillary services, because the engineering services in connection 
with construction of the power plant are part of the services ultimately 
provided to Y by A.
    (xiii) Same as (xii), except that A gets no engineering advice or 
assistance from B. However, B's corporate counsel provides legal advice 
to A regarding the structure of the transaction. In addition, B's 
corporate counsel draws up the contract documents.
    A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce. The legal services 
provided to A are ancillary services, because they are not part of the 
services provided to Y by A in fulfillment of its contract with Y.
    (xiv) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, enters 
into a contract to construct an apartment complex in boycotting country 
Y. A will fulfill its contract completely with goods and services from 
outside the United States. Pursuant to a provision in the contract, B 
guarantees A's performance of the contract.
    A's transaction with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's guaranty of 
A's performance involves the acquisition of services from the United 
States for purposes of fulfilling the transaction with Y, and those 
services are part of the services ultimately provided to Y.
    (xv) Same as (xiv), except that the guaranty of A's performance is 
supplied by C, a non-U.S. person located outside the United States. 
However, unrelated to any particular transaction, B from time to time 
provides general financial, legal, and technical services to A.
    A's transaction with Y is not in U.S. commerce, because the services 
acquired from the United States are not acquired for purposes of 
fulfilling the contract with Y.
    (xvi) A, a foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, has a contract with 
boycotting country Y to conduct oil drilling operations in that country. 
In conducting these operations, A from time to time seeks certain 
technical advice from B regarding the operation of the drilling rigs.
    A's contract with Y is in U.S. commerce, because B's services are 
sought for purposes of fulfilling the contract with Y and are part of 
the services ultimately provided to Y.
    (xvii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, enters 
into a contract to sell typewriters to boycotting country Y. A is 
located in non-boycotting country P. None of the components are acquired 
from the United States. A engages C, a U.S. shipping company, to 
transport the typewriters from P to Y.
    A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because in carrying A's 
goods, C is providing an ancillary service to A and not a service to Y.
    (xviii) Same as (xvii), except that A's contract with Y calls for 
title to pass to Y in P.

[[Page 356]]

In addition, the contract calls for A to engage a carrier to make 
delivery to Y.
    A's sales to Y are in U.S. commerce, because in carrying Y's goods, 
C is providing a service to A which is ultimately provided to Y.
    (xix) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, has 
general product liability insurance with U.S. company C. Foreign-origin 
goods sold from time to time by A to boycotting country Y are covered by 
the insurance policy.
    A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the insurance 
provided by C is an ancillary service provided to A which is not 
ultimately provided to Y.
    (xx) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, 
manufactures automobiles abroad under a license agreement with B. From 
time to time, A sells such goods to boycotting country Y.
    A's sales to Y are not in U.S. commerce, because the rights conveyed 
by the license are not acquired for the specific purpose of engaging in 
transactions with Y.

    (e) ``Intent''. (1) This part prohibits a United States person from 
taking or knowingly agreeing to take certain specified actions with 
intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign 
boycott.
    (2) A United States person has the intent to comply with, further, 
or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott when such a boycott is at 
least one of the reasons for that person's decision whether to take a 
particular prohibited action. So long as that is at least one of the 
reasons for that person's action, a violation occurs regardless of 
whether the prohibited action is also taken for non-boycott reasons. 
Stated differently, the fact that such action was taken for legitimate 
business reasons does not remove that action from the scope of this part 
if compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott was also a reason for 
the action.
    (3) Intent is a necessary element of any violation of this part. It 
is not sufficient that one take action that is specifically prohibited 
by this part. It is essential that one take such action with intent to 
comply with, further,or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. 
Accordingly, a person who inadvertently, without boycott intent, takes a 
prohibited action, does not commit any violation of this part.
    (4) Intent in this context means the reason or purpose for one's 
behavior. It does not mean that one has to agree with the boycott in 
question or desire that it succeed or that it be furthered or supported. 
But it does mean that the reason why a particular prohibited action was 
taken must be established.
    (5) Reason or purpose can be proved by circumstantial evidence. For 
example, if a person receives a request to supply certain boycott 
information, the furnishing of which is prohibited by this part, and he 
knowingly supplies that information in response, he clearly intends to 
comply with that boycott request. It is irrelevant that he may disagree 
with or object to the boycott itself. Information will be deemed to be 
furnished with the requisite intent if the person furnishing the 
information knows that it was sought for boycott purposes. On the other 
hand, if a person refuses to do business with someone who happens to be 
blacklisted, but the reason is because that person produces an inferior 
product, the requisite intent does not exist.
    (6) Actions will be deemed to be taken with intent to comply with an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott if the person taking such action knew that 
such action was required or requested for boycott reasons. On the other 
hand, the mere absence of a business relationship with a blacklisted 
person or with or in a boycotted country does not indicate the existence 
of the requisite intent.
    (7) In seeking to determine whether the requisite intent exists, all 
available evidence will be examined.

                         Examples of ``Intent''

    The following examples are intended to illustrate the factors which 
will be considered in determining whether the required intent exists. 
They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. person A does business in boycotting country Y. In 
selecting firms to supply goods for shipment to Y, A chooses supplier B 
because B's products are less expensive and of higher quality than the 
comparable products of supplier C. A knows that C is blacklisted, but 
that is not a reason for A's selection of B.
    A's choice of B rather than C is not action with intent to comply 
with Y's boycott, because C's blacklist status is not a reason for A's 
action.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that A chooses B rather than C in part 
because C is blacklisted by Y.

[[Page 357]]

    Since C's blacklist status is a reason for A's choice, A's action is 
taken with intent to comply with Y's boycott.
    (iii) U.S. person A bids on a tender issued by boycotting country Y. 
A inadvertently fails to notice a prohibited certification which appears 
in the tender document. A's bid is accepted.
    A's action in bidding was not taken with intent to comply with Y's 
boycott, because the boycott was not a reason for A's action.
    (iv) U.S. bank A engages in letter of credit transactions, in favor 
of U.S. beneficiaries, involving the shipments of U.S. goods to 
boycotting country Y. As A knows, such letters of credit routinely 
contain conditions requiring prohibited certifications. A fails to take 
reasonable steps to prevent the implementation of such letters of 
credit. A receives for implementation a letter of credit which in fact 
contains a prohibited condition but does not examine the letter of 
credit to determine whether it contains such a condition.
    Although Y's boycott may not be a specific reason for A's action in 
implementing the letter of credit with a prohibited condition, all 
available evidence shows that A's action was taken with intent to comply 
with the boycott, because A knows or should know that its procedures 
result in compliance with the boycott.
    (v) U.S. bank A engages in letter of credit transactions, in favor 
of U.S. beneficiaries, involving the shipment of U.S. goods to 
boycotting country Y. As A knows, the documentation accompanying such 
letters of credit sometimes contains prohibited certifications. In 
accordance with standard banking practices applicable to A, it does not 
examine such accompanying documentation. A receives a letter of credit 
in favor of a U.S. beneficiary. The letter of credit itself contains no 
prohibited conditions. However, the accompanying documentation, which A 
does not examine, does contain such a condition.
    All available evidence shows that A's action in implementing the 
letter of credit was not taken with intent to comply with the boycott, 
because A has no affirmative obligation to go beyond applicable standard 
banking practices in implementing letters of credit.
    (vi) A, a U.S. company, is considering opening a manufacturing 
facility in boycotted country X. A already has such a facility in 
boycotting country Y. After exploring the possibilities in X, A 
concludes that the market does not justify the move. A is aware that if 
it did open a plant in X, Y might object because of Y's boycott of X. 
However Y's possible objection is not a reason for A's decision not to 
open a plant in X.
    A's decision not to proceed with the plant in X is not action with 
intent to comply with Y's boycott, because Y's boycott of X is not a 
reason for A's decision.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that after exploring the business 
possibilities in X, A concludes that the market does justify the move to 
X. However, A does not open the plant because of Y's possible objections 
due to Y's boycott of X.
    A's decision not to proceed with the plant in X is action taken with 
intent to comply with Y's boycott, because Y's boycott is a reason for 
A's decision.
    (viii) A, a U.S. chemical manufacturer, receives a ``boycott 
questionnaire'' from boycotting country Y asking, among other things, 
whether A has any plants located in boycotted country X. A, which has 
never supported Y's boycott of X, responds to Y's questionnaire, 
indicating affirmatively that it does have plants in X and that it 
intends to continue to have plants in X.
    A's responding to Y's questionnaire is deemed to be action with 
intent to comply with Y's boycott because A knows that the questionnaire 
is boycott-related. It is irrelevant that A does not also wish to 
support Y's boycott.
    (ix) U.S. company A is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. In an 
attempt to secure its removal from the blacklist, A wishes to supply to 
Y information which demonstrates that A does at least as much business 
in Y and other countries engaged in a boycott of X as it does in X. A 
intends to continue its business in X undiminished and in fact is 
exploring and intends to continue exploring an expansion of its 
activities in X without regard to Y's boycott.
    A may furnish the information, because in doing so it has no intent 
to comply with, further, or support Y's boycott.
    (x) U.S. company A has a manufacturing facility in boycotted country 
X. A receives an invitation to bid on a construction project in 
boycotting country Y. The invitation states that all bidders must 
complete a boycott questionnaire and send it in with the bid. The 
questionnaire asks for information about A's business relationships with 
X. Regardless of whether A's bid is successful, A intends to continue 
its business in X undiminished and in fact is exploring and intends to 
continue exploring an expansion of its activities in X without regard to 
Y's boycott.
    A may not answer the questionnaire, because, despite A's intentions 
with regard to its business operations in X, Y's request for completion 
of the questionnaire is for boycott purposes and by responding, A's 
action would betaken with intent to comply with Y's boycott.

    (Note: Example (ix) is distinguishable from (x), because in (ix) A 
is not responding to any boycott request or requirement. Instead, on its 
own initiative, it is supplying information to demonstrate non-
discriminatory conduct as between X and Y without any intent

[[Page 358]]

to comply with, further, or support Y's boycott.)


<R05>
Sec. 760.2  Prohibitions.

    (a) Refusals to do business.

               Prohibition Against Refusals To Do Business

    (1) No United States person may: refuse, knowingly agree to refuse, 
require any other person to refuse, or knowingly agree to require any 
other person to refuse, to do business with or in a boycotted country, 
with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted 
country, with any national or resident of a boycotted country, or with 
any other person, when such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with the 
boycotting country, or a requirement of the boycotting country, or a 
request from or on behalf of the boycotting country.
    (2) Generally, a refusal to do business under this section consists 
of action that excludes a person or country from a transaction for 
boycott reasons. This includes a situation in which a United States 
person chooses or selects one person over another on a boycott basis or 
takes action to carry out another person's boycott-based selection when 
he knows or has reason to know that the other person's selection is 
boycott-based.
    (3) Refusals to do business which are prohibited by this section 
include not only specific refusals, but also refusals implied by a 
course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a specific offer and 
refusal to constitute a refusal to do business; a refusal may occur when 
a United States person has a financial or commercial opportunity and 
declines for boycott reasons to consider or accept it.
    (4) A United States person's use of either a boycott-based list of 
persons with whom he will not deal (a so-called ``blacklist'') or a 
boycott-based list of persons with whom he will deal (a so-called 
``whitelist'') constitutes a refusal to do business.
    (5) An agreement by a United States person to comply generally with 
the laws of the boycotting country with which it is doing business or an 
agreement that local laws of the boycotting country shall apply or 
govern is not, in and of itself, a refusal to do business. Nor, in and 
of itself, is use of a contractual clause explicitly requiring a person 
to assume the risk of loss of non-delivery of his products a refusal to 
do business with any person who will not or cannot comply with such a 
clause. (But see Sec. 760.4 of this part on ``Evasion.'')
    (6) If, for boycott reasons, a United States general manager chooses 
one supplier over another, or enters into a contract with one supplier 
over another, or advises its client to do so, then the general manager's 
actions constitute a refusal to do business under this section. However, 
it is not a refusal to do business under this section for a United 
States person to provide management, procurement, or other pre-award 
services for another person so long as the provision of such pre-award 
services is customary for that firm (or industry of which the firm is a 
part), without regard to the boycotting or non-boycotting character of 
the countries in which they are performed, and the United States person, 
in providing such services, does not act to exclude a person or country 
from the transaction for boycott reasons, or otherwise take actions that 
are boycott-based. For example, a United States person under contract to 
provide general management services in connection with a construction 
project in a boycotting country may compile lists of qualified bidders 
for the client if that service is a customary one and if persons who are 
qualified are not excluded from that list because they are blacklisted.
    (7) With respect to post-award services, if a client makes a 
boycott-based selection, actions taken by the United States general 
manager or contractor to carry out the client's choice are themselves 
refusals to do business if the United States contractor knows or has 
reason to know that the client's choice was boycott-based. (It is 
irrelevant whether the United States contractor also provided pre-award 
services.) Such actions include entering into a contract with the 
selected supplier, notifying the supplier of the client's choice, 
executing a contract on behalf of the client, arranging for inspection 
and shipment of the supplier's

[[Page 359]]

goods, or taking any other action to effect the client's choice. (But 
see Sec. 760.3(c) of this part on ``Compliance with Unilateral 
Selection'' as it may apply to post-award services.)
    (8) An agreement is not a prerequisite to a violation of this 
section since the prohibition extends to actions taken pursuant not only 
to agreements but also to requirements of, and requests from or on 
behalf of, a boycotting country.
    (9) Agreements under this section may be either express or implied 
by a course or pattern of conduct. There need not be a direct request 
from a boycotting country for action by a United States person to have 
been taken pursuant to an agreement with or requirement of a boycotting 
country.
    (10) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are 
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott. The mere absence of a business 
relationship with or in the boycotted country, with any business concern 
organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with national(s) or 
resident(s) of the boycotted country, or with any other person does not 
indicate the existence of the required intent.

      Examples of Refusals and Agreements To Refuse To Do Business

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which, in a boycott situation, a refusal to do 
business or an agreement to refuse to do business is prohibited. They 
are illustrative, not comprehensive.

                         Refusals To Do Business

    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, receives an order for its products from 
boycotting country Y. To fill that order, A solicits bids from U.S. 
companies B and C, manufacturers of components used in A's products. A 
does not, however, solicit bids from U.S. companies D or E, which also 
manufacture such components, because it knows that D and E are 
restricted from doing business in Y and that their products are, 
therefore, not importable into that country.
    Company A may not refuse to solicit bids from D and E for boycott 
reasons, because to do so would constitute a refusal to do business with 
those persons.
    (ii) A, a U.S. exporter, uses company B, a U.S. insurer, to insure 
the shipment of its goods to all its overseas customers. For the first 
time, A receives an order for its products from boycotting country Y. 
Knowing that B is on the blacklist of Y, A arranges with company C, a 
non-blacklisted U.S. insurer, to insure the shipment of its goods to Y.
    A's action constitutes a refusal to do business with B.
    (iii) A, a U.S. exporter, purchases all its liability insurance from 
company B, a U.S. company that does business in boycotted country X. A 
wishes to expand its operations into country Y, the boycotting country. 
Before doing so, A decides to switch from insurer B to insurer C in 
anticipation of a request from Y that A sever its relations with B as a 
condition of doing business in Y.
    A may not switch insurers for this reason, because doing so would 
constitute a refusal to do business with B.
    (iv) U.S. company A exports goods to boycotting country Y. In 
selecting vessels to transport the goods to Y, A chooses only from among 
carriers which call at ports in Y.
    A's action is not a refusal to do business with carriers which do 
not call at ports in Y.
    (v) A, a U.S. bank with a branch office in boycotting country Y, 
sends representatives to boycotted country X to discuss plans for 
opening a branch office in X. Upon learning of these discussions, an 
official of the local boycott office in Y advises A's local branch 
manager that if A opens an office in X it will no longer be allowed to 
do business in Y. As a result of this notification, A decides to abandon 
its plans to open a branch in X.
    Bank A may not abandon its plans to open a branch in X as a result 
of Y's notification, because doing so would constitute a refusal to do 
business in boycotted country X.
    (vi) A, a U.S. company that manufactures office equipment, has been 
restricted from doing business in boycotting country Y because of its 
business dealings with boycotted country X. In an effort to have itself 
removed from Y's blacklist, A ceases its business in X.
    A's action constitutes a refusal to do business in boycotted country 
X.
    (vii) A, a U.S. computer company, does business in boycotting 
country Y. A decides to explore business opportunities in boycotted 
country X. After careful analysis of possible business opportunities in 
X, A decides, solely for business reasons, not to market its products in 
X.
    A's decision not to proceed is not a refusal to do business, because 
it is not based on boycott considerations. A has no affirmative 
obligation to do business in X.

[[Page 360]]

    (viii) A, a U.S. oil company with operations in boycotting country 
Y, has regularly purchased equipment from U.S. petroleum equipment 
suppliers B, C, and D, none of whom is on the blacklist of Y. Because of 
its satisfactory relationship with B, C, and D, A has not dealt with 
other suppliers, including supplier E, who is blacklisted by Y.
    A's failure affirmatively to seek or secure business with 
blacklisted supplier E is not a refusal to do business with E.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except U.S. petroleum equipment supplier E, a 
company on boycotting country Y's blacklist, offers to supply U.S. oil 
company A with goods comparable to those provided by U.S. suppliers B, 
C, and D. A, because it has satisfactorily, established relationships 
with suppliers B, C, and D, does not accept supplier E's offer.
    A's refusal of supplier E's offer is not a refusal to do business, 
because it is based solely on non-boycott considerations. A has no 
affirmative obligation to do business with E.
    (x) A, a U.S. construction company, enters into a contract to build 
an office complex in boycotting country Y. A receives bids from B and C, 
U.S. companies that are equally qualified suppliers of electrical cable 
for the project. A knows that B is blacklisted by Y and that C is not. A 
accepts C's bid, in part because C is as qualified as the other 
potential supplier and in part because C is not blacklisted.
    A's decision to select supplier C instead of blacklisted supplier B 
is a refusal to do business, because the boycott was one of the reasons 
for A's decision.
    (xi) A, a U.S. general contractor, has been retained to construct a 
highway in boycotting country Y. A circulates an invitation to bid to 
U.S. manufacturers of road-building equipment. One of the conditions 
listed in the invitation to bid is that, in order for A to obtain prompt 
service, suppliers will be required to maintain a supply of spare parts 
and a service facility in Y. A includes this condition solely for 
commercial reasons unrelated to the boycott. Because of this condition, 
however, those suppliers on Y's blacklist do not bid, since they would 
be unable to satisfy the parts and services requirements.
    A's action is not a refusal to do business, because the contractual 
condition was included solely for legitimate business reasons and was 
not boycott-based.
    (xii) Company A, a U.S. oil company, purchases drill bits from U.S. 
suppliers for export to boycotting country Y. In its purchase orders, A 
includes a provision requiring the supplier to make delivery to A's 
facilities in Y and providing that title to the goods does not pass 
until delivery has been made. As is customary under such an arrangement, 
the supplier bears all risks of loss, including loss from fire, theft, 
perils of the sea, and inability to clear customs, until title passes.
    Insistence on such an arrangement does not constitute a refusal to 
do business, because this requirement is imposed on all suppliers 
whether they are blacklisted or not. (But see Sec. 760.4 of this part on 
``Evasion'').
    (xiii) A, a U.S. engineering and construction company, contracts 
with a government agency in boycotting country Y to perform a variety of 
services in connection with the construction of a large industrial 
facility in Y. Pursuant to this contract, A analyzes the market of 
prospective suppliers, compiles a suggested bidders list, analyzes the 
bids received, and makes recommendations to the client. The client 
independently selects and awards the contract to supplier C for boycott 
reasons. All of A's services are performed without regard to Y's 
blacklist or any other boycott considerations, and are the type of 
services A provides clients in both boycotting and non-boycotting 
countries.
    A's actions do not constitute a refusal to do business, because, in 
the provision of pre-award services, A has not excluded the other 
bidders and because A customarily provides such services to its clients.
    (xiv) Same as (xiii), except that in compiling a list of prospective 
suppliers, A deletes suppliers he knows his client will refuse to select 
because they are blacklisted. A knows that including the names of 
blacklisted suppliers will neither enhance their chances of being 
selected nor provide his client with a useful service, the function for 
which he has been retained.
    A's actions, which amount to furnishing a so-called ``whitelist'', 
constitute refusals to do business, because A's pre-award services have 
not been furnished without regard to boycott considerations.
    (xv) A, a U.S. construction firm, provides its boycotting country 
client with a permissible list of prospective suppliers, B, C, D, and E. 
The client independently selects and awards the contract to C, for 
boycott reasons, and then requests A to advise C of his selection, 
negotiate the contract with C, arrange for the shipment, and inspect the 
goods upon arrival. A knows that C was chosen by the client for boycott 
reasons.
    A's action in complying with his client's direction is a refusal to 
do business, because A's post-award actions carry out his client's 
boycott-based decision. (Note: Whether A's action comes within the 
unilateral selection exception depends upon factors discussed in 
Sec. 760.3(d) of this part).
    (xvi) Same as (xv), except that A is building the project on a 
turnkey basis and will retain title until completion. The client 
instructs A to contract only with C.
    A's action in contracting with C constitutes a refusal to do 
business, because it is action that excludes blacklisted persons from 
the transaction for boycott reasons. (Note: Whether A's action comes 
within the

[[Page 361]]

unilateral selection exception depends upon factors discussed in 
Sec. 760.3(d) of this part).
    (xvii) A, a U.S. exporter of machine tools, receives an order for 
drill presses from boycotting country Y. The cover letter from Y's 
procurement official states that A was selected over other U.S. 
manufacturers in part because A is not on Y's blacklist.
    A's action in filling this order is not a refusal to do business, 
because A has not excluded anyone from the transaction.
    (xviii) A, a U.S. engineering firm under contract to construct a dam 
in boycotting country Y, compiles, on a non-boycott basis, a list of 
potential heavy equipment suppliers, including information on their 
qualifications and prior experience. A then solicits bids from the top 
three firms on its list-B, C, and D-because they are the best qualified.
    None of them happens to be blacklisted. A does not solicit bids from 
E, F, or G, the next three firms on the list, one of whom is on Y's 
blacklist.
    A's decision to solicit bids from only B, C, and D, is not a refusal 
to do business with any person, because the solicited bidders were not 
selected for boycott reasons.
    (xix) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is not 
blacklisted. B meets all other conditions of the letter of credit but 
refuses to certify as to his blacklist status. A refuses to pay B on the 
letter of credit solely because B refuses to certify as to his blacklist 
status.
    A has refused to do business with another person pursuant to a 
boycott requirement or request.
    (xx) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to provide a 
certification from the steamship line that the vessel carrying the goods 
is not blacklisted. B seeks payment from A and meets all other 
conditions of the letter of credit but refuses or is unable to provide 
the certification from the steamship line about the vessel's blacklist 
status. A refuses to pay B on the letter of credit solely because B 
cannot or will not provide the certification.
    A has required another person to refuse to do business pursuant to a 
boycott requirement or request by insisting that B obtain such a 
certificate. (Either A or B may request an amendment to the letter of 
credit substituting a certificate of vessel eligibility, however. See 
Example (xxi) below).
    (xxi) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit from a bank in 
boycotting country Y in favor of U.S. beneficiary B. The letter of 
credit requires B to provide a certification from the steamship line 
that the vessel carrying the goods is eligible to enter the ports in Y. 
B seeks payment from A and meets all other conditions of the letter of 
credit. A refuses to pay B solely because B cannot or will not provide 
the certification.
    A has neither refused, nor required another person to refuse, to do 
business with another person pursuant to a boycott requirement or 
request because the vessel eligibility certificate is a common 
requirement for non-boycott purposes.
    (xxii) U.S. bank A confirms a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit contains a requirement that B 
certify that he is not blacklisted. B presents the letter of credit to 
U.S. bank C, a correspondent of bank A. B does not present the 
certificate of blacklist status to bank C, but, in accordance with these 
rules, bank C pays B, and then presents the letter of credit and 
documentation to bank A for reimbursement. Bank A refuses to reimburse 
bank C because the blacklist certification of B is not included in the 
documentation.
    A has required another person to refuse to do business with a person 
pursuant to a boycott requirement or request by insisting that C obtain 
the certificate from B.
    (xxiii) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is not 
blacklisted. B fails to provide such a certification when he presents 
the documents to A for payment. A notifies B that the certification has 
not been submitted.
    A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant to a 
boycott requirement by notifying B of the omitted certificate. A may not 
refuse to pay on the letter of credit, however, if B states that B will 
not provide such a certificate.
    (xxiv) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B from the issuing bank for the purpose of confirmation, 
negotiation or payment. The letter of credit requires B to certify that 
he is not blacklisted. A notifies B that it is contrary to the policy of 
A to handle letters of credit containing this condition and that, unless 
an amendment is obtained deleting this condition, A will not implement 
the letter of credit.
    A has not refused to do business with another person pursuant to a 
boycott requirement, because A has indicated its policy against 
implementing the letter of credit containing the term without regard to 
B's ability or willingness to furnish such a certificate.

                   Agreements To Refuse To Do Business

    (i) A, a U.S. construction firm, is retained by an agency of 
boycotting country Y to build a primary school. The proposed contract 
contains a clause stating that A ``may not use goods or services in the 
project that are produced or provided by any person restricted from 
having a business relationship with country Y by reason of Y's boycott 
against country X''.
    A's action in entering into such a contract would constitute an 
agreement to refuse to

[[Page 362]]

do business, because it is an agreement to exclude blacklisted persons 
from the transaction. A may, however, renegotiate this clause so that it 
does not contain terms prohibited by this part.
    (ii) A, a U.S. manufacturer of commercial refrigerators and 
freezers, receives an invitation to bid from boycotting country Y. The 
tender states that the bidder must agree not to deal with companies on 
Y's blacklist. A does not know which companies are on the blacklist, and 
A's bid makes no commitment regarding not dealing with certain 
companies. A's bid in response to the tender is accepted.
    At the point when A's bid is accepted, A has agreed to refuse to do 
business with blacklisted persons, because the terms of Y's tender are 
part of the contract between Y and A.
    (iii) A, a U.S. construction firm, is offered a contract to perform 
engineering and construction services in connection with a project 
located in boycotting country Y. The contract contains a clause stating 
that, in the event of a contract dispute, the laws of Y will apply.
    A may enter into the contract. Agreement that the laws of boycotting 
country Y will control in resolving a contract dispute is not an 
agreement to refuse to do business.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that the contract contains a clause that 
A and its employees will comply with the laws of boycotting country Y. A 
knows that Y has a number of boycott laws.
    Such an agreement is not, in and of itself, an agreement to refuse 
to do business. If, however, A subsequently refuses to do business with 
someone because of the laws of Y, A's action would be a refusal to do 
business.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that the contract contains a clause that A 
and its employees will comply with the laws of boycotting country Y, 
``including boycott laws''.
    A's agreeing, without qualification, to comply with local boycott 
laws constitutes an agreement to refuse to do business.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that A inserts a proviso ``except insofar 
as Y's laws conflict with U.S. laws'', or words to that effect.
    Such an agreement is not an agreement to refuse to do business.
    (vii) A, a U.S. general contractor, is retained to construct a 
pipeline in boycotting country Y. A provision in the proposed contract 
stipulates that in purchasing equipment, supplies, and services A must 
give preference to companies located in host country Y.
    A may agree to this contract provision. Agreeing to a ``buy local'' 
contract provision is not an agreement to refuse to do business, because 
A's agreement is not made for boycott reasons.
    (viii) A, a U.S. exporter planning to sell retail goods to customers 
in boycotting country Y, enters into a contract to purchase goods 
wholesale from B, a U.S. appliance manufacturer. A's contract with B 
includes a provision stipulating that B may not use components or 
services of blacklisted companies in the manufacture of its appliances.
    A's contract constitutes a refusal to do business, because it would 
require another person, B, to refuse to do business with other persons 
for boycott reasons. B may not agree to such a contract, because it 
would be agreeing to refuse to do business with other persons for 
boycott reasons.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that A and B reach an implicit 
understanding that B will not use components or services of blacklisted 
companies in the manufacture of goods to be exported to Y. In the 
manufacture of appliances to be sold to A for export to non-boycotting 
countries, B uses components manufactured by blacklisted companies.
    The actions of both A and B constitute agreement to refuse to do 
business. The agreement is implied by their pattern of conduct.
    (x) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y opens a 
letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The letter of credit 
specifies that negotiation of the letter of credit with a bank that 
appears on the country X boycott blacklist is prohibited. U.S. bank A, 
C's correspondent bank, advises B of the letter of credit. B presents 
documentation to bank A seeking to be paid on the letter of credit, 
without amending or otherwise taking exception to the boycott condition.
    B has agreed to refuse to do business with blacklisted banks 
because, by presenting the letter of credit for payment, B has accepted 
all of its terms and conditions.

    (b) Discriminatory actions.

            Prohibition Against Taking Discriminatory Actions

    (1) No United States person may:
    (i) Refuse to employ or otherwise discriminate against any 
individual who is a United States person on the basis of race, religion, 
sex, or national origin;
    (ii) Discriminate against any corporation or other organization 
which is a United States person on the basis of the race, religion, sex, 
or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such 
corporation or organization;
    (iii) Knowingly agree to take any of the actions described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; or

[[Page 363]]

    (iv) Require or knowingly agree to require any other person to take 
any of the actions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the discriminatory action 
is taken by a United States person on its own or in response to an 
agreement with, request from, or requirement of a boycotting country. 
This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to a United 
States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the 
United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent 
to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.
    (3) The section does not supersede or limit the operation of the 
civil rights laws of the United States.

                   Examples of Discriminatory Actions

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which the taking of particular discriminatory 
actions is prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. construction company A is awarded a contract to build an 
office complex in boycotting country Y. A, believing that employees of a 
particular religion will not be permitted to work in Y because of Y's 
boycott against country X, excludes U.S. persons of that religion from 
consideration for employment on the project.
    A's refusal to consider qualified U.S. persons of a particular 
religion for work on the project in Y constitutes a prohibited boycott-
based discriminatory action against U.S. persons on the basis of 
religion.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract provides that 
``no persons of country X origin are to work on this project.''
    A's agreement constitutes a prohibited boycott-based agreement to 
discriminate against U.S. persons, among others, on the basis of 
national origin.
    (iii) Same as (i), except that a clause in the contract provides 
that ``no persons who are citizens, residents, or nationals of country X 
are to work on this project.''
    A's agreement does not constitute a boycott-based agreement to 
discriminate against U.S. persons on the basis of race, religion, sex, 
or national origin, because the clause requires exclusion on the basis 
of citizenship, residency, and nationality only.
    (iv) U.S. construction company A enters into a contract to build a 
school in boycotting country Y. Y's representative orally tells A that 
no persons of country X origin are to work on the project.
    A may not comply, because to do so would constitute discrimination 
on the basis of national origin.
    It makes no difference that A learned of Y's requirement orally. It 
makes no difference how A learns about Y's discriminatory requirement.
    (v) Boycotting country Y tenders an invitation to bid on a 
construction project in Y. The tender requires that the successful 
bidder's personnel will be interviewed and that persons of a particular 
religious faith will not be permitted to work on the project. Y's 
requirement is based on its boycott of country X, the majority of whose 
citizens are of that particular faith.
    Agreement to this provision in the tender document by a U.S. person 
would constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-based 
discrimination against U.S. persons of a particular religion.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that the tender specifies that ``women will 
not be allowed to work on this project.''
    Agreement to this provision in the tender by a U.S. person does not 
constitute a prohibited agreement to engage in boycott-based 
discrimination, because the restriction against employment of women is 
not boycott-based. Such an agreement may, however, constitute a 
violation of U.S. civil rights laws.
    (vii) A is a U.S. investment banking firm. As a condition of 
participating in an underwriting of securities to be issued by 
boycotting country Y, A is required to exclude investment banks owned by 
persons of a particular faith from participation in the underwriting. 
Y's requirement is based on its boycott of country X, the majority of 
whose citizens are of that particular faith.
    A's agreement to such a provision constitutes a prohibited agreement 
to engage in boycott-based discrimination against U.S. persons on the 
basis of religion. Further, if A requires others to agree to such a 
condition, A would be acting to require another person to engage in such 
discrimination.
    (viii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to certify 
that A will not use a six-pointed star on the packaging of its products 
to be imported into Y. The requirement is part of the enforcement effort 
by Y of its boycott against country X.
    A may not so certify. The six-pointed star is a religious symbol, 
and the certification by A that it will not use such a symbol 
constitutes a statement that A will not ship products made or handled by 
persons of that religion.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that A is asked to certify that no 
symbol of boycotted country X will appear on the packaging of its 
products imported into Y.
    Such a certification conveys no statement about any person's 
religion and, thus, does not come within this prohibition.


[[Page 364]]


    (c) Furnishing information about race, religion, sex, or national 
origin.

Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Race, Religion, Sex, or 
                             National Origin

    (1) No United States person may:
    (i) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national 
origin of any United States person;
    (ii) Furnish information about the race, religion, sex, or national 
origin of any owner, officer, director, or employee of any corporation 
or other organization which is a United States person;
    (iii) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, 
religion, sex, or national origin of any United States person; or
    (iv) Knowingly agree to furnish information about the race, 
religion, sex, or national origin of any owner, officer, director, or 
employee of any corporation or other organization which is a United 
States person.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply whether the information is 
specifically requested or is offered voluntarily by the United States 
person. It shall also apply whether the information requested or 
volunteered is stated in the affirmative or the negative.
    (3) Information about the place of birth of or the nationality of 
the parents of a United States person comes within this prohibition, as 
does information in the form of code words or symbols which could 
identify a United States person's race, religion, sex, or national 
origin.
    (4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are 
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott.

     Examples of the Prohibition Against Furnishing Discriminatory 
                               Information

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which the furnishing of discriminatory information 
is prohibited. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. company A receives a boycott questionnaire from boycotting 
country Y asking whether it is owned or controlled by persons of a 
particular faith, whether it has any persons on its board of directors 
who are of that faith, and what the national origin of its president is. 
The information is sought for purposes of enforcing Y's boycott against 
country X, and A knows or has reason to know that the information is 
sought for that reason.
    A may not answer the questionnaire, because A would be furnishing 
information about the religion and national origin of U.S. persons for 
purposes of complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (ii) U.S. company A, located in the United States, is asked by 
boycotting country Y to certify that A has no persons of a particular 
national origin on its board of directors. A knows that Y's purpose in 
asking for the certification is to enforce its boycott against country 
X.
    A may not make such a certification, because A would be furnishing 
information about the national origin of U.S. persons for purposes of 
complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (iii) U.S. company A believes that boycotting country Y will select 
A's bid over those of other bidders if A volunteers that it has no 
shareholders, officers, or directors of a particular national origin. 
A's belief is based on its knowledge that Y generally refuses, as part 
of its boycott against country X, to do business with companies owned, 
controlled, or managed by persons of this particular national origin.
    A may not volunteer this information, because it would be furnishing 
information about the national origin of U.S. persons for purposes of 
complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (iv) U.S. company A has a contract to construct an airport in 
boycotting country Y. Before A begins work, A is asked by Y to identify 
the national origin of its employees who will work on the site. A knows 
or has reason to know that Y is seeking this information in order to 
enforce its boycott against X.
    A may not furnish this information, because A would be providing 
information about the national origin of U.S. persons for purposes of 
complying with or supporting Y's boycott against X.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that in order to assemble its work force on 
site in Y, A sends visa forms to its employees and asks that the forms 
be returned to A for transmittal to Y's consulate or embassy. A, itself, 
furnishes no information about its employees, but merely transmits the 
visa forms back and forth.
    In performing the ministerial function of transmitting visa forms, A 
is not furnishing information about any U.S. person's race, religion, 
sex, or national origin.
    (vi) Same as (iv), except that A is asked by Y to certify that none 
of its employees in Y

[[Page 365]]

will be women, because Y's laws prohibit women from working.
    Such a certification does not constitute a prohibited furnishing of 
information about any U.S. person's sex, since the reason the 
information is sought has nothing to do with Y's boycott of X.
    (vii) U.S. company A is considering establishing an office in 
boycotting country Y. In order to register to do business in Y, A is 
asked to furnish information concerning the nationalities of its 
corporate officers and board of directors.
    A may furnish the information about the nationalities of its 
officers and directors, because in so doing A would not be furnishing 
information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any 
U.S. person.

    (d) Furnishing information about business relationships with 
boycotted countries or blacklisted persons.

Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Business Relationships 
             With Boycotted Countries or Blacklisted Persons

    (1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to 
furnish information concerning his or any other person's past, present 
or proposed business relationships:
    (i) With or in a boycotted country;
    (ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of a 
boycotted country;
    (iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or
    (iv) With any other person who is known or believed to be restricted 
from having any business relationship with or in a boycotting country.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply:
    (i) Whether the information pertains to a business relationship 
involving a sale, purchase, or supply transaction; legal or commercial 
representation; shipping or other transportation transaction; insurance; 
investment; or any other type of business transaction or relationship; 
and
    (ii) Whether the information is directly or indirectly requested or 
is furnished on the initiative of the United States person.
    (3) This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal 
business information in a commercial context. Normal business 
information may relate to factors such as financial fitness, technical 
competence, or professional experience, and may be found in documents 
normally available to the public such as annual reports, disclosure 
statements concerning securities, catalogs, promotional brochures, and 
trade and business handbooks. Such information may also appear in 
specifications or statements of experience and qualifications.
    (4) Normal business information furnished in a commercial context 
does not cease to be such simply because the party soliciting the 
information may be a boycotting country or a national or resident 
thereof. If the information is of a type which is generally sought for a 
legitimate business purpose (such as determining financial fitness, 
technical competence, or professional experience), the information may 
be furnished even if the information could be used, or without the 
knowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to be 
used, for boycott purposes. However, no information about business 
relationships with blacklisted persons or boycotted countries, their 
residents or nationals, may be furnished in response to a boycott 
request, even if the information is publicly available. Requests for 
such information from a boycott office will be presumed to be boycott-
based.
    (5) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United States person's activities in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are 
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott.

              Examples Concerning Furnishing of Information

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which the furnishing of information is prohibited. 
They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. contractor A is considering bidding for a contract to build 
a dam in boycotting country Y. The invitation to bid, which appears in a 
trade journal, specifies that each bidder must state that he does not 
have any offices in boycotted country X. A knows or has reason to know 
that the requirement is boycott-based.
    A may not make this statement, because it constitutes information 
about A's business relationships with X.
    (ii) U.S. contractor A is considering bidding for a contract to 
construct a school in

[[Page 366]]

boycotting country Y. Each bidder is required to submit copies of its 
annual report with its bid. Since A's annual report describes A's 
worldwide operations, including the countries in which it does business, 
it necessarily discloses whether A has business relations with boycotted 
country X. A has no reason to know that its report is being sought for 
boycott purposes.
    A, in furnishing its annual report, is supplying ordinary business 
information in a commercial context.
    (iii) Same as (ii), except that accompanying the invitation to bid 
is a questionnaire from country Y's boycott office asking each bidder to 
supply a copy of its annual report.
    A may not furnish the annual report despite its public availability, 
because it would be furnishing information in response to a 
questionnaire from a boycott office.
    (iv) U.S. company A is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. For 
reasons unrelated to the boycott, A terminates its business 
relationships with boycotted country X. In exploring other marketing 
areas, A determines that boycotting country Y offers great potential. A 
is requested to complete a questionnaire from a central boycott office 
which inquires about A's business relations with X.
    A may not furnish the information, because it is information about 
A's business relationships with a boycotted country.
    (v) U.S. exporter A is seeking to sell its products to boycotting 
country Y. A is informed by Y that, as a condition of sale, A must 
certify that it has no salesmen in boycotted country X. A knows or has 
reason to know that the condition is boycott-based.
    A may not furnish the certification, because it is information about 
A's business relationships in a boycotted country.
    (vi) U.S. engineering company A receives an invitation to bid on the 
construction of a dam in boycotting country Y. As a condition of the 
bid, A is asked to certify that it does not have any offices in 
boycotted country X. A is also asked to furnish plans for other dams it 
has designed.
    A may not certify that it has no office in X, because this is 
information about its business relationships in a boycotted country. A 
may submit plans for other dams it has designed, because this is 
furnishing normal business information, in a commercial context, 
relating to A's technical competence and professional experience.
    (vii) U.S. company A, in seeking to expand its exports to boycotting 
country Y, sends a sales representative to Y for a one week trip. During 
a meeting in Y with trade association representatives, A's 
representative desires to explain that neither A nor any companies with 
which A deals has any business relationship with boycotted country X. 
The purpose of supplying such information is to ensure that A does not 
get blacklisted.
    A's representative may not volunteer this information even though A, 
for reasons unrelated to the boycott, does not deal with X, because A's 
representative would be volunteering information about A's business 
relationships with X for boycott reasons.
    (viii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to furnish 
information concerning its business relationships with boycotted country 
X. A, knowing that Y is seeking the information for boycott purposes, 
refuses to furnish the information asked for directly, but proposes to 
respond by supplying a copy of its annual report which lists the 
countries with which A is presently doing business. A does not happen to 
be doing business with X.
    A may not respond to Y's request by supplying its annual report, 
because A knows that it would be responding to a boycott-based request 
for information about its business relationships with X.
    (ix) U.S. company A receives a letter from a central boycott office 
asking A to ``clarify'' A's operations in boycotted country X. A intends 
to continue its operations in X, but fears that not responding to the 
request will result in its being placed on boycotting country Y's 
blacklist. A knows or has reason to know that the information is sought 
for boycott reasons.
    A may not respond to this request, because the information concerns 
its business relationships with a boycotted country.
    (x) U.S. company A, in the course of negotiating a sale of its goods 
to a buyer in boycotting country Y, is asked to certify that its 
supplier is not on Y's blacklist.
    A may not furnish the information about its supplier's blacklist 
status, because this is information about A's business relationships 
with another person who is believed to be restricted from having any 
business relationship with or in a boycotting country.
    (xi) U.S. company A has a manufacturing plant in boycotted country X 
and is on boycotting country Y's blacklist. A is seeking to establish 
operations in Y, while expanding its operations in X. A applies to Y to 
be removed from Y's blacklist. A is asked, in response, to indicate 
whether it has manufacturing facilities in X.
    A may not supply the requested information, because A would be 
furnishing information about its business relationships in a boycotted 
country.
    (xii) U.S. bank A plans to open a branch office in boycotting 
country Y. In order to do so, A is required to furnish certain 
information about its business operations, including the location of its 
other branch offices. Such information is normally sought in other 
countries where A has opened a branch office, and A does not have reason 
to know that Y is seeking the information for boycott reasons.

[[Page 367]]

    A may furnish this information, even though in furnishing it A would 
disclose information about its business relationships in a boycotted 
country, because it is being furnished in a normal business context and 
A does not have reason to know that it is sought for boycott reasons.
    (xiii) U.S. architectural firm A responds to an invitation to submit 
designs for an office complex in boycotting country Y. The invitation 
states that all bidders must include information concerning similar 
types of buildings they have designed. A has not designed such buildings 
in boycotted country X. Clients frequently seek information of this type 
before engaging an architect.
    A may furnish this information, because this is furnishing normal 
business information, in a commercial context, relating to A's technical 
competence and professional experience.
    (xiv) U.S. oil company A distributes to potential customers 
promotional brochures and catalogs which give background information on 
A's past projects. A does not have business dealings with boycotted 
country X. The brochures, which are identical to those which A uses 
throughout the world, list those countries in which A does or has done 
business. In soliciting potential customers in boycotting country Y, A 
desires to distribute copies of its brochures.
    A may do so, because this is furnishing normal business information, 
in a commercial context, relating to professional experience.
    (xv) U.S. company A is interested in doing business with boycotting 
country Y. A wants to ask Y's Ministry of Trade whether, and if so why, 
A is on Y's blacklist or is otherwise restricted for boycott reasons 
from doing business with Y.
    A may make this limited inquiry, because it does not constitute 
furnishing information.
    (xvi) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to certify 
that it is not owned by subjects or nationals of boycotted country X and 
that it is not resident in boycotted country X.
    A may not furnish the certification, because it is information about 
A's business relationships with or in a boycotted country, or with 
nationals of a boycotted country.
    (xvii) U.S. company A, a manufacturer of certain patented products, 
desires to register its patents in boycotting country Y. A receives a 
power of attorney form required to register its patents. The form 
contains a question regarding A's business relationships with or in 
boycotted country X. A has no business relationships with X and knows or 
has reason to know that the information is sought for boycott reasons.
    A may not answer the question, because A would be furnishing 
information about its business relationships with or in a boycotted 
country.
    (xviii) U.S. company A is asked by boycotting country Y to certify 
that it is not the mother company, sister company, subsidiary, or branch 
of any blacklisted company, and that it is not in any way affiliated 
with any blacklisted company.
    A may not furnish the certification, because it is information about 
whether A has a business relationship with another person who is known 
or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with 
or in a boycotting country. This interpretation became effective on June 
22, 1978.

    (e) Information concerning association with charitable and fraternal 
organizations.

   Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About Associations With 
                 Charitable and Fraternal Organizations

    (1) No United States person may furnish or knowingly agree to 
furnish information about whether any person is a member of, has made 
contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the 
activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports a 
boycotted country.
    (2) This prohibition shall apply whether:
    (i) The information concerns association with or involvement in any 
charitable or fraternal organization which (a) has, as one of its stated 
purposes, the support of a boycotted country through financial 
contributions or other means, or (b) undertakes, as a major 
organizational activity, to offer financial or other support to a 
boycotted country;
    (ii) The information is directly or indirectly requested or is 
furnished on the initiative of the United States person; or
    (iii) The information requested or volunteered concerns membership 
in, financial contributions to, or any other type of association with or 
involvement in the activities of such charitable or fraternal 
organization.
    (3) This prohibition does not prohibit the furnishing of normal 
business information in a commercial context as defined in paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (4) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United

[[Page 368]]

States person's activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the 
United States and only when such activities are undertaken with intent 
to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott.

      Examples of Prohibition Against Furnishing Information About 
         Associations With Charitable or Fraternal Organizations

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which the furnishing of information concerning 
associations with charitable or fraternal organizations is prohibited. 
They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) U.S. engineering firm A receives an invitation to bid from 
boycotting country Y. The invitation includes a request to supply 
information concerning any association which A's officers have with 
charitable organization B, an organization which is known by A to 
contribute financial support to boycotted country X. A knows or has 
reason to know that the information is sought for boycott reasons.
    A may not furnish the information.
    (ii) U.S. construction company A, in an effort to establish business 
dealings with boycotting country Y, proposes to furnish information to Y 
showing that no members of its board of directors are in any way 
associated with charitable organizations which support boycotted country 
X. A's purpose is to avoid any possibility of its being blacklisted by 
Y.
    A may not furnish the information, because A's purpose in doing so 
is boycott-based. It makes no difference that no specific request for 
the information has been made by Y.
    (iii) A, a citizen of the United States, is applying for a teaching 
position in a school in boycotting country Y. In connection with his 
application, A furnishes a resume which happens to disclose his 
affiliation with charitable organizations. A does so completely without 
reference to Y's boycott and without knowledge of any boycott 
requirement of Y that pertains to A's application for employment.
    The furnishing of a resume by A is not a boycott-related furnishing 
of information about his association with charitable organizations which 
support boycotted country X.

    (f) Letters of credit.

Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit Containing Prohibited 
                       Conditions or Requirements

    (1) No United States person may pay, honor, confirm, or otherwise 
implement a letter of credit which contains a condition or requirement 
compliance with which is prohibited by this part, nor shall any United 
States person, as a result of the application of this section, be 
obligated to pay, honor or otherwise implement such a letter of credit.
    (2) For purposes of this section, ``implementing'' a letter of 
credit includes:
    (i) Issuing or opening a letter of credit at the request of a 
customer;
    (ii) Honoring, by accepting as being a valid instrument of credit, 
any letter of credit;
    (iii) Paying, under a letter of credit, a draft or other demand for 
payment by the beneficiary;
    (iv) Confirming a letter of credit by agreeing to be responsible for 
payment to the beneficiary in response to a request by the issuer;
    (v) Negotiating a letter of credit by voluntarily purchasing a draft 
from a beneficiary and presenting such draft for reimbursement to the 
issuer or the confirmer of the letter of credit; and
    (vi) Taking any other action to implement a letter of credit.
    (3) In the standard international letter of credit transaction 
facilitating payment for the export of goods from the United States, a 
bank in a foreign country may be requested by its customer to issue a 
revocable or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the United States 
exporter. The customer usually requires, and the letter of credit 
provides, that the issuing (or a confirming) bank will make payment to 
the beneficiary against the bank's receipt of the documentation 
specified in the letter of credit. Such documentation usually includes 
commercial and consular invoices, a bill of lading, and evidence of 
insurance, but it may also include other required certifications or 
documentary assurances such as the origin of the goods and information 
relating to the carrier or insurer of the shipment.
    Banks usually will not accept drafts for payment unless the 
documents submitted therewith comply with the terms and conditions of 
the letter of credit.
    (4) A United States person is not prohibited under this section from 
advising a beneficiary of the existence of a letter of credit in his 
favor, or from taking ministerial actions to dispose of

[[Page 369]]

a letter of credit which it is prohibited from implementing.
    (5) Compliance with this section shall provide an absolute defense 
in any action brought to compel payment of, honoring of, or other 
implementation of a letter of credit, or for damages resulting from 
failure to pay or otherwise honor or implement the letter of credit. 
This section shall not otherwise relieve any person from any obligations 
or other liabilities he may incur under other laws or regulations, 
except as may be explicitly provided in this section.

             Letters of Credit to Which This Section Applies

    (6) This prohibition, like all others, applies only with respect to 
a United States person's activities taken with intent to comply with, 
further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. In addition, it 
applies only when the transaction to which the letter of credit applies 
is in United States commerce and the beneficiary is a United States 
person.

        Implementation of Letters of Credit in the United States

    (7) A letter of credit implemented in the United States by a United 
States person located in the United States, including a permanent United 
States establishment of a foreign bank, will be presumed to apply to a 
transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor of a United 
States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a United States 
address for the beneficiary. These presumptions may be rebutted by facts 
which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the beneficiary is 
not a United States person or that the underlying transaction is not in 
United States commerce.
    (8) Where a letter of credit implemented in the United States by a 
United States person located in the United States does not specify a 
United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be 
presumed to be other than a United States person. This presumption may 
be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude 
that the beneficiary is a United States person despite the foreign 
address.

      Implementation of Letters of Credit Outside the United States

    (9) A letter of credit implemented outside the United States by a 
United States person located outside the United States will be presumed 
to apply to a transaction in United States commerce and to be in favor 
of a United States beneficiary where the letter of credit specifies a 
United States address for the beneficiary and calls for documents 
indicating shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that 
the goods are of United States origin. These presumptions may be 
rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that 
the beneficiary is not a United States person or that the underlying 
transaction is not in United States commerce.
    (10) Where a letter of credit implemented outside the United States 
by a United States person located outside the United States does not 
specify a United States address for the beneficiary, the beneficiary 
will be presumed to be other than a United States person. In addition, 
where such a letter of credit does not call for documents indicating 
shipment from the United States or otherwise indicating that the goods 
are of United States origin, the transaction to which it applies will be 
presumed to be outside United States commerce. The presumption that the 
beneficiary is other than a United States person may be rebutted by 
facts which could reasonably lead the bank to conclude that the 
beneficiary is a United States person. The presumption that the 
transaction to which the letter of credit applies is outside United 
States commerce may be rebutted by facts which could reasonably lead the 
bank to conclude that the underlying transaction is in United States 
commerce.

   Examples of the Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which this section applies to the implementation of 
a letter of credit and in which such implementation is prohibited. They 
are illustrative, not comprehensive.

[[Page 370]]

      Implementation of Letters of Credit in United States Commerce

    (i) A, a U.S. bank located in the United States, opens a letter of 
credit in the United States in favor of B, a foreign company located 
outside the United States. The letter of credit specifies a non-U.S. 
address for the beneficiary.
    The beneficiary is presumed to be other than a U.S. person, because 
it does not have a U.S. address. The presumption may be rebutted by 
facts showing that A could reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is a 
U.S. person despite the foreign address.
    (ii) A, a branch of a foreign bank located in the United States, 
opens a letter of credit in favor of B, a foreign company located 
outside the United States. The letter of credit specifies a non-U.S. 
address for the beneficiary.
    The beneficiary is presumed to be other than a U.S.person, because 
it does not have a U.S. address. The presumption may be rebutted by 
facts showing that A could reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is a 
U.S. person despite the foreign address.
    (iii) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States, opens 
a letter of credit in favor of B, a person with a U.S. address. The 
letter of credit calls for documents indicating shipment of goods from 
the United States.
    The letter of credit is presumed to apply to a transaction in U.S. 
commerce and to be in favor of a U.S. beneficiary because the letter of 
credit specifies a U.S. address for the beneficiary and calls for 
documents indicating that the goods will be shipped from the United 
States. These presumptions may be rebutted by facts showing that A could 
reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is not a U.S. person or that 
the underlying transaction is not in U.S. commerce.
    (iv) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States, opens 
a letter of credit which specifies a beneficiary, B, with an address 
outside the United States and calls for documents indicating that the 
goods are of U.S.-origin. A knows or has reason to know that although B 
has an address outside the United States, B is a U.S. person.
    The letter of credit is presumed to apply to a transaction in U.S. 
commerce, because the letter of credit calls for shipment of U.S.-origin 
goods. In addition, the letter of credit is presumed to be in favor of a 
beneficiary who is a U.S. person, because A knows or has reason to know 
that the beneficiary is a U.S. person despite the foreign address.
    (v) A, a U.S. bank branch located outside the United States, opens a 
letter of credit which specifies a beneficiary with a U.S. address. The 
letter of credit calls for documents indicating shipment of foreign-
origin goods.
    The letter of credit is presumed to be in favor of a U.S. 
beneficiary but to apply to a transaction outside U.S. commerce, because 
it calls for documents indicating shipment of foreign-origin goods. The 
presumption of non-U.S. commerce may be rebutted by facts showing that A 
could reasonably conclude that the underlying transaction involves 
shipment of U.S.-origin goods or goods from the U.S.

           Prohibition Against Implementing Letters of Credit

    (i) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y opens a 
letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The letter of credit 
specifies as a condition of payment that B certify that it does not do 
business with boycotted country X. Foreign bank C forwards the letter of 
credit it has opened to U.S. bank A for confirmation.
    A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit, 
because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may not comply.
    (ii) Same as (i), except U.S. bank A desires to advise the 
beneficiary, U.S. company B, of the letter of credit.
    A may do so, because advising the beneficiary of the letter of 
credit (including the term which prevents A from implementing it) is not 
implementation of the letter of credit.
    (iii) Same as (i), except foreign bank C sends a telegram to U.S. 
bank A stating the major terms and conditions of the letter of credit. 
The telegram does not reflect the boycott provision. Subsequently, C 
mails to A documents setting forth the terms and conditions of the 
letter of credit, including the prohibited boycott condition.
    A may not further implement the letter of credit after it receives 
the documents, because they reflect the prohibited boycott condition in 
the letter of credit. A may advise the beneficiary and C of the 
existence of the letter of credit (including the boycott term), and may 
perform any essentially ministerial acts necessary to dispose of the 
letter of credit.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that U.S. company B, based in part on 
information received from U.S. bank A, desires to obtain an amendment to 
the letter of credit which would eliminate or nullify the language in 
the letter of credit which prevents A from paying or otherwise 
implementing it.
    Either company B or bank A may undertake, and the other may 
cooperate and assist in, this endeavor. A could then pay or otherwise 
implement the revised letter of credit, so long as the original 
prohibited language is of no force or effect.
    (v) Boycotting country Y requests a foreign bank in Y to open a 
letter of credit to effect payment for goods to be shipped by U.S. 
supplier B, the beneficiary of the letter of credit. The letter of 
credit contains prohibited boycott clauses. The foreign bank

[[Page 371]]

forwards a copy of the letter of credit to its branch office A, in the 
United States.
    A may advise the beneficiary but may not implement the letter of 
credit, because it contains prohibited boycott conditions.
    (vi) On November 1, 1977, boycotting country Y orders goods from 
U.S. company B. U.S. bank A is asked to implement, for the benefit of B, 
a letter of credit which contains a clause requiring documentation that 
the goods shipped are not of boycotted country X origin.
    A may implement the letter of credit, but after June 21, 1978, may 
accept only a positive certificate of origin as satisfactory 
documentation. (See Sec. 760.3(b) of this part on ``Import and Shipping 
Document Requirements.'')
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that U.S. company B has a contract with Y 
to supply a certain quantity of goods each month over a two-year period. 
B's contract was entered into on May 15, 1977, and thus qualifies for 
grace period treatment until December 31, 1978. Each month, Y causes a 
letter of credit to be opened in favor of B in order to effect payment. 
Such letters of credit call for negative certificates of origin.
    A may accept negative certificates of origin in fulfillment of the 
terms of the letter of credit through December 31, 1978, because the 
underlying contract is entitled to a grace period through that date. 
(See Sec. 760.8 of this part on ``Grace Period.'')
    (viii) B is a foreign bank located outside the United States. B 
maintains an account with U.S. bank A, located in the United States. A 
letter of credit issued by B in favor of a U.S. beneficiary provides 
that any negotiating bank may obtain reimbursement from A by certifying 
that all the terms and conditions of the letter of credit have been met 
and then drawing against B's account. B notifies A by cable of the 
issuance of a letter of credit and the existence of reimbursement 
authorization; A does not receive a copy of the letter of credit.
    A may reimburse any negotiating bank, even when the underlying 
letter of credit contains a prohibited boycott condition, because A does 
not know or have reason to know that the letter of credit contains a 
prohibited boycott condition.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that foreign bank B forwards a copy of 
the letter of credit to U.S. bank A, which then becomes aware of the 
prohibited boycott clause.
    A may not thereafter reimburse a negotiating bank or in any way 
further implement the letter of credit, because it knows of the 
prohibited boycott condition.
    (x) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. exporter B and 
requests a foreign bank in Y to open a letter of credit in favor of B to 
cover the cost. The letter of credit contains a prohibited boycott 
clause. The foreign bank asks U.S. bank A to advise and confirm the 
letter of credit. Through inadvertence, A does not notice the prohibited 
clause and confirms the letter of credit. A thereafter notices the 
clause and then refuses to honor B's draft against the letter of credit. 
B sues bank A for payment.
    A has an absolute defense against the obligation to make payment 
under this letter of credit. (Note that paragraph (ix) of this section 
does not alter any other obligations or liabilities of the parties under 
appropriate law.)
    (xi) [Reserved]
    (xii) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. A 
letter of credit which contains a prohibited boycott clause is opened in 
favor of B by a foreign bank in Y. The foreign bank asks U.S. bank A to 
advise and confirm the letter of credit, which it forwards to A.
    A may advise B that it has received the letter of credit (including 
the boycott term), but may not confirm the letter of credit with the 
prohibited clause.
    (xiii) Same as (xii), except U.S. bank A fails to tell B that it 
cannot process the letter of credit. B requests payment.
    A may not pay. If the prohibited language is eliminated or nullified 
as the result of renegotiation, A may then pay or otherwise implement 
the revised letter of credit.
    (xiv) U.S. bank A receives a letter of credit in favor of U.S. 
beneficiary B. The letter of credit requires B to certify that he is not 
blacklisted.
    A may implement such a letter of credit, but it may not insist that 
the certification be furnished, because by so insisting it would be 
refusing to do business with a blacklisted person in compliance with a 
boycott.
    (xv) A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S. opens a letter of credit in 
favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods to boycotting country 
Y. The letter of credit contains no boycott conditions, but A knows that 
Y customarily requires the seller of goods to certify that it has dealt 
with no blacklisted supplier. A, therefore, instructs B that it will not 
make payment under the letter of credit unless B makes such a 
certification.
    A's action in requiring the certification from B constitutes action 
to require another person to refuse to do business with blacklisted 
persons.
    (xvi) A, a U.S. bank located in the U.S., opens a letter of credit 
in favor of U.S. beneficiary B for B's sale of goods to boycotting 
country Y. The letter of credit contains no boycott conditions, but A 
has actual knowledge that B has agreed to supply a certification to Y 
that it has not dealt with blacklisted firms, as a condition of 
receiving the letter of credit in its favor.
    A may not implement the letter of credit, because it knows that an 
implicit condition of the credit is a condition with which B may not 
legally comply.

[[Page 372]]

    (xvii) Boycotting country Y orders goods from U.S. company B. Y 
opens a letter of credit with foreign bank C in favor of B. The letter 
of credit includes the statement, ``Do not negotiate with blacklisted 
banks.'' C forwards the letter of credit it has opened to U.S. bank A 
for confirmation.
    A may not confirm or otherwise implement this letter of credit, 
because it contains a condition with which a U.S. person may not comply.


<R05>
Sec. 760.3  Exceptions to prohibitions.

    (a) Import requirements of a boycotting country.

       Compliance With Import Requirements of a Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States person, in supplying goods or services to a 
boycotting country, or to a national or resident of a boycotting 
country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of such 
boycotting country which prohibit the import of:
    (i) Goods or services from the boycotted country;
    (ii) Goods produced or services provided by any business concern 
organized under the laws of the boycotted country; or
    (iii) Goods produced or services provided by nationals or residents 
of the boycotted country.
    (2) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with such 
import requirements whether or not he has received a specific request to 
comply. By its terms, this exception applies only to transactions 
involving imports into a boycotting country. A United States person may 
not, under this exception, refuse on an across-the-board basis to do 
business with a boycotted country or a national or resident of a 
boycotted country.
    (3) In taking action within the scope of this exception, a United 
States person is limited in the types of boycott-related information he 
can supply. (See Sec. 760.2(d) of this part on ``Furnishing Information 
About Business Relationships with Boycotted Countries or Blacklisted 
Persons'' and paragraph (c) of this section on ``Import and Shipping 
Document Requirements.'')

 Examples of Compliance With Import Requirements of a Boycotting Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with the import requirements of a 
boycotting country is permissible. They are illustrative, not 
comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, receives an order from boycotting 
country Y for its products, country X is boycotted by country Y, and the 
import laws of Y prohibit the importation of goods produced or 
manufactured in X. In filling this type of order, A would usually 
include some component parts produced in X.
    For the purpose of filling this order, A may substitute comparable 
component parts in place of parts produced in X, because the import laws 
of Y prohibit the importation of goods manufactured in X.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that A's contract with Y expressly provides 
that in fulfilling the contract A ``may not include parts or components 
produced or manufactured in boycotted country X.''
    A may agree to and comply with this contract provision, because Y 
prohibits the importation of goods from X. (NOTE: After June 21, 1978, A 
may not furnish negative certifications regarding the origin of 
components in response to import and shipping document requirements.)
    (iii) A, a U.S. building contractor, is awarded a contract to 
construct a plant in boycotting country Y. A accepts bids on goods 
required under the contract, and the lowest bid is made by B, a business 
concern organized under the laws of X, a country boycotted by Y. Y 
prohibits the import of goods produced by companies organized under the 
laws of X.
    For purposes of this contract, A may reject B's bid and accept 
another, because B's goods would be refused entry in to Y because of Y's 
boycott against X.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A also rejects the low bid by B for 
work on a construction project in country M, a country not boycotted by 
Y.
    This exception does not apply, because A's action is not taken in 
order to comply with Y's requirements prohibiting the import of products 
from boycotted country X.
    (v) A, a U.S. management consulting firm, contracts to provide 
services to boycotting country Y. Y requests that A not employ residents 
or nationals of boycotted country X to provide those services.
    A may agree, as a condition of the contract, not to have services 
furnished by nationals or residents of X, because importation of such 
services is prohibited by Y.
    (vi) A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a contract to supply machine 
tools to boycotting country Y. Y insists that the contract

[[Page 373]]

contain a provision whereby A agrees that none of the machine tools will 
be produced by any business concern owned by nationals of boycotted 
country X, even if the business concern is organized under the laws of a 
non-boycotted country.
    A may not agree to this provision, because it is a restriction on 
the import of goods produced by business concerns owned by nationals of 
a boycotted country even if the business concerns themselves are 
organized under the laws of a non-boycotted country.

    (b) Shipment of goods to a boycotting country.

   Compliance With Requirements Regarding the Shipment of Goods to a 
                           Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting 
country, may comply or agree to comply with requirements of that country 
which prohibit the shipment of goods:
    (i) On a carrier of the boycotted country; or
    (ii) By a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country 
or the recipient of the shipment.
    (2) A specific request that a United States person comply or agree 
to comply with requirements concerning the use of carriers of a 
boycotted country is not necessary if the United States person knows, or 
has reason to know, that the use of such carriers for shipping goods to 
the boycotting country is prohibited by requirements of the boycotting 
country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country or the 
purchaser of the shipment:
    (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through a 
port of the boycotted country; or
    (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not 
include a port in the boycotted country.
    (3) For purposes of this exception, the term carrier of a boycotted 
country means a carrier which flies the flag of a boycotted country or 
which is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by a boycotted country or 
by nationals or residents of a boycotted country.

 Examples of Compliance With the Shipping Requirements of a Boycotting 
                                 Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with import and shipping document 
requirements of a boycotting country is permissible. They are 
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A is a U.S. exporter from whom boycotting country Y is importing 
goods. Y directs that the goods not pass through a port of boycotted 
country X.
    A may comply with Y's shipping instructions, because they pertain to 
the route of shipment of goods being shipped to Y.
    (ii) A, a U.S. fertilizer manufacturer, receives an order from 
boycotting country Y for fertilizer. Y specifies in the order that A may 
not ship the fertilizer on a carrier of boycotted country X.
    A may comply with this request, because it pertains to the carrier 
of a boycotted country.
    (iii) B, a resident of boycotting country Y, orders textile goods 
from A, a U.S. distributor, specifying that the shipment must not be 
made on a carrier owned or leased by nationals of boycotted country X 
and that the carrier must not pass through a port of country X enroute 
to Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with these requests, because they 
pertain to the shipment of goods to Y on a carrier of a boycotted 
country and the route such shipment will take.
    (iv) Boycotting country Y orders goods from A, a U.S. retail 
merchant. The order specifies that the goods shipped by A ``may not be 
shipped on a carrier registered in or owned by boycotted country X.''
    A may agree to this contract provision, because it pertains to the 
carrier of a boycotted country.
    (v) Boycotting country Y orders goods from A, a U.S. pharmaceutical 
company, and requests that the shipment not pass through a port of 
country P, which is not a country boycotted by Y.
    This exception does not apply in a non-boycotting situation. A may 
comply with the shipping instructions of Y, because in doing so he would 
not violate any prohibition of this part.

    (c) Import and shipping document requirements.

     Compliance With Import and Shipping Document Requirements of a 
                           Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States person, in shipping goods to a boycotting 
country, may comply or agree to comply with import and shipping document 
requirements of that country, with respect to:
    (i) The country or origin of the goods;
    (ii) The name of the carrier;
    (iii) The route of the shipment;
    (iv) The name of the supplier of the shipment; and

[[Page 374]]

    (v) The name of the provider of other services.
    (2) After June 21, 1978, all such information must be stated in 
positive, non-blacklisting, non-exclusionary terms except for 
information with respect to the names of carriers or routes of shipment, 
which may continue to be stated in negative terms in conjunction with 
shipments to a boycotting country, in order to comply with precautionary 
requirements protecting against war risks or confiscation. The purpose 
of this delayed effective date, which is provided by section 4A(a)(2)(B) 
of the Export Administration Act of 1969, as amended, is to allow time 
for persons to adjust their practices to the use of import and shipping 
documentation stated in positive rather than negative terms.

  Examples of Compliance With Import and Shipping Document Requirements

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with the import requirements of a 
boycotting country is permissible. They are illustrative, not 
comprehensive.
    (i) Boycotting country Y contracts with A, a U.S. petroleum 
equipment manufacturer, for certain equipment. Y requires that goods 
being imported into Y must be accompanied by a certification that the 
goods being supplied did not originate in boycotted country X.
    Until June 21, 1978, A may comply with such import requirements in 
the terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not supply such a 
certification in negative terms but may identify instead the country of 
origin of the goods in positive terms only.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that Y requires that the shipping 
documentation accompanying the goods specify the country of origin of 
the goods.
    A may furnish the information.
    (iii) On February 1, 1978, A, a U.S. distributor, enters into a two-
year contract with boycotting country Y to make monthly shipments of 
goods to Y. A clause in the contract requires that all shipments into 
the country must be accompanied by a certification that the goods did 
not originate in X, a country boycotted by Y.
    A may supply such a negative certification until June 21, 1978. 
After that date, A may state the origin of the goods on the shipping or 
import documents in positive terms only.
    (iv) A, a U.S. apparel manufacturer, has contracted to sell certain 
of its products to B, a national of boycotting country Y. The form that 
must be submitted to customs officials of Y requires the shipper to 
certify that the goods contained in the shipment have not been supplied 
by ``blacklisted'' persons.
    Until June 21, 1978, A may furnish the information required in the 
terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not furnish the information 
in negative terms but may certify, in positive terms only, the name of 
the supplier of the goods.
    (v) Same as (iv), except the customs form requires certification 
that the insurer and freight forwarder used are not ``blacklisted.''
    Until June 21, 1978, A may furnish the information required in the 
terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not comply with the request 
but may supply a certification stating, in positive terms only, the 
names of the insurer and freight forwarder.
    (vi) A, a U.S. petrochemical manufacturer, executes a sales contract 
with B, a resident of boycotting country Y. A provision of A's contract 
with B requires that the bill of lading and other shipping documents 
contain certifications that the goods have not been shipped on a 
``blacklisted'' carrier.
    Until June 21, 1978, A may furnish the information required in the 
terms requested. After June 21, 1978, A may not agree to supply a 
certification that the carrier is not ``blacklisted'' but may certify 
the name of the carrier in positive terms only.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires certification 
that the goods will not be shipped on a carrier which flies the flag of, 
or is owned, chartered, leased, or operated by boycotted country X, or 
by nationals or residents of X.
    Such a certification, which is a reasonable requirement to protect 
against war risks or confiscation, may be furnished at any time.
    (viii) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires that the 
shipping documents certify the name of the carrier being used.
    A may, at any time, supply or agree to supply the requested 
documentation regarding the name of the carrier, either in negative or 
positive terms.
    (ix) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires a certification 
that the carrier will not call at a port in boycotted country X before 
making delivery in Y.
    Such a certification, which is a reasonable requirement to protect 
against war risks or confiscation, may be furnished at any time.
    (x) Same as (vi), except that the contract requires that the 
shipping documents indicate the name of the insurer and freight 
forwarder.
    A may comply at any time, because the statement is not required to 
be made in negative or blacklisting terms.
    (xi) A, a U.S. exporter, is negotiating a contract to sell bicycles 
to boycotting country Y. Y insists that A agree to certify that the 
goods will not be shipped on a vessel which has ever called at a port in 
boycotted country X.

[[Page 375]]

    As distinguished from a certification that goods will not be shipped 
on a vessel which will call enroute at a port of boycotted country X, 
such a certification is not a reasonable requirement to protect against 
war risks or confiscation, and, hence, may not be supplied.
    (xii) Same as (xi), except that Y insists that A agree to certify 
that the goods will not be shipped on a carrier that is ineligible to 
enter Y's waters.
    Such a certification, which is not a reasonable requirement to 
protect against war risks or confiscation may not be supplied.
    (xiii) A, a U.S. exporter, sells some of its products to boycotting 
country Y. A foreign bank located in Y opens a letter of credit to pay 
for the goods. The letter of credit requires that A supply documentation 
certifying that ``the goods are not manufactured in boycotted country 
X.''
    A may make the required certification until June 21, 1978, because 
import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country may be 
reflected in letters of credit.

    (d) Compliance with unilateral selection.

            Compliance With Unilateral and Specific Selection

    (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply in the 
normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by 
a boycotting country, a national of a boycotting country, or a resident 
of a boycotting country (including a United States person who is a bona 
fide resident of a boycotting country) of carriers, insurers, suppliers 
of services to be performed within the boycotting country, or specific 
goods, provided that with respect to services, it is necessary and 
customary that an insignificant part of the services be performed within 
the boycotting country, and with respect to goods, the items, in the 
normal course of business, are identifiable as to their source or origin 
at the time of their entry into the boycotting country by uniqueness of 
design or appearance or trademark, trade name, or other identification 
normally on the items themselves, including their packaging.
    (2) This exception pertains to what is permissible for a United 
States person who is the recipient of a unilateral and specific 
selection of goods or services to be furnished by a third person. It 
does not pertain to whether the act of making such a selection is 
permitted; that question is covered, with respect to United States 
persons, in paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local 
Law.'' Nor does it pertain to the United States person who is the 
recipient of an order to supply its own goods or services. Nothing in 
this part prohibits or restricts a United States person from filling an 
order himself, even if he is selected by the buyer on a boycott basis 
(e.g., because he is not blacklisted), so long as he does not himself 
take any action prohibited by this part.

           Unilateral and Specific Character of the Selection

    (3) In order for this exception to apply, the selection with which a 
United States person wishes to comply must be unilateral and specific.
    (4) A ``specific'' selection is one which is stated in the 
affirmative and which specifies a particular supplier of goods or 
services.
    (5) A ``unilateral'' selection is one in which the discretion in 
making the selection is exercised by the boycotting country buyer. If 
the United States person who receives a unilateral selection has 
provided the buyer with any boycott-based assistance (including 
information for purposes of helping the buyer select someone on a 
boycott basis), then the buyer's selection is not unilateral, and 
compliance with that selection by a United States person does not come 
within this exception.
    (6) The provision of so-called ``pre-selection'' or ``pre-award'' 
services, such as providing lists of qualified suppliers, 
subcontractors, or bidders, does not, in and of itself, destroy the 
unilateral character of a selection, provided such services are not 
boycott-based. Lists of qualified suppliers, for example, must not 
exclude anyone because he is blacklisted. Moreover, such services must 
be of the type customarily provided in similar transactions by the firm 
(or industry of which the firm is a part) as measured by the practice in 
non-boycotting as well as boycotting countries. If such services are not 
customarily provided in similar transactions or such services are 
provided in such a way as to exclude blacklisted

[[Page 376]]

persons from participating in a transaction or diminish their 
opportunity for such participation, then the services may not be 
provided without destroying the unilateral character of any subsequent 
selection.

           Selection To Be Made by Boycotting Country Resident

    (7) In order for this exception to be available, the unilateral and 
specific selection must have been made by a boycotting country, or by a 
national or resident of a boycotting country. Such a resident may be a 
United States person. For purposes of this exception, a United States 
person will be considered a resident of a boycotting country only if he 
is a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona fide 
resident of a boycotting country even if such person's residency is 
temporary.
    (8) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a United 
States person is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country include:
    (i) Physical presence in the country;
    (ii) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;
    (iii) Continuity of the residency;
    (iv) Intent to maintain the residency;
    (v) Prior residence in the country;
    (vi) Size and nature of presence in the country;
    (vii) Whether the person is registered to do business or 
incorporated in the country;
    (viii) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and
    (ix) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting 
and non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business 
activities.

    Note to paragraph (d)(8) of this section: No one of the factors is 
dispositive. All the circumstances will be examined closely to ascertain 
whether there is, in fact, a bona fide residency. Residency established 
solely for purposes of avoidance of the application of this part, 
unrelated to legitimate business needs, does not constitute bona fide 
residency.

    (9) The boycotting country resident must be the one actually making 
the selection. If a selection is made by a non-resident agent, parent, 
subsidiary, affiliate, home office or branch office of a boycotting 
country resident, it is not a selection by a resident within the meaning 
of this exception.
    (10) A selection made solely by a bona fide resident and merely 
transmitted by another person to a United States person for execution is 
a selection by a bona fide resident within the meaning of this 
exception.

                             Duty of Inquiry

    (11) If a United States person receives, from another person located 
in the United States, what may be a unilateral selection by a boycotting 
country customer, and knows or has reason to know that the selection is 
made for boycott reasons, he has a duty to inquire of the transmitting 
person to determine who actually made the selection. If he knows or has 
reason to know that the selection was made by other than a boycotting 
country, or a national or resident of a boycotting country, he may not 
comply. A course or pattern of conduct which a United States person 
recognizes or should recognize as consistent with boycott restrictions 
will create a duty to inquire.
    (12) If the United States person does not know or have reason to 
know that the selection it receives is boycott-based, its compliance 
with such a selection does not offend any prohibition and this exception 
is not needed.

                          Selection of Services

    (13) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of 
certain types of suppliers of services-carriers, insurers, and suppliers 
of services to be performed ``within the boycotting country.'' Services 
to be performed wholly within the United States or wholly within any 
country other than the boycotting country are not covered.
    (14) For purposes of this part, services are to be performed 
``within the boycotting country'' only if they are of a type which would 
customarily be performed by suppliers of those services within the 
country of the recipient of those services, and if the part of the 
services performed within the boycotting country is a necessary and not 
insignificant part of the total services performed.
    (15) What is ``customary and necessary'' for these purposes depends 
on

[[Page 377]]

the usual practice of the supplier of the services (or the industry of 
which he is a part) as measured by the practice in non-boycotting as 
well as boycotting countries, except where such practices are instituted 
to accommodate this part.

                           Selection of Goods

    (16) This exception applies only to compliance with selections of 
certain types of goods--goods that, in the normal course of business, 
are identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry 
into the boycotting country. The definition of ``specifically 
identifiable goods'' is the same under this section as it is in 
paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local Law.''
    (17) Goods ``specifically identifiable'' in the normal course of 
business are those items which at the time of their entry into a 
boycotting country are identifiable as to source or origin by uniqueness 
of design or appearance; or trademark, trade name, or other 
identification normally on the items themselves, including their 
packaging. Goods are ``specifically identifiable'' in the normal course 
of business if their source or origin is ascertainable by inspection of 
the items themselves, including their packaging, regardless of whether 
inspection takes place. Goods are not considered to be ``specifically 
identifiable'' in the normal course of business if a trademark, trade 
name, or other form of identification not normally present is added to 
the items themselves, including their packaging, to accommodate this 
part.

                                 General

    (18) If a unilateral selection meets the conditions described in 
paragraph (d) of this section, the United States person receiving the 
unilateral selection may comply or agree to comply, even if he knows or 
has reason to know that the selection was boycott-based. However, no 
United States person may comply or agree to comply with any unilateral 
selection if he knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the 
selection is to effect discrimination against any United States person 
on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin.

           Examples of Compliance With a Unilateral Selection

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
what constitutes a unilateral selection and the circumstances in which 
compliance with such a selection is permissible. They are illustrative, 
not comprehensive.

                    Specific and Unilateral Selection

    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer of road-grading equipment, is asked by 
boycotting country Y to ship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B, a carrier 
which is not blacklisted by Y. A knows or has reason to know that Y's 
selection of B is boycott-based.
    A may comply with Y's request, or may agree to comply as a condition 
of the contract, because the selection is specific and unilateral.
    (ii) A, a U.S. contractor building an industrial facility in 
boycotting country Y is asked by B, a resident of Y, to use C as the 
supplier of air conditioning equipment to be used in the facility. C is 
not blacklisted by country Y. A knows or has reason to know that B's 
request is boycott-based.
    A may comply with B's request, or may agree to comply as a condition 
of the contract, because the selection of C is specific and unilateral.
    (iii) A, a U.S. manufacturer of automotive equipment, is asked by 
boycotting country Y not to ship its goods to Y on U.S. carriers, B, C, 
or D. Carriers B, C, and D are blacklisted by boycotting country Y. A 
knows or has reason to know that Y's request is boycott-based.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because no 
specific selection of any particular carrier has been made.
    (iv) A, a U.S. exporter shipping goods ordered by boycotting country 
Y, is provided by Y with a list of eligible U.S. insurers from which A 
may choose in insuring the shipment of its goods. A knows or has reason 
to know that the list was compiled on a boycott basis.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request that A choose 
from among the eligible insurers, because no specific selection of any 
particular insurer has been made.
    (v) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, is negotiating to sell aircraft 
to boycotting country Y. During the negotiations, Y asks A to identify 
the company which normally manufactures the engines for the aircraft. A 
responds that they are normally manufactured by U.S. engine manufacturer 
B. B is blacklisted by Y. In making the purchase, Y specifies that the 
engines for the aircraft should be supplied by U.S. engine manufacturer 
C.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's selection of C, because Y's 
selection is unilateral and specific.

[[Page 378]]

    (vi) A, a U.S. construction firm, is retained by an agency of 
boycotting country Y to build a pipeline. Y requests A to suggest 
qualified engineering firms to be used on-site in the construction of 
the pipeline. It is customary for A, regardless of where it conducts its 
operations, to identify qualified engineering firms to its customers so 
that its customers may make their own selection of the firm to be 
engaged. Choice of engineering firm is customarily a prerogative of the 
customer. A provides a list of five engineering firms, B-F, excluding no 
firm because it may be blacklisted, and then confers with and gives its 
recommendations to Y. A recommends C, because C is the best qualified. Y 
then selects B, because C is blacklisted.
    A may comply with Y's selection of B, because the boycott-based 
decision is made by Y and is unilateral and specific. Since A's pre-
award services are of the kind customarily provided in these situations, 
and since they are provided without reference to the boycott, they do 
not destroy the unilateral character of Y's selection.
    (vii) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, has an order to supply a 
certain number of planes to boycotting country Y. In connection with the 
order, Y asks A to supply it with a list of qualified aircraft tire 
manufacturers so that Y can select the tires to be placed on the planes. 
This is a highly unusual request, since, in A's worldwide business 
operations, choice of tires is customarily made by the manufacturer, not 
the customer. Nonetheless, A supplies a list of tire manufacturers, B, 
C, D, and E. Y chooses tire manufacturer B because B is not blacklisted. 
Had A, as is customary, selected the tires, company C would have been 
chosen. C happens to be blacklisted, and A knows that C's blacklist 
status was the reason for Y's selection of B.
    A's provision of a list of tire manufacturers for Y to choose from 
destroys the unilateral character of Y's selection, because such a pre-
selection service is not customary in A's worldwide business operations.
    (viii) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, receives an order from U.S. 
company C, which is located in the United States, for the sale of 
aircraft to company D, a U.S. affiliate of C. D is a bona fide resident 
of boycotting country Y. C instructs A that ``in order to avoid boycott 
problems,'' A must use engines that are manufactured by company B, a 
company that is not blacklisted by Y. Engines built by B are unique in 
design and also bear B's trade name.
    Since A has reason to know that the selection is boycott-based, he 
must inquire of C whether the selection was in fact made by D. If C 
informs A that the selection was made by D, A may comply.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that C initially states that the 
designation was unilaterally and specifically made by D.
    A may accept C's statement without further investigation and may 
comply with the selection, because C merely transmitted D's unilateral 
and specific selection.
    (x) Same as (ix), except that C informs A that it, C, has selected B 
on behalf of or as an agent of its affiliated company resident in the 
boycotting country.
    A may not comply with this selection, because the decision was not 
made by a resident of the boycotting country.
    (xi) A, a U.S. management consulting firm, is advising boycotting 
country Y on the selection of a contracting firm to construct a plant 
for the manufacture of agricultural chemicals. As is customary in its 
business, A compiles a list of potential contractors on the basis of its 
evaluation of the capabilities of the respective candidates to perform 
the job. A has knowledge that company B is blacklisted, but provides Y 
with the names of companies B, C, D, and E, listing them in order of 
their qualifications. Y instructs A to negotiate with C.
    A may comply with Y's instruction, because Y's selection is 
unilateral and specific.
    (xii) A, a U.S. exporter, is asked by boycotting country Y not to 
ship goods on carriers B, C, or D, which are owned by nationals of and 
are registered in country P, a country not boycotted by Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's request even though the 
selection is not specific, because A does not know or have reason to 
know that the request is boycott-based.

    (Note: In example (xii), A has violated no prohibition, because it 
does not know or have reason to know that Y's instruction is boycott-
based. Therefore, A could not act with the requisite intent to comply 
with the boycott.)

    (xiii) A, a U.S. construction company, receives a contract to 
construct a hotel in boycotting country Y. As part of the contract, A is 
required to furnish Y with lists of qualified suppliers of various 
specifically identifiable items. A compiles lists of various qualified 
suppliers wholly without reference to the boycott, and thereafter Y 
instructs A to negotiate with, enter into contracts with, and arrange 
for delivery from each of the suppliers which Y designates. A knows that 
Y's choices are made on a boycott basis.
    A may comply with Y's selections and carry out these post-award 
services for Y, because Y's selections were unilateral and specific and 
A's pre-award services were provided without reference to Y's boycott.

                  Examples of Boycotting Country Buyer

(The factors in determining whether a United States person is a ``bona 
fide resident'' of a boycotting country are the same

[[Page 379]]

as in paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with Local Law.'' 
See also the examples in that section.)

    (i) A, a U.S. exporter, is asked by B, a U.S. person who is a bona 
fide resident of boycotting country Y, to ship goods on U.S. carrier C. 
C is not blacklisted by Y, and A knows that B has chosen on a boycott 
basis in order to comply with Y's boycott laws.
    A may comply or agree to comply with B's request, because B is a 
bona fide resident of Y.
    (ii) A is a U.S. computer company whose subsidiary, B, is a bona 
fide resident of boycotting country Y. A receives an order from B for 
specific, identifiable products manufactured by company C in connection 
with a computer which B is installing in Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with B's unilateral and specific 
selection, so long as the discretion was in fact exercised by B, not A.

    (Note: Unilateral selection transactions involving related United 
States persons will be scrutinized carefully to ensure that the 
selection was in fact made by the bona fide resident of the boycotting 
country.)

    (iii) A, a U.S. engineering firm, has chief engineer B as its 
resident engineer on a dam construction site in boycotting country Y. 
B's presence at the site is necessary in order to ensure proper 
supervision of the project. In order to comply with local law, B selects 
equipment supplier C rather than D, who is blacklisted, and directs A to 
purchase certain specific equipment from C for use in the project.
    A may comply with this unilateral selection, because the decision 
was made by a bona fide resident of Y.

(As noted above, unilateral selections involving related United States 
persons will be scrutinized carefully to ensure that the selection was 
in fact made by the bona fide resident of the boycotting country.)

    (iv) B, a branch of U.S. bank A, is located in boycotting country Y. 
B is in need of office supplies and asks the home office in New York to 
make the necessary purchases. A contacts C, a U.S. company in the office 
supply business, and instructs C to purchase various items from certain 
specific companies and ship them directly to B. In order to avoid any 
difficulties for B with respect to Y's boycott laws, A is careful to 
specify only non-blacklisted companies or suppliers. C knows that that 
was A's purpose. C may not comply with A's instruction, because the 
selection of suppliers was not made by a resident of a boycotting 
country.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that A has given standing instructions to B 
that whenever it needs office supplies, it should specify certain 
suppliers designated by A. To avoid running afoul of Y's boycott laws, 
A's designations consist exclusively of non-blacklisted firms. A 
receives an order from B with the suppliers designated in accordance 
with A's instructions.
    A may not comply with B's selection, because the selection was not 
in fact made by a bona fide resident of the boycotting country, but by a 
person located in the United States.

                    Examples of Suppliers of Services

    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is asked by boycotting country Y to ship 
goods to Y on U.S. vessel B, a carrier which is not blacklisted by Y.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because compliance 
with the unilateral and specific selection of carriers is expressly 
permitted under this exception.
    (ii) A, a U.S. exporter shipping goods ordered by C, a national of 
boycotting country Y, is asked by C to insure the shipment through U.S. 
insurer B.
    A may comply or agree to comply with C's request, because compliance 
with the unilateral and specific selection of an insurer is expressly 
permitted under this exception.
    (iii) A, a U.S. construction company, is hired by C, an agency of 
the government of boycotting country Y, to build a power plant in Y. C 
specifies that A should subcontract the foundation work to U.S. 
contractor B. Part of the foundation design work will be done by B in 
the United States.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's designation, because a 
necessary and not insignificant part of B's services are to be performed 
within the boycotting country, and such services are customarily 
performed on-site.
    (iv) A, a U.S. contractor, is engaged by boycotting country Y to 
build a power plant. Y specifies that U.S. architectural firm B should 
be retained by A to design the plant. In order to design the plant, it 
is essential that B's personnel visit and become familiar with the site, 
although the bulk of the design and drawing work will be done in the 
United States.
    A may comply or agree to comply with Y's unilateral and specific 
selection of architectural firm B, because a necessary and not 
insignificant part of B's services are to be performed within Y, and 
such on-site work is customarily involved in the provision of 
architectural services. The fact that the bulk of the actual work may be 
performed in the United States is irrelevant since the part to be 
performed within Y is necessary to B's effective performance.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that Y specifies that the turbine for the 
power plant should be designed by U.S. engineer C. It is neither 
customary nor necessary for C to visit the site in order to do any of 
his work, but C has informed A that he would probably want to

[[Page 380]]

visit the site in Y if he were selected for the job.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because, in 
the normal course of business, it is neither customary nor necessary for 
engineer C's services to be performed in Y.
    (vi) A, a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, receives a contract from 
boycotting country Y to manufacture jet engines for Y's use. Y specifies 
that the engines should be designed by U.S. industrial engineering firm 
B.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because, in 
the normal course of business, the services will not be performed in Y.
    (vii) U.S. company A has a contract to supply specially designed 
road graders to boycotting country Y. Y has instructed A that it should 
engage engineering firm B in the design work rather than engineering 
firm C, which A normally uses, because C is blacklisted. When A contacts 
B, B informs A that one of B's personnel customarily visits the location 
in which any equipment B designs is used after it is in use, in order to 
determine how good a design job B has done. Such visits are necessary 
from B's point of view to provide a check on the quality of its work, 
and they are necessary from Y's point of view because they make it 
possible for Y to discuss possible design changes should deficiencies be 
detected.
    A may not comply with Y's selection of B, because the services which 
B would perform in Y are an insignificant part of the total services to 
be performed by B.

               Examples of Specifically Identifiable Goods

(The test of what constitutes ``specifically identifiable goods'' under 
this exception also applies to the term ``specifically identifiable 
goods'' as used in paragraph (g) of this section on ``Compliance with 
Local Law.'')

    (i) A, a U.S. contractor, is constructing an apartment complex, on a 
turnkey basis, for boycotting country Y. Y instructs A to use only 
kitchen appliances manufactured by U.S. company B in completing the 
project. The appliances normally bear the manufacturer's name and 
trademark.
    A may comply with Y's selection of B, because Y's unilateral and 
specific selection is of goods identifiable as to source or origin in 
the normal course of business at the time of their entry into Y.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that Y directs A to use lumber manufactured 
only by U.S. company C. In the normal course of business, C neither 
stamps its name on the lumber nor identifies itself as the manufacturer 
on the packaging. In addition, normal export packaging does not identify 
the manufacturer.
    A may not comply with Y's selection, because the goods selected are 
not identifiable by source or origin in the normal course of business at 
the time of their entry into Y.
    (iii) B, a U.S. contractor who is a bona fide resident of boycotting 
country Y, is engaged in building roads. B retains the services of A, a 
U.S. engineering firm, to assist it in procuring construction equipment. 
B directs A to purchase road graders only from manufacturer C because 
other road grader manufacturers which A might use are blacklisted. C's 
road graders normally bear C's insignia.
    A may comply with B's selection of C, because the goods selected are 
identifiable by source or origin in the normal course of business at the 
time of their entry into Y.
    (iv) A, a U.S. company, manufactures computer-operated machine 
tools. The computers are mounted on a separate bracket on the side of 
the equipment and are readily identifiable by brand name imprinted on 
the equipment. There are five or six U.S. manufacturers of such 
computers which will function interchangeably to operate the machine 
tools manufactured by A. B, a resident of boycotting country Y, 
contracts to buy the machine tools manufactured by A on the condition 
that A incorporate, as the computer drive, a computer manufactured by 
U.S. company C. B's designation of C is made to avoid boycott problems 
which could be caused if computers manufactured by some other company 
were used.
    A may comply with B's designation of C, because the goods selected 
are identifiable by source or origin in the normal course of business at 
the time of their entry into Y.
    (v) A, a U.S. wholesaler of electronic equipment, receives an order 
from B, a U.S. manufacturer of radio equipment, who is a bona fide 
resident of boycotting country Y. B orders a variety of electrical 
components and specifies that all transistors must be purchased from 
company C, which is not blacklisted by Y. The transistors requested by B 
do not normally bear the name of the manufacturer; however, they are 
typically shipped in cartons, and C's name and logo appear on the 
cartons.
    A may comply with B's selection, because the goods selected by B are 
identifiable as to source or origin in the normal course of business at 
the time of their entry into Y by virtue of the containers or packaging 
used.
    (vi) A, a U.S. computer manufacturer, receives an order for a 
computer from B, a university in boycotting country Y. B specifies that 
certain integrated circuits incorporated in the computer must be 
supplied by U.S. electronics company C. These circuits are incorporated 
into the computer and are not visible without disassembling the 
computer.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with B's specific selection of 
these components, because they are not identifiable as to their source 
or origin in the normal course of business at the time of their entry 
into Y.

[[Page 381]]

    (vii) A, a U.S. clothing manufacturer, receives an order for shirts 
from B, a retailer resident in boycotting country Y. B specifies that 
the shirts are to be manufactured from cotton produced by U.S. farming 
cooperative C. Such shirts will not identify C or the source of the 
cotton.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with B's designation, because 
the cotton is not identifiable as to source or origin in the normal 
course of business at the time of entry into Y.
    (viii) A, a U.S. contractor, is retained by B, a construction firm 
located in and wholly-owned by boycotting country Y, to assist B in 
procuring construction materials. B directs A to purchase a range of 
materials, including hardware, tools, and trucks, all of which bear the 
name of the manufacturer stamped on the item. In addition, B directs A 
to purchase steel beams manufactured by U.S. company C. The name of 
manufacturer C normally does not appear on the steel itself or on its 
export packaging.
    A may comply with B's selection of the hardware, tools, and trucks, 
because they are identifiable as to source or origin in the normal 
course of business at the time of entry into Y. A may not comply with 
B's selection of steel beams, because the goods are not identifiable as 
to source or origin by trade name, trademark, uniqueness or packaging at 
the time of their entry into Y.

Examples of Discrimination on Basis of Race, Religion, Sex, or National 
                                 Origin

    (i) A, a U.S. paper manufacturer, is asked by boycotting country Y 
to ship goods to Y on U.S. vessel B. Y states that the reason for its 
choice of B is that, unlike U.S. vessel C, B is not owned by persons of 
a particular faith.
    A may not comply or agree to comply with Y's request, because A has 
reason to know that the purpose of the selection is to effect religious 
discrimination against a United States person.

    (e) Shipment and transshipment of exports pursuant to a boycotting 
country's requirements.

 Compliance With a Boycotting Country's Requirements Regarding Shipment 
                      and Transshipment of Exports

    (1) A United States person may comply or agree to comply with the 
export requirements of a boycotting country with respect to shipments or 
transshipments of exports to:
    (i) A boycotted country;
    (ii) Any business concern of a boycotted country;
    (iii) Any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted 
country; or
    (iv) Any national or resident of a boycotted country.
    (2) This exception permits compliance with restrictions which a 
boycotting country may place on direct exports to a boycotted country; 
on indirect exports to a boycotted country (i.e., those that pass via 
third parties); and on exports to residents, nationals, or business 
concerns of, or organized under the laws of, a boycotted country, 
including those located in third countries.
    (3) This exception also permits compliance with restrictions which a 
boycotting country may place on the route of export shipments when the 
restrictions are reasonably related to preventing the export shipments 
from coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of the boycotted 
country. This exception applies whether a boycotting country or the 
vendor of the shipment:
    (i) Explicitly states that the shipment should not pass through the 
boycotted country enroute to its final destination; or
    (ii) Affirmatively describes a route of shipment that does not 
include the boycotted country.
    (4) A United States person may not, under this exception, refuse on 
an across-the-board basis to do business with a boycotted country or a 
national or resident of a boycotted country.

    Examples of Compliance With a Boycotting Country's Requirements 
             Regarding Shipment or Transshipment of Exports

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with the export requirements of a 
boycotting country is permissible. They are illustrative, not 
comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. petroleum company, exports petroleum products to 20 
countries, including the United States, from boycotting country Y. 
Country Y's export regulations require that products not be exported 
from Y to boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect to the 
export of goods from Y to X.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that Y's export regulations require that 
goods not be exported from boycotting country Y to any business

[[Page 382]]

concern organized under the laws of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect to the 
export of goods from Y to a business concern organized under the laws of 
X, even if such concern is located in a country not involved in Y's 
boycott of X.
    (iii) B, the operator of a storage facility in country M, contracts 
with A, a U.S. carrier, for the shipment of certain goods manufactured 
in boycotting country Y. A's contract with B contains a provision 
stating that the goods to be transported may not be shipped or 
transshipped to boycotted country X. B informs A that this provision is 
a requirement of C, the manufacturer of goods who is a resident of 
boycotting country Y. Country M is not boycotted by Y.
    A may agree to and comply with this provision, because such a 
provision is required by the export regulations of boycotting country Y 
in order to prevent shipment of Y-origin goods to a country boycotted by 
Y.
    (iv) A, a U.S. petroleum refiner located in the United States, 
purchases crude oil from boycotting country Y. A has a branch operation 
in boycotted country X. Y requires, as a condition of sale, that A agree 
not to ship or transship the crude oil or products refined in Y to A's 
branch in X.
    A may agree to and comply with these requirements, because they are 
export requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from 
being shipped to a boycotted country.
    (v) A, a U.S. company, has a petrochemical plant in boycotting 
country Y. As a condition of securing an export license from Y, A must 
agree that it will not ship or permit transshipment of any of its output 
from the plant in Y to any companies which Y lists as being owned by 
nationals of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to this condition, because it is a restriction designed 
to prevent Y-origin products from being exported to a business concern 
of boycotted country X or to nationals of boycotted country X.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that the condition imposed on A is that Y-
origin goods may not be shipped or permitted to be transshipped to any 
companies which Y lists as being owned by persons whose national origin 
is X.
    A may not agree to this condition, because it is a restriction 
designed to prevent Y-origin goods from being exported to persons of a 
particular national origin rather than to residents or nationals of a 
particular boycotted country.
    (vii) A, a U.S. petroleum company, exports petroleum products to 20 
countries, including the United States, from boycotting country Y. Y 
requires, as a condition of sale, that A not ship the products to be 
exported from Y to or through boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with this requirement because it is an 
export requirement of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from 
coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycotted 
country.
    (viii) Same as (vii), except that boycotting country Y's export 
regulations require that products to be exported from Y not pass through 
a port of boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations prohibiting Y-origin 
exports from passing through a port at boycotted country X, because they 
are export requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from 
coming into contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycotted 
country.
    (ix) Same as (vii), except that Y's export regulations require that 
A not transship the exported products ``in or at'' boycotted country X.
    A may agree to and comply with Y's regulations with respect to the 
transshipment of goods ``in or at'' X, because they are export 
requirements of Y designed to prevent Y-origin products from coming into 
contact with or under the jurisdiction of a boycotted country.

    (f) Immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a 
boycotting country.

Compliance With Immigration, Passport, Visa, or Employment Requirements 
                         of a Boycotting Country

    (1) A United States individual may comply or agree to comply with 
the immigration, passport, visa, or employment requirements of a 
boycotting country, and with requests for information from a boycotting 
country made to ascertain whether such individual meets requirements for 
employment within the boycotting country, provided that he furnishes 
information only about himself or a member of his family, and not about 
any other United States individual, including his employees, employers, 
or co-workers.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a United States individual means a 
person who is a resident or national of the United States. Family means 
immediate family members, including parents, siblings, spouse, children, 
and other dependents living in the individual's home.
    (3) A United States person may not furnish information about its 
employees or executives, but may allow any individual to respond on his 
own to any

[[Page 383]]

request for information relating to immigration, passport, visa, or 
employment requirements. A United States person may also perform any 
ministerial acts to expedite processing of applications by individuals. 
These include informing employees of boycotting country visa 
requirements at an appropriate time; typing, translation, messenger and 
similar services; and assisting in or arranging for the expeditious 
processing of applications. All such actions must be undertaken on a 
non-discriminatory basis.
    (4) A United States person may proceed with a project in a 
boycotting country even if certain of its employees or other prospective 
participants in a transaction are denied entry for boycott reasons. But 
no employees or other participants may be selected in advance in a 
manner designed to comply with a boycott.

 Examples of Compliance With Immigration, Passport, Visa, or Employment 
                  Requirements of a Boycotting Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with immigration, passport, visa, 
or employment requirements is permissible. They are illustrative, not 
comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. individual employed by B, a U.S. manufacturer of 
sporting goods with a plant in boycotting country Y, wishes to obtain a 
work visa so that he may transfer to the plant in Y. Country Y's 
immigration laws specify that anyone wishing to enter the country or 
obtain a visa to work in the country must supply information about his 
religion. This information is required for boycott purposes.
    A may furnish such information, because it is required by Y's 
immigration laws.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that A is asked to supply such information 
about other employees of B.
    A may not supply this information, because it is not information 
about himself or his family.
    (iii) A, a U.S. building contractor, has been awarded a construction 
contract to be performed in boycotting country Y. Y's immigration laws 
require that individuals applying for visas must indicate race, 
religion, and place of birth. The information is sought for boycott 
purposes. To avoid repeated rejections of applications for work visas by 
A's employees, A desires to furnish to country Y a list of its 
prospective and current employees and required information about each so 
that Y can make an initial screening.
    A may not furnish such a list, because A would be furnishing 
information about the race, religion, and national origin of its 
employees.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A selects for work on the project 
those of its current employees whom it believes will be granted work 
visas from boycotting country Y.
    A may not make a selection from among its employees in a manner 
designed to comply with the boycott-based visa requirements of Y, but 
must allow all eligible employees to apply for visas. A may later 
substitute an employee who obtains the necessary visa for one who has 
had his application rejected.
    (v) Same as (iii), except that A selects employees for the project 
and then allows each employee individually to apply for his own visa. 
Two employees' applications are rejected, and A then substitutes two 
other employees who, in turn, submit their own visa applications.
    A may take such action, because in so doing A is not acting in 
contravention of any prohibition of this part.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that A arranges for the translation, typing 
and processing of its employees' applications, and transmits all the 
applications to the consulate of boycotting country Y.
    A may take such ministerial actions, because in so doing A is not 
itself furnishing information with respect to race, religion, sex, or 
national origin, but is merely transmitting information furnished by its 
individual employees.
    (vii) A, a U.S. contractor, selects U.S. subcontractor B to perform 
certain engineering services in connection with A's project in 
boycotting country Y. The work visa application submitted by the 
employee B has proposed as chief engineer of this project is rejected by 
Y because his national origin is of boycotted country X. Subcontractor B 
thereupon withdraws.
    A may continue with the project and select another subcontractor, 
because A is not acting in contravention of any prohibition of this 
part.

    (g) Compliance with local law. (1) This exception contains two 
parts. The first covers compliance with local law with respect to a 
United States person's activities exclusively within a foreign country; 
the second covers compliance with local import laws by United States 
persons resident in a foreign country. Under both parts of this 
exception, local laws are laws of the host country, whether derived from 
statutes, regulations, decrees, or other official sources having the 
effect of law in the host country. This exception is not

[[Page 384]]

available for compliance with presumed policies or understandings of 
policies unless those policies are reflected in official sources having 
the effect of law.
    (2) Both parts of this exception apply only to United States persons 
resident in a foreign country. For purposes of this exception, a United 
States person will be considered to be a resident of a foreign country 
only if he is a bona fide resident. A United States person may be a bona 
fide resident of a foreign country even if such person's residency is 
temporary.
    (3)(i) Factors that will be considered in determining whether a 
United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country 
include:
    (A) Physical presence in the country;
    (B) Whether residence is needed for legitimate business reasons;
    (C) Continuity of the residency;
    (D) Intent to maintain the residency;
    (E) Prior residence in the country;
    (F) Size and nature of presence in the country;
    (G) Whether the person is registered to do business or incorporated 
in the country;
    (H) Whether the person has a valid work visa; and
    (I) Whether the person has a similar presence in both boycotting and 
non-boycotting foreign countries in connection with similar business 
activities.
    (ii) No one of the factors in paragraph (g)(3) of this section is 
dispositive. All the circumstances involved will be closely examined to 
ascertain whether there is, in fact, bona fide residency. Residency 
established solely for purposes of avoidance of the application of this 
part, unrelated to legitimate business needs, does not constitute bona 
fide residency.

                     Examples of Bona Fide Residency

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which a United States person may be a bona fide 
resident of a foreign country. For purposes of illustration, each 
example discusses only one or two factors, instead of all relevant 
factors. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. radio manufacturer located in the United States, 
receives a tender to bid on a contract to supply radios for a hotel to 
be built in boycotting country Y. After examining the proposal, A sends 
a bid from its New York office to Y.
    A is not a resident of Y, because it is not physically present in Y.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that after receiving the tender, A sends 
its sales representative to Y. A does not usually have sales 
representatives in countries when it bids from the United States, and 
this particular person's presence in Y is not necessary to enable A to 
make the bid.
    A is not a bona fide resident of Y, because it has no legitimate 
business reasons for having its sales representative resident in Y.
    (iii) A, a U.S. bank, wishes to establish a branch office in 
boycotting country Y. In pursuit of that objective, A's personnel visit 
Y to make the necessary arrangements. A intends to establish a permanent 
branch office in Y after the necessary arrangements are made.
    A's personnel in Y are not bona fide residents of Y, because A does 
not yet have a permanent business operation in Y.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except A's personnel are required by Y's laws to 
furnish certain non-discriminatory boycott information in order to 
establish a branch in Y.
    In these limited circumstances, A's personnel may furnish the non-
discriminatory boycott information necessary to establish residency to 
the same extent a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident in that 
country could. If this information could not be furnished in such 
limited circumstances, the exception would be available only to firms 
resident in a boycotting country before the effective date of this part.
    (v) A, a U.S. construction company, receives an invitation to build 
a power plant in boycotting country Y. After receipt of the invitation, 
A's personnel visit Y in order to survey the site and make necessary 
analyses in preparation for submitting a bid. The invitation requires 
that otherwise prohibited boycott information be furnished with the bid.
    A's personnel in Y are not bona fide residents of Y, because A has 
no permanent business operation in Y. Therefore, A's personnel may not 
furnish the prohibited information.
    (vi) Same as (v), except that A is considering establishing an 
office in boycotting country Y. A's personnel visit Y in order to 
register A to do business in that country. A intends to establish 
ongoing construction operations in Y. A's personnel are required by Y's 
laws to furnish certain non-discriminatory boycott information in order 
to register A to do business or incorporate a subsidiary in Y.
    In these limited circumstances, A's personnel may furnish non-
discriminatory boycott information necessary to establish residency to 
the same extent a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident in that 
country could. If this information could not be furnished in

[[Page 385]]

such limited circumstances, the exception would be available only to 
firms resident in a boycotting country before the effective date of this 
part.
    (vii) A, a subsidiary of U.S. oil company B, is located in 
boycotting country Y. A has been engaged in oil explorations in Y for a 
number of years.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because of its pre-existing 
continuous presence in Y for legitimate business reasons.
    (viii) Same as (vii), except that A has just been established in Y 
and has not yet begun operations.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because it is present in Y for 
legitimate business reasons and it intends to reside continuously.
    (ix) U.S. company A is a manufacturer of prefabricated homes. A 
builds a plant in boycotting country Y for purposes of assembling 
components made by A in the United States and shipped to Y.
    A's personnel in Y are bona fide residents of Y, because A's plant 
in Y is established for legitimate business reasons, and it intends to 
reside continuously.
    (x) U.S. company A has its principal place of business in the United 
States. A's sales agent visits boycotting country Y from time to time 
for purposes of soliciting orders.
    A's sales agent is not a bona fide resident of Y, because such 
periodic visits to Y are insufficient to establish a bona fide 
residency.
    (xi) A, a branch office of U.S. construction company B, is located 
in boycotting country Y. The branch office has been in existence for a 
number of years and has been performing various management services in 
connection with B's construction operations in Y.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because of its longstanding presence 
in Y and its conduct of ongoing operations in Y.
    (xii) U.S. construction company A has never done any business in 
boycotting country Y. It is awarded a contract to construct a hospital 
in Y, and preparatory to beginning construction, sends its personnel to 
Y to set up operations.
    A's personnel are bona fide residents of Y, because they are present 
in Y for the purposes of carrying out A's legitimate business purposes; 
they intend to reside continuously; and residency is necessary to 
conduct their business.
    (xiii) U.S. company A manufactures furniture. All its sales in 
foreign countries are conducted from its offices in the United States. 
From time to time A has considered opening sales offices abroad, but it 
has concluded that it is more efficient to conduct sales operations from 
the United States. Shortly after the effective date of this part, A 
sends a sales representative to boycotting country Y to open an office 
in and solicit orders from Y. It is more costly to conduct operations 
from that office than to sell directly from the United States, but A 
believes that if it establishes a residence in Y, it will be in a better 
position to avoid conflicts with U.S. law in its sales to Y.
    A's sales representative is not a bona fide resident of Y, because 
the residency was established to avoid the application of this part and 
not for legitimate business reasons.
    (xiv) Same as (xiii), except that it is in fact more efficient to 
have a sales office in Y. In fact, without a sales office in Y, A would 
find it difficult to explore business opportunities in Y. A is aware, 
however, that residency in Y would permit its sales representative to 
comply with Y's boycott laws.
    A's sales representative is a bona fide resident of Y, because A has 
a legitimate business reason for establishing a sales office in Y.
    (xv) U.S. company B is a computer manufacturer. B sells computers 
and related programming services tailored to the needs of individual 
clients. Because of the complex nature of the product, B must have sales 
representatives in any country where sales are made. B has a sales 
representative, A, in boycotting country Y. A spends two months of the 
year in Y, and the rest of the year in other countries. B has a 
permanent sales office from which A operates while in Y, and the sales 
office is stocked with brochures and other sales materials.
    A is a bona fide resident of Y, because his presence in Y is 
necessary to carry out B's legitimate business purposes; B maintains a 
permanent office in Y; and B intends to continue doing business in Y in 
the future.
    (xvi) A, a U.S. construction engineering company, is engaged by B, a 
U.S. general contracting company, to provide services in connection with 
B's contract to construct a hospital complex in boycotting country Y. In 
order to perform those services, A's engineers set up a temporary office 
in a trailer on the construction site in Y. A's work is expected to be 
completed within six months.
    A's personnel in Y are bona fide residents of Y, because A's on-site 
office is necessary to the performance of its services for B, and 
because A's personnel are continuously there.
    (xvii) A, a U.S. company, sends one of its representatives to 
boycotting country Y to explore new sales possibilities for its line of 
transistor radios. After spending several weeks in Y, A's representative 
rents a post office box in Y, to which all persons interested in A's 
products are directed to make inquiry.
    A is not a bona fide resident of Y, because rental of a post office 
box is not a sufficient presence in Y to constitute residency.
    (xviii) A, a U.S. computer company, has a patent and trademark 
registered in the

[[Page 386]]

United States. In order to obtain registration of its patent and 
trademark in boycotting country Y, A is required to furnish certain non-
discriminatory boycott information.
    A may not furnish the information, because A is not a bona fide 
resident of Y.

    (h) Activities exclusively within a foreign country. (1) Any United 
States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, 
including a boycotting country, may comply or agree to comply with the 
laws of that country with respect to his activities exclusively within 
that country. These activities include:
    (i) Entering into contracts which provide that local law applies or 
governs, or that the parties will comply with such laws;
    (ii) Employing residents of the host country;
    (iii) Retaining local contractors to perform work within the host 
country;
    (iv) Purchasing or selling goods or services from or to residents of 
the host country; and
    (v) Furnishing information within the host country.
    (2) Activities exclusively within the country do not include 
importing goods or services from outside the host country, and, 
therefore, this part of the exception does not apply to compliance with 
import laws in connection with importing goods or services.

   Examples of Permissible Compliance With Local Law With Respect to 
             Activities Exclusively Within a Foreign Country

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with local law is permissible. 
They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

             Activities Exclusively Within a Foreign Country

    (i) U.S. construction company A, a bona fide resident of boycotting 
country Y, has a contract to build a school complex in Y. Pursuant to 
Y's boycott laws, the contract requires A to refuse to purchase supplies 
from certain local merchants. While Y permits such merchants to operate 
within Y, their freedom of action in Y is constrained because of their 
relationship with boycotted country X.
    A may enter into the contract, because dealings with local merchants 
are activities exclusively within Y.
    (ii) A, a banking subsidiary of U.S. bank B, is a bona fide resident 
of boycotting country Y. From time to time, A purchases office supplies 
from the United States.
    A's purchase of office supplies is not an activity exclusively 
within Y, because it involves the import of goods from abroad.
    (iii) A, a branch of U.S. bank B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y. Under Y's boycott laws, A is required to supply 
information about whether A has any dealings with boycotted country X. A 
compiles and furnishes the information within Y and does so of its own 
knowledge.
    A may comply with that requirement, because in compiling and 
furnishing the information within Y, based on its own knowledge, A is 
engaging in an activity exclusively within Y.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A is required to supply information 
about B's dealings with X. From its own knowledge and without making any 
inquiry of B, A compiles and furnishes the information.
    A may comply with that requirement, because in compiling and 
furnishing the information within Y, based on its own knowledge, A is 
engaging in an activity exclusively within Y.
    (v) Same as (iv), except that in making its responses, A asks B to 
compile some of the information.
    A may not comply, because the gathering of the necessary information 
takes place partially outside Y.
    (vi) U.S. company A has applied for a license to establish a 
permanent manufacturing facility in boycotting country Y. Under Y's 
boycott law, A must agree, as a condition of the license, that it will 
not sell any of its output to blacklisted foreign firms.
    A may not comply, because the agreement would govern activities of A 
which are not exclusively within Y.

              Discrimination Against United States Persons

    (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y. A manufactures air conditioners in its plant in Y. 
Under Y's boycott laws, A must agree not to hire nationals of boycotted 
country X.
    A may agree to the restriction and may abide by it with respect to 
its recruitment of individuals within Y, because the recruitment of such 
individuals is an activity exclusively within Y. However, A cannot abide 
by this restriction with respect to its recruitment of individuals 
outside Y, because this is not an activity exclusively within Y.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that pursuant to Y's boycott laws, A must 
agree not to hire anyone who is of a designated religion.
    A may not agree to this restriction, because the agreement calls for 
discrimination against U.S. persons on the basis of religion.

[[Page 387]]

It makes no difference whether the recruitment of the U.S. persons 
occurs within or without Y.

    (Note: The exception for compliance with local law does not apply to 
boycott-based refusals to employ U.S. persons on the basis of race, 
religion, sex, or national origin even if the activity is exclusively 
within the boycotting country.)

    (i) Compliance with local import law. (1) Any United States person 
who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, including a boycotting 
country, may, in importing goods, materials or components into that 
country, comply or agree to comply with the import laws of that country, 
provided that:
    (i) The items are for his own use or for his use in performing 
contractual services within that country; and
    (ii) In the normal course of business, the items are identifiable as 
to their source or origin at the time of their entry into the foreign 
country by:
    (a) Uniqueness of design or appearance; or
    (b) Trademark, trade name, or other identification normally on the 
items themselves, including their packaging.
    (2) The factors that will be considered in determining whether a 
United States person is a bona fide resident of a foreign country are 
those set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. Bona fide residence of 
a United States company's subsidiary, affiliate, or other permanent 
establishment in a foreign country does not confer such residence on 
such United States company. Likewise, bona fide residence of a United 
States company's employee in a foreign country does not confer such 
residence on the entire company.
    (3) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign 
country may take action under this exception through an agent outside 
the country, but the agent must act at the direction of the resident and 
not exercise his own discretion. Therefore, if a United States person 
resident in a boycotting country takes action to comply with a 
boycotting country's import law with respect to the importation of 
qualified goods, he may direct his agent in the United States on the 
action to be taken, but the United States agent himself may not exercise 
any discretion.
    (4) For purposes of this exception, the test that governs whether 
goods or components of goods are specifically identifiable is identical 
to the test applied in paragraph (c) of this section on ``Compliance 
With Unilateral Selection'' to determine whether they are identifiable 
as to their source or origin in the normal course of business.
    (5) The availability of this exception for the import of goods 
depends on whether the goods are intended for the United States person's 
own use at the time they are imported. It does not depend upon who has 
title to the goods at the time of importation into a foreign country.
    (6) Goods are for the United States person's own use (including the 
performance of contractual services within the foreign country) if:
    (i) They are to be consumed by the United States person;
    (ii) They are to remain in the United States person's possession and 
to be used by that person;
    (iii) They are to be used by the United States person in performing 
contractual services for another;
    (iv) They are to be further manufactured, incorporated into, refined 
into, or reprocessed into another product to be manufactured for 
another; or
    (v) They are to be incorporated into, or permanently affixed as a 
functional part of, a project to be constructed for another.
    (7) Goods acquired to fill an order for such goods from another are 
not for the United States person's own use. Goods procured for another 
are not for one's own use, even if the furnishing of procurement 
services is the business in which the United States person is 
customarily engaged. Nor are goods obtained for simple resale acquired 
for one's own use, even if the United States person is engaged in the 
retail business. Likewise, goods obtained for inclusion in a turnkey 
project are not for one's own use if they are not customarily 
incorporated into, or do not customarily become permanently affixed as a 
functional part of the project.
    (8) This part of the local law exception does not apply to the 
import of services, even when the United States person importing such 
services is a

[[Page 388]]

bona fide resident of a boycotting country and is importing them for his 
own use. In addition, this exception is available for a United States 
person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country only when the 
individual or entity actually present within that country takes action 
through the exercise of his own discretion.
    (9) Use of this exception will be monitored and continually reviewed 
to determine whether its continued availability is consistent with the 
national interest. Its availability may be limited or withdrawn as 
appropriate. In reviewing the continued availability of this exception, 
the effect that the inability to comply with local import laws would 
have on the economic and other relations of the United States with 
boycotting countries will be considered.
    (10) A United States person who is a bona fide resident of a foreign 
country may comply or agree to comply with the host country's import 
laws even if he knows or has reason to know that particular laws are 
boycott-related. However, no United States person may comply or agree to 
comply with any host country law which would require him to discriminate 
against any United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or 
national origin, or to supply information about any United States 
person's race, religion, sex, or national origin.

        Examples of Permissible Compliance With Local Import Law

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
the circumstances in which compliance with local import law is 
permissible. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.

                   Compliance by a Bona Fide Resident

    (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y and is engaged in oil drilling operations in Y. In 
acquiring certain large, specifically identifiable products for carrying 
out its operations in Y, A chooses only from non-blacklisted firms 
because Y's import laws prohibit the importation of goods from 
blacklisted firms. However, with respect to smaller items, B makes the 
selection on behalf of A and sends them to A in Y.
    A may choose from non-blacklisted firms, because it is a U.S. person 
who is a bona fide resident in Y. However, because B is not resident in 
Y, B cannot make boycott-based selections to conform with Y's import 
laws prohibiting the importation of goods from blacklisted firms.
    (ii) Same as (i), except that after making its choices on the larger 
items, A directs B to carry out its instructions by entering into 
appropriate contracts and making necessary shipping arrangements.
    B may carry out A's instructions provided that A, a bona fide 
resident of Y, has in fact made the choice and B is exercising no 
discretion, but is acting only as A's agent.

    (Note: Such transactions between related companies will be 
scrutinized carefully. A must in fact exercise the discretion and make 
the selections. If the discretion is exercised by B, B would be in 
violation of this part.)

    (iii) U.S. construction company A has a contract to build a school 
in boycotting country Y. A's employees set up operations in Y for 
purposes of commencing construction. A's employees in Y advise A's 
headquarters in the United States that Y's import laws prohibit 
importation of goods manufactured by blacklisted firms. A's headquarters 
then issues invitations to bid only to non-blacklisted firms for certain 
specifically identifiable goods.
    A's headquarters' choice of non-blacklisted suppliers is not a 
choice made by a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident of Y, because 
the discretion in issuing the bids was exercised in the United States, 
not in Y.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that A's employees in Y actually make the 
decision regarding to whom the bids should be issued.
    The choices made by A's employees are choices made by U.S. persons 
who are bona fide residents of Y, because the discretion in choosing was 
exercised solely in Y.

    (Note: Choices purportedly made by employees of U.S. companies who 
are resident in boycotting countries will be carefully scrutinized to 
ensure that the discretion was exercised entirely in the boycotting 
country.)

                     Specifically Identifiable Goods

    The test and examples as to what constitutes specifically 
identifiable goods are identical to those applicable under paragraph (d) 
of this section on ``Compliance With Unilateral Selection.''

                    Imports for U.S. Person's Own Use

    (i) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y. A plans to import computer operated machine tools 
to be installed in its automobile plant in boycotting country Y. The 
computers are mounted on a separate bracket on the side of the equipment 
and are readily identifiable by brand name. A orders the tools from U.S. 
supplier C and specifies that C

[[Page 389]]

must incorporate computers manufactured by D, a non-blacklisted company. 
A would have chosen computers manufactured by E, except that E is 
blacklisted, and Y's import laws prohibit the importation of goods 
manufactured by blacklisted firms.
    A may refuse to purchase E's computers, because A is importing the 
computers for its own use in its manufacturing operations in Y.
    (ii) A, a subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y. To meet the needs of its employees in Y, A imports 
certain specifically identifiable commissary items for sale, such as 
cosmetics; and canteen items, such as candy. In selecting such items for 
importation into Y, A chooses items made only by non-blacklisted firms, 
because Y's import laws prohibit importation of goods from blacklisted 
firms.
    A may import these items only from non-blacklisted firms, because 
the importation of goods for consumption by A's employees is an 
importation for A's own use.
    (iii) A, a U.S. construction company which is a bona fide resident 
of boycotting country Y, has a contract to build a hospital complex for 
the Ministry of Health in Y. Under the contract, A will be general 
manager of the project with discretion to choose all subcontractors and 
suppliers. The complex is to be built on a turnkey basis, with A 
retaining title to the property and bearing all financial risk until the 
complex is conveyed to Y. In choosing specifically identifiable goods 
for import, such as central air conditioning units and plate glass, A 
excludes blacklisted suppliers in order to comply with Y's import laws. 
These goods are customarily incorporated into, or permanently affixed as 
a functional part of, the project.
    A may refuse to deal with blacklisted suppliers of specifically 
identifiable goods, because importation of goods by a general contractor 
to be incorporated into a construction project in Y is an importation of 
goods for A's own use.
    (iv) Same as (iii), except that, in addition, in choosing U.S. 
architects and engineers to work on the project, A excludes blacklisted 
firms, because Y's import laws prohibit the use of services rendered by 
blacklisted persons.
    A may not refuse to deal with blacklisted architectural or 
engineering firms, because this exception does not apply to the import 
of services. It is irrelevant that, at some stage, the architectural or 
engineering drawings or plans may be brought to the site in Y. This 
factor is insufficient to transform such services into ``goods'' for 
purposes of this exception.
    (v) Same as (iii), except that the project is to be completed on a 
``cost plus'' basis, with Y making progress payments to A at various 
stages of completion.
    A may refuse to deal with blacklisted suppliers of specifically 
identifiable goods, because the importation of goods by A to be 
incorporated in a project A is under contract to complete is an 
importation of goods for its own use. The terms of payment are 
irrelevant.
    (vi) A, a U.S. construction company which is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y, has a contract for the construction of an office 
building in Y on a turnkey basis. In choosing goods to be used or 
included in the office complex, A orders wallboard, office partitions, 
and lighting fixtures from non-blacklisted manufacturers. A likewise 
orders desks, office chairs, typewriters, and office supplies from non-
blacklisted manufacturers.
    Because they are customarily incorporated into or permanently 
affixed as a functional part of an office building, the wallboard, 
office partitions, and lighting fixtures are for A's own use, and A may 
select non-blacklisted suppliers of these goods in order to comply with 
Y's import laws. Because they are not customarily incorporated into or 
permanently affixed to the project, the desks, office chairs, 
typewriters, and office supplies are not for A's own use, and A may not 
make boycott-based selections of the suppliers of these goods.
    (vii) A, a U.S. company engaged in the business of selling 
automobiles, is a bona fide resident of boycotting country Y. In 
ordering automobiles from time to time for purposes of stocking its 
inventory, A purchases from U.S. manufacturer B, but not U.S. 
manufacturer C, because C is blacklisted. Retail sales are subsequently 
made from this inventory.
    A's import of automobiles from B is not an import for A's own use, 
because the importation of items for general inventory in a retail sales 
operation is not an importation for one's own use.
    (viii) A, a U.S. company engaged in the manufacture of 
pharmaceutical products, is a bona fide resident of boycotting country 
Y. In importing chemicals for incorporation into the pharmaceutical 
products, A purchases from U.S. supplier B, but not U.S. supplier C, 
because C is blacklisted.
    A may import chemicals from B rather than C, because the importation 
of specifically identifiable items for incorporation into another 
product is an importation for one's own use.
    (ix) A, a U.S. management company which is a bona fide resident of 
boycotting country Y, has a contract with the Ministry of Education in Y 
to purchase supplies for Y's school system. From time to time, A 
purchases goods from abroad for delivery to various schools in Y.
    A's purchase of goods for Y's school system does not constitute an 
importation of goods

[[Page 390]]

for A's own use, because A is acting as a procurement agent for another. 
A, therefore, cannot make boycott-based selections of suppliers of such 
school supplies.
    (x) A, a U.S. company which is a bona fide resident of boycotting 
country Y, has a contract to make purchases for Y in connection with a 
construction project in Y. A is not engaged in the construction of, or 
in any other activity in connection with, the project. A's role is 
merely to purchase goods for Y and arrange for their delivery to Y.
    A is not purchasing goods for its own use, because A is acting as a 
procurement agent for Y. A, therefore, cannot make boycott selections of 
suppliers of such goods.
    (xi) A, a U.S. company which is a bona fide resident of boycotting 
country Y, imports specifically identifiable goods into Y for exhibit by 
A at a trade fair in Y. In selecting goods for exhibit, A excludes items 
made by blacklisted firms.
    A's import of goods for its exhibit at a trade fair constitutes an 
import for A's own use. However, A may not sell in Y those goods it 
imported for exhibit.

                    For Use Within Boycotting Country

    A is a bona fide resident of boycotting countries Y and Z. In 
compliance with Y's boycott laws, A chooses specifically identifiable 
goods for its oil drilling operations in Y and Z by excluding 
blacklisted suppliers. The goods are first imported into Y. Those 
purchased for A's use in Z are then transshipped to Z.
    In selecting those goods for importation into Y, A is making an 
import selection for its own use, even though A may use some of the 
imported goods in Z. Further, the subsequent shipment from Y to Z of 
those goods purchased for use in Z is an import into Z for A's own use.


<R05>
Sec. 760.4  Evasion.

    (a) No United States person may engage in any transaction or take 
any other action, either independently or through any other person, with 
intent to evade the provisions of this part. Nor may any United States 
person assist another United States person to violate or evade the 
provisions of this part.
    (b) The exceptions set forth in Sec. 760.3(a) through (g) of this 
part do not permit activities or agreements (express or implied by a 
course of conduct, including a pattern of responses) which are otherwise 
prohibited by this part and which are not within the intent of such 
exceptions. However, activities within the coverage and intent of the 
exceptions set forth in this part do not constitute evasion regardless 
of how often such exceptions are utilized.
    (c) Use of any artifice, device or scheme which is intended to place 
a person at a commercial disadvantage or impose on him special burdens 
because he is blacklisted or otherwise restricted for boycott reasons 
from having a business relationship with or in a boycotting country will 
be regarded as evasion for purposes of this part.
    (d) Unless permitted under one of the exceptions, use of risk of 
loss provisions that expressly impose a financial risk on another 
because of the import laws of a boycotting country may constitute 
evasion. If they are introduced after January 21, 1978, their use will 
be presumed to constitute evasion. This presumption may be rebutted by a 
showing that such a provision is in customary usage without distinction 
between boycotting and non-boycotting countries and that there is a 
legitimate non-boycott reason for its use. On the other hand, use of 
such a provision by a United States person subsequent to January 21, 
1978 is presumed not to constitute evasion if the provision had been 
customarily used by that person prior to January 21, 1978.
    (e) Use of dummy corporations or other devices to mask prohibited 
activity will also be regarded as evasion. Similarly, it is evasion 
under this part to divert specific boycotting country orders from a 
United States parent to a foreign subsidiary for purposes of complying 
with prohibited boycott requirements. However, alteration of a person's 
structure or method of doing business will not constitute evasion so 
long as the alteration is based on legitimate business considerations 
and is not undertaken solely to avoid the application of the 
prohibitions of this part. The facts and circumstances of an arrangement 
or transaction will be carefully scrutinized to see whether appearances 
conform to reality.

                                Examples

    The following examples are intended to give guidance to persons in 
determining circumstances in which this section will apply. They are 
illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. insurance company, receives a request from boycotting 
country Y asking whether it does business in boycotted country X. 
Because furnishing such information

[[Page 391]]

is prohibited, A declines to answer and as a result is placed on Y's 
blacklist. The following year, A's annual report contains new 
information about A's worldwide operations, including a list of all 
countries in which A does business. A then mails a copy of its annual 
report, which has never before contained such information, to officials 
of the government of country Y.
    Absent some business justification unrelated to the boycott for 
changing the annual report in this fashion, A's action constitutes 
evasion of this part.
    (ii) A, a U.S. construction firm resident in boycotting country Y, 
orders lumber from U.S. company B. A unilaterally selects B in part 
because U.S. lumber producer C is blacklisted by Y and C's products are 
therefore not importable. In placing its order with B, A requests that B 
stamp its name or logo on the lumber so that A ``can be certain that it 
is, in fact, receiving B's products.'' B does not normally so stamp its 
lumber, and A's purpose in making the request is to appear to fit within 
the unilateral selection exception of this part.
    Absent additional facts justifying A's action, A's action 
constitutes evasion of this part.
    (iii) A, a U.S. company, has been selling sewing machines to 
boycotting country Y for a number of years and routinely supplying 
negative certificates of origin. A is aware that the furnishing of 
negative certificates of origin will be prohibited after June 21, 1978 
and, therefore, arranges to have all future shipments run through a 
foreign corporation in a third country which will affix the necessary 
certification before forwarding the machines on to Y.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a device 
to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    (iv) A, a U.S. company, has been selling hand calculators to 
boycotting country Y for a number of years and routinely supplies 
negative certificates of origin. A is aware that the furnishing of such 
negative certificates will be prohibited after June 21, 1978. A 
thereupon ceases all direct sales to Y, and instead arranges to make all 
future sales to distributor B in a third country. A knows B will step in 
and make the sales to Y which A would otherwise have made directly. B 
will make the necessary negative certifications. A's warranty, which it 
will continue to honor, runs to the purchaser in Y.
    A's action constitutes evasion, because the diverting of orders to B 
is a device to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    (v) A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a long-term contract with 
boycotting country Y to meet all Y's medical supply needs. Y informs A 
that before such a contract can be concluded, A must complete Y's 
boycott questionnaire. A knows that it is prohibited from answering the 
questionnaire so it arranges for a local agent in Y to supply the 
necessary information.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a device 
to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    (vi) A, a U.S. contractor which has not previously dealt with 
boycotting country Y, is awarded a construction contract by Y. Because 
it is customary in the construction industry for a contractor to 
establish an on-site facility for the duration of the project, A 
establishes such an office, which satisfies the requirements for bona 
fide residency. Thereafter, A's office in Y takes a number of actions 
permitted under the compliance with local law exception.
    A's actions do not constitute evasion, because A's facility in Y was 
established for legitimate business reasons.
    (vii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is 
located in non-boycotting country M. A and B both make machine tools for 
sale in their respective marketing regions. B's marketing region 
includes boycotting country Y. After assessing the requirements of this 
part, B decides that it can no longer make machines for sale in Y. 
Instead, A decides to expand its facilities in M in order to service the 
Y market.
    The actions of A and B do not constitute evasion, because there is a 
legitimate business reason for their actions. It is irrelevant that the 
effect may be to place sales which would otherwise have been subject to 
this part beyond the reach of this part.
    (viii) A, a U.S. manufacturer, from time to time receives purchase 
orders from boycotting country Y which A fills from its plant in the 
United States. A knows that it is about to receive an order from Y which 
contains a request for a certification which A is prohibited from 
furnishing under this part. In order to permit the certification to be 
made, A diverts the purchase order to its foreign subsidiary.
    A's diversion of the purchase order constitutes evasion of this 
part, because it is a device to mask prohibited activity carried out on 
A's behalf.
    (ix) A, a U.S. company, is engaged in assembling drilling rigs for 
shipment to boycotting country Y. Because of potential difficulties in 
securing entry into Y of materials supplied by blacklisted firms, A 
insists that blacklisted firms take a 15 percent discount on all 
materials which they supply to A. As a result, no blacklisted firms are 
willing to transact with A.
    A's insistence on the discount for materials supplied by blacklisted 
firms constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a device or scheme 
which is intended to place a special burden on blacklisted firms because 
of Y's boycott.
    (x) Same as (ix), except that shortly after the effective date of 
this part, A insists that its suppliers sign contracts which provide

[[Page 392]]

that even after title passes from the supplier to A, the supplier will 
bear the risk of loss and indemnify A if goods which the supplier has 
furnished are denied entry into Y for boycott reasons.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a device 
or scheme which is intended to place a special burden on blacklisted 
persons because of Y's boycott.
    (xi) Same as (x), except that A customarily insisted on such an 
arrangement with its supplier prior to the effective date of this part.
    A's action is presumed not to constitute evasion, because use of 
this contractual arrangement was customary for A prior to the effective 
date of this part.
    (xii) A, a U.S. company, has a contract to supply automobile sub-
assembly units to boycotting country Y. Shortly after the effective date 
of this part, A insists that its suppliers sign contracts which provide 
that even after title passes to A, the supplier will bear the risk of 
loss and indemnify A if goods which the supplier has furnished are 
denied entry into boycotting country Y for whatever reason.
    A's insistence on this arrangement is presumed to constitute 
evasion, because it is a device which is intended to place a special 
burden on blacklisted firms because of Y's boycott. The presumption may 
be rebutted by competent evidence showing that use of such an 
arrangement is customary without regard to the boycotting or non-
boycotting character of the country to which it relates and that there 
is a legitimate non-boycott business reason for its use.
    (xiii) Same as (vii), except that A requires that all suppliers make 
in-country delivery.
    A's action does not constitute evasion, because it is an ordinary 
commercial practice to require in-country delivery of goods.
    (xiv) Same as (xii), except that A requires that title remain with 
the supplier until delivery in Y has been made.
    A's action does not constitute evasion, because it is ordinary 
commercial practice to require that title remain with the supplier until 
delivery has been made. This example is distinguishable from example 
(xii), because in example (xii) A had insisted on an extraordinary 
arrangement designed to require that the risk of loss remain with the 
supplier even after title had passed to A.
    (xv) U.S. bank A is contacted by U.S. company B to finance B's 
transaction with boycotting country Y. Payment will be effected through 
a letter of credit in favor of B at its U.S. address. A knows that the 
letter of credit will contain restrictive boycott conditions which would 
bar its implementation by A if the beneficiary were a U.S. person. A 
suggests to B that the beneficiary should be changed to C, a shell 
corporation in non-boycotting country M. The beneficiary is changed 
accordingly.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because the arrangement 
is a device to mask prohibited activity on A's part.
    (xvi) Same as (xv), except that U.S. company B, the beneficiary of 
the letter of credit, arranges to change the beneficiary to B's foreign 
subsidiary so that A can implement the letter of credit. A knows that 
this has been done.
    A's implementation of the letter of credit in the face of its 
knowledge of B's action constitutes evasion of this part, because its 
action is part of a device to mask prohibited activity on A's part.
    (xvii) U.S. bank A, located in the United States, is contacted by 
foreign company B to finance B's transaction with boycotting country Y. 
B is a controlled subsidiary of a U.S. company. The transaction which is 
to be financed with a letter of credit payable to B at its foreign 
address, requires B to certify that none of its board members are of a 
particular religious faith. Since B cannot legally furnish the 
certificate, it asks A to convey the necessary information to Y through 
A's bank branch in Y. Such information would be furnished wholly outside 
the letter of credit transaction.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is 
undertaken to assist B's violation of this part.
    (xviii) U.S. bank A is asked by foreign corporation B to implement a 
letter of credit in favor of B so that B might perform under its long-
term contract with boycotting country Y. Under the terms of the letter 
of credit, B is required to certify that none of its suppliers is 
blacklisted. A knows that it cannot implement a letter of credit with 
this condition, so it tells B to negotiate the elimination of this 
requirement from the letter of credit and instead supply the 
certification to Y directly.
    A's suggestion to B that it provide the negative certification to Y 
directly constitutes evasion of this part, because A is taking an action 
through another person to mask prohibited activity on A's part.

Sec. 760.5  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Scope of reporting requirements. (1) A United States person who 
receives a request to take any action which has the effect of furthering 
or supporting a restrictive trade practice or boycott fostered or 
imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the United 
States or against any United States person must report such request to 
the Department of Commerce in accordance with the requirements of this 
section. Such a request may be either written or oral and may include a 
request to furnish information or enter into or implement an agreement. 
It

[[Page 393]]

may also include a solicitation, directive, legend or instruction that 
asks for information or that asks that a United States person take or 
refrain from taking a particular action. Such a request shall be 
reported regardless of whether the action requested is prohibited or 
permissible under this part, except as otherwise provided by this 
section.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a request received by a United 
States person is reportable if he knows or has reason to know that the 
purpose of the request is to enforce, implement, or otherwise further, 
support, or secure compliance with an unsanctioned foreign boycott or 
restrictive trade practice.
    (i) A request received by a United States person located in the 
United States is reportable if it is received in connection with a 
transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign commerce of the 
United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(1) through (5) and (18) 
of this part.
    (ii) A request received by a United States person located outside 
the United States (that is, a foreign subsidiary, partnership, 
affiliate, branch, office, or other permanent foreign establishment 
which is controlled in fact by any domestic concern, as determined under 
Sec. 760.1(c) of this part) is reportable if it is received in 
connection with a transaction or activity in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States, as determined under Sec. 760.1(d)(6) 
through (17) and (19) of this part.
    (iii) A request such as a boycott questionnaire, unrelated to a 
particular transaction or activity, received by any United States person 
is reportable when such person has or anticipates a business 
relationship with or in a boycotting country involving the sale, 
purchase or transfer of goods or services (including information) in the 
interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under 
Sec. 760.1(d) of this part.
    (3) These reporting requirements apply to all United States persons. 
They apply whether the United States person receiving the request is an 
exporter, bank or other financial institution, insurer, freight 
forwarder, manufacturer, or any other United States person subject to 
this part.
    (4) The acquisition of information about a boycotting country's 
boycott requirements through the receipt or review of books, pamphlets, 
legal texts, exporters' guidebooks and other similar publications does 
not constitute receipt of a reportable request for purposes of this 
section. In addition, a United States person who receives an unsolicited 
invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott request has 
not received a reportable request for purposes of this section where he 
does not respond to the invitation to bid or other proposal.
    (5) Because of the use of certain terms for boycott and non-boycott 
purposes; because of Congressional mandates to provide clear and precise 
guidelines in areas of inherent uncertainty; and because of the 
Department's commitment to minimize paperwork and reduce the cost of 
reporting where it will not impair the Department's ability to continue 
to monitor foreign boycotts, the following specific requests are not 
reportable:
    (i) A request to refrain from shipping goods on a carrier which 
flies the flag of a particular country or which is owned, chartered, 
leased or operated by a particular country or by nationals or residents 
of a particular country, or a request to certify to that effect.
    (ii) A request to ship goods via a prescribed route, or a request to 
refrain from shipping goods via a proscribed route, or a request to 
certify to either effect.
    (iii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification 
regarding the country of origin of goods.
    (iv) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification 
regarding the name of the supplier or manufacturer of the goods shipped 
or the name of the provider of services.
    (v) A request to comply with the laws of another country except 
where the request expressly requires compliance with that country's 
boycott laws.
    (vi) A request to an individual to supply information about himself 
or a member of his family for immigration, passport, visa, or employment 
purposes.

[[Page 394]]

    (vii) A request to supply an affirmative statement or certification 
indicating the destination of exports or confirming or otherwise 
indicating that such cargo will be unloaded or discharged at a 
particular destination.
    (viii) A request to supply a certificate by the owner, master, 
charterer, or any employee thereof, that a vessel, aircraft, truck or 
any other mode of transportation is eligible, otherwise eligible, 
permitted, or allowed to enter, or not restricted from entering, a 
particular port, country, or group of countries pursuant to the laws, 
rules, or regulations of that port, country, or group of countries.
    (ix) A request to supply a certificate from an insurance company 
stating that the insurance company has a duly authorized agent or 
representative within a boycotting country and/or the name and address 
of such agent.
    (x) A request to comply with a term or condition of a transaction 
that provides that the vendor bear the risk of loss and indemnify the 
purchaser if the vendor's goods are denied entry into a country for any 
reason (``risk of loss clause'') if such clause was in use by the 
purchaser prior to January 18, 1978.
    (6) No United States person may engage in any transaction or take 
any other action, either independently or through any other person, with 
intent to evade the provisions of this part.
    (7) From time to time the Department will survey domestic concerns 
for purposes of determining the worldwide scope of boycott requests 
received by their controlled foreign subsidiaries and affiliates with 
respect to their activities outside United States commerce. This 
pertains to requests which would be reportable under this section but 
for the fact that the activities to which the requests relate are 
outside United States commerce. The information requested will include 
the number and nature of non-reportable boycott requests received, the 
action(s) requested, the actions(s) taken in response and the countries 
in which the requests originate. The results of such surveys, including 
the names of those surveyed, will be made public.
    (b) Manner of reporting. (1) Each reportable request must be 
reported. However, if more than one document (such as an invitation to 
bid, purchase order, or letter of credit) containing the same boycott 
request is received as part of the same transaction, only the first such 
request need be reported. Individual shipments against the same purchase 
order or letter of credit are to be treated as part of the same 
transaction. Each different boycott request associated with a given 
transaction must be reported, regardless of how or when the request is 
received.
    (2) Each United States person actually receiving a reportable 
request must report that request. However, such person may designate 
someone else to report on his behalf. For example, a United States 
company, if authorized, may report on behalf of its controlled foreign 
subsidiary or affiliates; a freight forwarder, if authorized, may report 
on behalf of the exporter; and a bank, if authorized, may report on 
behalf of the beneficiary of a letter of credit. If a person designated 
to report a request received by another receives an identical request 
directed to him in connection with the same transaction, he may file one 
report on behalf of himself and the other person.
    (3) Where a person is designated to report on behalf of another, the 
person receiving the request remains liable for any failure to report or 
for any representations made on his behalf. Further, anyone reporting on 
behalf of another is not relieved of his own responsibility for 
reporting any boycott request which he receives, even if it is an 
identical request in connection with the same transaction.
    (4) Reports must be submitted in duplicate to: Report Processing 
Staff, Office of Antiboycott Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Room 6099C, Washington, D.C. 20230. Each submission must be made in 
accordance with the following requirements:
    (i) Where the person receiving the request is a United States person 
located in the United States, each report of requests received through 
June 30, 1979, must be postmarked by the last day of the month following 
the month in which the request was received. Thereafter, each submission 
must be postmarked by the last day of the month following the calendar 
quarter in which the request was received (e.g., April 30

[[Page 395]]

for the quarter consisting of January, February, and March).
    (ii) Where the person receiving the request is a United States 
person located outside the United States, each report of requests 
received through June 30, 1979, must be postmarked by the last day of 
the second month following the month in which the request was received. 
Thereafter, each submission must be postmarked by the last day of the 
second month following the calendar quarter in which the request was 
received (e.g., May 31 for the quarter consisting of January, February, 
and March).
    (5) At the reporting person's option, reports may be submitted on 
either a single transaction form (Form BXA-621P, Report of Restrictive 
Trade Practice or Boycott Request Single Transaction (revised 10-89)) or 
on a multiple transaction form (Form BXA-6051P, Report of Request for 
Restrictive Trade Practice or Boycott Multiple Transactions (revised 10-
89)). Use of the multiple transaction form permits the reporting person 
to provide on one form all required information relating to as many as 
75 reportable requests received within any single reporting period.
    (6) Reports, whether submitted on the single transaction form or on 
the multiple transaction form, must contain entries for every applicable 
item on the form, including whether the reporting person intends to take 
or has taken the action requested. If the reporting person has not 
decided what action he will take by the time the report is required to 
be filed, he must later report the action he decides to take within 10 
business days after deciding. In addition, anyone filing a report on 
behalf of another must so indicate and identify that other person.
    (7) Each report of a boycott request must be accompanied by two 
copies of the relevant page(s) of any document(s) in which the request 
appears. Reports may also be accompanied by any additional information 
relating to the request as the reporting person desires to provide 
concerning his response to the request.
    (8) Records containing information relating to a reportable boycott 
request, including a copy of any document(s) in which the request 
appears, must be maintained by the recipient for a five-year period 
after receipt of the request. The Department may require that these 
materials be submitted to it or that it have access to them at any time 
within that period. (See part 762 of the EAR for additional 
recordkeeping requirements.)
    (c) Disclosure of information. (1) Reports of requests received on 
or after October 7, 1976, as well as any accompanying documents filed 
with the reports, have been and will continue to be made available for 
public inspection and copying, except for certain proprietary 
information. With respect to reports of requests received on or after 
August 1, 1978, if the person making the report certifies that a United 
States person to whom the report relates would be placed at a 
competitive disadvantage because of the disclosure of information 
regarding the quantity, description, or value of any articles, 
materials, and supplies, including related technical data and other 
information, whether contained in a report or in any accompanying 
document(s), such information will not be publicly disclosed except upon 
failure by the reporting entity to edit the public inspection copy of 
the accompanying document(s) as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that the disclosure 
would not place the United States person involved at a competitive 
disadvantage or that it would be contrary to the national interest to 
withhold the information. In the event the Secretary of Commerce 
considers making such a determination concerning competitive 
disadvantage, appropriate notice and an opportunity for comment will be 
given before any such proprietary information is publicly disclosed. In 
no event will requests of reporting persons to withhold any information 
contained in the report other than that specified in this paragraph be 
honored.
    (2) Because a copy of any document(s) accompanying the report will 
be made available for public inspection and copying, one copy must be 
submitted intact and another copy must be edited by the reporting entity 
to delete the same information which it certified

[[Page 396]]

in the report would place a United States person at a competitive 
disadvantage if disclosed. In addition, the reporting entity may delete 
from this copy information that is considered confidential and that is 
not required to be contained in the report (e.g., information related to 
foreign consignee). This copy should be conspicuously marked with the 
legend ``Public Inspection Copy.'' With respect to documents 
accompanying reports received by the Department on or after July 1, 
1979, the public inspection copy will be made available as submitted 
whether or not it has been appropriately edited by the reporting entity 
as provided by this paragraph.
    (3) Reports and accompanying documents which are available to the 
public for inspection and copying are located in the BXA Freedom of 
Information Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of 
Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20230. Requests to inspect such documents should be addressed to that 
facility.
    (4) The Secretary of Commerce will periodically transmit summaries 
of the information contained in the reports to the Secretary of State 
for such action as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Commerce, may deem appropriate for carrying out the 
policies in section 8(b)(2) of the Export Administration Act of 1979.

                                Examples

    The following examples are intended to give guidance in determining 
what is reportable. They are illustrative, not comprehensive.
    (i) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycotting country 
Y and is asked by Y to certify that it is not blacklisted by Y's boycott 
office.
    The request to A is reportable, because it is a request to A to 
comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (ii) A, a U.S. manufacturing company, receives an order for tractors 
from boycotting country Y. Y's order specifies that the tires on the 
tractors be made by B, another U.S. company. A believes Y has specified 
B as the tire supplier because otherwise A would have used tires made by 
C, a blacklisted company, and Y will not take shipment of tractors 
containing tires made by blacklisted companies.
    A must report Y's request for tires made by B, because A has reason 
to know that B was chosen for boycott reasons.
    (iii) Same as (ii), except A knows that Y's request has nothing to 
do with the boycott but simply reflects Y's preference for tires made by 
B.
    Y's request is not reportable, because it is unrelated to Y's 
boycott.
    (iv) Same as (ii), except A neither knows nor has reason to know why 
Y has chosen B.
    Y's request is not reportable, because A neither knows nor has 
reason to know that Y's request is based on Y's boycott.
    (v) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a 
resident of boycotting country Y. A is a general contractor. After being 
supplied by A with a list of competent subcontractors, A's customer 
instructs A to use subcontractor C on the project. A believes that C was 
chosen because, among other things, the other listed subcontractors are 
blacklisted.
    The instruction to A by its customer that C be used on the project 
is reportable, because it is a request to comply with Y's boycott 
requirements.
    (vi) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is 
located in non-boycotting country P. A receives an order for washing 
machines from boycotting country Y. Y instructs A that a negative 
certificate of origin must accompany the shipment. The washing machines 
are made wholly in P, without U.S. components.
    Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate of origin is 
not reportable, because the transaction to which it relates is not in 
U.S. commerce.
    (vii) Same as (vi), except that A obtains components from the United 
States for the purpose of filling the order from Y. Y's instruction to A 
regarding the negative certificate of origin is reportable, because the 
transaction to which it relates is in U.S. commerce.
    (viii) A, a U.S. construction company, receives in the mail an 
unsolicited invitation to bid on a construction project in boycotting 
country Y. The invitation to bid requires those who respond to certify 
that they do not have any plants or branch offices in boycotted country 
X. A does not respond.
    A's receipt of the unsolicited invitation to bid is not reportable, 
because the request does not relate to any present or anticipated 
business of A with or in Y.
    (ix) Same as (viii), except that A receives a boycott questionnaire 
from a central boycott office. A does not do business in any of the 
boycotting countries involved, and does not anticipate doing any 
business in those countries. A does not respond.
    A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is not reportable, because 
it does not relate to any present or anticipated business by A with or 
in a boycotting country.

[[Page 397]]

    (x) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is seeking markets in which to expand 
its exports. A sends a representative to boycotting country Y to explore 
Y's potential as a market for A's products. A's representative discusses 
its products but does not enter into any contracts on that trip. A does, 
however, hope that sales will materialize in the future. Subsequently, A 
receives a boycott questionnaire from Y.
    A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, because the 
request relates to A's anticipated business with or in a boycotting 
country. For purposes of determining whether a report is required, it 
makes no difference whether A responds to the questionnaire, and it 
makes no difference that actual sales contracts are not in existence or 
do not materialize.
    (xi) Same as (x), except that A's representative enters into a 
contract to sell A's products to a buyer in boycotting country Y. 
Subsequently, A receives a boycott questionnaire from Y.
    A's receipt of the boycott questionnaire is reportable, because it 
relates to A's present business with or in a boycotting country. For 
purposes of determining whether a report is required, it makes no 
difference whether A responds to the questionnaire.
    (xii) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, purchases an exporter's guidebook 
which includes the import requirements of boycotting country Y. The 
guidebook contains descriptions of actions which U.S. exporters must 
take in order to make delivery of goods to Y.
    A's acquisition of the guidebook is not reportable, because he has 
not received a request from anyone.
    (xiii) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for the shipment of 
goods to boycotting country Y at the request of B, a U.S. exporter. B 
asks A to assume responsibility to assure that the documentation 
accompanying the shipment is in compliance with Y's import requirements. 
A examines an exporters' guidebook, determines that Y's import 
regulations require a certification that the insurer of the goods is not 
blacklisted and asks U.S. insurer C for such a certification.
    B's request to A is reportable by A, because it constitutes a 
request to comply with Y's boycott as of the time A takes action to 
comply with Y's boycott requirements in response to the request. A's 
request to C is reportable by C.
    (xiv) A, a U.S. freight forwarder, is arranging for the shipment of 
U.S. goods to boycotting country Y. The manufacturer supplies A with all 
the necessary documentation to accompany the shipment. Among the 
documents supplied by the manufacturer is his certificate that he 
himself is not blacklisted. A transmits the documentation supplied by 
the manufacturer.
    A's action in merely transmitting documents received from the 
manufacturer is not reportable, because A has received no request to 
comply with Y's boycott.
    (xv) Same as (xiv), except that A is asked by U.S. exporter B to 
assume the responsibility to assure that the necessary documentation 
accompanies the shipment whatever that documentation might be. B 
forwards to A a letter of credit which requires that a negative 
certificate of origin accompany the bill of lading. A supplies a 
positive certificate of origin.
    Both A and B must report receipt of the letter of credit, because it 
contains a request to both of them to comply with Y's boycott.
    (xvi) Same as (xiv), except that the manufacturer fails to supply a 
required negative certificate of origin, and A is subsequently asked by 
a consular official of Y to see to it that the certificate is supplied. 
A supplies a positive certificate of origin.
    The consular official's request to A is reportable by A, because A 
was asked to comply with Y's boycott requirements by supplying the 
negative certificate of origin.
    (xvii) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is shipping goods to boycotting 
country Y. Arrangements have been made for freight forwarder B to handle 
the shipment and secure all necessary shipping certifications. B notes 
that the letter of credit requires that the manufacturer supply a 
negative certificate of origin and B asks A to do so. A supplies a 
positive certificate of origin.
    B's request to A is reportable by A, because A is asked to comply 
with Y's boycott requirements by providing the negative certificate.
    (xviii) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is a 
resident of boycotting country Y. A is engaged in oil exploration and 
drilling operations in Y. In placing orders for drilling equipment to be 
shipped from the United States, A, in compliance with Y's laws, selects 
only those suppliers who are not blacklisted.
    A's action in choosing non-blacklisted suppliers is not reportable, 
because A has not received a request to comply with Y's boycott in 
making these selections.
    (xix) A, a controlled foreign subsidiary of U.S. company B, is 
seeking permission to do business in boycotting country Y. Before being 
granted such permission, A is asked to sign an agreement to comply with 
Y's boycott laws.
    The request to A is reportable, because it is a request that 
expressly requires compliance with Y's boycott law and is received in 
connection with A's anticipated business in Y.
    (xx) A, a U.S. bank, is asked by a firm in boycotting country Y to 
confirm a letter of credit in favor of B, a U.S. company. The letter of 
credit calls for a certificate from B that the goods to be supplied are 
not produced by a firm blacklisted by Y. A informs

[[Page 398]]

B of the letter of credit, including its certification condition, and 
sends B a copy.
    B must report the certification request contained in the letter of 
credit, and A must report the request to confirm the letter of credit 
containing the boycott condition, because both are being asked to comply 
with Y's boycott.
    (xxi) Same as (xx), except that the letter of credit calls for a 
certificate from the beneficiary that the goods will not be shipped on a 
vessel that will call at a port in boycotted country X before making 
delivery in Y.
    The request is not reportable, because it is a request of a type 
deemed by this section to be in common use for non-boycott purposes.
    (xxii) A, a U.S. company, receives a letter of credit from 
boycotting country Y stating that on no condition may a bank blacklisted 
by Y be permitted to negotiate the credit.
    A's receipt of the letter of credit is reportable, because it 
contains a request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxiii) A, a U.S. bank, receives a demand draft from B, a U.S. 
company, in connection with B's shipment of goods to boycotting country 
Y. The draft contains a directive that it is valid in all countries 
except boycotted country X.
    A's receipt of the demand draft is reportable, because it contains a 
request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxiv) A, a U.S. exporter, receives an order from boycotting country 
Y. On the order is a legend that A's goods, invoices, and packaging must 
not bear a six-pointed star or other symbol of boycotted country X.
    A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains a 
request to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxv) Same as (xxiv), except the order contains a statement that 
goods exported must not represent part of war reparations to boycotted 
country X.
    A's receipt of the order is reportable, because it contains a 
request to A to comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxvi) A, a U.S. contractor, is negotiating with boycotting country 
Y to build a school in Y. During the course of the negotiations, Y 
suggests that one of the terms of the construction contract be that A 
agree not to import materials produced in boycotted country X. It is A's 
company policy not to agree to such a contractual clause, and A suggests 
that instead it agree that all of the necessary materials will be 
obtained from U.S. suppliers. Y agrees to A's suggestion and a contract 
is executed.
    A has received a reportable request, but, for purposes of reporting, 
the request is deemed to be received when the contract is executed.
    (xxvii) Same as (xxvi), except Y does not accept A's suggested 
alternative clause and negotiations break off.
    A's receipt of Y's request is reportable. For purposes of reporting, 
it makes no difference that A was not successful in the negotiations. 
The request is deemed to be received at the time the negotiations break 
off.
    (xxviii) A, a U.S. insurance company, is insuring the shipment of 
drilling equipment to boycotting country Y. The transaction is being 
financed by a letter of credit which requires that A certify that it is 
not blacklisted by Y. Freight forwarder B asks A to supply the 
certification in order to satisfy the requirements of the letter of 
credit.
    The request to A is reportable by A, because it is a request to 
comply with Y's boycott requirements.
    (xxix) A, a U.S. manufacturer, is engaged from time-to-time in 
supplying drilling rigs to company B in boycotting country Y. B insists 
that its suppliers sign contracts which provide that, even after title 
passes from the supplier to B, the supplier will bear the risk of loss 
and indemnify B if goods which the supplier has furnished are denied 
entry into Y for whatever reason. A knows or has reason to know that 
this contractual provision is required by B because of Y's boycott, and 
that B has been using the provision since 1977. A receives an order from 
B which contains such a clause.
    B's request is not reportable by A, because the request is deemed to 
be not reportable by these regulations if the provision was in use by B 
prior to the effective date of the regulations, January 18, 1978.
    (xxx) Same as (xxix), except that A does not know when B began using 
the provision.
    Unless A receives information from B that B introduced the term 
prior to the effective date of the regulations, January 18, 1978, A must 
report receipt of the request.
    (xxxi) A, a U.S. citizen, is a shipping clerk for B, a U.S. 
manufacturing company. In the course of his employment, A receives an 
order for goods from boycotting country Y. The order specifies that none 
of the components of the goods is to be furnished by blacklisted firms.
    B must report the request received by its employee, A, acting in the 
scope of his employment. Although A is a U.S. person, such an individual 
does not have a separate obligation to report requests received by him 
in his capacity as an employee of B.
    (xxxii) U.S. exporter A is negotiating a transaction with boycotting 
country Y. A knows that at the conclusion of the negotiations he will be 
asked by Y to supply certain boycott-related information and that such a 
request is reportable. In an effort to forestall the request and thereby 
avoid having to file a report, A supplies the information in advance.
    A is deemed to have received a reportable request.

[[Page 399]]

    (xxxiii) A, a controlled foreign affiliate of U.S. company B, 
receives an order for computers from boycotting country Y and obtains 
components from the United States for the purpose of filling the order. 
Y instructs A that a negative certificate of origin must accompany the 
shipment.
    Y's instruction to A regarding the negative certificate of origin is 
reportable by A. Moreover, A may designate B or any other person to 
report on its behalf. However, A remains liable for any failure to 
report or for any representations made on its behalf.
    (xxxiv) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting country Y, 
receives a request from the customer in Y to state on the bill of lading 
that the vessel is allowed to enter Y's ports. The request further 
states that a certificate from the owner or master of the vessel to that 
effect is acceptable.
    The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportable if 
it was received after January 21, 1978, because it is a request of a 
type deemed to be not reportable by these regulations. (A may not make 
such a statement on the bill of lading himself, if he knows or has 
reason to know it is requested for a boycott purpose.
    (xxxv) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting country Y, 
receives a request from the customer in Y to furnish a certificate from 
the owner of the vessel that the vessel is permitted to call at Y's 
ports.
    The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportable if 
it was received after the effective date of these rules, because it is a 
request of a type deemed to be not reportable by these regulations.
    (xxxvi) U.S. exporter A, in shipping goods to boycotting country Y, 
receives a request from the customer in Y to furnish a certificate from 
the insurance company indicating that the company has a duly authorized 
representative in country Y and giving the name of that representative.
    The request A received from his customer in Y is not reportable if 
it was received after the effective date of these rules, because it is a 
request of a type deemed to be not reportable by these regulations.

              Supplement No. 1 to Part 760--Interpretations

    It has come to the Department's attention that some U.S. persons are 
being or may be asked to comply with new boycotting country requirements 
with respect to shipping and insurance certifications and certificates 
of origin. It has also come to the Department's attention that some U.S. 
persons are being or may be asked to agree to new contractual provisions 
in connection with certain foreign government or foreign government 
agency contracts. In order to maximize its guidance with respect to 
section 8 of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 
U.S.C. app. 2407) and part 760 of the EAR, the Department hereby sets 
forth its views on these certifications and contractual 
clauses.<SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\  The Department originally issued this interpretation pursuant 
to the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1979 (Public Law 95-52) 
and the regulations on restrictive trade practices and boycotts (15 CFR 
part 369) published on January 25, 1978 (43 FR 3508) and contained in 
the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1, 1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            I. Certifications

    Sec. 760.2(d) of this part prohibits a U.S. person from furnishing 
or knowingly agreeing to furnish:
    ``Information concerning his or any other person's past, present or 
proposed business relationships:
    (i) With or in a boycotted country;
    (ii) With any business concern organized under the laws of a 
boycotted country;
    (iii) With any national or resident of a boycotted country; or
    (iv) With any other person who is known or believed to be restricted 
from having any business relationship with or in a boycotting country.''
    This prohibition, like all others under part 760, applies only with 
respect to a U.S. person's activities in the interstate or foreign 
commerce of the United States and only when such activities are 
undertaken with intent to comply with, further, or support an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott. (Sec. 760.2(d)(5) of this part.)
    This prohibition does not apply to the furnishing of normal business 
information in a commercial context. ( Sec. 760.2(d)(3) of this part). 
Normal business information furnished in a commercial context does not 
cease to be such simply because the party soliciting the information may 
be a boycotting country or a national or resident thereof. If the 
information is of a type which is generally sought for a legitimate 
business purpose (such as determining financial fitness, technical 
competence, or professional experience), the information may be 
furnished even if the information could be used, or without the 
knowledge of the person supplying the information is intended to be 
used, for boycott purposes. (Sec. 760.2(d)(4) of this part).
    The new certification requirements and the Department's 
interpretation of the applicability of part 760 thereto are as follows:
    A. Certificate of origin. A certificate of origin is to be issued by 
the supplier or exporting company and authenticated by the exporting 
country, attesting that the goods exported to the boycotting country are 
of purely indigenous origin, and stating the name of the factory or the 
manufacturing company. To the extent that the goods as described on

[[Page 400]]

the certificate of origin are not solely and exclusively products of 
their country of origin indicated thereon, a declaration must be 
appended to the certificate of origin giving the name of the supplier/
manufacturer and declaring:
    ``The undersigned, ____________, does hereby declare on behalf of 
the above-named supplier/manufacturer, that certain parts or components 
of the goods described in the attached certificate of origin are the 
products of such country or countries, other than the country named 
therein as specifically indicated hereunder:

    Country of Origin and Percentage of Value of Parts or Components 
                       Relative to Total Shipment

 1._____________________________________________________________________
 2._____________________________________________________________________
 3._____________________________________________________________________
 Dated:_________________________________________________________________
 Signature______________________________________________________________
    Sworn to before me, this ________ day of ____________, 19 ____. 
Notary Seal.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that furnishing a positive 
certificate of origin, such as the one set out above, falls within the 
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance with 
the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. 
See Sec. 760.3(c) of this part and examples (i) and (ii) thereunder.
    B. Shipping certificate. A certificate must be appended to the bill 
of lading stating: (1) Name of vessel; (2) Nationality of vessel; and 
(3) Owner of vessel, and declaring:
    ``The undersigned does hereby declare on behalf of the owner, 
master, or agent of the above-named vessel that said vessel is not 
registered in the boycotted country or owned by nationals or residents 
of the boycotted country and will not call at or pass through any 
boycotted country port enroute to its boycotting country destination.
    ``The undersigned further declares that said vessel is otherwise 
eligible to enter into the ports of the boycotting country in conformity 
with its laws and regulations.
    Sworn to before me, this ________ day of __________, 19 ____. Notary 
Seal.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that furnishing a certificate, such 
as the one set out above, stating: (1) The name of the vessel, (2) The 
nationality of the vessel, and (3) The owner of the vessel and further 
declaring that the vessel: (a) Is not registered in a boycotted country, 
(b) Is not owned by nationals or residents of a boycotted country, and 
(c) Will not call at or pass through a boycotted country port enroute to 
its destination in a boycotting country falls within the exception 
contained in Sec. 760.3(b) of this part for compliance with the import 
and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. See 
Sec. 760.3(b) of this part and examples (vii), (viii), and (ix) 
thereunder.
    It is also the Department's position that the owner, charterer, or 
master of a vessel may certify that the vessel is ``eligible'' or 
``otherwise eligible'' to enter into the ports of a boycotting country 
in conformity with its laws and regulations. Furnishing such a statement 
pertaining to one's own eligibility offends no prohibition under part 
760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example (xiv).
    On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declaration that a 
vessel is ``eligible'' or ``otherwise eligible'' to enter the ports of 
the boycotting country necessarily conveys the information that the 
vessel is not blacklisted or otherwise restricted from having a business 
relationship with the boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(b) of this 
part, examples (vi), (xi), and (xii). Where a person other than the 
vessel's owner, charterer, or master furnishes such a statement, that is 
tantamount to his furnishing a statement that he is not doing business 
with a blacklisted person or is doing business only with nonblacklisted 
persons. Therefore, it is the Department's position that furnishing such 
a certification (which does not reflect customary international 
commercial practice) by anyone other than the owner, charterer, or 
master of a vessel would fall within the prohibition set forth in 
Sec. 760.2(d) of this part unless it is clear from all the facts and 
circumstances that the certification is not required for a boycott 
reason. See Sec. 760.2(d)(3) and (4) of this part. However, in 
accordance with the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part 
for compliance with the import and shipping document requirements of a 
boycotting country, such a United States person may furnish such a 
certification until June 21, 1978.
    C. Insurance certificate. A certificate must be appended to the 
insurance policy stating: (1) Name of insurance company; (2) Address of 
its principal office; and (3) Country of its incorporation, and 
declaring:
    ``The undersigned, ________________, does hereby certify on behalf 
of the above-named insurance company that the said company has a duly 
qualified and appointed agent or representative in the boycotting 
country whose name and address appear below:
    Name of agent/representative and address in the boycotting country.
    Sworn to before me this ________ day of ____________, 19____. Notary 
Seal.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that furnishing the name of the 
insurance company falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) 
of this part for compliance with the import and shipping document 
requirements of a boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c)(1)(v) of

[[Page 401]]

this part and examples (v) and (x) thereunder. In addition, it is the 
Department's position that furnishing a certificate, such as the one set 
out above, stating the address of the insurance company's principal 
office and its country of incorporation offends no prohibition under 
part 760 unless the U.S. person furnishing the certificate knows or has 
reason to know that the information is sought for the purpose of 
determining that the insurance company is neither headquartered nor 
incorporated in a boycotted country. See Sec. 760.2(d)(1)(i) of this 
part.
    It is also the Department's position that the insurer, himself, may 
certify that he has a duly qualified and appointed agent or 
representative in the boycotting country and may furnish the name and 
address of his agent or representative. Furnishing such a statement 
pertaining to one's own status offends no prohibition under part 760. 
See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example (xiv).
    On the other hand, where a boycott is in force, a declaration that 
an insurer ``has a duly qualified and appointed agent or 
representative'' in the boycotting country necessarily conveys the 
information that the insurer is not blacklisted or otherwise restricted 
from having a business relationship with the boycotting country. See 
Sec. 760.3(c) of this part, example (v). Therefore, it is the 
Department's position that furnishing such a certification by anyone 
other than the insurer would fall within the prohibition set forth in 
Sec. 760.2(d) of this part unless it is clear from all the facts and 
circumstances that the certification is not required for a boycott 
reason. See Sec. 760.2(d) (3) and (4) of this part. However, in 
accordance with the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part 
for compliance with the import and shipping document requirements of a 
boycotting country, such a U.S. person may furnish such a certification 
until June 21, 1978.

                         II. Contractual Clauses

    The new contractual requirements and the Department's interpretation 
of the applicability of part 760 thereto are as follows:
    A. Contractual clause regarding import laws of boycotting country. 
``In connection with the performance of this contract the Contractor/
Supplier acknowledges that the import and customs laws and regulations 
of the boycotting country shall apply to the furnishing and shipment of 
any products or components thereof to the boycotting country. The 
Contractor/Supplier specifically acknowledges that the aforementioned 
import and customs laws and regulations of the boycotting country 
prohibit, among other things, the importation into the boycotting 
country of products or components thereof: (1) Originating in the 
boycotted country; (2) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by companies 
organized under the laws of the boycotted country; and (3) Manufactured, 
produced, or furnished by nationals or residents of the boycotted 
country.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the one 
set out in the first sentence above, that the import and customs 
requirements of a boycotting country shall apply to the performance of a 
contract does not, in and of itself, offend any prohibition under Part 
760. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) of this part and example (iii) under 
``Examples of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business.'' It is also the 
Department's position that an agreement to comply generally with the 
import and customs requirements of a boycotting country does not, in and 
of itself, offend any prohibition under part 760 of this part. See 
Sec. 760.2(a)(5) of this part and examples (iv) and (v) under ``Examples 
of Agreements To Refuse To Do Business.'' In addition, it is the 
Department's position that an agreement, such as the one set out in the 
second sentence above, to comply with the boycotting country's import 
and customs requirements prohibiting the importation of products or 
components: (1) Originating in the boycotted country; (2) Manufactured, 
produced, or furnished by companies organized under the laws of the 
boycotted country; or (3) Manufactured, produced, or furnished by 
nationals or residents of the boycotted country falls within the 
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(a) of this part for compliance with 
the import requirements of a boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(a) of 
this part and example (ii) thereunder.
    The Department notes that, after June 21, 1978, a United States 
person may not furnish a negative certification regarding the origin of 
goods or their components even though the certification is furnished in 
response to the import and shipping document requirements of the 
boycotting country. See Sec. 760.3(c) of this part and examples (i), 
(ii), and (iii) thereunder, and Sec. 760.3(a) of this part and example 
(ii) thereunder.
    B. Contractual clause regarding unilateral and specific selection. 
``The Government of the boycotting country (or the First Party), in its 
exclusive power, reserves its right to make the final unilateral and 
specific selection of any proposed carriers, insurers, suppliers of 
services to be performed within the boycotting country, or of specific 
goods to be furnished in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
this contract.''

                             Interpretation

    It is the Department's position that an agreement, such as the one 
set out above, falls within the exception contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of 
this part for compliance with unilateral selections. However, the 
Department notes that whether a U.S. person may subsequently comply or 
agree to comply with any

[[Page 402]]

particular selection depends upon whether that selection meets all the 
requirements contained in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part for compliance with 
unilateral selections. For example, the particular selection must be 
unilateral and specific, particular goods must be specifically 
identifiable as to their source or origin at the time of their entry 
into the boycotting country, and all other requirements contained in 
Sec. 760.3(d) of this part must be observed.

              Supplement No. 2 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The Department hereby sets forth its views on whether the furnishing 
of certain shipping and insurance certificates in compliance with 
boycotting country requirements violates the provisions of section 8 of 
the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2407) 
and part 760 of the EAR,<SUP>1</SUP> as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\ The Department originally issued this interpretation on April 
21, 1978 (43 FR 16969) pursuant to the Export Administration Amendments 
Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-52) and the regulations on restrictive trade 
practices and boycotts (15 CFR part 369) published on January 25, 1978 
(43 FR 3508) and contained in the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 
1, 1979.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) ``The owner, charterer or master of a vessel may certify that 
the vessel is `eligible' or `otherwise eligible' to enter into the ports 
of a boycotting country in conformity with its laws and regulations;''
    (ii) ``The insurer, himself, may certify that he has a duly 
qualified and appointed agent or representative in the boycotting 
country and may furnish the name and address of his agent or 
representative.''
    Furnishing such certifications by anyone other than:
    (i) The owner, charterer or master of a vessel, or
    (ii) The insurer would fall within the prohibition set forth in 
Sec. 760.2(d) of this part, ``unless it is clear from all the facts and 
circumstances that these certifications are not required for a boycott 
reason.'' See Sec. 760.2(d) (3) and (4) of this part.
    The Department has received from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia a 
clarification that the shipping and insurance certifications are 
required by Saudi Arabia in order to:
    (i) Demonstrate that there are no applicable restrictions under 
Saudi laws or regulations pertaining to maritime matters such as the age 
of the ship, the condition of the ship, and similar matters that would 
bar entry of the vessel into Saudi ports; and
    (ii) Facilitate dealings with insurers by Saudi Arabian importers 
whose ability to secure expeditious payments in the event of damage to 
insured goods may be adversely affected by the absence of a qualified 
agent or representative of the insurer in Saudi Arabia. In the 
Department's judgment, this clarification constitutes sufficient facts 
and circumstances to demonstrate that the certifications are not 
required by Saudi Arabia for boycott reasons.
    On the basis of this clarification, it is the Department's position 
that any United States person may furnish such shipping and insurance 
certificates required by Saudi Arabia without violating Sec. 760.2(d) of 
this part. Moreover, under these circumstances, receipt of requests for 
such shipping and insurance certificates from Saudi Arabia is not 
reportable.
    It is still the Department's position that furnishing such a 
certificate pertaining to one's own eligibility offends no prohibition 
under part 760. See Sec. 760.2(f) of this part, example (xiv). However, 
absent facts and circumstances clearly indicating that the 
certifications are required for ordinary commercial reasons as 
demonstrated by the Saudi clarification, furnishing certifications about 
the eligibility or blacklist status of any other person would fall 
within the prohibition set forth in Sec. 760.2(d) of this part, and 
receipt of requests for such certifications is reportable.
    It also remains the Department's position that where a United States 
person asks an insurer or carrier of the exporter's goods to self-
certify, such request offends no prohibition under this part. However, 
where a United States person asks anyone other than an insurer or 
carrier of the exporter's goods to self-certify, such requests will be 
considered by the Department as evidence of the requesting person's 
refusal to do business with those persons who cannot or will not furnish 
such a self-certification. For example, if an exporter-beneficiary of a 
letter of credit asks his component suppliers to self-certify, such a 
request will be considered as evidence of his refusal to do business 
with those component suppliers who cannot or will not furnish such a 
self-certification.
    The Department wishes to emphasize that notwithstanding the fact 
that self-certifications are permissible, it will closely scrutinize the 
activities of all United States persons who provide such self-
certifications, including insurers and carriers, to determine that such 
persons have not taken any prohibited actions or entered into any 
prohibited agreements in order to be able to furnish such 
certifications.

              Supplement No. 3 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Pursuant to Article 2, Annex II of the Peace Treaty between Egypt 
and Israel, Egypt's participation in the Arab economic boycott of Israel 
was formally terminated on January 25, 1980. On the basis of this 
action,

[[Page 403]]

it is the Department's position that certain requests for information, 
action or agreement which were considered boycott-related by implication 
now cannot be presumed boycott-related and thus would not be prohibited 
or reportable under the Regulations. For example, a request that an 
exporter certify that the vessel on which it is shipping its goods is 
eligible to enter Arab Republic of Egypt ports has been considered a 
boycott-related request that the exporter could not comply with because 
Egypt has a boycott in force against Israel (see 43 FR 16969, April 21, 
1978 or the 15 CFR edition revised as of January 1, 1979). Such a 
request after January 25, 1980 would not be presumed boycott-related 
because the underlying boycott requirement/basis for the certification 
has been eliminated. Similarly, a U.S. company would not be prohibited 
from complying with a request received from Egyptian government 
officials to furnish the place of birth of employees the company is 
seeking to take to Egypt, because there is no underlying boycott law or 
policy that would give rise to a presumption that the request was 
boycott-related.
    U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their face 
boycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance or 
support of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to the 
Regulations, irrespective of the country or origin. For example, 
requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'', ``Israel 
boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases or words 
indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriate 
provisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.

              Supplement No. 4 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The question has arisen how the definition of U.S. commerce in the 
antiboycott regulations (15 CFR part 760) applies to a shipment of 
foreign-made goods when U.S.-origin spare parts are included in the 
shipment. Specifically, if the shipment of foreign goods falls outside 
the definition of U.S. commerce, will the inclusion of U.S.-origin spare 
parts bring the entire transaction into U.S. commerce?
    Section 760.1(d)(12) of this part provides the general guidelines 
for determining when U.S.-origin goods shipped from a controlled in fact 
foreign subsidiary are outside U.S. commerce. The two key tests of that 
provision are that the goods were (1) acquired without reference to a 
specific order, and (2) further manufactured, incorporated or 
reprocessed into another product. Because the application of these two 
tests to spare parts does not conclusively answer the U.S. commerce 
question, the Department is presenting this clarification.
    In the cases brought to the Department's attention, an order for 
foreign-origin goods was placed with a controlled in fact foreign 
subsidiary of a United States company. The foreign goods contained 
components manufactured in the United States and in other countries, and 
the order included a request for extras of the U.S. manufactured 
components (spare parts) to allow the customer to repair the item. Both 
the foreign manufactured product and the U.S. spare parts were to be 
shipped from the general inventory of the foreign subsidiary. Since the 
spare parts, if shipped by themselves, would be in U.S. commerce as that 
term is defined in the Regulations, the question was whether including 
them with the foreign manufactured item would bring the entire shipment 
into U.S. commerce. The Department has decided that it will not and 
presents the following specific guidance.
    As used above, the term ``spare parts'' refers to parts of the 
quantities and types normally and customarily ordered with a product and 
kept on hand in the event they are needed to assure prompt repair of the 
product. Parts, components or accessories that improve or change the 
basic operations or design characteristics, for example, as to accuracy, 
capability or productivity, are not spare parts under this definition.
    Inclusion of U.S.-origin spare parts in a shipment of products which 
is otherwise outside U.S. commerce will not bring the transaction into 
U.S. commerce if the following conditions are met:
    (I) The parts included in the shipment are acquired from the United 
States by the controlled in fact foreign subsidiary without reference to 
a specific order from or transaction with a person outside the United 
States;
    (II) The parts are identical to the corresponding United States-
origin parts which have been manufactured, incorporated into or 
reprocessed into the completed product;
    (III) The parts are of the quantity and type normally and 
customarily ordered with the completed product and kept on hand by the 
firm or industry of which the firm is a part to assure prompt repair of 
the product; and
    (IV) The parts are covered by the same order as the completed 
product and are shipped with or at the same time as the original 
product.
    The Department emphasizes that unless each of the above conditions 
is met, the inclusion of United States-origin spare parts in an order 
for a foreign-manufactured or assembled product will bring the entire 
transaction into the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States 
for purposes of part 760.

              Supplement No. 5 to Part 760--Interpretation

                A. Permissible Furnishing of Information

    The information outlined below may be furnished in response to 
boycott-related requests from boycotting countries or others. This 
information is, in the view of the Department, not prohibited by the 
Regulations. Thus, a person does not have to qualify under any of the 
exceptions to be able to make the following statements. Such statements 
can be made, however, only by the person indicated and under the 
circumstances described. These statements should not be used as a point 
of departure or analogy for determining the permissibility of other 
types of statements. The Department's view that these statements are not 
contrary to the prohibitions contained in antiboycott provisions of the 
Regulations is limited to the specific statement in the specific context 
indicated.
    1. A U.S. person may always provide its own name, address, place of 
incorporation (``nationality''), and nature of business.
    2. A U.S. person may state that it is not on a blacklist, or 
restricted from doing business in a boycotting country. A company may 
not make that statement about its subsidiaries or affiliates--only about 
itself. A U.S. person may not say that there is no reason for it to be 
blacklisted. To make that statement would provide directly or by 
implication information that may not be provided. A U.S. person may 
inquire about the reasons it is blacklisted if it learns that it is on a 
blacklist (see Sec. 760.2(d) of this part example (xv)).
    3. A U.S. person may describe in detail its past dealings with 
boycotting countries; may state in which boycotting countries its 
trademarks are registered; and may specify in which boycotting countries 
it is registered or qualified to do business. In general, a U.S. person 
is free to furnish any information it wishes about the nature and extent 
of its commercial dealings with boycotting countries.
    4. A U.S. person may state that many U.S. firms or individuals have 
similar names and that it believes that it may be confused with a 
similarly named entity. A U.S. person may not state that it does or does 
not have an affiliation or relationship with such similarly named 
entity.
    5. A U.S. person may state that the information requested is a 
matter of public record in the United States. However, the person may 
not direct the inquirer to the location of that information, nor may the 
U.S. person provide or cause to be provided such information.

B. Availability of the Compliance With Local Law Exception to Establish 
                            a Foreign Branch

    Section 760.3(f) of this part, the Compliance With Local Law 
exception, permits U.S. persons, who are bona fide residents of a 
boycotting country, to take certain limited, but otherwise prohibited, 
actions, if they are required to do so in order to comply with local 
law.
    Among these actions is the furnishing of non-discriminatory 
information. Examples (iv) through (vi) under ``Examples of Bona Fide 
Residency'' indicate that a company seeking to become a bona fide 
resident within a boycotting country may take advantage of the exception 
for the limited purpose of furnishing information required by local law 
to obtain resident status. Exactly when and how this exception is 
available has been the subject of a number of inquiries. It is the 
Department's view that the following conditions must be met for a non-
resident company to be permitted to furnish otherwise prohibited 
information for the limited purpose of seeking to become a bona fide 
resident:
    1. The company must have a legitimate business reason for seeking to 
establish a branch or other resident operation in the boycotting 
country. (Removal from the blacklist does not constitute such a reason.)
    2. The local operation it seeks to establish must be similar or 
comparable in nature and operation to ones the company operates in other 
parts of the world, unless local law or custom dictates a significantly 
different form.
    3. The person who visits the boycotting country to furnish the 
information must be the official whose responsibility ordinarily 
includes the creation and registration of foreign operations (i.e., the 
chairman of the board cannot be flown in to answer boycott questions 
unless the chairman of the board is the corporate official who 
ordinarily goes into a country to handle foreign registrations).
    4. The information provided must be that which is ordinarily known 
to the person establishing the foreign branch. Obviously, at the time of 
establishment, the foreign branch will have no information of its own 
knowledge. Rather, the information should be that which the responsible 
person has of his own knowledge, or that he would have with him as 
incidental and necessary to the registration and establishment process. 
As a general rule, such information would not include such things as 
copies of agreements with boycotted country concerns or detailed 
information about the person's dealings with blacklisted concerns.
    5. It is not necessary that documents prepared in compliance with 
this exception be drafted or executed within the boycotting

[[Page 405]]

country. The restrictions on the type of information which may be 
provided and on who may provide it apply regardless of where the papers 
are prepared or signed.

              Supplement No. 6 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The antiboycott regulations prohibit knowing agreements to comply 
with certain prohibited requests and requirements of boycotting 
countries, regardless of how these terms are stated. Similarly, the 
reporting rules require that a boycott related ``solicitation, 
directive, legend or instruction that asks for information or that asks 
that a United States person take or refrain from taking a particular 
action'' be reported. Questions have frequently arisen about how 
particular requirements in the form of directive or instructions are 
viewed under the antiboycott regulations, and we believe that it will 
add clarity to the regulations to provide a written interpretation of 
how three of these terms are treated under the law. The terms in 
question appear frequently in letters of credit, but may also be found 
on purchase orders or other shipping or sale documents. They have been 
brought to the attention of the Department by numerous persons. The 
terms are, or are similar to, the following: (1) Goods of boycotted 
country origin are prohibited; (2) No six-pointed stars may be used on 
the goods, packing or cases; (3) Neither goods nor packing shall bear 
any symbols prohibited in the boycotting country.
    (a) Goods of boycotted country origin prohibited. This term is very 
common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may also appear from time-
to-time in invitations to bid, contracts, or other trade documents. It 
imposes a condition or requirement compliance with which is prohibited, 
but permitted by an exception under the Regulations (see Sec. 760.2(a) 
and Sec. 760.3(b) of this part). It is reportable by those parties to 
the letter of credit or other transaction that are required to take or 
refrain from taking some boycott related action by the request. Thus the 
bank must report the request because it is a term or condition of the 
letter of credit that it is handling, and the exporter-beneficiary must 
report the request because the exporter determines the origin of the 
goods. The freight forwarder does not have to report this request 
because the forwarder has no role or obligation in this part of the 
transaction. See Sec. 760.5, examples (xiii)-(xv) of this part.
    (b) No six-pointed stars may be used on the goods, packing or cases. 
This term appears from time-to-time on documents from a variety of 
countries. The Department has taken the position that the six-pointed 
star is a religious symbol. See Sec. 760.2(b), example (viii) of this 
part. Agreeing to this term is prohibited by the Regulations and not 
excepted because it constitutes an agreement to furnish information 
about the religion of a U.S. person. See Sec. 760.2(c) of this part. If 
a person proceeds with a transaction in which this is a condition at any 
stage of the transaction, that person has agreed to the condition in 
violation of the Regulations. It is not enough to ignore the condition. 
Exception must affirmatively be taken to this term or it must be 
stricken from the documents of the transaction. It is reportable by all 
parties to the transaction that are restricted by it. For example, 
unlike the situation described in (a) above, the freight forwarder would 
have to report this request because his role in the transaction would 
involve preparation of the packing and cases. The bank and exporter 
would both have to report, of course, if it were a term in a letter of 
credit. Each party would be obligated affirmatively to seek an amendment 
or deletion of the term.
    (c) Neither goods nor packaging shall bear any symbols prohibited in 
the boycotting country. This term appears from time-to-time in letters 
of credit and shipping documents from Saudi Arabia. In our view, it is 
neither prohibited, nor reportable because it is not boycott-related. 
There is a wide range of symbols that are prohibited in Saudi Arabia for 
a variety of reasons, many having to do with that nation's cultural and 
religious beliefs. On this basis, we do not interpret the term to be 
boycott related. See Sec. 760.2(a)(5) and Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(v) of this 
part.

              Supplement No. 7 to Part 760--Interpretation

                    Prohibited Refusal To Do Business

    When a boycotting country rejects for boycott-related reasons a 
shipment of goods sold by a United States person, the United States 
person selling the goods may return them to its inventory or may re-ship 
them to other markets (the United States person may not return them to 
the original supplier and demand restitution). The U.S. person may then 
make a non-boycott based selection of another supplier and provide the 
goods necessary to meet its obligations to the boycotting customer in 
that particular transaction without violating Sec. 760.2(a) of this 
part. If the United States person receives another order from the same 
boycotting country for similar goods, the Department has determined that 
a boycott-based refusal by a United States person to ship goods from the 
supplier whose goods were previously rejected would constitute a 
prohibited refusal to do business under Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. The 
Department will presume that filling such an order with alternative 
goods is evidence of the person's refusal to deal with the original 
supplier.
    The Department recognizes the limitations this places on future 
transactions with a

[[Page 406]]

boycotting country once a shipment of goods has been rejected. Because 
of this, the Department wishes to point out that, when faced with a 
boycotting country's refusal to permit entry of the particular goods, a 
United States person may state its obligation to abide by the 
requirements of United States law and indicate its readiness to comply 
with the unilateral and specific selection of goods by the boycotting 
country in accordance with Sec. 760.3(c) of this part. That section 
provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
    A United States person may comply or agree to comply in the normal 
course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a 
boycotting country ________ of ________ specific goods, ________ 
provided that ________ with respect to goods, the items, in the normal 
course of business, are identifiable as to their source or origin at the 
time of their entry into the boycotting country by (a) uniqueness of 
design or appearance or (b) trademark, trade name, or other 
identification normally on the items themselves, including their 
packaging.
    The United States person may also provide certain services in 
advance of the unilateral selection by the boycotting country, such as 
the compilation of lists of qualified suppliers, so long as such 
services are customary to the type of business the United States person 
is engaged in, and the services rendered are completely non-exclusionary 
in character (i.e., the list of qualified suppliers would have to 
include the supplier whose goods had previously been rejected by the 
boycotting country, if they were fully qualified). See Sec. 760.2(a)(6) 
of this part for a discussion of the requirements for the provision of 
these services.
    The Department wishes to emphasize that the unilateral selection 
exception in Sec. 760.3(d) of this part will be construed narrowly, and 
that all its requirements and conditions must be met, including the 
following:

--Discretion for the selection must be exercised by a boycotting 
country; or by a national or resident of a boycotting country;
--The selection must be stated in the affirmative specifying a 
particular supplier of goods;
--While a permissible selection may be boycott based, if the United 
States person knows or has reason to know that the purpose of the 
selection is to effect discrimination against any United States person 
on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin, the person may 
not comply under any circumstances.

    The Department cautions United States persons confronted with the 
problem or concern over the boycott-based rejection of goods shipped to 
a boycotting country that the adoption of devices such as ``risk of 
loss'' clauses, or conditions that make the supplier financially liable 
if his or her goods are rejected by the boycotting country for boycott 
reasons are presumed by the Department to be evasion of the statute and 
regulations, and as such are prohibited by Sec. 760.4 of this part, 
unless adopted prior to January 18, 1978. See Sec. 760.4(d) of this 
part.

              Supplement No. 8 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Definition of Interstate or Foreign Commerce of the United States

    When United States persons (as defined by the antiboycott 
regulations) located within the United States purchase or sell goods or 
services located outside the United States, they have engaged in an 
activity within the foreign commerce of the United States. Although the 
goods or services may never physically come within the geographic 
boundaries of the several states or territories of the United States, 
legal ownership or title is transferred from a foreign nation to the 
United States person who is located in the United States. In the case of 
a purchase, subsequent resale would also be within United States 
commerce.
    It is the Department's view that the terms ``sale'' and ``purchase'' 
as used in the regulations are not limited to those circumstances where 
the goods or services are physically transferred to the person who 
acquires title. The EAR define the activities that serve as the 
transactional basis for U.S. commerce as those involving the ``sale, 
purchase, or transfer'' of goods or services. In the Department's view, 
as used in the antiboycott regulations, ``transfer'' contemplates 
physical movement of the goods or services between the several states or 
territories and a foreign country, while ``sale'' and ``purchase'' 
relate to the movement of ownership or title.
    This interpretation applies only to those circumstances in which the 
person located within the United States buys or sells goods or services 
for its own account. Where the United States person is engaged in the 
brokerage of foreign goods, i.e., bringing foreign buyers and sellers 
together and assisting in the transfer of the goods, the sale or 
purchase itself would not ordinarily be considered to be within U.S. 
commerce. The brokerage service, however, would be a service provided 
from the United States to the parties and thus an activity within U.S. 
commerce and subject to the antiboycott laws. See Sec. 760.1(d)(13) of 
this part.
    The Department cautions that United States persons who alter their 
normal pattern of dealing to eliminate the passage of ownership of the 
goods or services to or from the several states or territories of the 
United States in order to avoid the application of the antiboycott 
regulations would be in violation of Sec. 760.4 of this part.

[[Page 407]]

              Supplement No. 9 to Part 760--Interpretation

     Activities Exclusively Within a Boycotting Country--Furnishing 
                               Information

    Sec. 760.3(h) of this part provides that a United States person who 
is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country may comply with the laws 
of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively within 
the boycotting country. Among the types of conduct permitted by this 
exception is ``furnishing information within the host country'' 
Sec. 760.3(h)(1)(v) of this part. For purposes of the discussion which 
follows, the Department is assuming that the person in question is a 
bona fide resident of the boycotting country as defined in Sec. 760.3(f) 
of this part, and that the information to be provided is required by the 
laws or regulations of the boycotting country, as also defined in 
Sec. 760.3(g) of this part. The only issue this interpretation addresses 
is under what circumstances the provision of information is ``an 
activity exclusively within the boycotting country.''
    The activity of ``furnishing information'' consists of two parts, 
the acquisition of the information and its subsequent transmittal. Under 
the terms of this exception, the information may not be acquired outside 
the country for the purpose of responding to the requirement for 
information imposed by the boycotting country. Thus, if an American 
company which is a bona fide resident of a boycotting country is 
required to provide information about its dealings with other U.S. 
firms, the company may not ask its parent corporation in the United 
States for that information, or make any other inquiry outside the 
boundaries of the boycotting country. The information must be provided 
to the boycotting country authorities based on information or knowledge 
available to the company and its personnel located within the boycotting 
country at the time the inquiry is received. See Sec. 760.3, (h) of this 
part, examples (iii), (iv), and (v). Much of the information in the 
company's possession (transaction and corporate records) may have 
actually originated outside the boycotting country, and much of the 
information known to the employees may have been acquired outside the 
boycotting country. This will not cause the information to fall outside 
the coverage of this exception, if the information was sent to the 
boycotting country or acquired by the individuals in normal commercial 
context prior to and unrelated to a boycott inquiry or purpose. It 
should be noted that if prohibited information (about business relations 
with a boycotted country, for example) has been forwarded to the 
affiliate in the boycotting country in anticipation of a possible 
boycott inquiry from the boycotting country government, the Department 
will not regard this as information within the knowledge of the bona 
fide resident under the terms of the exception. However, if the bona 
fide resident possesses the information prior to receipt of a boycott-
related inquiry and obtained it in a normal commercial context, the 
information can be provided pursuant to this exception notwithstanding 
the fact that, at some point, the information came into the boycotting 
country from the outside.
    The second part of the analysis of ``furnishing information'' deals 
with the limitation on the transmittal of the information. It can only 
be provided within the boundaries of the boycotting country. The bona 
fide resident may only provide the information to the party that the 
boycotting country law requires (directly or through an agent or 
representative within the country) so long as that party is located 
within the boycotting country. This application of the exception is 
somewhat easier, since it is relatively simple to determine if the 
information is to be given to somebody within the country.
    Note that in discussing what constitutes furnishing information 
``exclusively within'' the boycotting country, the Department does not 
address the nature of the transaction or activity that the information 
relates to. It is the Department's position that the nature of the 
transaction, including the inception or completion of the transaction, 
is not material in analyzing the availability of this exception.
    For example, if a shipment of goods imported into a boycotting 
country is held up at the time of entry, and information from the bona 
fide resident within that country is legally required to free those 
goods, the fact that the information may relate to a transaction that 
began outside the boycotting country is not material. The availability 
of the exception will be judged based on the activity of the bona fide 
resident within the country. If the resident provides that information 
of his or her own knowledge, and provides it to appropriate parties 
located exclusively within the country, the exception permits the 
information to be furnished.
    Factual variations may raise questions about the application of this 
exception and the effect of this interpretation. In an effort to 
anticipate some of these, the Department has set forth below a number of 
questions and answers. They are incorporated as a part of this 
interpretation.
    1. Q. Under this exception, can a company which is a U.S. person and 
a bona fide resident of the boycotting country provide information to 
the local boycott office?
    A. Yes, if local law requires the company to provide this 
information to the boycott office and all the other requirements are 
met.

[[Page 408]]

    2. Q. If the company knows that the local boycott office will 
forward the information to the Central Boycott Office, may it still 
provide the information to the local boycott office?
    A. Yes, if it is required by local law to furnish the information to 
the local boycott office and all the other requirements are met. The 
company has no control over what happens to the information after it is 
provided to the proper authorities. (There is obvious potential for 
evasion here, and the Department will examine such occurrences closely.)
    3. Q. Can a U.S. person who is a bona fide resident of Syria furnish 
information to the Central Boycott Office in Damascus?
    A. No, unless the law in Syria specifically requires information to 
be provided to the Central Boycott Office the exception will not apply. 
Syria has a local boycott office responsible for enforcing the boycott 
in that country.
    4. Q. If a company which is a U.S. person and a bona fide resident 
of the boycotting country has an import shipment held up in customs of 
the boycotting country, and is required to provide information about the 
shipment to get it out of customs, may the company do so?
    A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. The act of 
furnishing the information is the activity taking place exclusively 
within the boycotting country. The fact that the information is provided 
corollary to a transaction that originates or terminates outside the 
boycotting country is not material.
    5. Q. If the U.S. person and bona fide resident of the boycotting 
country is shipping goods out of the boycotting country, and is required 
to certify to customs officials of the country at the time of export 
that the goods are not of Israeli origin, may he do so even though the 
certification relates to an export transaction?
    A. Yes, assuming all other requirements are met. See number 4 above.

              Supplement No. 10 to Part 760--Interpretation

    (a) The words ``Persian Gulf'' cannot appear on the document.
    This term is common in letters of credit from Kuwait and may be 
found in letters of credit from Bahrain. Although more commonly 
appearing in letters of credit, the term may also appear in other trade 
documents.
    It is the Department's view that this term reflects a historical 
dispute between the Arabs and the Iranians over geographic place names 
which in no way relates to existing economic boycotts. Thus, the term is 
neither prohibited nor reportable under the Regulations.
    (b) Certify that goods are of U.S.A. origin and contain no foreign 
parts.
    This term appears periodically on documents from a number of Arab 
countries. It is the Department's position that the statement is a 
positive certification of origin and, as such, falls within the 
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part for compliance with 
the import and shipping document requirements of a boycotting country. 
Even though a negative phrase is contained within the positive clause, 
the phrase is a non exclusionary, non blacklisting statement. In the 
Department's view, the additional phrase does not affect the permissible 
status of the positive certificate, nor does it make the request 
reportable Sec. 760.5(a)(5)(iii) of this part.
    (c) Legalization of documents by any Arab consulate except Egyptian 
Consulate permitted.
    This term appears from time to time in letters of credit but also 
may appear in various other trade documents requiring legalization and 
thus is not prohibited, and a request to comply with the statement is 
not reportable. Because a number of Arab states do not have formal 
diplomatic relations with Egypt, they do not recognize Egyptian embassy 
actions. The absence of diplomatic relations is the reason for the 
requirement. In the Department's view this does not constitute an 
unsanctioned foreign boycott or embargo against Egypt under the terms of 
the Export Administration Act. Thus the term is not prohibited, and a 
request to comply with the statement is not reportable.

              Supplement No. 11 to Part 760--Interpretation

               Definition of Unsolicited Invitation to Bid

    Sec. 760.5(a)(4) of this part states in part:
    In addition, a United States person who receives an unsolicited 
invitation to bid, or similar proposal, containing a boycott request has 
not received a reportable request for purposes of this section where he 
does not respond to the invitation to bid or other proposal.
    The Regulations do not define ``unsolicited'' in this context. Based 
on review of numerous situations, the Department has developed certain 
criteria that it applies in determining if an invitation to bid or other 
proposal received by a U.S. person is in fact unsolicited.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if, during a commercially 
reasonable period of time preceding the issuance of the invitation, a 
representative of the U.S. person contacted the company or agency 
involved for the purpose of promoting business on behalf of the company.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has advertised 
the product or line of

[[Page 409]]

products that are the subject of the invitation in periodicals or 
publications that ordinarily circulate to the country issuing the 
invitation during a commercially reasonable period of time preceding the 
issuance of the invitation.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has sold the 
same or similar products to the company or agency issuing the invitation 
within a commercially reasonable period of time before the issuance of 
the current invitation.
    The invitation is not unsolicited if the U.S. person has 
participated in a trade mission to or trade fair in the country issuing 
the invitation within a commercially reasonable period of time before 
the issuance of the invitation.
    Under Sec. 760.5(a)(4) of this part, the invitation is regarded as 
not reportable if the U.S. person receiving it does not respond. The 
Department has determined that a simple acknowledgment of the invitation 
does not constitute a response for purposes of this rule. However, an 
acknowledgment that requests inclusion for future invitations will be 
considered a response, and a report is required.
    Where the person in receipt of an invitation containing a boycott 
term or condition is undecided about a response by the time a report 
would be required to be filed under the regulations, it is the 
Department's view that the person must file a report as called for in 
the Regulations. The person filing the report may indicate at the time 
of filing that he has not made a decision on the boycott request but 
must file a supplemental report as called for in the regulations at the 
time a decision is made (Sec. 760.5(a)(6) of this part).

              Supplement No. 12 to Part 760--Interpretation

    The Department has taken the position that a U.S. person as defined 
by Sec. 760.1(b) of this part may not make use of an agent to furnish 
information that the U.S. person is prohibited from furnishing pursuant 
to Sec. 760.2(d) of this part.
    Example (v) under Sec. 760.4 of this part (Evasion) provides:
    A, a U.S. company, is negotiating a long-term contract with 
boycotting country Y to meet all of Y's medical supply needs. Y informs 
A that before such a contract can be concluded, A must complete Y's 
boycott questionnaire. A knows that it is prohibited from answering the 
questionnaire so it arranges for a local agent in Y to supply the 
necessary information.
    A's action constitutes evasion of this part, because it is a device 
to mask prohibited activity carried out on A's behalf.
    This interpretation deals with the application of the Regulations to 
a commercial agent registration requirement recently imposed by the 
government of Saudi Arabia. The requirement provides that nationals of 
Saudi Arabia seeking to register in Saudi Arabia as commercial agents or 
representatives of foreign concerns must furnish certain boycott-related 
information about the foreign concern prior to obtaining approval of the 
registration.
    The requirement has been imposed by the Ministry of Commerce of 
Saudi Arabia, which is the government agency responsible for regulation 
of commercial agents and foreign commercial registrations. The Ministry 
requires the agent or representative to state the following:
    Declaration: I, the undersigned, hereby declare, in my capacity as 
(blank) that (name and address of foreign principal) is not presently on 
the blacklist of the Office for the Boycott of Israel and that it and 
all its branches, if any, are bound by the decisions issued by the 
Boycott Office and do not (1) participate in the capital of, (2) license 
the manufacture of any products or grant trademarks or tradeware license 
to, (3) give experience or technical advice to, or (4) have any other 
relationship with other companies which are prohibited to be dealt with 
by the Boycott Office. Signed (name of commercial agent/representative/
distributor).
    It is the Department's view that under the circumstances 
specifically outlined in this interpretation relating to the nature of 
the requirement, a U.S. person will not be held responsible for a 
violation of this part when such statements are provided by its 
commercial agent or representative, even when such statements are made 
with the full knowledge of the U.S. person.
    Nature of the requirement. For a boycott-related commercial 
registration requirement to fall within the coverage of this 
interpretation it must have the following characteristics:
    1. The requirement for information imposed by the boycotting country 
applies to a national or other subject of the boycotting country 
qualified under the local laws of that country to function as a 
commercial representative within that country;
    2. The registration requirement relates to the registration of the 
commercial agent's or representative's authority to sell or distribute 
goods within the boycotting country acquired from the foreign concern;
    3. The requirement is a routine part of the registration process and 
is not applied selectively based on boycott-related criteria;
    4. The requirement applies only to a commercial agent or 
representative in the boycotting country and does not apply to the 
foreign concern itself; and
    5. The requirement is imposed by the agency of the boycotting 
country responsible for regulating commercial agencies.
    The U.S. person whose agent is complying with the registration 
requirement continues

[[Page 410]]

to be subject to all the terms of the Regulations, and may not provide 
any prohibited information to the agent for purposes of the agent's 
compliance with the requirement.
    In addition, the authority granted to the commercial agent or 
representative by the U.S. person must be consistent with standard 
commercial practices and not involve any grants of authority beyond 
those incidental to the commercial sales and distributorship 
responsibilities of the agent.
    Because the requirement does not apply to the U.S. person, no 
reporting obligation under Sec. 760.5 of this part would arise.
    This interpretation, like all others issued by the Department 
discussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the Export 
Administration Regulations, should be read narrowly. Circumstances that 
differ in any material way from those discussed in this notice will be 
considered under the applicable provisions of the Regulations. Persons 
are particularly advised not to seek to apply this interpretation to 
circumstances in which U.S. principals seek to use agents to deal with 
boycott-related or potential blacklisting situations.

              Supplement No. 13 to Part 760--Interpretation

                                 Summary

    This interpretation considers boycott-based contractual language 
dealing with the selection of suppliers and subcontractors. While this 
language borrows terms from the ``unilateral and specific selection'' 
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(c) of this part, it fails to meet the 
requirements of that exception. Compliance with the requirements of the 
language constitutes a violation of the regulatory prohibition of 
boycott-based refusals to do business.

                          Regulatory Background

    Section 760.2(a) of this part prohibits U.S. persons from refusing 
or knowingly agreeing to refuse to do business with other persons when 
such refusal is pursuant to an agreement with, requirement of, or 
request of a boycotting country. That prohibition does not extend to the 
performance of management, procurement or other pre-award services, 
however, notwithstanding knowledge that the ultimate selection may be 
boycott-based. To be permissible such services: (1) Must be customary 
for the firm or industry involved and (2) must not exclude others from 
the transaction or involve other actions based on the boycott. See 
Sec. 760.2(a)(6) of this part, ``Refusals to Do Business'', and example 
(xiii).
    A specific exception is also made in the Regulations for compliance 
(and agreements to comply) with a unilateral and specific selection of 
suppliers or subcontractors by a boycotting country buyer. See 
Sec. 760.3(d) of this part. In Supplement No. 1 to part 760, the 
following form of contractual language was said to fall within that 
exception for compliance with unilateral and specific selection:
    The Government of the boycotting country (or the First Party), in 
its exclusive power, reserves its right to make the final unilateral and 
specific selection of any proposed carriers, insurers, suppliers of 
services to be performed within the boycotting country, or of specific 
goods to be furnished in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
this contract.
    The Department noted that the actual steps necessary to comply with 
any selection made under this agreement would also have to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 760.3(c) of this part to claim the benefit of that 
exception. In other words, the discretion in selecting would have to be 
exercised exclusively by the boycotting country customer and the 
selection would have to be stated in the affirmative, naming a 
particular supplier. See Sec. 760.3(d) (4) and (5) of this part.

                Analysis of the New Contractual Language

    The Office of Antiboycott Compliance has learned of the introduction 
of a new contractual clause into tender documents issued by boycotting 
country governments. This clause is, in many respects, similar to that 
dealt with in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, but several critical 
differences exist.
    The clause states:

                      Boycott of Boycotted Country

    In connection with the performance of this Agreement, Contractor 
acknowledges that the import and customs laws and regulations of 
boycotting country apply to the furnishing and shipment of any products 
or components thereof to boycotting country. The Contractor specifically 
acknowledges that the aforementioned import and customs laws and 
regulations of boycotting country prohibit, among other things, the 
importation into boycotting country of products or components thereof: 
(A) Originating in boycotted country; (B) Manufactured, produced and 
furnish by companies organized under the laws of boycotted country; and 
(C) Manufactured, produced or furnished by Nationals or Residents of 
boycotted country.
    The Government, in its exclusive power, reserves its right to make 
the final unilateral and specific selection of any proposed Carriers, 
Insurers, Suppliers of Services to be performed within boycotting 
country or of specific goods to be furnished in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of this Contract.

[[Page 411]]

    To assist the Government in exercising its right under the preceding 
paragraph, Contractor further agrees to provide a complete list of names 
and addresses of all his Sub-Contractors, Suppliers, Vendors and 
Consultants and any other suppliers of the service for the project.
    The title of this clause makes clear that its provisions are 
intended to be boycott-related. The first paragraph acknowledges the 
applicability of certain boycott-related requirements of the boycotting 
country's laws in language reviewed in part 760, Supplement No. 1, Part 
II.B. and found to constitute a permissible agreement under the 
exception contained in Sec. 760.3(a) of this part for compliance with 
the import requirements of a boycotting country. The second and third 
paragraphs together deal with the procedure for selecting subcontractors 
and suppliers of services and goods and, in the context of the clause as 
a whole, must be regarded as motivated by boycott considerations and 
intended to enable the boycotting country government to make boycott-
based selections, including the elimination of blacklisted 
subcontractors and suppliers.
    The question is whether the incorporation into these paragraphs of 
some language from the ``unilateral and specific selection'' clause 
approved in Supplement No. 1 to part 760 suffices to take the language 
outside Sec. 760.2(a) of this part's prohibition on boycott-based 
agreements to refuse to do business. While the first sentence of this 
clause is consistent with the language discussed in Supplement No. 1 to 
part 760, the second sentence significantly alters the effect of this 
clause. The effect is to draw the contractor into the decision-making 
process, thereby destroying the unilateral character of the selection by 
the buyer. By agreeing to submit the names of the suppliers it plans to 
use, the contractor is agreeing to give the boycotting country buyer, 
who has retained the right of final selection, the ability to reject, 
for boycott-related reasons, any supplier the contractor has already 
chosen. Because the requirement appears in the contractual provision 
dealing with the boycott, the buyer's rejection of any supplier whose 
name is given to the buyer pursuant to this provision would be presumed 
to be boycott-based. By signing the contract, and thereby agreeing to 
comply with all of its provisions, the contractor must either accept the 
buyer's rejection of any supplier, which is presumed to be boycott-based 
because of the context of this provision, or breach the contract.
    In these circumstances, the contractor's method of choosing its 
subcontractors and suppliers, in anticipation of the buyer's boycott-
based review, cannot be considered a permissible pre-award service 
because of the presumed intrusion of boycott-based criteria into the 
selection process. Thus, assuming all other jurisdictional requirements 
necessary to establish a violation of part 760 are met, the signing of 
the contract by the contractor constitutes a violation of Sec. 760.2(a) 
of this part because he is agreeing to refuse to do business for boycott 
reasons.
    The apparent attempt to bring this language within the exception for 
compliance with unilateral and specific selections is ineffective. The 
language does not place the discretion to choose suppliers in the hands 
of the boycotting country buyer but divides this discretion between the 
buyer and his principal contractor. Knowing that the buyer will not 
accept a boycotted company as supplier or subcontractor, the contractor 
is asked to use his discretion in selecting a single supplier or 
subcontractor for each element of the contract. The boycotting country 
buyer exercises discretion only through accepting or rejecting the 
selected supplier or contractor as its boycott policies require. In 
these circumstances it cannot be said that the buyer is exercising right 
of unilateral and specific selection which meets the criteria of 
Sec. 760.3(c) of this part. For this reason, agreement to the 
contractual language discussed here would constitute an agreement to 
refuse to do business with any person rejected by the buyer and would 
violate Sec. 760.2(a) of this part.

              Supplement No. 14 to Part 760--Interpretation

    (a) Contractual clause concerning import, customs and boycott laws 
of a boycotting country.
    The following language has appeared in tender documents issued by a 
boycotting country:
    Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that the import, Customs 
and boycott laws, rules and regulations of [name of boycotting country] 
apply in importing to [name of boycotting country].
    Supplier declares his knowledge of the fact that under these laws, 
rules and regulations, it is prohibited to import into [name of the 
boycotting country] any products or parts thereof that originated in 
[name of boycotted country]; were manufactured, produced or imported by 
companies formed under the laws of [name of boycotted country]; or were 
manufactured, produced or imported by nationals or residents of [name of 
boycotted country].
    Agreeing to the above contractual language is a prohibited agreement 
to refuse to do business, under Sec. 760.2(a) of this part. The first 
paragraph requires broad acknowledgment of the application of the 
boycotting country's boycott laws, rules and regulations. Unless this 
language is qualified to apply only to boycott restrictions with which 
U.S. persons may comply, agreement to it is prohibited. See 
Sec. 760.2(a) of this part, examples (v) and (vi) under ``Agreement to 
Refuse to Do Business.''

[[Page 412]]

    The second paragraph does not limit the scope of the boycott 
restrictions referenced in the first paragraph. It states that the 
boycott laws include restrictions on goods originating in the boycotted 
country; manufactured, produced or supplied by companies organized under 
the laws of the boycotted country; or manufactured, produced or supplied 
by nationals or residents of the boycotted country. Each of these 
restrictions is within the exception for compliance with the import 
requirements of the boycotting country (Sec. 760.3(a) of this part). 
However, the second paragraph's list of restrictions is not exclusive. 
Since the boycott laws generally include more than what is listed and 
permissible under the antiboycott law, U.S. persons may not agree to the 
quoted clause. For example, a country's boycott laws may prohibit 
imports of goods manufactured by blacklisted firms. Except as provided 
by Sec. 760.3(g) of this part, agreement to and compliance with this 
boycott restriction would be prohibited under the antiboycott law.
    The above contractual language is distinguished from the contract 
clause determined to be permissible in supplement 1, Part II, A, by its 
acknowledgment that the boycott requirements of the boycotting country 
apply. Although the first sentence of the Supplement 1 clause does not 
exclude the possible application of boycott laws, it refers only to the 
import and customs laws of the boycotting country without mentioning the 
boycott laws as well. As discussed fully in Supplement No. 1 to part 
760, compliance with or agreement to the clause quoted there is, 
therefore, permissible.
    The contract clause quoted above, as well as the clause dealt with 
in Supplement No. 1 to part 760, part II, A, is reportable under 
Sec. 760.6(a)(1) of this part.
    (b) Letter of credit terms removing blacklist certificate 
requirement if specified vessels used.
    The following terms frequently appear on letters of credit covering 
shipment to Iraq:
    Shipment to be effected by Iraqi State Enterprise for Maritime 
Transport Vessels or by United Arab Shipping Company (SAB) vessels, if 
available.
    If shipment is effected by any of the above company's [sic] vessels, 
black list certificate or evidence to that effect is not required.
    These terms are not reportable and compliance with them is 
permissible.
    The first sentence, a directive to use Iraqi State Enterprise for 
Maritime Transport or United Arab Shipping vessels, is neither 
reportable nor prohibited because it is not considered by the Department 
to be boycott-related. The apparent reason for the directive is Iraq's 
preference to have cargo shipped on its own vessels (or, as in the case 
of United Arab Shipping, on vessels owned by a company in part 
established and owned by the Iraqi government). Such ``cargo 
preference'' requirements, calling for the use of an importing or 
exporting country's own ships, are common throughout the world and are 
imposed for non-boycott reasons. (See Sec. 760.2(a) of this part, 
example (vii) AGREEMENTS TO REFUSE TO DO BUSINESS.)
    In contrast, if the letter of credit contains a list of vessels or 
carriers that appears to constitute a boycott-related whitelist, a 
directive to select a vessel from that list would be both reportable and 
prohibited. When such a directive appears in conjunction with a term 
removing the blacklist certificate requirement if these vessels are 
used, the Department will presume that beneficiaries, banks and any 
other U.S. person receiving the letter of credit know that there is a 
boycott-related purpose for the directive.
    The second sentence of the letter of credit language quoted above 
does not, by itself, call for a blacklist certificate and is not 
therefore, reportable. If a term elsewhere on the letter of credit 
imposes a blacklist certificate requirement, then that other term would 
be reportable.
    (c) Information not related to a particular transaction in U.S. 
commerce.
    Under Sec. 760.2 (c), (d) and (e), of this part U.S. persons are 
prohibited, with respect to their activities in U.S. commerce, from 
furnishing certain information. It is the Department's position that the 
required nexus with U.S. commerce is established when the furnishing of 
information itself occurs in U.S. commerce. Even when the furnishing of 
information is not itself in U.S. commerce, however, the necessary 
relationship to U.S. commerce will be established if the furnishing of 
information relates to particular transactions in U.S. commerce or to 
anticipated transactions in U.S. commerce. See, e.g. Sec. 760.2(d), 
examples (vii), (ix) and (xii) of this part.
    The simplest situation occurs where a U.S. person located in the 
United States furnishes information to a boycotting country. The 
transfer of information from the United States to a foreign country is 
itself an activity in U.S. commerce. See Sec. 760.1(d)(1)(iv) of this 
part. In some circumstances, the furnishing of information by a U.S. 
person located outside the United States may also be an activity in U.S. 
commerce. For example, the controlled foreign subsidiary of a domestic 
concern might furnish to a boycotting country information the subsidiary 
obtained from the U.S.-located parent for that purpose. The subsidiary's 
furnishing would, in these circumstances, constitute an activity in U.S. 
commerce. See Sec. 760.1(d)(8) of this part.
    Where the furnishing of information is not itself in U.S. commerce, 
the U.S. commerce requirement may be satisfied by the fact that the 
furnishing is related to an activity in U.S. foreign or domestic 
commerce. For example, if a shipment of goods by a controlled-in-fact 
foreign subsidiary of a U.S.

[[Page 413]]

company to a boycotting country gives rise to an inquiry from the 
boycotting country concerning the subsidiary's relationship with another 
firm, the Department regards any responsive furnishing of information by 
the subsidiary as related to the shipment giving rise to the inquiry. If 
the shipment is in U.S. foreign or domestic commerce, as defined by the 
regulations, then the Department regards the furnishing to be related to 
an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycott regulations, 
whether or not the furnishing itself is in U.S. commerce.
    In some circumstances, the Department may regard a furnishing of 
information as related to a broader category of present and prospective 
transactions. For example, if a controlled-in-fact foreign subsidiary of 
a U.S. company is requested to furnish information about its commercial 
dealings and it appears that failure to respond will result in its 
blacklisting, any responsive furnishing of information will be regarded 
by the Department as relating to all of the subsidiary's present and 
anticipated business activities with the inquiring boycotting country. 
Accordingly, if any of these present or anticipated business activities 
are in U.S. commerce, the Department will regard the furnishing as 
related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to the antiboycott 
regulations.
    In deciding whether anticipated business activities will be in U.S. 
commerce, the Department will consider all of the surrounding 
circumstances. Particular attention will be given to the history of the 
U.S. person's business activities with the boycotting country and 
others, the nature of any activities occurring after a furnishing of 
information occurs and any relevant economic or commercial factors which 
may affect these activities.
    For example, if a U.S. person has no activities with the boycotting 
country at present but all of its other international activities are in 
U.S. commerce, as defined by the Regulations, then the Department is 
likely to regard any furnishing of information by that person for the 
purpose of securing entry into the boycotting country's market as 
relating to anticipated activities in U.S. commerce and subject to the 
antiboycott regulations. Similarly, if subsequent to the furnishing of 
information to the boycotting country for the purpose of securing entry 
into its markets, the U.S. person engages in transactions with that 
country which are in U.S. commerce, the Department is likely to regard 
the furnishing as related to an activity in U.S. commerce and subject to 
the antiboycott regulations.

              Supplement No. 15 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Section 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) of this part prohibits United States 
persons from furnishing certain types of information with intent to 
comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott against 
a country friendly to the United States. The Department has been asked 
whether prohibited information may be transmitted--that is, passed to 
others by a United States person who has not directly or indirectly 
authored the information--without such transmission constituting a 
furnishing of information in violation of Sec. 760.2 (c), (d), and (e) 
of this part. Throughout this interpretation, ``transmission'' is 
defined as the passing on by one person of information initially 
authored by another. The Department believes that there is no 
distinction in the EAR between transmitting (as defined above) and 
furnishing prohibited information under the EAR and that the 
transmission of prohibited information with the requisite boycott intent 
is a furnishing of information violative of the EAR. At the same time, 
however, the circumstances relating to the transmitting party's 
involvement will be carefully considered in determining whether that 
party intended to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned 
foreign boycott.
    The EAR does not deal specifically with the relationship between 
transmitting and furnishing. However, the restrictions in the EAR on 
responses to boycott-related conditions, both by direct and indirect 
actions and whether by primary parties or intermediaries, indicate that 
U.S. persons who simply transmit prohibited information are to be 
treated the same under the EAR as those who both author and furnish 
prohibited information. This has been the Department's position in 
enforcement actions it has brought.
    The few references in the EAR to the transmission of information by 
third parties are consistent with this position. Two examples, both 
relating to the prohibition against the furnishing of information about 
U.S. persons' race, religion, sex, or national origin (Sec. 760.2(c) of 
this part), deal explicitly with transmitting information. These 
examples (Sec. 760.2(c) of this part, example (v), and Sec. 760.3(f) of 
this part, example (vi)) show that, in certain cases, when furnishing 
certain information is permissible, either because it is not within a 
prohibition or is excepted from a prohibition, transmitting it is also 
permissible. These examples concern information that may be furnished by 
individuals about themselves or their families. The examples show that 
employers may transmit to a boycotting country visa applications or 
forms containing information about an employee's race, religion, sex, or 
national origin if that employee is the source of the information

[[Page 414]]

and authorizes its transmission. In other words, within the limits of 
ministerial action set forth in these examples, employees' actions in 
transmitting information are protected by the exception available to the 
employee. The distinction between permissible and prohibited behavior 
rests not on the definitional distinction between furnishing and 
transmitting, but on the excepted nature of the information furnished by 
the employee. The information originating from the employee does not 
lose its excepted character because it is transmitted by the employer.
    The Department's position regarding the furnishing and transmission 
of certificates of one's own blacklist status rests on a similar basis 
and does not support the contention that third parties may transmit 
prohibited information authored by another. Such self-certifications do 
not violate any prohibitions in the EAR (see Supplement Nos. 1(I)(B), 2, 
and 5(A)(2); Sec. 760.2(f), example (xiv)). It is the Department's 
position that it is not prohibited for U.S. persons to transmit such 
self-certifications completed by others. Once again, because furnishing 
the self-certification is not prohibited, third parties who transmit the 
self-certifications offend no prohibition. On the other hand, if a third 
party authored information about another's blacklist status, the act of 
transmitting that information would be prohibited.
    A third example in the EAR (Sec. 760.5, example (xiv) of this part), 
which also concerns a permissible transmission of boycott-related 
information, does not support the theory that one may transmit 
prohibited information authored by another. This example deals with the 
reporting requirements in Sec. 760.5 of this part--not the 
prohibitions--and merely illustrates that a person who receives and 
transmits a self-certification has not received a reportable request.
    It is also the Department's position that a U.S. person violates the 
prohibitions against furnishing information by transmitting prohibited 
information even if that person has received no reportable request in 
the transaction. For example, where documents accompanying a letter of 
credit contain prohibited information, a negotiating bank that transmits 
the documents, with the requisite boycott intent, to an issuing bank has 
not received a reportable request, but has furnished prohibited 
information.
    While the Department does not regard the suggested distinction 
between transmitting and furnishing information as meaningful, the facts 
relating to the third party's involvement may be important in 
determining whether that party furnished information with the required 
intent to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign 
boycott. For example, if it is a standard business practice for one 
participant in a transaction to obtain and pass on, without examination, 
documents prepared by another party, it might be difficult to maintain 
that the first participant intended to comply with a boycott by passing 
on information contained in the unexamined documents. Resolution of such 
intent questions, however, depends upon an analysis of the individual 
facts and circumstances of the transaction and the Department will 
continue to engage in such analysis on a case-by-case basis.
    This interpretation, like all others issued by the Department 
discussing applications of the antiboycott provisions of the EAR, should 
be read narrowly. Circumstances that differ in any material way from 
those discussed in this interpretation will be considered under the 
applicable provisions of the Regulations.

              Supplement No. 16 to Part 760--Interpretation

    Pursuant to Articles 5, 7, and 26 of the Treaty of Peace between the 
State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and implementing 
legislation enacted by Jordan, Jordan's participation in the Arab 
economic boycott of Israel was formally terminated on August 16, 1995.
    On the basis of this action, it is the Department's position that 
certain requests for information, action or agreement from Jordan which 
were considered boycott-related by implication now cannot be presumed 
boycott-related and thus would not be prohibited or reportable under the 
regulations. For example, a request that an exporter certify that the 
vessel on which it is shipping its goods is eligible to enter Hashemite 
Kingdom of Jordan ports has been considered a boycott-related request 
that the exporter could not comply with because Jordan has had a boycott 
in force against Israel. Such a request from Jordan after August 16, 
1995 would not be presumed boycott-related because the underlying 
boycott requirement/basis for the certification has been eliminated. 
Similarly, a U.S. company would not be prohibited from complying with a 
request received from Jordanian government officials to furnish the 
place of birth of employees the company is seeking to take to Jordan 
because there is no underlying boycott law or policy that would give 
rise to a presumption that the request was boycott-related.
    U.S. persons are reminded that requests that are on their face 
boycott-related or that are for action obviously in furtherance or 
support of an unsanctioned foreign boycott are subject to the 
regulations, irrespective of the country of origin. For example, 
requests containing references to ``blacklisted companies'', ``Israel 
boycott list'', ``non-Israeli goods'' or other phrases or words 
indicating boycott purpose would be subject to the appropriate 
provisions of the Department's antiboycott regulations.

Sec. 762.4  Original records required.

    The regulated person must maintain the original records in the form 
in which that person receives or creates them unless that person meets 
all of the conditions of Sec. 762.5 of this part relating to 
reproduction of records. If the original record does not meet the 
standards of legibility and readability

[[Page 417]]

described in Sec. 762.5 of this part and the regulated person intends to 
rely on that record to meet the recordkeeping requirements of the EAR, 
that person must retain the original record.


<R05>
Sec. 762.5  Reproduction of original records.

    (a) The regulated person may maintain reproductions instead of the 
original records provided all of the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section are met.
    (b) In order to maintain the records required by Sec. 762.2 of this 
part, the regulated persons defined in Sec. 762.1 of this part may use 
any photographic, photostatic, miniature photographic, micrographic, 
automated archival storage, or other process that completely, 
accurately, legibly and durably reproduces the original records (whether 
on paper, microfilm, or through electronic digital storage techniques). 
The process must meet all of the following requirements, which are 
applicable to all systems:
    (1) The system must be capable of reproducing all records on paper.
    (2) The system must record and be able to reproduce all marks, 
information, and other characteristics of the original record, including 
both obverse and reverse sides of paper documents in legible form.
    (3) When displayed on a viewer, monitor, or reproduced on paper, the 
records must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability. (For 
purposes of this section, legible and legibility mean the quality of a 
letter or numeral that enable the observer to identify it positively and 
quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readable and 
readability mean the quality of a group of letters or numerals being 
recognized as complete words or numbers.)
    (4) The system must preserve the initial image (including both 
obverse and reverse sides of paper documents) and record all changes, 
who made them and when they were made. This information must be stored 
in such a manner that none of it may be altered once it is initially 
recorded.
    (5) The regulated person must establish written procedures to 
identify the individuals who are responsible for the operation, use and 
maintenance of the system.
    (6) The regulated person must establish written procedures for 
inspection and quality assurance of records in the system and document 
the implementation of those procedures.
    (7) The system must be complete and contain all records required to 
be kept by this part or the regulated person must provide a method for 
correlating, identifying and locating records relating to the same 
transaction(s) that are kept in other record keeping systems.
    (8) The regulated person must keep a record of where, when, by whom, 
and on what equipment the records and other information were entered 
into the system.
    (9) Upon request by the Office of Export Enforcement, the Office of 
Antiboycott Compliance, or any other agency of competent jurisdiction, 
the regulated person must furnish, at the examination site, the records, 
the equipment and, if necessary, knowledgeable personnel for locating, 
reading, and reproducing any record in the system.
    (c) Requirements applicable to systems based on the storage of 
digital images. For systems based on the storage of digital images, the 
system must provide accessibility to any digital image in the system. 
With respect to records of transactions, including those involving 
restrictive trade practices or boycott requirements or requests. The 
system must be able to locate and reproduce all records relating to a 
particular transaction based on any one of the following criteria:
    (1) The name(s) of the parties to the transaction;
    (2) Any country(ies) connected with the transaction; or
    (3) A document reference number that was on any original document.
    (d) Requirements applicable to a system based on photographic 
processes. For systems based on photographic, photostatic, or miniature 
photographic processes, the regulated person must maintain a detailed 
index of all records in the system that is arranged in such a manner as 
to allow immediate location of any particular record in the system.

[[Page 418]]


<R05>
Sec. 762.6  Period of retention.

    (a) Five year retention period. All records required to be kept by 
the EAR must be retained for five years from the latest of the following 
times:
    (1) The export from the United States of the item involved in the 
transaction to which the records pertain or the provision of financing, 
transporting or other service for or on behalf of end-users of 
proliferation concern as described in Secs. 736.2(b)(7) and 744.6 of the 
EAR;
    (2) Any known reexport, transshipment, or diversion of such item;

    (4) In the case of records of pertaining to transactions involving 
restrictive trade practices or boycotts described in part 760 of the 
EAR, the date the regulated person receives the boycott-related request 
or requirement.
    (b) Destruction or disposal of records. If the Bureau of Export 
Administration or any other government agency makes a formal or informal 
request for a certain record or records, such record or records may not 
be destroyed or disposed of without the written authorization of the 
agency concerned. This prohibition applies to records pertaining to 
voluntary disclosures made to BXA in accordance with 
Sec. 765.5(c)(4)(ii) and other records even if such records have been 
retained for a period of time exceeding that required by paragraph (a) 
of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 762.7  Producing and inspecting records.

    (a) Persons located in the United States. Persons located in the

kept by any provision of the EAR, or any license, order, or 
authorization issued thereunder and to make them available for 
inspection and copying by any authorized agent, official, or employee of 
the Bureau of Export Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, or any 
other agency of the U.S. Government, without any charge or expense to 
such agent, official, or employee. The Office of Export Enforcement and 
the Office of Antiboycott Compliance encourage voluntary cooperation 
with such requests. When voluntary cooperation is not forthcoming, the 
Office of Export Enforcement and the Office of Antiboycott Compliance 
are authorized to issue subpoenas for books, records, and other 
writings. In instances where a person does not comply with a subpoena, 
the Department of Commerce may petition a district court to have a

of Export Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, or a Foreign Service 
post, or by any other accredited representative of the U.S. Government, 
without any charge or expense to such agent, official or employee.

[[Page 419]]

part 760 of the EAR, and the violations and sanctions specified in part 
764 also apply to conduct relating to part 760, unless otherwise stated. 
This part describes administrative sanctions that may be imposed by the

EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, 
has occurred, is about to occur, or is intended to occur in connection

<R05>
Sec. 764.3  Sanctions.

    (a) Administrative.\1\ Violations of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, 
license or authorization issued thereunder are subject to the 
administrative sanctions described in this section and to any other 
liability, sanction, or penalty available under law. The protective 
administrative measures that are described in Sec. 764.6 of this part 
are distinct from administrative sanctions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\ In the event that any part of the EAR is not under the authority 
of the EAA, sanctions shall be limited to those provided for by such 
other authority, but the provisions of this part and of part 766 of the 
EAR shall apply insofar as not inconsistent with that other authority.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Civil penalty. (i) A civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 may be 
imposed for each violation, except that a civil penalty not to exceed 
$100,000 may be imposed for each violation involving national security 
controls imposed under section 5 of the EAA.
    (ii) The payment of any civil penalty may be made a condition, for a 
period not exceeding one year after the imposition of such penalty, to 
the granting, restoration, or continuing validity of any export license, 
License Exception, permission, or privilege granted or to be granted to 
the person upon whom such penalty is imposed.
    (iii) The payment of any civil penalty may be deferred or suspended 
in whole or in part during any probation period that may be imposed. 
Such deferral or suspension shall not bar the collection of the penalty 
if the conditions of the deferral, suspension, or probation are not 
fulfilled.
    (2) Denial of export privileges. An order may be issued that 
restricts the ability of the named persons to engage in export and 
reexport transactions involving items subject to the EAR, or that 
restricts access by named persons to items subject to the EAR. An order 
denying export privileges may be imposed either as a sanction for a 
violation specified in this part or as a protective administrative 
measure described in Sec. 764.6(c) or (d) of this part. An order denying 
export privileges may suspend or revoke any or all outstanding licenses 
issued under the EAR to a person named in the denial order or in which 
such person has an interest, may deny or restrict exports and reexports 
by or to such person of any item subject to the EAR, and may restrict 
dealings in which that person may benefit from any export or reexport of 
such items. The standard terms of a denial order are set forth in 
Supplement No. 1 to this part. A non-standard denial order, narrower in 
scope, may be issued. Authorization to engage in actions otherwise 
prohibited by a denial order may be given by the Office of Exporter 
Services, in consultation with the Office of Export Enforcement, 
following application by a person named in the denial order or by a 
person seeking permission to deal with a named person.
    (3) Exclusion from practice. Any person acting as an attorney, 
accountant, consultant, freight forwarder, or in any other 
representative capacity for any license application or other matter 
before BXA may be excluded by order from any or all such activities 
before BXA.
    (b) Criminal.\2\ (1) General. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, whoever knowingly violates or

[[Page 421]]

conspires to or attempts to violate the EAA, EAR, or any order or 
license issued thereunder, shall be fined not more than five times the 
value of the exports or reexports involved or $50,000, whichever is 
greater, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \2\ In the event that any part of the EAR is not under the authority 
of the EAA, sanctions shall be limited to those provided for by such 
other authority or by 18 U.S.C. 3571, a criminal code provision that 
establishes a maximum criminal fine for a felony that is the greater of 
the amount provided by the statute that was violated, or an amount not 
more than $500,000 for an organization. The Federal Sentencing 
Guidelines found in Sec. 2M5.1 of Appendix 4 to Title 18 of the United 
States Code apply, to the extent followed by the court, to sentencing 
for convictions for violating the EAA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Willful violations. (i) Whoever willfully violates or conspires 
to or attempts to violate any provision of the EAA, the EAR, or any 
order or license issued thereunder, with knowledge that the exports 
involved will be used for the benefit of, or that the destination or 
intended destination of items involved is, any controlled country or any 
country to which exports or reexports are controlled for foreign policy 
purposes, except in the case of an individual, shall be fined not more 
than five times the value of the export or reexport involved or 
$1,000,000, whichever is greater; and, in the case of an individual, 
shall be fined not more than $250,000, or imprisoned not more than 10 
years, or both.
    (ii) Any person who is issued a license under the EAA or the EAR for 
the export or reexport of any items to a controlled country and who, 
with knowledge that such export or reexport is being used by such 
controlled country for military or intelligence gathering purposes 
contrary to the conditions under which the license was issued, willfully 
fails to report such use to the Secretary of Defense, except in the case 
of an individual, shall be fined not more than five times the value of 
the exports or reexports involved or $1,000,000, whichever is greater; 
and in the case of an individual, shall be fined not more than $250,000, 
or imprisoned not more than five years or both.
    (iii) Any person who possesses any item with the intent to export or 
reexport such item in violation of an export control imposed under 
sections 5 or 6 of the EAA, the EAR, or any order or license issued 
thereunder, or knowing or having reason to believe that the item would 
be so exported or reexported, shall, in the case of a violation of an 
export control imposed under section 5 of the EAA (or the EAR, or any 
order or license issued thereunder with respect to such control), be 
subject to the penalties set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section and shall in the case of a violation of an export control 
imposed under section 6 of the EAA (or the EAR, or any order or license 
issued thereunder with respect to such control), be subject to the 
penalties set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (iv) Any person who takes any action with intent to evade the 
provisions of the EAA, the EAR, or any order or license issued 
thereunder, shall be subject to the penalties set forth in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, except that in the case of an evasion of an 
export control imposed under sections 5 or 6 of the EAA (or the EAR, or 
any order or license issued thereunder with respect to such control), 
such person shall be subject to the penalties set forth in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) Other criminal sanctions. Conduct that constitutes a violation 
of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued 
thereunder, or that occurs in connection with such a violation, may also 
be prosecuted under other provisions of law, including 18 U.S.C. 371 
(conspiracy), 18 U.S.C. 1001 (false statements), 18 U.S.C. 1341, 1343, 
and 1346 (mail and wire fraud), and 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 (money 
laundering).
    (c) Other sanctions. Conduct that violates the EAA, the EAR, or any 
order, license or authorization issued thereunder, and other conduct 
specified in the EAA may be subject to sanctions or other measures in 
addition to criminal and administrative sanctions under the EAA or EAR. 
These include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Statutory sanctions. Statutorily-mandated sanctions may be 
imposed on account of specified conduct related to weapons 
proliferation. Such statutory sanctions are not civil or criminal 
penalties, but restrict imports and procurement (See section 11A of the 
EAA, Multilateral Export Control Violations, and section 11C of the EAA, 
Chemical and Biological Weapons Proliferation), or restrict export 
licenses (See section 11B of the EAA, Missile Proliferation Violations, 
and the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992).

[[Page 422]]

    (2) Other sanctions and measures--(i) Seizure and forfeiture. Items 
that have been, are being, or are intended to be, exported or shipped 
from or taken out of the United States in violation of the EAA, the EAR, 
or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder, are subject to 
being seized and detained as are the vessels, vehicles, and aircraft 
carrying such items. Seized items are subject to forfeiture. (50 U.S.C. 
app. 2411(g); 22 U.S.C. 401.)
    (ii) Cross-debarment. (A) The Department of State may deny licenses 
or approvals for the export or reexport of defense articles and defense 
services controlled under the Arms Export Control Act to persons 
indicted or convicted of specified criminal offenses, including 
violations of the EAA, or to persons denied export privileges by BXA or 
another agency. (22 CFR 126.7(a) and 127.11(a).)
    (B) The Department of Defense, among other agencies, may suspend the 
right of any person to contract with the United States Government based 
on export control violations. (Federal Acquisition Regulations 9.407-2.)
[61 FR 12902, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25469, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 764.4  Reporting of violations.

    (a) Where to report. If a person learns that an export control 
violation of the EAR has occurred or may occur, that person may notify:

Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Export Administration,U.S. 
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room 
H-4520, Washington, D.C. 20230, Tel: (202) 482-1208, Facsimile: (202) 
482-0964


or, for violations of part 760 of the EAR:

Office of Antiboycott Compliance, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room 
H-6099C, Washington, D.C. 20230, Tel: (202) 482-2381, Facsimile: (202) 
482-0913.

    (b) Failure to report violations. Failure to report potential 
violations may result in the unwarranted issuance of licenses or exports 
without the required licenses to the detriment of the interests of the 
United States.
    (c) Reporting requirement distinguished. The reporting provisions in 
paragraph (a) of this section are not ``reporting requirements'' within 
the meaning of Sec. 764.2(i) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 764.5  Voluntary self-disclosure.

    (a) General policy. BXA strongly encourages disclosure to OEE if you 
believe that you may have violated the EAR, or any order, license or 
authorization issued thereunder. Voluntary self-disclosure is a 
mitigating factor in determining what administrative sanctions, if any, 
will be sought by OEE.
    (b) Limitations. (1) The provisions of this section do not apply to 
disclosures of violations relating to part 760 of the EAR.
    (2) The provisions of this section apply only when information is 
provided to OEE for its review in determining whether to take 
administrative action under part 766 of the EAR for violations of the 
export control provisions of the EAR.
    (3) The provisions of this section apply only when information is 
received by OEE for review prior to the time that OEE, or any other 
agency of the United States Government, has learned the same or 
substantially similar information from another source and has commenced 
an investigation or inquiry in connection with that information.
    (4) While voluntary self-disclosure is a mitigating factor in 
determining what administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought by 
OEE, it is a factor that is considered together with all other factors 
in a case. The weight given to voluntary self-disclosure is solely 
within the discretion of OEE, and the mitigating effect of voluntary 
self-disclosure may be outweighed by aggravating factors. Voluntary 
self-disclosure does not prevent transactions from being referred to the 
Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. In such a case, OEE 
would notify the Department of Justice of the voluntary self-disclosure, 
but the consideration of that factor is within the discretion of the 
Department of Justice.
    (5) A firm will not be deemed to have made a disclosure under this 
section unless the individual making the disclosure did so with the full 
knowledge

[[Page 423]]

and authorization of the firm's senior management.
    (6) The provisions of this section do not, nor should they be relied 
on to, create, confer, or grant any rights, benefits, privileges, or 
protection enforceable at law or in equity by any person, business, or 
entity in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other matter.
    (c) Information to be provided. (1) General. Any person wanting to 
disclose information that constitutes a voluntary self-disclosure 
should, in the manner outlined below, initially notify OEE as soon as 
possible after violations are discovered, and then conduct a thorough 
review of all export-related transactions where violations are 
suspected.
    (2) Initial notification. (i) The initial notification should be in 
writing and be sent to one of the addresses in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of this 
part. The notification should include the name of the person making the 
disclosure and a brief description of the suspected violations. The 
notification should describe the general nature and extent of the 
violations. If the person making the disclosure subsequently completes 
the narrative account required by Sec. 764.5(c)(3) of this part, the 
disclosure will be deemed to have been made on the date of the initial 
notification for purposes of Sec. 764.5(b)(3) of this part.
    (ii) OEE recognizes that there may be situations where it will not 
be practical to make an initial notification in writing. For example, 
written notification may not be practical if a shipment leaves the 
United States without the required license, yet there is still an 
opportunity to prevent acquisition of the items by unauthorized persons. 
In such situations, OEE should be contacted promptly at one of the 
offices listed in Sec. 764.5(c)(7) of this part.
    (3) Narrative account. After the initial notification, a thorough 
review should be conducted of all export-related transactions where 
possible violations are suspected. OEE recommends that the review cover 
a period of five years prior to the date of the initial notification. If 
your review goes back less than five years, you risk failing to discover 
violations that may later become the subject of an investigation. Any 
violations not voluntarily disclosed do not receive consideration under 
this section. However, the failure to make such disclosures will not be 
treated as a separate violation unless some other section of the EAR or 
other provision of law requires disclosure. Upon completion of the 
review, OEE should be furnished with a narrative account that 
sufficiently describes the suspected violations so that their nature and 
gravity can be assessed. The narrative account should also describe the 
nature of the review conducted and measures that may have been taken to 
minimize the likelihood that violations will occur in the future. The 
narrative account should include:
    (i) The kind of violation involved, for example, a shipment without 
the required license or dealing with a party denied export privileges;
    (ii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred;
    (iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and 
organizations, whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities 
giving rise to the violations;
    (iv) License numbers;
    (v) The description, quantity, value in U.S. dollars and ECCN or 
other classification of the items involved; and
    (vi) A description of any mitigating circumstances.
    (4) Supporting documentation. (i) The narrative account should be 
accompanied by copies of documents that explain and support it, 
including:
    (A) Licensing documents such as licenses, license applications, 
import certificates and end-user statements;
    (B) Shipping documents such as Shipper's Export Declarations, air 
waybills and bills of lading; and
    (C) Other documents such as letters, facsimiles, telexes and other 
evidence of written or oral communications, internal memoranda, purchase 
orders, invoices, letters of credit and brochures.
    (ii) Any relevant documents not attached to the narrative account 
must be retained by the person making the disclosure until OEE requests 
them, or until a final decision on the disclosed information has been 
made. After a final decision, the documents should be maintained in 
accordance with the recordkeeping rules in part 762 of the EAR.

[[Page 424]]

    (5) Certification. A certification must be submitted stating that 
all of the representations made in connection with the voluntary self-
disclosure are true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge 
and belief. Certifications made by a corporation or other organization 
should be signed by an official of the corporation or other organization 
with the authority to do so. Section 764.2(g) of this part, relating to 
false or misleading representations, applies in connection with the 
disclosure of information under this section.
    (6) Oral presentations. OEE believes that oral presentations are 
generally not necessary to augment the written narrative account and 
supporting documentation. If the person making the disclosure believes 
otherwise, a request for a meeting should be included with the 
disclosure.
    (7) Where to make voluntary self-disclosures. The information 
constituting a voluntary self-disclosure or any other correspondence 
pertaining to a voluntary self-disclosure may be submitted to:

Office of Export Enforcement, Director, Intelligence Division, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 70, Washington, D.C. 20044

    (d) Action by the Office of Export Enforcement. After OEE has been 
provided with the required narrative and supporting documentation, it 
will acknowledge the disclosure by letter, provide the person making the 
disclosure with a point of contact, and take whatever additional action, 
including further investigation, it deems appropriate. As quickly as the 
facts and circumstances of a given case permit, OEE may take any of the 
following actions:
    (1) Inform the person making the disclosure that, based on the facts 
disclosed, it plans to take no action;
    (2) Issue a warning letter;
    (3) Issue a proposed charging letter pursuant to Sec. 766.18 of the 
EAR and attempt to settle the matter;
    (4) Issue a charging letter pursuant to Sec. 766.3 of the EAR if a 
settlement is not reached; and/or
    (5) Refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal 
prosecution.
    (e) Criteria. For purposes of determining what administrative action 
to take and what sanctions, if any, to seek, the fact that a voluntary 
self-disclosure has been made will be a mitigating factor. OEE will take 
that factor into account along with other mitigating and aggravating 
factors when determining what, if any, administrative sanctions should 
be imposed. The factors that OEE will consider are in its sole 
discretion, but may include:
    (1) The extent to which the purpose of the control is undermined by 
the transaction;
    (2) Whether the transaction would have been authorized had proper 
application been made;

[[Page 425]]

    (3) The quantity and value of the items involved;
    (4) Why the violations occurred. For example, OEE may consider 
whether the violations were intentional or inadvertent; the degree to 
which the person responsible for the violation making the disclosure was 
familiar with the EAR; and whether the violator has been the subject of 
prior administrative or criminal action under the EAA or the EAR;
    (5) Whether, as a result of the information provided, OEE is able to 
prevent any items exported illegally from reaching unauthorized persons 
or destinations;
    (6) The degree of cooperation with the ensuing investigation;
    (7) Whether the person has instituted or improved an internal 
compliance program to reduce the likelihood of future violations.
    (f) Treatment of unlawfully exported items after voluntary self-
disclosure. (1) Any person taking certain actions with knowledge that a 
violation of the EAA or the EAR has occurred has violated Sec. 764.2(e) 
of this part. Any person who has made a voluntary self-disclosure knows 
that a violation may have occurred. Therefore, at the time that a 
voluntary self-disclosure is made, the person making the disclosure may 
request permission from BXA to engage in the activities described in 
Sec. 764.2(e) of this part that would otherwise be prohibited. If the 
request is granted by the Office of Exporter Services in consultation 
with OEE, future activities with respect to those items that would 
otherwise violate Sec. 764.2(e) of this part will not constitute 
violations. However, even if permission is granted, the person making 
the voluntary self-disclosure is not absolved from liability for any 
violations disclosed nor relieved of the obligation to obtain any 
required reexport authorizations.
    (2) A license to reexport items that are the subject of a voluntary 
self-disclosure, and that have been exported contrary to the provisions 
of the EAA or the EAR, may be requested from BXA in accordance with the 
provisions of part 748 of the EAR. If the applicant for reexport 
authorization knows that the items are the subject of a voluntary self-
disclosure, the request should state that a voluntary self-disclosure 
was made in connection with the export of the commodities for which 
reexport authorization is sought.
[61 FR 12902, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25469, May 9, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 764.6  Protective administrative measures.

    (a) License Exception limitation. As provided in Sec. 740.2(b) of 
the EAR , all License Exceptions are subject to revision, suspension, or 
revocation.
    (b) Revocation or suspension of licenses. As provided in Sec. 750.8 
of the EAR, all licenses are subject to revision, suspension, or 
revocation.
    (c) Temporary denial orders. BXA may, in accordance with Sec. 766.24 
of the EAR, issue an order temporarily denying export privileges when 
such an order is necessary in the public interest to prevent the 
occurrence of an imminent violation.
    (d) Denial based on criminal conviction. BXA may, in accordance with 
Sec. 766.25 of the EAR, issue an order denying the export privileges of 
any person who has been convicted of an offense specified in Sec. 11(h) 
of the EAA.

 Supplement No. 1 to Part 764--Standard Terms of Orders Denying Export 
                               Privileges

    (a) General. Orders denying export privileges may be ``standard'' or 
``non-standard.'' This supplement specifies terms of the standard order 
denying export privileges. All denial orders are published in the 
Federal Register. The failure by any person to comply with any denial 
order is a violation of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). 
(See General Prohibition Four at Sec. 736.2(b)(4) of the EAR; 
Sec. 764.2(k) of this part.) All persons whose export privileges are 
denied by any form of denial order are identified on the Denied Persons 
List (Supplement No. 2 to this part), with an indication of whether an 
order is standard or non-standard denoted in the ``Terms of order'' 
column. The Denied Persons List also tells you where each denial order 
can be found in the Federal Register. Reference should be made to the 
text of the denial order, as published in the Federal Register, to learn 
the scope of any denial order, including any non-standard denial order.
    Denial orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, are to be construed, 
insofar as possible, as having the same scope and effect as the standard 
denial order.

[[Page 426]]

    The introduction to each denial order shall be specific to that 
order, and shall include: (1) The name and address of any denied persons 
and any related persons subject to the denial order; (2) the basis for 
the denial order, such as final decision following charges of violation, 
settlement agreement, Sec. 11(h) of the EAA, or temporary denial order 
request; (3) the period of denial, the effective date of the order, 
whether and for how long any portion of the denial of export privileges 
is suspended, and any conditions of probation; and (4) whether any or 
all outstanding licenses issued under the EAR to the person(s) named in 
the denial order or in which such person(s) has an interest, are 
suspended or revoked.
    (b) Standard text. The standard denial order shall provide:
    ``It is therefore ordered:
    First, that [the denied person(s)] may not, directly or indirectly, 
participate in any way in any transaction involving any commodity, 
software or technology (hereinafter collectively referred to as 
``item'') exported or to be exported from the United States that is 
subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), or in any other 
activity subject to the EAR, including, but not limited to:
    A. Applying for, obtaining, or using any license, License Exception, 
or export control document;
    B. Carrying on negotiations concerning, or ordering, buying, 
receiving, using, selling, delivering, storing, disposing of, 
forwarding, transporting, financing, or otherwise servicing in any way, 
any transaction involving any item exported or to be exported from the 
United States that is subject to the EAR, or in any other activity 
subject to the EAR; or
    C. Benefiting in any way from any transaction involving any item 
exported or to be exported from the United States that is subject to the 
EAR, or in any other activity subject to the EAR.
    Second, that no person may, directly or indirectly, do any of the 
following:
    A. Export or reexport to or on behalf of the denied person any item 
subject to the EAR;
    B. Take any action that facilitates the acquisition or attempted 
acquisition by a denied person of the ownership, possession, or control 
of any item subject to the EAR that has been or will be exported from 
the United States, including financing or other support activities 
related to a transaction whereby a denied person acquires or attempts to 
acquire such ownership, possession or control;
    C. Take any action to acquire from or to facilitate the acquisition 
or attempted acquisition from the denied person of any item subject to 
the EAR that has been exported from the United States;
    D. Obtain from the denied person in the United States any item 
subject to the EAR with knowledge or reason to know that the item will 
be, or is intended to be, exported from the United States; or
    E. Engage in any transaction to service any item subject to the EAR 
that has been or will be exported from the United States and which is 
owned, possessed or controlled by a denied person, or service any item, 
of whatever origin, that is owned, possessed or controlled by a denied 
person if such service involves the use of any item subject to the EAR 
that has been or will be exported from the United States. For purposes 
of this paragraph, servicing means installation, maintenance, repair, 
modification or testing.
    Third, that, after notice and opportunity for comment as provided in 
Sec. 766.23 of the EAR, any person, firm, corporation, or business 
organization related to the denied person by affiliation, ownership, 
control, or position of responsibility in the conduct of trade or 
related services may also be made subject to the provisions of this 
order.
    Fourth, that this order does not prohibit any export, reexport, or 
other transaction subject to the EAR where the only items involved that 
are subject to the EAR are the foreign-produced direct product of U.S.-
origin technology.
    This order, which constitutes the final agency action in this 
matter, is effective immediately.''

            Supplement No. 2 to Part 764--Denied Persons List

    (a) General. (1) The Denied Persons List identifies those persons 
denied export privileges by the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) 
pursuant to the terms of an order. Part A of the Denied Persons List 
lists all denied persons in alphabetical order and provides 
supplementary information, while Part B lists all denied persons by 
geographic area. Part A of the Denied Persons List is organized into 
five columns, including the name and address of the denied person, the 
effective and expiration dates of the order, a brief description of the 
terms of the order, and a citation to the Federal Register where the 
terms of the order can be located. Reference should always be made to 
the text of a denial order when using the Denied Persons List.
    (2) Denial orders issued subsequent to March 25, 1996, shall be 
identified in part A as being standard or non-standard, and denial 
orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, shall be construed, insofar as 
possible, as having the same scope and effect as the standard denial 
order. Non-standard orders are denoted by the phrase ``non-standard'' in 
the ``Terms of order'' column in part A, standard orders are denoted by 
the word ``standard,'' and orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, are 
denoted by the same brief description entered at the time of issuance. 
Standard orders denying export privileges

[[Page 427]]

contain the standard terms set forth in Supplement No. 1 to part 764.
    (3) You are responsible for ensuring that you take no action 
involving items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) 
that is contrary to the terms of a denial order.
    (b) Related persons. Related persons who are denied export 
privileges subsequent to [the effective date of the interim EAR] shall 
appear in part A of the Denied Persons List with a note identifying the 
denied persons to whom they are related in the column entitled ``Terms 
of order.''
    (c) Publication. New and amended denial orders are published in the 
Federal Register as they are issued. This publication constitutes 
official notice to the public.
    (d) Updates and availability. (1) As a convenience for the public, 
issuance of denial orders is announced in Export Administration 
Bulletins. Part A of the Denied Persons List is also available 
electronically on two bulletin boards of Department of Commerce 
agencies, Fedworld (National Technical Information Service) and the 
Economic Bulletin Board (Economics and Statistics Administration).

Sec. 766.1  Scope.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. This part describes the procedures for imposing 
administrative sanctions for violations of the Export Administration Act 
of 1979, as amended (the EAA), the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR), or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. Parts 
760 and 764 of the EAR specify those actions that constitute violations, 
and part 764 describes the sanctions that apply. In addition to 
describing the procedures for imposing sanctions, this part describes 
the procedures for imposing temporary denial orders to prevent imminent 
violations of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization 
issued thereunder. This part also describes the procedures for taking 
the discretionary protective administrative action of denying the export 
privileges of persons who have been convicted of violating any of the 
statutes, including the EAA, listed in section 11(h) of the EAA. Nothing 
in this part shall be construed as applying to or limiting other 
administrative or enforcement action relating to the EAA or the EAR, 
including the exercise of any investigative authorities conferred by the 
EAA. This part does not confer any procedural rights or impose any 
requirements based on the Administrative Procedure Act for proceedings 
charging violations under the EAA, except as expressly provided for in 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 766.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the following definitions apply:
    Administrative law judge. The person authorized to conduct hearings 
in administrative enforcement proceedings brought under the EAA or to 
hear appeals from the imposition of temporary denial orders. The term 
``judge'' may be used for brevity when it is clear that the reference is 
to the administrative law judge.

Sec. 766.3  Institution of administrative enforcement proceedings.

    (a) Charging letters. The Director of the Office of Export 
Enforcement <SUP>1</SUP> (OEE) or the Director of the Office of 
Antiboycott Compliance (OAC), as appropriate, may begin administrative 
enforcement proceedings under this part by issuing a charging letter in 
the name of BXA. The charging letter shall constitute the formal 
complaint and will state that there is reason to believe that a 
violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization 
issued thereunder, has occurred. It will set forth the essential facts 
about the alleged violation, refer to the specific regulatory or other 
provisions involved, and give notice of the sanctions available under 
part 764 of the EAR. The charging letter will inform the respondent that 
failure to answer the charges as provided in Sec. 766.6 of this part 
will be treated as a default under Sec. 766.7 of this part, that the 
respondent is entitled to a hearing if a written demand for one is 
requested with the answer, and that the respondent may be represented by 
counsel, or by other authorized representative who has a power of 
attorney to represent the respondent. A copy of the charging letter 
shall be filed with the administrative law judge, which filing shall 
toll the running of the applicable statute of limitations. Charging 
letters may be amended or supplemented at any time before an answer is 
filed, or, with permission of the administrative law judge, afterwards. 
BXA may unilaterally withdraw charging letters at any time, by notifying 
the respondent and the administrative law judge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


    \1\ By agreement with the Director of the Office of Strategic 
Industries and Economic Resource Administration, the Director of the 
Office of Export Enforcement enforces short supply controls imposed 
under section 7 of the EAA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Notice of issuance of charging letter instituting administrative 
enforcement proceeding. A respondent shall be notified of the issuance 
of a charging letter, or any amendment or supplement thereto:
    (1) By mailing a copy by registered or certified mail addressed to 
the respondent at the respondent's last known address;
    (2) By leaving a copy with the respondent or with an officer, a 
managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment 
or by law to receive service of process for the respondent; or
    (3) By leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion 
who resides at the respondent's last known dwelling.

[[Page 429]]

    (4) Delivery of a copy of the charging letter, if made in the manner 
described in paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, shall be evidenced 
by a certificate of service signed by the person making such service, 
stating the method of service and the identity of the person with whom 
the charging letter was left. The certificate of service shall be filed 
with the administrative law judge.
    (c) Date. The date of service of notice of the issuance of a 
charging letter instituting an administrative enforcement proceeding, or 
service of notice of the issuance of a supplement or amendment to a 
charging letter, is the date of its delivery, or of its attempted 
delivery if delivery is refused.


<R05>
Sec. 766.4  Representation.

    A respondent individual may appear and participate in person, a 
corporation by a duly authorized officer or employee, and a partnership 
by a partner. If a respondent is represented by counsel, counsel shall 
be a member in good standing of the bar of any State, Commonwealth or 
Territory of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, or be 
licensed to practice law in the country in which counsel resides if not 
the United States. A respondent personally, or through counsel or other 
representative, shall file a notice of appearance with the 
administrative law judge. BXA will be represented by the Office of Chief 
Counsel for Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 766.5  Filing and service of papers other than charging letter.

    (a) Filing. All papers to be filed shall be addressed to ``EAR 
Administrative Enforcement Proceedings,'' U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Room H-6716, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20230, or such other place as the administrative law judge may 
designate. Filing by United States mail, first class postage prepaid, by 
express or equivalent parcel delivery service, or by hand delivery, is 
acceptable. Filing by mail from a foreign country shall be by airmail. 
In addition, the administrative law judge may authorize filing of papers 
by facsimile or other electronic means, provided that a hard copy of any 
such paper is subsequently filed. A copy of each paper filed shall be 
simultaneously served on each party.
    (b) Service. Service shall be made by personal delivery or by 
mailing one copy of each paper to each party in the proceeding. Service 
by delivery service or facsimile, in the manner set forth in paragraph 
(a) of this section, is acceptable. Service on BXA shall be addressed to 
the Chief Counsel for Export Administration, Room H-3839, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20230. Service on a respondent shall be to the address 
to which the charging letter was sent or to such other address as 
respondent may provide. When a party has appeared by counsel or other 
representative, service on counsel or other representative shall 
constitute service on that party.
    (c) Date. The date of filing or service is the day when the papers 
are deposited in the mail or are delivered in person, by delivery 
service, or by facsimile.
    (d) Certificate of service. A certificate of service signed by the 
party making service, stating the date and manner of service, shall 
accompany every paper, other than the charging letter, filed and served 
on parties.
    (e) Computing period of time. In computing any period of time 
prescribed or allowed by this part or by order of the administrative law 
judge or the Under Secretary, the day of the act, event, or default from 
which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. 
The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a 
Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure), in which case the period runs until 
the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a 
legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are 
excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or 
allowed is seven days or less.


<R05>
Sec. 766.6  Answer and demand for hearing.

    (a) When to answer. The respondent must answer the charging letter 
within

[[Page 430]]

30 days after being served with notice of the issuance of a charging 
letter instituting an administrative enforcement proceeding, or within 
30 days of notice of any supplement or amendment to a charging letter, 
unless time is extended under Sec. 766.16 of this part.
    (b) Contents of answer. The answer must be responsive to the 
charging letter and must fully set forth the nature of the respondent's 
defense or defenses. The answer must admit or deny specifically each 
separate allegation of the charging letter; if the respondent is without 
knowledge, the answer must so state and will operate as a denial. 
Failure to deny or controvert a particular allegation will be deemed an 
admission of that allegation. The answer must also set forth any 
additional or new matter the respondent believes supports a defense or 
claim of mitigation. Any defense or partial defense not specifically set 
forth in the answer shall be deemed waived, and evidence thereon may be 
refused, except for good cause shown.
    (c) Demand for hearing. If the respondent desires a hearing, a 
written demand for one must be submitted with the answer. Any demand by 
BXA for a hearing must be filed with the administrative law judge within 
30 days after service of the answer. Failure to make a timely written 
demand for a hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the party's right to a 
hearing, except for good cause shown. If no party demands a hearing, the 
matter will go forward in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 766.15 of this part.
    (d) English language required. The answer, all other papers, and all 
documentary evidence must be submitted in English, or translations into 
English must be filed and served at the same time.


<R05>
Sec. 766.7  Default.

    (a) General. Failure of the respondent to file an answer within the 
time provided constitutes a waiver of the respondent's right to appear 
and contest the allegations in the charging letter. In such event, the 
administrative law judge, on BXA's motion and without further notice to 
the respondent, shall find the facts to be as alleged in the charging 
letter and render an initial or recommended decision containing findings 
of fact and appropriate conclusions of law and issue or recommend an 
order imposing appropriate sanctions. The decision and order shall be 
subject to review by the Under Secretary in accordance with the 
applicable procedures set forth in Sec. 766.21 or Sec. 766.22 of this 
part.
    (b) Petition to set aside default--(1) Procedure. Upon petition 
filed by a respondent against whom a default order has been issued, 
which petition is accompanied by an answer meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 766.6(b) of this part, the Under Secretary may, after giving all 
parties an opportunity to comment, and for good cause shown, set aside 
the default and vacate the order entered thereon and remand the matter 
to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.
    (2) Time limits. A petition under this section must be made within 
one year of the date of entry of the order which the petition seeks to 
have vacated.


<R05>
Sec. 766.8  Summary decision.

    At any time after a proceeding has been initiated, a party may move 
for a summary decision disposing of some or all of the issues. The 
administrative law judge may render an initial or recommended decision 
and issue or recommend an order if the entire record shows, as to the 
issue(s) under consideration:
    (a) That there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and
    (b) That the moving party is entitled to a summary decision as a 
matter of law.


<R05>
Sec. 766.9  Discovery.

    (a) General. The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary 
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the 
subject matter of the pending proceeding. The provisions of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure relating to discovery apply to the extent 
consistent with this part and except as otherwise provided by the 
administrative law judge or by waiver or agreement of the parties. The 
administrative law judge may make any order which justice requires to 
protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or 
undue

[[Page 431]]

burden or expense. These orders may include limitations on the scope, 
method, time and place of discovery, and provisions for protecting the 
confidentiality of classified or otherwise sensitive information.
    (b) Interrogatories and requests for admission or production of 
documents. A party may serve on any party interrogatories, requests for 
admission, or requests for production of documents for inspection and 
copying, and a party concerned may apply to the administrative law judge 
for such enforcement or protective order as that party deems warranted 
with respect to such discovery. The service of a discovery request shall 
be made at least 20 days before the scheduled date of the hearing unless 
the administrative law judge specifies a shorter time period. Copies of 
interrogatories, requests for admission and requests for production of 
documents and responses thereto shall be served on all parties, and a 
copy of the certificate of service shall be filed with the 
administrative law judge. Matters of fact or law of which admission is 
requested shall be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in 
the request (at least 10 days after service, or within such additional 
time as the administrative law judge may allow), the party to whom the 
request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement 
either denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested 
or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party to whom the request 
is directed cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters.
    (c) Depositions. Upon application of a party and for good cause 
shown, the administrative law judge may order the taking of the 
testimony of any person by deposition and the production of specified 
documents or materials by the person at the deposition. The application 
shall state the purpose of the deposition and set forth the facts sought 
to be established through the deposition.
    (d) Enforcement. The administrative law judge may order a party to 
answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or things or 
to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a 
party does not comply with such an order, the administrative law judge 
may make a determination or enter any order in the proceeding as the 
judge deems reasonable and appropriate. The judge may strike related 
charges or defenses in whole or in part or may take particular facts 
relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or refused 
to respond as being established for purposes of the proceeding in 
accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In 
addition, enforcement by a district court of the United States may be 
sought under section 12(a) of the EAA.


<R05>
Sec. 766.10  Subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. Upon the application of any party, supported by a 
satisfactory showing that there is substantial reason to believe that 
the evidence would not otherwise be available, the administrative law 
judge will issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of 
witnesses and the production of such books, records or other documentary 
or physical evidence for the purpose of the hearing, as the judge deems 
relevant and material to the proceedings, and reasonable in scope.
    (b) Service. Subpoenas issued by the administrative law judge may be 
served in any of the methods set forth in Sec. 766.5(b) of this part.
    (c) Timing. Applications for subpoenas must be submitted at least 10 
days before the scheduled hearing or deposition, unless the 
administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown, that 
extraordinary circumstances warrant a shorter time.


<R05>
Sec. 766.11  Matter protected against disclosure.

    (a) Protective measures. It is often necessary for BXA to receive 
and consider information and documents that are sensitive from the 
standpoint of national security, foreign policy, business 
confidentiality, or investigative concern, and that are to be protected 
against disclosure. Accordingly, and without limiting the discretion of 
the administrative law judge to give effect to any other applicable 
privilege, it is proper for the administrative law judge to limit 
discovery or introduction of evidence or to issue such protective or

[[Page 432]]

other orders as in the judge's judgment may be consistent with the 
objective of preventing undue disclosure of the sensitive documents or 
information. Where the administrative law judge determines that 
documents containing the sensitive matter need to be made available to a 
respondent to avoid prejudice, the judge may direct BXA to prepare an 
unclassified and nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents. The 
administrative law judge may compare the extract or summary with the 
original to ensure that it is supported by the source document and that 
it omits only so much as must remain classified or undisclosed. The 
summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.
    (b) Arrangements for access. If the administrative law judge 
determines that this procedure is unsatisfactory and that classified or 
otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the record in order to 
avoid prejudice to a party, the judge may provide the parties 
opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a representative 
to have access to such matter without compromising sensitive 
information. Such arrangements may include obtaining security 
clearances, obtaining a national interest determination under section 
12(c) of the EAA, or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive 
information and documents subject to assurances against further 
disclosure, including a protective order, if necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 766.12  Prehearing conference.

    (a) The administrative law judge, on the judge's own motion or on 
request of a party, may direct the parties to participate in a 
prehearing conference, either in person or by telephone, to consider:
    (1) Simplification of issues;
    (2) The necessity or desirability of amendments to pleadings;
    (3) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid 
unnecessary proof; or
    (4) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the 
proceedings.
    (b) The administrative law judge may order the conference 
proceedings to be recorded electronically or taken by a reporter, 
transcribed and filed with the judge.
    (c) If a prehearing conference is impracticable, the administrative 
law judge may direct the parties to correspond with the judge to achieve 
the purposes of such a conference.
    (d) The administrative law judge will prepare a summary of any 
actions agreed on or taken pursuant to this section. The summary will 
include any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties.


<R05>
Sec. 766.13  Hearings.

    (a) Scheduling. The administrative law judge, by agreement with the 
parties or upon notice to all parties of not less than 30 days, will 
schedule a hearing. All hearings will be held in Washington, D.C., 
unless the administrative law judge determines, for good cause shown, 
that another location would better serve the interests of justice.
    (b) Hearing procedure. Hearings will be conducted in a fair and 
impartial manner by the administrative law judge, who may limit 
attendance at any hearing or portion thereof to the parties, their 
representatives and witnesses if the judge deems this necessary or 
advisable in order to protect sensitive matter (see Sec. 766.11 of this 
part) from improper disclosure. The rules of evidence prevailing in 
courts of law do not apply, and all evidentiary material deemed by the 
administrative law judge to be relevant and material to the proceeding 
and not unduly repetitious will be received and given appropriate 
weight.
    (c) Testimony and record. Witnesses will testify under oath or 
affirmation. A verbatim record of the hearing and of any other oral 
proceedings will be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, 
transcribed and filed with the administrative law judge. A respondent 
may examine the transcript and may obtain a copy by paying any 
applicable costs. Upon such terms as the administrative law judge deems 
just, the judge may direct that the testimony of any person be taken by 
deposition and may admit an affidavit or declaration as evidence, 
provided that any affidavits or declarations have been filed and served 
on the parties sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit a party

[[Page 433]]

to file and serve an objection thereto on the grounds that it is 
necessary that the affiant or declarant testify at the hearing and be 
subject to cross-examination.
    (d) Failure to appear. If a party fails to appear in person or by 
counsel at a scheduled hearing, the hearing may nevertheless proceed, 
and that party's failure to appear will not affect the validity of the 
hearing or any proceedings or action taken thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 766.14  Interlocutory review of rulings.

    (a) At the request of a party, or on the judge's own initiative, the 
administrative law judge may certify to the Under Secretary for review a 
ruling that does not finally dispose of a proceeding, if the 
administrative law judge determines that immediate review may hasten or 
facilitate the final disposition of the matter.
    (b) Upon certification to the Under Secretary of the interlocutory 
ruling for review, the parties will have 10 days to file and serve 
briefs stating their positions, and five days to file and serve replies, 
following which the Under Secretary will decide the matter promptly.


<R05>
Sec. 766.15  Proceeding without a hearing.

    If the parties have waived a hearing, the case will be decided on 
the record by the administrative law judge. Proceeding without a hearing 
does not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts 
supporting their charges or defenses. Affidavits or declarations, 
depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories and stipulations may 
supplement other documentary evidence in the record. The administrative 
law judge will give each party reasonable opportunity to file rebuttal 
evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 766.16  Procedural stipulations; extension of time.

    (a) Procedural stipulations. Unless otherwise ordered, a written 
stipulation agreed to by all parties and filed with the administrative 
law judge will modify any procedures established by this part.
    (b) Extension of time. (1) The parties may extend any applicable 
time limitation, by stipulation filed with the administrative law judge 
before the time limitation expires.
    (2) The administrative law judge may, on the judge's own initiative 
or upon application by any party, either before or after the expiration 
of any applicable time limitation, extend the time within which to file 
and serve an answer to a charging letter or do any other act required by 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 766.17  Decision of the administrative law judge.

    (a) Predecisional matters. Except for default proceedings under 
Sec. 766.7 of this part, the administrative law judge will give the 
parties reasonable opportunity to submit the following, which will be 
made a part of the record:
    (1) Exceptions to any ruling by the judge or to the admissibility of 
evidence proffered at the hearing;
    (2) Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (3) Supporting legal arguments for the exceptions and proposed 
findings and conclusions submitted; and
    (4) A proposed order.
    (b) Decision and order. After considering the entire record in the 
proceeding, the administrative law judge will issue a written decision.
    (1) Initial decision. For proceedings charging violations relating 
to part 760 of the EAR, the decision rendered shall be an initial 
decision. The decision will include findings of fact, conclusions of 
law, and findings as to whether there has been a violation of the EAA, 
the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder. If 
the administrative law judge finds that the evidence of record is 
insufficient to sustain a finding that a violation has occurred with 
respect to one or more charges, the judge shall order dismissal of the 
charges in whole or in part, as appropriate. If the administrative law 
judge finds that one or more violations have been committed, the judge 
may issue an order imposing administrative sanctions, as provided in 
part 764 of the EAR. The decision and order shall be served on each 
party, and shall become effective as the final decision of the 
Department 30 days after service, unless an appeal is filed in 
accordance with Sec. 766.21 of this part.

[[Page 434]]

    (2) Recommended decision. For proceedings not involving violations 
relating to part 760 of the EAR, the decision rendered shall be a 
recommended decision. The decision will include recommended findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and findings as to whether there has been a 
violation of the EAA, the EAR or any order, license or authorization 
issued thereunder. If the administrative law judge finds that the 
evidence of record is insufficient to sustain a recommended finding that 
a violation has occurred with respect to one or more charges, the judge 
shall recommend dismissal of any such charge. If the administrative law 
judge finds that one or more violations have been committed, the judge 
shall recommend an order imposing administrative sanctions, as provided 
in part 764 of the EAR, or such other action as the judge deems 
appropriate. The administrative law judge shall immediately certify the 
record, including the original copy of the recommended decision and 
order, to the Under Secretary for review in accordance with Sec. 766.22 
of this part. The administrative law judge shall also immediately serve 
the recommended decision on all parties. Because of the time limits 
established in the EAA for review by the Under Secretary, service upon 
parties shall be by personal delivery, express mail or other overnight 
carrier.
    (c) Suspension of sanctions. Any order imposing administrative 
sanctions may provide for the suspension of the sanction imposed, in 
whole or in part and on such terms of probation or other conditions as 
the administrative law judge or the Under Secretary may specify. Any 
suspension order may be modified or revoked by the signing official upon 
application of BXA showing a violation of the probationary terms or 
other conditions, after service on the respondent of notice of the 
application in accordance with the service provisions of Sec. 766.3 of 
this part, and with such opportunity for response as the responsible 
signing official in his/her discretion may allow. A copy of any order 
modifying or revoking the suspension shall also be served on the 
respondent in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 766.3 of this part.
    (d) Time for decision. Administrative enforcement proceedings not 
involving violations relating to part 760 of the EAR shall be concluded, 
including review by the Under Secretary under Sec. 766.22 of this part, 
within one year of the submission of a charging letter, unless the 
administrative law judge, for good cause shown, extends such period. The 
charging letter will be deemed to have been submitted to the 
administrative law judge on the date the respondent files an answer or 
on the date BXA files a motion for a default order pursuant to 
Sec. 766.7(a) of this part, whichever occurs first.


<R05>
Sec. 766.18  Settlement.

    (a) Cases may be settled before service of a charging letter. In 
cases in which settlement is reached before service of a charging 
letter, a proposed charging letter will be prepared, and a settlement 
proposal consisting of a settlement agreement and order will be 
submitted to the Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the 
Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, he/she will notify 
the parties and the case will proceed as though no settlement proposal 
had been made. If the Assistant Secretary approves the proposal, he/she 
will issue an appropriate order, and no action will be required by the 
administrative law judge.
    (b) Cases may also be settled after service of a charging letter. 
(1) If the case is pending before the administrative law judge, the 
judge shall stay the proceedings for a reasonable period of time, 
usually not to exceed 30 days, upon notification by the parties that 
they have entered into good faith settlement negotiations. The 
administrative law judge may, in his/her discretion, grant additional 
stays. If settlement is reached, a proposal will be submitted to the 
Assistant Secretary for approval and signature. If the Assistant 
Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an appropriate order, 
and notify the administrative law judge that the case is withdrawn from 
adjudication. If the Assistant Secretary does not approve the proposal, 
he/she will notify the parties and the case will proceed to adjudication 
by the administrative law judge as though no settlement proposal had 
been made.

[[Page 435]]

    (2) If the case is pending before the Under Secretary under 
Sec. 766.21 or Sec. 766.22 of this part, the parties may submit a 
settlement proposal to the Under Secretary for approval and signature. 
If the Under Secretary approves the proposal, he/she will issue an 
appropriate order. If the Under Secretary does not approve the proposal, 
the case will proceed to final decision in accordance with Sec. 766.21 
or Sec. 766.22 of this part, as appropriate.
    (c) Any order disposing of a case by settlement may suspend the 
administrative sanction imposed, in whole or in part, on such terms of 
probation or other conditions as the signing official may specify. Any 
such suspension may be modified or revoked by the signing official, in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 766.17(c) of this part.
    (d) Any respondent who agrees to an order imposing any 
administrative sanction does so solely for the purpose of resolving the 
claims in the administrative enforcement proceeding brought under this 
part. This reflects the fact that BXA has neither the authority nor the 
responsibility for instituting, conducting, settling, or otherwise 
disposing of criminal proceedings. That authority and responsibility are 
vested in the Attorney General and the Department of Justice.
    (e) Cases that are settled may not be reopened or appealed.


<R05>
Sec. 766.19  Reopening.

    The respondent may petition the administrative law judge within one 
year of the date of the final decision, except where the decision arises 
from a default judgment or from a settlement, to reopen an 
administrative enforcement proceeding to receive any relevant and 
material evidence which was unknown or unobtainable at the time the 
proceeding was held. The petition must include a summary of such 
evidence, the reasons why it is deemed relevant and material, and the 
reasons why it could not have been presented at the time the proceedings 
were held. The administrative law judge will grant or deny the petition 
after providing other parties reasonable opportunity to comment. If the 
proceeding is reopened, the administrative law judge may make such 
arrangements as the judge deems appropriate for receiving the new 
evidence and completing the record. The administrative law judge will 
then issue a new initial or recommended decision and order, and the case 
will proceed to final decision and order in accordance with Sec. 766.21 
or Sec. 766.22 of this part, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 766.20  Record for decision and availability of documents.

    (a) General. The transcript of hearings, exhibits, rulings, orders, 
all papers and requests filed in the proceedings and, for purposes of 
any appeal under Sec. 766.21 of this part or review under Sec. 766.22 of 
this part, the decision of the administrative law judge and such 
submissions as are provided for by Secs. 766.21 and 766.22 of this part, 
will constitute the record and the exclusive basis for decision. When a 
case is settled after the service of a charging letter, the record will 
consist of any and all of the foregoing, as well as the settlement 
agreement and the order. When a case is settled before service of a 
charging letter, the record will consist of the proposed charging 
letter, the settlement agreement and the order.
    (b) Restricted access. On the judge's own motion, or on the motion 
of any party, the administrative law judge may direct that there be a 
restricted access portion of the record for any material in the record 
to which public access is restricted by law or by the terms of a 
protective order entered in the proceedings. A party seeking to restrict 
access to any portion of the record is responsible for submitting, at 
the time specified in Sec. 766.20(c)(2) of this part, a version of the 
document proposed for public availability that reflects the requested 
deletion. The restricted access portion of the record will be placed in 
a separate file and the file will be clearly marked to avoid improper 
disclosure and to identify it as a portion of the official record in the 
proceedings. The administrative law judge may act at any time to permit 
material that becomes declassified or unrestricted through passage of 
time to be transferred to the unrestricted access portion of the record.
    (c) Availability of documents--(1) Scope. (i) For proceedings 
started on or

[[Page 436]]

after October 12, 1979, all charging letters, answers, initial and 
recommended decisions, and orders disposing of a case will be made 
available for public inspection in the BXA Freedom of Information 
Records Inspection Facility, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-6624, 
14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. The 
complete record for decision, as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section will be made available on request. In addition, all 
decisions of the Under Secretary on appeal pursuant to Sec. 766.22 of 
this part and those final orders providing for denial, suspension or 
revocation of export privileges shall be published in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) For proceedings started before October 12, 1979, the public 
availability of the record for decision will be governed by the 
applicable regulations in effect when the proceedings were begun.
    (2) Timing--(i) Antiboycott cases. For matters relating to part 760 
of the EAR, documents are available immediately upon filing, except for 
any portion of the record for which a request for segregation is made. 
Parties that seek to restrict access to any portion of the record under 
paragraph (b) of this section must make such a request, together with 
the reasons supporting the claim of confidentiality, simultaneously with 
the submission of material for the record.
    (ii) Other cases. In all other cases, documents will be available 
only after the final administrative disposition of the case. In these 
cases, parties desiring to restrict access to any portion of the record 
under paragraph (b) of this section must assert their claim of 
confidentiality, together with the reasons for supporting the claim, 
before the close of the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 766.21  Appeals.

    (a) Grounds. For proceedings charging violations relating to part 
760 of the EAR, a party may appeal to the Under Secretary from an order 
disposing of a proceeding or an order denying a petition to set aside a 
default or a petition for reopening, on the grounds:
    (1) That a necessary finding of fact is omitted, erroneous or 
unsupported by substantial evidence of record;
    (2) That a necessary legal conclusion or finding is contrary to law;
    (3) That prejudicial procedural error occurred, or
    (4) That the decision or the extent of sanctions is arbitrary, 
capricious or an abuse of discretion. The appeal must specify the 
grounds on which the appeal is based and the provisions of the order 
from which the appeal is taken.
    (b) Filing of appeal. An appeal from an order must be filed with the 
Office of the Under Secretary for Export Administration, Bureau of 
Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room H-3898, 14th 
Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, within 30 
days after service of the order appealed from. If the Under Secretary 
cannot act on an appeal for any reason, the Under Secretary will 
designate another Department of Commerce official to receive and act on 
the appeal.
    (c) Effect of appeal. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the 
operation of any order, unless the order by its express terms so 
provides or unless the Under Secretary, upon application by a party and 
with opportunity for response, grants a stay.
    (d) Appeal procedure. The Under Secretary normally will not hold 
hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals. A full written statement 
in support of the appeal must be filed with the appeal and be 
simultaneously served on all parties, who shall have 30 days from 
service to file a reply. At his/her discretion, the Under Secretary may 
accept new submissions, but will not ordinarily accept those submissions 
filed more than 30 days after the filing of the reply to the appellant's 
first submission.
    (e) Decisions. The decision will be in writing and will be 
accompanied by an order signed by the Under Secretary giving effect to 
the decision. The order may either dispose of the case by affirming, 
modifying or reversing the order of the administrative law judge or may 
refer the case back to the administrative law judge for further 
proceedings.

[[Page 437]]


<R05>
Sec. 766.22  Review by Under Secretary.

    (a) Recommended decision. For proceedings not involving violations 
relating to part 760 of the EAR, the administrative law judge shall 
immediately refer the recommended decision and order to the Under 
Secretary. Because of the time limits provided under the EAA for review 
by the Under Secretary, service of the recommended decision and order on 
the parties, all papers filed by the parties in response, and the final 
decision of the Under Secretary must be by personal delivery, facsimile, 
express mail or other overnight carrier. If the Under Secretary cannot 
act on a recommended decision and order for any reason, the Under 
Secretary will designate another Department of Commerce official to 
receive and act on the recommendation.
    (b) Submissions by parties. Parties shall have 12 days from the date 
of issuance of the recommended decision and order in which to submit 
simultaneous responses. Parties thereafter shall have eight days from 
receipt of any response(s) in which to submit replies. Any response or 
reply must be received within the time specified by the Under Secretary.
    (c) Final decision. Within 30 days after receipt of the recommended 
decision and order, the Under Secretary shall issue a written order 
affirming, modifying or vacating the recommended decision and order of 
the administrative law judge. If he/she vacates the recommended decision 
and order, the Under Secretary may refer the case back to the 
administrative law judge for further proceedings. Because of the time 
limits, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily be limited to the 
written record for decision, including the transcript of any hearing, 
and any submissions by the parties concerning the recommended decision.
    (d) Delivery. The final decision and implementing order shall be 
served on the parties and will be publicly available in accordance with 
Sec. 766.20 of this part.
    (e) Appeals. The charged party may appeal the Under Secretary's 
written order within 15 days to the United States Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia pursuant to 50 U.S.C. app. Sec. 2412(c)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 766.23  Related persons.

    (a) General. In order to prevent evasion, certain types of orders 
under this part may be made applicable not only to the respondent, but 
also to other persons then or thereafter related to the respondent by 
ownership, control, position of responsibility, affiliation, or other 
connection in the conduct of trade or business. Orders that may be made 
applicable to related persons include those that deny or affect export 
privileges, including temporary denial orders, and those that exclude a 
respondent from practice before BXA.
    (b) Procedures. If BXA has reason to believe that a person is 
related to the respondent and that an order that is being sought or that 
has been issued should be made applicable to that person in order to 
prevent evasion of the order, BXA shall, except in an ex parte 
proceeding under Sec. 766.24(a) of this part, give that person notice in 
accordance with Sec. 766.5(b) of this part and an opportunity to oppose 
such action. If the official authorized to issue the order against the 
respondent finds that the order should be made applicable to that person 
in order to prevent evasion of the order that official shall issue or 
amend the order accordingly.
    (c) Appeals. Any person named by BXA in an order as related to the 
respondent may file an appeal with the administrative law judge. The 
sole issues to be raised and ruled on in any such appeal are whether the 
person so named is related to the respondent and whether the order is 
justified in order to prevent evasion. The recommended decision and 
order of the administrative law judge shall be reviewed by the Under 
Secretary in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sec. 766.22 of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 766.24  Temporary denials.

    (a) General. The procedures in this section apply to temporary 
denial orders issued on or after July 12, 1985. For temporary denial 
orders issued on or before July 11, 1985, the proceedings will be 
governed by the applicable regulations in effect at the time the 
temporary denial orders were issued. Without limiting any other action 
BXA may take under the EAR with respect

[[Page 438]]

to any application, order, license or authorization issued under the 
EAA, BXA may ask the Assistant Secretary to issue a temporary denial 
order on an ex parte basis to prevent an imminent violation, as defined 
in this section, of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or 
authorization issued thereunder. The temporary denial order will deny 
export privileges to any person named in the order as provided for in 
Sec. 764.3(a)(2) of the EAR.
    (b) Issuance. (1) The Assistant Secretary may issue an order 
temporarily denying to a person any or all of the export privileges 
described in part 764 of the EAR upon a showing by BXA that the order is 
necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of the 
EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder.
    (2) The temporary denial order shall define the imminent violation 
and state why it was issued without a hearing. Because all denial orders 
are public, the description of the imminent violation and the reasons 
for proceeding on an ex parte basis set forth therein shall be stated in 
a manner that is consistent with national security, foreign policy, 
business confidentiality, and investigative concerns.
    (3) A violation may be ``imminent'' either in time or in degree of 
likelihood. To establish grounds for the temporary denial order, BXA may 
show either that a violation is about to occur, or that the general 
circumstances of the matter under investigation or case under criminal 
or administrative charges demonstrate a likelihood of future violations. 
To indicate the likelihood of future violations, BXA may show that the 
violation under investigation or charges is significant, deliberate, 
covert and/or likely to occur again, rather than technical or negligent, 
and that it is appropriate to give notice to companies in the United 
States and abroad to cease dealing with the person in U.S.-origin items 
in order to reduce the likelihood that a person under investigation or 
charges continues to export or acquire abroad such items, risking 
subsequent disposition contrary to export control requirements. Lack of 
information establishing the precise time a violation may occur does not 
preclude a finding that a violation is imminent, so long as there is 
sufficient reason to believe the likelihood of a violation.
    (4) The temporary denial order will be issued for a period not 
exceeding 180 days.
    (5) Notice of the issuance of a temporary denial order on an ex 
parte basis shall be given in accordance with Sec. 766.5(b) of this part 
upon issuance.
    (c) Related persons. A temporary denial order may be made applicable 
to related persons in accordance with Sec. 766.23 of this part.
    (d) Renewal. (1) If, no later than 20 days before the expiration 
date of a temporary denial order, BXA believes that renewal of the 
denial order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an imminent 
violation, BXA may file a written request setting forth the basis for 
its belief, including any additional or changed circumstances, asking 
that the Assistant Secretary renew the temporary denial order, with 
modifications, if any are appropriate, for an additional period not 
exceeding 180 days. BXA's request shall be delivered to the respondent, 
or any agent designated for this purpose, in accordance with 
Sec. 766.5(b) of this part, which will constitute notice of the renewal 
application.
    (2) Non-resident respondents. To facilitate timely notice of renewal 
requests, a respondent not a resident of the United States may designate 
a local agent for this purpose and provide written notification of such 
designation to BXA in the manner set forth in Sec. 766.5(b) of this 
part.
    (3) Hearing. (i) A respondent may oppose renewal of a temporary 
denial order by filing with the Assistant Secretary a written 
submission, supported by appropriate evidence, to be received not later 
than seven days before the expiration date of such order. For good cause 
shown, the Assistant Secretary may consider submissions received not 
later than five days before the expiration date. The Assistant Secretary 
ordinarily will not allow discovery; however, for good cause shown in 
respondent's submission, he/she may allow the parties to take limited 
discovery, consisting of a request for production of

[[Page 439]]

documents. If requested by the respondent in the written submission, the 
Assistant Secretary shall hold a hearing on the renewal application. The 
hearing shall be on the record and ordinarily will consist only of oral 
argument. The only issue to be considered on BXA's request for renewal 
is whether the temporary denial order should be continued to prevent an 
imminent violation as defined herein.
    (ii) Any person designated as a related person may not oppose 
issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order, but may file an 
appeal in accordance with Sec. 766.2(3)(c) of this part.
    (iii) If no written opposition to BXA's renewal request is received 
within the specified time, the Assistant Secretary may issue the order 
renewing the temporary denial order without a hearing.
    (4) A temporary denial order may be renewed more than once.
    (e) Appeals--(1) Filing. (i) A respondent may, at any time, file an 
appeal of the initial or renewed temporary denial order with the 
administrative law judge.
    (ii) The filing of an appeal shall stay neither the effectiveness of 
the temporary denial order nor any application for renewal, nor will it 
operate to bar the Assistant Secretary's consideration of any renewal 
application.
    (2) Grounds. A respondent may appeal on the grounds that the finding 
that the order is necessary in the public interest to prevent an 
imminent violation is unsupported.
    (3) Appeal procedure. A full written statement in support of the 
appeal must be filed with the appeal together with appropriate evidence, 
and be simultaneously served on BXA, which shall have seven days from 
receipt to file a reply. Service on the administrative law judge shall 
be addressed to the Office of the Administrative Law Judge, U.S. 
Department of Commerce, Room H-6716, 14th Street and Constitution 
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Service on BXA shall be as set 
forth in Sec. 766.5(b) of this part. The administrative law judge 
normally will not hold hearings or entertain oral argument on appeals.
    (4) Recommended Decision. Within 10 working days after an appeal is 
filed, the administrative law judge shall submit a recommended decision 
to the Under Secretary, and serve copies on the parties, recommending 
whether the issuance or the renewal of the temporary denial order should 
be affirmed, modified or vacated.
    (5) Final decision. Within five working days after receipt of the 
recommended decision, the Under Secretary shall issue a written order 
accepting, rejecting or modifying the recommended decision. Because of 
the time constraints, the Under Secretary's review will ordinarily be 
limited to the written record for decision, including the transcript of 
any hearing. The issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order shall 
be affirmed only if there is reason to believe that the temporary denial 
order is required in the public interest to prevent an imminent 
violation of the EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or other 
authorization issued under the EAA. The Under Secretary's written order 
is final and is not subject to judicial review, except as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) Delivery. A copy of any temporary denial order issued or renewed 
and any final decision on appeal shall be published in the Federal 
Register and shall be delivered to BXA and to the respondent, or any 
agent designated for this purpose, and to any related person in the same 
manner as provided in Sec. 766.5 of this part for filing for papers 
other than a charging letter.
    (g) Judicial review. A respondent temporarily denied export 
privileges by order of the Under Secretary may appeal to the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia pursuant to 50 
U.S.C. app. Sec. 2412(d)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 766.25  Administrative action denying permission to apply for or use export licenses.

    (a) General. The Director of the Office of Exporter Services, in 
consultation with the Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, may 
deny permission to apply for or use any license, including any License 
Exception, to any person who has been convicted of a violation of the 
EAA, the EAR, or any order, license or authorization issued thereunder; 
any regulation, license or order issued under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50

[[Page 440]]

U.S.C. 1701-1706); 18 U.S.C. 793, 794 or 798; section 4(b) of the 
Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 783(b)), or section 38 of the 
Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778).
    (b) Procedure. Upon notification that a person has been convicted of 
a violation of one or more of the provisions specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Director of the Office of Exporter Services, in 
consultation with the Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, will 
determine whether to deny permission to apply for or use any export 
license, including any License Exception, to any such person. The 
Director of the Office of Exporter Services will notify each person 
denied under this section by letter stating that permission to apply for 
or use export licenses has been denied.
    (c) Criteria. In determining whether and for how long to deny U.S. 
export privileges to a person previously convicted of one or more of the 
statutes set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Director of the 
Office of Exporter Services may take into consideration any relevant 
information, including, but not limited to, the seriousness of the 
offense involved in the criminal prosecution, the nature and duration of 
the criminal sanctions imposed, and whether the person has undertaken 
any corrective measures.
    (d) Duration. Any denial of permission to apply for or use export 
licenses, including any License Exception, under this section shall not 
exceed 10 years from the date of the conviction of the person who is 
subject to the denial.
    (e) Effect. Any person denied permission to apply for and use 
licenses under this section will be considered a ``person denied export 
privileges'' for purposes of Sec. 736.2(b)(4) (General Prohibition 4--
Engage in actions prohibited by a denial order) and Sec. 764.2(k) of the 
EAR.
    (f) Publication. The name and address(es) of any person denied 
permission to apply for or use export licenses under this section will 
be published as described in Supplement No. 2 to part 764 of the EAR, 
noting that such action was taken pursuant to this section and section 
11(h) of the EAA.
    (g) Appeal. An appeal of an action under this section will be

    (h) Applicability to related person. The Director of the Office of 
Exporter Services, in consultation with the Director of the Office of 
Export Enforcement, may take action in accordance with Sec. 766.23 of 
this part to make applicable to related persons an order that is being 
sought or that has been issued under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 768.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
    (a) Authority. Pursuant to sections 5(f) and 5(h) of the Export 
Administration Act (EAA), the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export 
Administration directs the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) in 
gathering and analyzing all the evidence necessary for the

[[Page 441]]

Secretary to determine foreign availability.
    (b) Scope. This part applies only to the extent that items are 
controlled for national security purposes. This part does not apply to 
encryption items that were formerly controlled on the U.S. Munitions 
List and that were transferred to the Commerce Control List consistent 
with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the 
Presidential Memorandum of that date, which shall not be subject to any 
mandatory foreign availability review procedures.
    (c) Types of programs. There are two general programs of foreign 
availability:
    (1) Foreign availability to controlled countries. In this category 
are denied license assessments (see Secs. 768.4(b) and 768.7 of this 
part) and decontrol assessments (see Secs. 768.4(c) and 768.7 of this 
part).
    (2) Foreign availability to non-controlled countries. In this 
category are denied license assessments, decontrol assessments, and 
evaluations of eligibility for expedited licensing (see Sec. 768.8 of 
this part).
    (d) Definitions. The following are definitions of terms used in this 
part 768:
    Allegation. See foreign availability submission.
    Assessment. An evidentiary analysis that BXA conducts concerning the 
foreign availability of a given item based on the assessment criteria, 
data gathered by BXA, and the data and recommendations submitted by the 
Departments of Defense and State and other relevant departments and 
agencies, TAC committees, and industry.
    Assessment criteria. Statutorily established criteria that must be 
assessed for the Secretary to make a determination with respect to 
foreign availability. They are, available-in-fact, from a non-U.S. 
source, in sufficient quantity so as to render the control ineffective, 
and of comparable quality. (See Sec. 768.6 of this part).
    Available-in-fact. An item is available-in-fact to a country if it 
is produced within the country or if it may be obtained by that country 
from a third country. Ordinarily, items will not be considered 
available-in-fact to non-controlled countries if the items are available 
only under a validated national security license or a comparable 
authorization from a country that maintains export controls on such 
items cooperatively with the United States.
    Claimant. Any party who makes a foreign availability submission, 
excluding TACs.
    Comparable quality. An item is of comparable quality to an item 
controlled under the EAR if it possesses the characteristics specified 
in the Commerce Control List (CCL) for that item and is alike in key 
characteristics that include, but are not limited to: (1) Function; (2) 
technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4) maintainability 
and service life; and (5) any other attribute relevant to the purpose 
for which the control was placed on the item.
    Controlled countries. Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, 
Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cuba, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Laos, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, North Korea, Romania, 
Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and the 
People's Republic of China.
    Decontrol. Removal of license requirements under the EAR.
    Decontrol assessment. An assessment of the foreign availability of 
an item to a country or countries for purposes of determining whether 
decontrol is warranted. Such assessments may be conducted after BXA 
receives a foreign availability submission or a TAC certification, or by 
the Secretary's own initiative.
    Denied license assessment. A foreign availability assessment 
conducted as a result of a claimant's allegation of foreign availability 
for an item (or items) that BXA has denied or has issued a letter of 
intent to deny a license. If the Secretary determines that foreign 
availability exists, BXA's approval of a license will be limited to the 
items, countries, and quantities in the allegation.
    Determination. The Secretary's decision that foreign availability 
within the meaning of the EAA does or does not exist. (See Sec. 768.7 of 
this part).

[[Page 442]]

    Expedited licensing procedure eligibility evaluation. An evaluation 
that BXA initiates for the purpose of determining whether an item is 
eligible for the expedited licensing procedure. (See Sec. 768.8 of this 
part).
    Expedited licensing procedures. Under expedited licensing 
procedures, BXA reviews and processes a license application for the 
export of an eligible item to a non-controlled country within statutory 
time limits. Licenses are deemed approved unless BXA denies within the 
statutory time limits (See Sec. 768.8 of this part).
    Foreign availability submission (FAS). An allegation of foreign 
availability a claimant makes, supported by reasonable evidence, and 
submits to BXA. (See Sec. 768.5 of this part).
    Item. Any commodity, software, or technology.
    Items eligible for non-controlled country expedited licensing 
procedures. The items described in Supplement No. 2 to this part 768 are 
eligible for the expedited license procedures (See Sec. 768.8 of this 
part).
    National Security Override (NSO). A Presidential decision to 
maintain export controls on an item notwithstanding its foreign 
availability as determined under the EAA. The President's decision is 
based on his/her determination that the absence of the controls would 
prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. Once 
the President makes such a decision, the President must actively pursue 
negotiations to eliminate foreign availability with the governments of 
the sources of foreign availability. (See Sec. 768.7 of this part).
    Non-controlled countries. Any country not defined as a controlled 
country by this section.
    Non-U.S. source/foreign source. A person located outside the 
jurisdiction of the United States (as defined in part 772 of the EAR).
    Reasonable evidence. Relevant information that is credible.
    Reliable evidence. Relevant information that is credible and 
dependable.
    Secretary. As used in this part, the Secretary refers to the 
Secretary of Commerce or his/her designee.
    Similar quality. An item is of similar quality to an item that is 
controlled under the EAR if it is substantially alike in key 
characteristics that may include, but are not limited to: (1) Function; 
(2) technological approach; (3) performance thresholds; (4) 
maintainability and service life; and (5) any other attribute relevant 
to the purpose for which the control was placed on the item.
    Sufficient quantity. The amount of an item that would render the 
U.S. export control, or the denial of the license in question, 
ineffective in achieving its purpose. For a controlled country, it is 
the quantity that meets the military needs of that country so that U.S. 
exports of the item to that country would not make a significant 
contribution to its military potential.
    Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). A Committee created under 
section 5(h) of the EAA that advises and assists the Secretary of 
Commerce, the Secretary of Defense, and any other department, agency, or 
official of the Government of the United States to which the President 
delegates authority under the EAA on export control matters related to 
specific areas of controlled items.
    TAC certification. A statement that a TAC submits to BXA, supported 
by reasonable evidence, documented as in a FAS, that foreign 
availability to a controlled country exists for an item that falls 
within the TAC's area of technical expertise.

Sec. 768.2  Foreign availability described.

    (a) Foreign availability. Foreign availability exists when the 
Secretary determines that an item is comparable in quality to an item 
subject to U.S. national security export controls, and is available-in-
fact to a country, from a non-U.S. source, in sufficient quantities to 
render the U.S. export control of that item or the denial of a license 
ineffective. For a controlled country, such control or denial is 
``ineffective'' when maintaining such control or denying a specific 
license would not restrict the availability of items that would make a 
significant contribution to the military potential of the controlled 
country or combination of

[[Page 443]]

countries detrimental to the national security of the United States (see 
sections 5(a) and 3(2)(A) of the EAA.)
    (b) Types of foreign availability. There are two types of foreign 
availability:
    (1) Foreign availability to a controlled country; and
    (2) Foreign availability to a non-controlled country.

    (Note to paragraph (b) of this section: See Sec. 768.7 of this part 
for delineation of the foreign availability assessment procedures, and 
Sec. 768.6 of this part for the criteria used in determining foreign 
availability)


<R05>
Sec. 768.3  Foreign availability assessment.

    (a) Foreign availability assessment. A foreign availability 
assessment is an evidentiary analysis that BXA conducts to assess the 
foreign availability of a given item according to the assessment 
criteria, based on data submitted by a claimant, the data gathered by 
BXA, and the data and recommendations submitted by the Departments of 
Defense and State and other relevant departments and agencies, TAC 
committees, and industry. BXA uses the results of the analysis in 
formulating its recommendation to the Secretary on whether foreign 
availability exists for a given item. If the Secretary determines that 
foreign availability exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for 
national security reasons or approve the license in question if there is 
no foreign policy reason to deny the license, unless the President 
exercises a National Security Override (see Sec. 768.7 of this part). 
The effect of any such determination on the effectiveness of foreign 
policy controls may be considered independent of this part.
    (b) Types of assessments. There are two types of foreign 
availability assessments:
    (1) Denied license assessment; and
    (2) Decontrol assessment.
    (c) Expedited licensing procedures. See Sec. 768.8 of this part for 
the evaluation of eligibility of an item for the expedited licensing 
procedures.
[61 FR 12915, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 68585, Dec. 30, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 768.4  Initiation of an assessment.

    (a) Assessment request. To initiate an assessment, each claimant or 
TAC must submit a FAS or a TAC Certification to BXA. TACs are authorized 
to certify foreign availability only to controlled countries. Claimants 
can allege foreign availability for either controlled or non-controlled 
countries.
    (b) Denied license assessment. A claimant whose license application 
BXA has denied, or for which it has issued a letter of intent to deny on 
national security grounds, may request that BXA initiate a denied 
license assessment by submitting a Foreign Availability Submission (FAS) 
within 90 days after denial of the license. As part of its submission, 
the claimant must request that the specified license application be 
approved on the grounds of foreign availability. The evidence must 
relate to the particular export as described on the license application 
and to the alleged comparable item. If foreign availability is found, 
the Secretary will approve the license for the specific items, 
countries, and quantities listed on the application. The denied license 
assessment procedure, however, is not intended to result in the removal 
of the U.S. export control on an item by incrementally providing a 
country with amounts that, taken together, would constitute a sufficient 
quantity of an item. The Secretary will not approve on foreign 
availability grounds a denied license if the approval of such license 
would itself render the U.S. export control ineffective in achieving its 
purpose. In the case of a positive determination, the Secretary will 
determine whether a decontrol assessment is warranted. If so, then BXA 
will initiate a decontrol assessment.
    (c) Decontrol assessment. (1) Any claimant may at any time request 
that BXA initiate a decontrol assessment by a FAS to BXA alleging 
foreign availability to any country or countries.
    (2) A TAC may request that BXA initiate a decontrol assessment at 
any time by submitting a TAC Certification to BXA that there is foreign 
availability to a controlled country for items that fall within the area 
of the TAC's technical expertise.

[[Page 444]]

    (3) The Secretary, on his/her own initiative, may initiate a 
decontrol assessment.
    (d) BXA mailing address. All foreign availability submissions and 
TAC certifications should be submitted to: Department of Commerce, 
Bureau of Export Administration, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, 
NW, Room 3877, Washington, DC 20230.


<R05>
Sec. 768.5  Contents of foreign availability submissions and Technical Advisory Committee certifications.

    (a) All foreign availability submissions must contain, in addition 
to information on product or technology alleged to be available from 
foreign sources, at least:
    (1) The name of the claimant;
    (2) The claimant's mailing and business address;
    (3) The claimant's telephone number; and
    (4) A contact point and telephone number.
    (b) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications should 
contain as much evidence as is available to support the claim, 
including, but not limited to:
    (1) Product names and model designations of the items alleged to be 
comparable;
    (2) Extent to which the alleged comparable item is based on U.S. 
technology;
    (3) Names and locations of the non-U.S. sources and the basis for 
claiming that the item is a non-U.S. source item;
    (4) Key performance elements, attributes, and characteristics of the 
items on which a qualitative comparison may be made;
    (5) Non-U.S. source's production quantities and/or sales of the 
alleged comparable items and marketing efforts;
    (6) Estimated market demand and the economic impact of the control;
    (7) Product names, model designations, and value of U.S. controlled 
parts and components incorporated in the items alleged to be comparable; 
and
    (8) The basis for the claim that the item is available-in-fact to 
the country or countries for which foreign availability is alleged.
    (c) Supporting evidence of foreign availability may include, but is 
not limited to, the following:
    (1) Foreign manufacturers' catalogs, brochures, operation or 
maintenance manuals;
    (2) Articles from reputable trade and technical publications;
    (3) Photographs;
    (4) Depositions based on eyewitness accounts; and
    (5) Other credible evidence.

    Note to paragraph (c) of this section: See Supplement No. 1 to part 
768 for additional examples of supporting evidence.

    (d) Upon receipt of a FAS or TAC certification, BXA will review it 
to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the belief 
that foreign availability may exist. If BXA determines the FAS or TAC 
certification is lacking in supporting evidence, BXA will seek 
additional evidence from appropriate sources, including the claimant or 
TAC. BXA will initiate the assessment when it determines that it has 
sufficient evidence that foreign availability may exist. Claimant and 
TAC certified assessments will be deemed to be initiated as of the date 
of such determination.
    (e) Claimants and TACs are advised to review the foreign 
availability assessment criteria described in Sec. 768.6 of this part 
and the examples of evidence described in Supplement No. 1 to part 768 
when assembling supporting evidence for inclusion in the FAS or TAC 
certification.


<R05>
Sec. 768.6  Criteria.

    BXA will evaluate the evidence contained in a FAS or TAC 
certification and all other evidence gathered in the assessment process 
in accordance with certain criteria that must be met before BXA can 
recommend a positive determination to the Secretary. The criteria are 
defined in Sec. 768.1(d) of this part. In order to initiate an 
assessment, each FAS and TAC certification should address each of these 
criteria. The criteria are statutorily prescribed and are:
    (a) Available-in-fact;
    (b) Non-U.S. source;
    (c) Sufficient quantity; and

[[Page 445]]

    (d) Comparable quality.


<R05>
Sec. 768.7  Procedures.

    (a) Initiation of an assessment. (1) Once BXA accepts a FAS or TAC 
certification of foreign availability, BXA will notify the claimant or 
TAC that it is initiating the assessment.
    (2) BXA will publish a Federal Register notice of the initiation of 
any assessment.
    (3) BXA will notify the Departments of Defense and State, the 
intelligence community, and any other departments, agencies and their 
contractors that may have information concerning the item on which BXA 
has initiated an assessment. Each such department, agency, and 
contractor shall provide BXA all relevant information concerning the 
item. BXA will invite interested departments and agencies to participate 
in the assessment process (See paragraph (e) of this section).
    (b) Data gathering. BXA will seek and consider all available 
information that bears upon the presence or absence of foreign 
availability, including but not limited to that evidence described in 
Sec. 768.5 (b) and (c) of this part. As soon as BXA initiates the 
assessment, it will seek evidence relevant to the assessment, including 
an analysis of the military needs of a selected country or countries, 
technical analysis, and intelligence information from the Departments of 
Defense and State, and other U.S. agencies. Evidence is particularly 
sought from: industry sources worldwide; other U.S. organizations; 
foreign governments; commercial, academic and classified data bases; 
scientific and engineering research and development organizations; and 
international trade fairs.
    (c) Analysis. BXA will conduct its analysis by evaluating whether 
the reasonable and reliable evidence that is relevant to each of the 
foreign availability criteria provides a sufficient basis to recommend a 
determination that foreign availability does or does not exist.
    (d) Recommendation and determination. (1) Upon completion of each 
assessment, BXA, on the basis of its analysis, will recommend that the 
Secretary make a determination either that there is or that there is not 
foreign availability, whichever the evidence supports. The assessment 
upon which BXA bases its recommendation will accompany the 
recommendation to the Secretary.
    (2) BXA will recommend on the basis of its analysis that the 
Secretary determine that foreign availability exists to a country when 
the available evidence demonstrates that an item of comparable quality 
is available-in-fact to the country, from non-U.S. sources, in 
sufficient quantity so that continuation of the existing national 
security export control, or denial of the license application in 
question on national security grounds, would be ineffective in achieving 
its purpose. For a controlled country, such control or denial is 
``ineffective'' when comparable items are available-in-fact from foreign 
sources in sufficient quantities so that maintaining such control or 
denying a license would not be effective in restricting the availability 
of items that would make a significant contribution to the military 
potential of any country or combination of countries detrimental to the 
national security of the United States.
    (3) The Secretary will make the determination of foreign 
availability on the basis of the BXA assessment and recommendation; the 
Secretary's determination will take into account the evidence provided 
to BXA, the recommendations of the Secretaries of Defense and State and 
any other interested agencies, and any other information that the 
Secretary considers relevant.
    (4) For all decontrol and denied license assessments (under section 
5(f)(3) of the EAA) initiated by a FAS, the Secretary will make a 
determination within 4 months of the initiation of the assessment and 
will notify the claimant. The Secretary will submit positive 
determinations for review to the appropriate departments and agencies.
    (5) The deadlines for determinations based on self-initiated and 
TAC-initiated assessments are different from the deadlines for claimant-
initiated assessments (see paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this 
section).
    (e) Interagency review. BXA will notify all appropriate U.S. 
agencies and Departments upon the initiation of an

[[Page 446]]

assessment and will invite their participation in the assessment 
process. BXA will provide all interested agencies and departments an 
opportunity to review source material, draft analyses and draft 
assessments immediately upon their receipt or production. For claimant-
initiated assessments, BXA will provide a copy of all positive 
recommendations and assessments to interested agencies and departments 
for their review following the Secretary's determination of foreign 
availability. For self-initiated and TAC-initiated assessments, BXA will 
provide all interested agencies an opportunity to review and comment on 
the assessment.
    (f) Notification. (1) No later than 5 months after the initiation of 
an assessment based on a FAS (claimant assessments), the Secretary will 
inform the claimant in writing and will submit for publication in the 
Federal Register a notice that:
    (i) Foreign availability exists, and
    (A) The requirement of a license has been removed or the license 
application in question has been approved; or
    (B) The President has determined that for national security purposes 
the export controls must be maintained or the license application must 
be denied, notwithstanding foreign availability, and that appropriate 
steps to eliminate the foreign availability are being initiated; or
    (C) In the case of an item controlled multilaterally under the 
former COCOM regime, the U.S. Government will conduct any necessary 
consultations concerning the proposed decontrol or approval of the 
license with the former COCOM regime for a period of up to 4 months from 
the date of the publication of the determination in the Federal Register 
(the U.S. Government may remove the license requirement for exports to 
non-controlled countries pending completion of the former COCOM regime 
review process); or
    (ii) Foreign availability does not exist.
    (2) For all TAC certification assessments, the Secretary will make a 
foreign availability determination within 90 days following initiation 
of the assessment. BXA will prepare and submit a report to the TAC and 
to the Congress stating that:
    (i) The Secretary has found foreign availability and has removed the 
license requirement; or
    (ii) The Secretary has found foreign availability, but has 
recommended to the President that negotiations be undertaken to 
eliminate the foreign availability; or
    (iii) The Secretary has not found foreign availability.
    (3) There is no statutory deadline for assessments self-initiated by 
the Secretary or for the resulting determination. However, BXA will make 
every effort to complete such assessments and determinations promptly.
    (g) Foreign availability to controlled countries. When the Secretary 
determines that an item controlled for national security reasons is 
available to a controlled country and the President does not issue a 
National Security Override (NSO), BXA will submit the determination to 
the Department of State, along with a draft proposal for the 
multilateral decontrol of the item or for the former COCOM regime 
approval of the license. The Department of State will submit the 
proposal or the license for former COCOM regime review. The former COCOM 
regime will have up to 4 months for review of the proposal.
    (h) Foreign availability to non-controlled countries. If the 
Secretary determines that foreign availability to non-controlled 
countries exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for export to 
all non-controlled countries where it is found to be available, or 
approve the license in question, unless the President exercises a 
National Security Override.
    (i) Negotiations to eliminate foreign availability. (1) The 
President may determine that an export control must be maintained 
notwithstanding the existence of foreign availability. Such a 
determination is called a National Security Override (NSO) and is based 
on the President's decision that the absence of the control would prove 
detrimental to the United States national security. Unless extended (as 
described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section), an NSO is

[[Page 447]]

effective for 6 months. Where the President invokes an NSO, the U.S. 
Government will actively pursue negotiations with the government of any 
source country during the 6 month period to eliminate the availability.
    (2) There are two types of National Security Overrides:
    (i) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting from 
an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(f) of the EAA (claimant 
and self-initiated assessments); and
    (ii) An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting 
from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(h) of the EAA (TAC-
certification assessments).
    (3) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 
5(f) of the EAA, the Secretary of any agency may recommend that the 
President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls or 
deny the license notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.
    (4) For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section 
5(h) of the EAA, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend that the 
President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls 
notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.
    (5) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under 
section 5(f) of the EAA, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of 
the House of Representatives will be notified of the initiation of the 
required negotiations. The notice will include an explanation of the 
national security interest that necessitates the retention of controls.
    (6) Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under 
section 5(f) of the EAA, BXA will publish notices in the Federal 
Register consisting of:
    (i) The Secretary's determination of foreign availability;
    (ii) The President's decision to exercise the NSO;
    (iii) A concise statement of the basis for the President's decision; 
and
    (iv) An estimate of the economic impact of the decision.
    (7) The 6 month effective period for an NSO may be extended up to an 
additional 12 months if, prior to the end of the 6 months, the President 
certifies to Congress that the negotiations are progressing, and 
determines that the absence of the controls would continue to be 
detrimental to the United States national security.
    (8) After the conclusion of negotiations, BXA will retain the 
control only to the extent that foreign availability is eliminated. If 
foreign availability is not eliminated, BXA will decontrol the item by 
removing the requirement for a license for the export of the item to the 
destinations covered by the assessment. To the extent that the 
negotiations are successful and the foreign availability is eliminated, 
BXA will remove the license requirement for the export of the item to 
any country that has agreed to eliminate foreign availability.
    (j) Changes in foreign availability. If BXA becomes aware of 
conditions, including new evidence, that affect a previous determination 
that foreign availability exists or does not exist, BXA may review the 
conditions. If BXA finds that the foreign availability previously 
determined no longer exists, or that foreign availability not earlier 
found now does exist, BXA will make a recommendation to the Secretary of 
Commerce for the appropriate changes in the control. The Secretary of 
Commerce will make a determination, and BXA will publish a Federal 
Register notice of the determination.


<R05>
Sec. 768.8  Eligibility of expedited licensing procedures for non-controlled countries.

    (a) BXA determines the eligibility of an item for expedited 
licensing procedures on the basis of an evaluation of the foreign 
availability of the item. Eligibility is specific to the items and the 
countries to which they are found to be available.
    (b) BXA will initiate an eligibility evaluation:
    (1) On its own initiative;
    (2) On receipt of a FAS; or
    (3) On receipt of a TAC certification.
    (c) Upon initiation of an eligibility evaluation following receipt 
of either a FAS or TAC certification, BXA will notify the claimant or 
TAC of the receipt and initiation of an evaluation and

[[Page 448]]

publish a Federal Register notice of the initiation of the evaluation.
    (d) The criteria for determining eligibility for expedited licensing 
procedures are:
    (1) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified
    non-controlled country from a foreign source;
    (2) The item must be of a quality similar to that of the U.S.-
controlled item; and
    (3) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified non-
controlled country without effective restrictions.
    (e) Within 30 days of initiation of the evaluation, the Secretary of 
Commerce will make a determination of foreign availability on the basis 
of the BXA evaluation and recommendation, taking into consideration the 
evidence the Secretaries of Defense, State, and other interested 
agencies provide to BXA and any other information that the Secretary 
considers relevant.
    (f) Within 30 days of the receipt of the FAS or TAC certification, 
BXA will publish the Secretary's determination in the Federal Register, 
that the item will or will not be eligible for expedited licensing 
procedures to the stated countries and, where appropriate, amend 
Supplement No. 2 to part 768.
    (g) Following completion of a self-initiated evaluation, BXA will be 
notified of the Secretary's determination and, where appropriate, 
Supplement No. 2 to part 768 will be amended.
    (h) Foreign availability submissions and TAC certifications to 
initiate an expedited licensing procedure evaluation must be clearly 
designated on their face as a request for expedited licensing procedure 
and must specify the items, quantities and countries alleged eligible. 
Submissions and certifications should be sent to: Department of 
Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration, 14th Street and Pennsylvania 
Avenue, NW., Room 3877, Washington, DC 20230.


<R05>
Sec. 768.9  Appeals of negative foreign availability determinations.

    Appeals of negative determinations will be conducted according to 
the standards and procedures described in part 756 of the EAR. A 
Presidential decision (NSO) to deny a license or continue controls 
notwithstanding a determination of foreign availability is not subject 
to appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 768.10  Removal of controls on less sophisticated items.

    Where the Secretary has removed national security controls on an 
item for foreign availability reasons, the Secretary will also remove 
controls on similar items that are controlled for national security 
reasons and whose functions, technological approach, performance 
thresholds, and other attributes that form the basis for national 
security export controls do not exceed the technical parameters of the 
item that BXA has decontrolled for foreign availability reasons.

     Supplement No. 1 to Part 768--Evidence of Foreign Availability

    This supplement provides a list of examples of evidence that the 
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) has found to be useful in 
conducting assessments of foreign availability. A claimant submitting 
evidence supporting a claim of foreign availability should review this 
list for suggestions as evidence is collected. Acceptable evidence 
indicating possible foreign availability is not limited to these 
examples, nor is any one of these examples, usually, in and of itself, 
necessarily sufficient to meet a foreign availability criterion. A 
combination of several types of evidence for each criterion usually is 
required. A Foreign Availability Submission (FAS) should include as much 
evidence as possible on all four of the criteria listed below. BXA 
combines the submitted evidence with the evidence that it collects from 
other sources. BXA evaluates all evidence, taking into account factors 
that may include, but are not limited to: Information concerning the 
source of the evidence, corroborative or contradictory indications, and 
experience concerning the reliability or reasonableness of such 
evidence. BXA will assess all relevant evidence to determine whether 
each of the four criteria has been met. Where possible, all information 
should be in writing. If information is based on third party 
documentation, the submitter should provide such documentation to BXA. 
If information is based on oral statements a third party made, the 
submitter should provide a memorandum of the conversation to BXA if the 
submitter cannot obtain a written memorandum from the source. BXA will 
amend this informational list as it identifies new examples of evidence.

[[Page 449]]

    (a) Examples of evidence of foreign availability:
    The following are intended as examples of evidence that BXA will 
consider in evaluating foreign availability. BXA will evaluate all

Sec. 770.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. This part provides commodity, technology, and 
software interpretations. These interpretations clarify the scope of 
controls where such scope is not readily apparent from the Commerce 
Control List (CCL) (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) and 
other provisions of the Export Administration Regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 770.2  Commodity interpretations.

    (a) Interpretation 1: Anti-friction bearing or bearing systems and 
specially designed parts. (1) Anti-friction bearings or bearing systems 
shipped as spares or replacements are classified under Export Control 
Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 2A001, 2A002, 2A003, 2A004, 2A005, and 
2A006 (ball, roller, or needle-roller bearings and parts). This applies 
to separate shipments of anti-friction bearings or bearing systems and 
anti-friction bearings or bearing systems shipped with machinery or 
equipment for which they are intended to be used as spares or 
replacement parts.
    (2) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system physically 
incorporated in a segment of a machine or in a complete machine prior to 
shipment loses its identity as a bearing. In this scenario, the machine 
or segment of machinery containing the bearing is the item subject to 
export control requirements.
    (3) An anti-friction bearing or bearing system not incorporated in a 
segment of a machine prior to shipment, but shipped as a component of a 
complete unassembled (knocked-down) machine, is considered a component 
of a machine. In this scenario, the complete machine is the item subject 
to export license requirements.
    (b) Interpretation 2: Classification of ``parts'' of machinery, 
equipment, or other items--(1) An assembled machine or unit of equipment 
is being exported. In instances where one or more assembled machines or 
units of equipment are being exported, the individual component parts 
that are physically incorporated into the machine or equipment do not 
require a license. The license or general exception under which the 
complete machine or unit of equipment is exported will also cover its 
component parts, provided that the parts are normal and usual components 
of the machine or equipment being exported, or that the physical 
incorporation is not used as a device to evade the requirement for a 
license.
    (2) Parts are exported as spares, replacements, for resale, or for 
stock. In instances where parts are exported as spares, replacements, 
for resale, or for stock, a license is required only if the appropriate 
entry for the part specifies that a license is required for the intended 
destination.
    (c) Interpretation 3: Wire or cable cut to length. (1) Wire or cable 
may be included as a component of a system or piece of equipment, 
whether or not the wire or cable is cut to length and whether or not it 
is fitted with connectors at one or both ends, so long as it is in 
normal quantity necessary to make the original installation of the 
equipment and is necessary to its operation.
    (2) Wire or cable exported as replacement or spares, or for further 
manufacture is controlled under the applicable wire or cable ECCN only. 
This includes wire or cable, whether or not cut to length or fitted with 
connectors at one or both ends.

[[Page 451]]

    (d) Interpretation 4: Telecommunications equipment and systems. 
Control equipment for paging systems (broadcast radio or selectively 
signalled receiving systems) is defined as circuit switching equipment 
in Category 5 of the CCL.
    (e) Interpretation 5: Numerical control systems--(1) Classification 
of ``Numerical Control'' Units. ``Numerical control'' units for machine 
tools, regardless of their configurations or architectures, are 
controlled by their functional characteristics as described in ECCN 
2B001.a. ``Numerical control'' units include computers with add-on 
``motion control boards''. A computer with add-on ``motion control 
boards'' for machine tools may be controlled under ECCN 2B001.a even 
when the computer alone without ``motion control boards'' is not subject 
to licensing requirements under Category 4 and the ``motion control 
boards'' are not controlled under ECCN 2B001.b.
    (2) Export documentation requirement. (i) When preparing a license 
application for a numerical control system, the machine tool and the 
control unit are classified separately. If either the machine tool or 
the control unit requires a license, then the entire unit requires a 
license. If either a machine tool or a control unit is exported 
separately from the system, the exported component is classified on the 
license application without regard to the other parts of a possible 
system.
    (ii) When preparing the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), a system 
being shipped complete (i.e., machine and control unit), should be 
reported under the Schedule B number for each machine. When either a 
control unit or a machine is shipped separately, it should be reported 
under the Schedule B number appropriate for the individual item being 
exported.
    (f) Interpretation 6: Parts, accessories, and equipment exported as 
scrap. Parts, accessories, or equipment that are being shipped as scrap 
should be described on the SED in sufficient detail to be identified 
under the proper ECCN. When commodities declared as parts, accessories, 
or equipment are shipped in bulk, or are otherwise not packaged, packed, 
or sorted in accordance with normal trade practices, the Customs Officer 
may require evidence that the shipment is not scrap. Such evidence may 
include, but is not limited to, bills of sale, orders and correspondence 
indicating whether the commodities are scrap or are being exported for 
use as parts, accessories, or equipment.
    (g) Interpretation 7: Scrap arms, ammunition, and implements of war. 
Arms, ammunition, and implements of war, as defined in the U.S. 
Munitions List, and are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of 
State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), except for the following, which 
are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce:
    (1) Cartridge and shell cases that have been rendered useless beyond 
the possibility of restoration to their original identity by means of 
excessive heating, flame treatment, mangling, crushing, cutting, or by 
any other method are ``scrap''.
    (2) Cartridge and shell cases that have been sold by the armed 
services as ``scrap'', whether or not they have been heated, flame-
treated, mangled, crushed, cut, or reduced to scrap by any other method.
    (3) Other commodities that may have been on the U.S. Munitions List 
are ``scrap'', and therefore under the jurisdiction of the Department of 
Commerce, if they have been rendered useless beyond the possibility of 
restoration to their original identity only by means of mangling, 
crushing, or cutting. When in doubt as to whether a commodity covered by 
the Munitions List has been rendered useless, exporters should consult 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State, 
Washington, DC 20520, or the Exporter Counseling Division, Office of 
Exporter Services, Room 1099A, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, 
DC 20230, before reporting a shipment as metal scrap.
    (h) Interpretation 8: Military automotive vehicles and parts for 
such vehicles--(1) Military automotive vehicles. (i) For purposes of 
U.S. export controls, military automotive vehicles ``possessing or built 
to current military specifications differing materially from normal 
commercial specifications'' may include, but are not limited to, the 
following characteristics:

[[Page 452]]

    (A) Special fittings for mounting ordnance or military equipment;
    (B) Bullet-proof glass;
    (C) Armor plate;
    (D) Fungus preventive treatment;
    (E) Twenty-four volt electrical systems;
    (F) Shielded electrical system (electronic emission suppression); or
    (G) Puncture-proof or run-flat tires.
    (ii) Automotive vehicles fall into two categories.
    (A) Military automotive vehicles on the Munitions List, new and 
used. Automotive vehicles in this category are primarily combat 
(fighting) vehicles, with or without armor and/or armament, ``designed 
for specific fighting function.'' These automotive vehicles are licensed 
for export by the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 
130).
    (B) Military automotive vehicles not on the U.S. Munitions List, new 
and used. Automotive vehicles in this category are primarily transport 
vehicles designed for non-combat military purposes (transporting cargo, 
personnel and/or equipment, and/or for to wing other vehicles and 
equipment over land and roads in close support of fighting vehicles and 
troops). These automotive vehicles are licensed for export by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce.
    (iii) Parts for military automotive vehicles. Functional parts are 
defined as those parts making up the power train of the vehicles, 
including the electrical system, the cooling system, the fuel system, 
and the control system (brake and steering mechanism), the front and 
rear axle assemblies including the wheels, the chassis frame, springs 
and shock absorbers. Parts specifically designed for military automotive 
vehicles on the Munitions List are licensed for export by the U.S. 
Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130).
    (iv) General instructions. Manufacturers of non-Munitions List 
automotive vehicles and/or parts will know whether their products meet 
the conditions described in this paragraph (h). Merchant exporters and 
other parties who are not sure whether their products (automotive 
vehicles and/or parts) meet these conditions should check with their 
suppliers for the required information before making a shipment under 
general exception or submitting an application to BXA for a license.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (i) Interpretation 9: Aircraft, parts, accessories and components. 
Aircraft, parts, accessories, and components defined in Categories VIII 
and IX of the Munitions List are under the export licensing authority of 
the U.S. Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 130). All other 
aircraft, and parts, accessories and components therefor, are under the 
export licensing authority of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The 
following aircraft, parts, accessories and components are under the 
licensing authority of the U.S. Department of Commerce:
    (1) Any aircraft (except an aircraft that has been demilitarized, 
but including aircraft specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section) 
that conforms to a Federal Aviation Agency type certificate in the 
normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, or restricted category, provided 
such aircraft has not been equipped with or modified to include military 
equipment, such as gun mounts, turrets, rocket launchers, or similar 
equipment designed for military combat or military training purposes.
    (2) Only the following military aircraft, demilitarized (aircraft 
not specifically equipped, reequipped, or modified for military 
operations):
    (i) Cargo, bearing designations ``C-45 through C-118 inclusive,'' 
and ``C-121'';
    (ii) Trainers, bearing a ``T'' designation and using piston engines;
    (iii) Utility, bearing a ``U'' designation and using piston engines;
    (iv) Liaison, bearing an ``L'' designation; and
    (v) Observation, bearing an ``O'' designation and using piston 
engines.
    (3) All reciprocating engines.
    (4) Other aircraft engines not specifically designed or modified for 
military aircraft.
    (5) Parts, accessories, and components (including propellers), 
designed exclusively for aircraft and engines described in paragraphs 
(i)(1), (i)(2), (i)(3), and (i)(4) of this section.
    (6) General purpose parts, accessories, and components usable 
interchangeably on either military or civil aircraft.

[[Page 453]]

    (j) Interpretation 10: Civil aircraft inertial navigation equipment. 
(1) The Department of Commerce has licensing jurisdiction over exports 
and reexports to all destinations of inertial navigation systems, 
inertial navigation equipment, and specially designed components 
therefor for ``civil aircraft''.
    (2) The Department of State, retains jurisdiction over all software 
and technology for inertial navigation systems and navigation equipment, 
and specially designed components therefor, for shipborne use, 
underwater use, ground vehicle use, spaceborne use or use other than 
``civil aircraft''.
    (k) Interpretation 11: Precursor chemicals. The following chemicals 
are controlled by ECCN 1C350. The appropriate Chemical Abstract Service 
Registry (C.A.S.) number and synonyms, (i.e., alternative names) are 
included to help you determine whether your chemicals are controlled by 
this entry. These chemicals require a license to all countries except 
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy,

    (l) Interpretation 12: Computers. (1) Digital computers or computer 
systems classified under ECCN 4A003.a, .b, or .c, that qualify for ``No 
License Required'' (NLR) must be evaluated on the basis of CTP alone, to 
the exclusion of all other technical parameters. Computers controlled in 
this entry for MT reasons are not eligible for License Exception CTP 
regardles of the CTP of the computer. Digital computers or computer 
systems classified under ECCN 4A003.a, .b, or .c that qualify for 
License Exception CTP must be evaluated on the basis of CTP, to the 
exclusion of all other technical parameters, except for parameters of 
Missile Technology concern, or ECCN 4A003.e (equipment performing 
analog-to-digital conversions exceeding the limits in ECCN 3A001.a.5.a). 
This License Exception does not authorize the export or reexport of 
computers controlled for MT purposes regardless of the CTP. Assemblies

Sec. 770.3  Interpretations related to exports of technology and software to destinations in Country Group D:1.

    (a) Introduction. This section is intended to provide you additional 
guidance on how to determine whether your technology or software would 
be eligible for a License Exception, may be exported under NLR, or 
require a license, for export to Country Group D:1.
    (b) Scope of licenses. The export of technology and software under a 
license is authorized only to the extent specifically indicated on the 
face of the license. The only technology and software related to 
equipment exports that may be exported without a license is technology 
described in Secs. 734.7 through 734.11 of the EAR; operating technology 
and software described in Sec. 740.8(a) of the EAR; sales technology 
described in Sec. 740.8(b) of the EAR; and software updates described in 
Sec. 740.8(c) of the EAR.
    (c) Commingled technology and software. (1) U.S.-origin technology 
does not lose its U.S.-origin when it is redrawn, used, consulted, or 
otherwise commingled abroad in any respect with other technology of any 
other origin. Therefore, any subsequent or similar technical data 
prepared or engineered abroad for the design, construction, operation, 
or maintenance of any plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is 
based on or utilizes any U.S.-origin technology, is subject to the EAR 
in the same manner as the original U.S.-origin technology, including 
license requirements, unless the commingled technology is not subject to 
the EAR by reason of the de minimis exclusions described in Sec. 734.4 
of the EAR.
    (2) U.S.-origin software that is incorporated into or commingled 
with foreign-origin software does not lose its U.S.-origin. Such 
commingled software is subject to the EAR is the same manner as the 
original U.S.-origin software, including license requirements, unless 
the commingled software is not subject to the EAR by reason of the de 
minimis exclusions described in Sec. 734.4 of the EAR.
    (d) Certain License Exception. The following questions and answers 
are intended to further clarify the scope of

[[Page 457]]

technology and software eligible for a License Exception.
    (1)(i) Question 1. (A) Our engineers, in installing or repairing 
equipment, use techniques (experience as well as proprietary knowledge 
of the internal componentry or specifications of the equipment) that 
exceed what is provided in the standard manuals or instructions 
(including training) given to the customer. In some cases, it is also a 
condition of the license that such information provided to the customer 
be constrained to the minimum necessary for normal installation, 
maintenance and operation situations.
    (B) Can we send an engineer (with knowledge and experience) to the 
customer site to perform the installation or repair, under the 
provisions of License Exception TSU for operation technology and 
software described in Sec. 740.13(a) of the EAR, if it is understood 
that he is restricted by our normal business practices to performing the 
work without imparting the knowledge or technology to the customer 
personnel?
    (ii) Answer 1. Export of technology includes release of U.S.-origin 
data in a foreign country, and ``release'' includes ``application to 
situations abroad of personal knowledge or technical experience acquired 
in the United States.'' As the release of technology in the 
circumstances described here would exceed that permitted under the 
License Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in 
Sec. 740.13(a) of the EAR, a license would be required even though the 
technician could apply the data without disclosing it to the customer.
    (2)(i) Question 2. We plan, according to our normal business 
practices, to train customer engineers to maintain equipment that we 
have exported under a license, License Exception, or NLR. The training 
is contractual in nature, provided for a fee, and is scheduled to take 
place in part in the customer's facility and in part in the U.S. Can we 
now proceed with this training at both locations under a License 
Exception?
    (ii) Answer 2. (A) Provided that this is your normal training, and 
involves technology contained in your manuals and standard instructions 
for the exported equipment, and meets the other requirements of License 
Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in 
Sec. 740.13(a), the training may be provided within the limits of those 
provisions of License Exception TSU. The location of the training is not 
significant, as the export occurs at the time and place of the actual 
transfer or imparting of the technology to the customer's engineers.
    (B) Any training beyond that covered under the provisions of License 
Exception TSU for operation technology and software described in 
Sec. 740.13(a), but specifically represented in your license application 
as required for this customer installation, and in fact authorized on 
the face of the license or a separate technology license, may not be 
undertaken while the license is suspended or revoked.

Sec. 770.4  Interpretations related to chemical mixtures--de minimis exceptions examples.

    (a)(1) Introduction: The following are examples for applying the de 
minimis exceptions for chemical mixtures containing precursor and 
intermediate chemicals controlled under ECCN 1C350.
    (2) In ECCN 1C350, Note 2, paragraphs (c) and (d) within the 
Mixtures Exemptions state that a validated license is required when at 
least one of the listed chemicals constitutes more than 10% or 25%, 
respectively, of the weight of the mixture on a solvent free basis.
    (b)(1) Example One. A mixture contains the following components:
    (i) 90% polymer polyol (a liquid raw material used to make 
polyurethane polymers); and
    (ii) 10% Australia Group (AG)-controlled chemical eligible for 25% 
de minimis exemption.

    Note to paragraph (b) of this section: The polymer does not dissolve 
the AG-controlled chemical.

    (2) In this example, the polymer polyol does not dissolve the AG-
controlled chemical (the only other component of the mixture). 
Therefore, the polyol is NOT considered a solvent, and the concentration 
of the polymer

[[Page 458]]

polyol is included in the concentration calculation. As a result, the 
AG-controlled chemical's concentration is 10% when calculated on a 
solvent-free basis (.10/1.00). Accordingly, this concentration is below 
the threshold concentration of 25% applicable to specific AG-controlled 
chemicals under the chemical mixtures rule and can be exported under NLR 
to all destinations except Iran, Sudan, Syria, and Country Group E:2 in 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR.
    (3) To determine the classification of this mixture, it is necessary 
to determine whether the polymer is capable of functioning as a solvent 
for the other components of the mixture. If the polymer polyol is 
capable of functioning as a solvent for the controlled AG chemical, then 
the polymer component is omitted from the concentration calculation. If 
the polymer polyol is not capable of functioning as a solvent for the AG 
chemical, then the polymer component is included in the concentration 
calculation.
    (c)(1) Example Two: An automotive coolant (antifreeze) is a mixture 
of the following components:
    (i) 75% ethylene glycol;
    (ii) 10% additive package; and
    (iii) 15% water.

    Note to paragraph (c) of this section: The ``additive package'' 
contains an AG-controlled chemical that is eligible for the 10% de 
minimis exemption. This chemical is added as a stabilizer and represents 
9% of the total mixture. The remaining components of the additive 
package are various dyes and stabilizers that represent 1% of the total 
mixture. Ethylene glycol serves as the basic functional ingredient that 
prevents the engine block from freezing, and does not dissolve the other 
components of the mixture. The water is added to keep the mixture in 
solution.

    (2) To determine if this mixture requires a license it is necessary 
to calculate the concentration of the AG-controlled chemical on a 
solvent-free basis. Since the water dissolves all of the other 
components of the mixture, water is considered a ``solvent'' and the 
quantity of water present is not included in the calculation of the AG-
chemical concentration. Consequently, the concentration of the AG 
chemical is approximately 11% (.09/.85), and the mixture is classified 
under ECCN 1C350. Accordingly, since this concentration is above the 
threshold concentration of 10% applicable to this category of AG-
controlled chemical under the chemical mixtures rule, a license is 
required to all destinations except AG member countries.
    (d)(1) Example Three. A pesticide formulation consists of an AG-
controlled chemical that is eligible for the 25% de minimis exemption, 
and an active ingredient that is not AG-controlled. The formulation is 
diluted with water to allow safe, effective, and economic application. 
The resulting mixture is 15% AG chemical, 40% active ingredient and 45% 
water. Although the water is added as a diluent, it dissolves the other 
components of the mixture.
    (2) Since the water dissolves all components in the mixture, it is 
considered a solvent even though it was added as a diluent. The percent 
concentration of the AG-controlled chemical calculated on a solvent free 
basis is .15/.55 = 27%, and the mixture is therefore classified under 
ECCN 1C350. Accordingly, since this concentration is above the threshold 
concentration of 25% applicable to this category of AG-controlled 
chemicals under the chemical mixtures rule, a license is required to all 
destinations except AG member countries.
    (e)(1) Example Four. A mixture contains the following components:
    (i) 10% water;
    (ii) 22% Chemical A;
    (iii) 21% Chemical B;
    (iv) 20% Chemical C;
    (v) 19% Chemical D; and
    (vi) 8% Chemical E.

    Note to paragraph (e) of this section: The water is added to 
dissolve the other components of the mixture. Chemicals A, B, C, and D 
are AG-controlled chemicals each eligible for 25% de minimis exemption. 
Chemical E is an AG-controlled chemical eligible for 10% de minimis 
exemption.

    (2) In this example, water is considered a solvent since it 
dissolves all components in the mixture. Therefore, the quantity of 
water present in the mixture is not included in calculating the 
concentrations of the controlled chemicals on a solvent-free basis. The 
concentrations of the controlled chemicals are as follows: Chemical A 
24%; Chemical B 23%; Chemical C 22%; Chemical D 21%; Chemical E 9%. It 
is

[[Page 459]]

important to note that in this example, even though the cumulative 
amount of the mixture (90%) consists of controlled chemicals, each one 
of the controlled chemicals is below the de minimis level for its 
category. Consequently, this mixture can be exported under NLR to all 
destinations except Iran, Sudan, Syria, and Country Group E:2 in 
Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR.

different types of media. The format is based on the Synchronous 
Transport Module (STM) that is defined by CCITT Recommendation G.703, 
G.707, G.708, G.709 and others yet to be published. The first level rate 
of ``SDH'' is 155.52 Mbits/s.
    ``Synchronous optical network.'' (SONET) (Cat 5)--A network 
providing a means to manage, multiplex and access various forms of 
digital traffic using a synchronous transmission format on fiber optics. 
The format is the North America version of ``SDH'' and also uses the

Sec. 774.1  Introduction.

    In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter 
VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) maintains 
the Commerce Control List (CCL) that includes items (commodities, 
software, and technology) subject to the authority of BXA. The CCL does 
not include those items exclusively controlled for export by another 
department or agency of the U.S. Government. In instances where other 
agencies administer controls over related items, entries in the CCL will 
contain a reference to these controls. Those items subject to the EAR 
but not specified on the CCL are identified by the designator ``EAR99''. 
See Sec. 734.2(a) of the EAR for items that are ``subject to the EAR''. 
You should consult part 738 of the EAR for an explanation of the 
organization of the CCL and its relationship to the Country Chart.
    The CCL is contained in Supplement No. 1 to this part, and 
Supplement No. 2 to this part contains the General Technology and 
Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.

controlled chemical is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged 
for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are controlled by 
ECCN EAR99.
    e. Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals.
    1. Usual Commercial Purposes. In calculating the percentage of an AG 
controlled chemical in a mixture (solution), any other chemical must be 
excluded if it was not added for usual commercial purposes, but was 
added for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration 
Regulations.
    2. ``Solvent Free Basis Requirement.'' When calculating the 
percentage, by weight, of components in a chemical mixture, you must 
exclude from the calculation any component of the mixture that acts as a 
solvent.
    3. Solvent--For purposes of this ECCN ``A substance capable of 
dissolving another substance to form a uniformly dispersed mixture 
(solutiony''.
    <bullet> Solvents are liquids at standard temperature and pressure 
(STP).
    <bullet> In no instance is an AG controlled chemical considered a 
``solvent''.
    <bullet> All ingredients of mixtures are expressed in terms of 
weight.
    <bullet> The solvent component of the mixture converts it into a 
solution.
    3. Trace Quantities:
    a. A license is required for mixtures containing any amount 
(including trace quantities) of the following chemicals: 0-Ethyl-2-
diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonite (QL) (C.A.S. #57856-11-8), 
Ethylphosphonyl difluoride (C.A.S. #753-98-0), and Methylphosphonyl 
difluoride (C.A.S. #676-99-3).
    b. Except as noted in paragraph (a) of this Note, a license is not 
required under this entry for mixtures that contain a cumulative total 
concentration of no more than 10,000 parts by weight (pbw) per million 
of all precursor or intermediate chemicals listed in this entry. The 
calculation for this paragraph (b) should not be done on a solvent-free 
basis (related ECCN: 1C995).
    c. Countries Not Eligible: The following countries are not eligible 
for exports under this Trace Quantities Note: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, 
North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.

    Technical Note: Minimum increment of motion test (slide motion from 
rest): The test is conducted only if the machine tool is equipped with a 
control unit the minimum increment of which is less (better) than 0.5 
micrometer. Prepare the machine for testing in accordance with ISO 230.2 
paragraphs 3.1, 3.2, 3.3. Conduct the test on each axis (slide) of the 
machine tool as follows:
    1. Move the axis over at least 50% of the maximum travel in plus and 
minus directions twice at maximum feed rate, rapid traverse rate or jog 
control;
    2. Wait at least 10 seconds;
    3. With manual data input, input the minimum programmable increment 
of the control unit;
    4. Measure the axis movement;
    5. Clear the control unit with the servo null, reset or whatever 
clears any signal (voltage) in the servo loop;
    6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 five times, twice in the same direction of 
the axis travel and three times in the opposite direction of travel for 
a total of six test points;
    7. If the axis movement is between 80% and 120% of the minimum 
programmable input for four of the six test points, the machine is 
controlled. For rotary axes, the measurement is taken 200 mm from the 
center of rotation.

            Technical Note to Table on Deposition Techniques

    Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows:
    a. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface 
modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, composite, 
dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous 
reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate 
resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound 
material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical 
reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow 
discharge plasma, or ``laser'' irradiation.
    Note 1: CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-
of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal 
decomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.
    Note 2: Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.
    Note 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are 
produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack 
cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in 
contact with the powder mixture.
    b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is an 
overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 
0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the 
coating material. This process results in the condensation, or 
deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned 
substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the 
coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary 
modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or 
plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common 
modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-
process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings 
can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as 
follows:
    1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the 
material which forms the coating;
    2. Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating 
sources capable of producing a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated 
coating species;
    3. ``Laser'' Evaporation uses either pulsed or continuous wave 
``laser'' beams to heat the material which forms the coating;
    4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the 
material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on 
the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled 
motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized 
plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the 
cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used 
for non line-of-sight deposition.
    Note: This definition does not include random cathodic arc 
deposition with non-biased substrates.
    c. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process 
in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be 
deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to 
facilitate the extraction of the species to be deposited from the 
plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids 
within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-
process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of 
coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.
    d. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay 
coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a 
pack), that consists of:
    1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminum, 
chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);
    2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and
    3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina. The substrate and 
powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 
1,030 K (757  deg.C) to 1,375 K (1,102  deg.C) for sufficient time to 
deposit the coating.
    e. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun 
(spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or 
wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, 
whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying 
constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma 
spraying carried out underwater.
    Note 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.
    Note 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 
750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20  deg.C) at 0.1 MPa.
    f. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay 
coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic 
binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either 
spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat 
treatment to obtain the desired coating.

[[Page 535]]

    g. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a 
momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by 
an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). 
The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target 
surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately 
positioned substrate.
    Note 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive 
sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and 
rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter 
deposition used to permit vaporization of non-metallic coating 
materials.
    Note 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to 
activate the deposition.
    h. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in 
which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a 
potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the 
substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is 
performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapor deposition or 
sputter deposition.

Related Definition: Detonators using only primary explosives, such as 
lead azide, are not controlled by this entry.
Items: a. Electrically driven explosive detonators, as follows:
    a.1. Exploding bridge (EB);
    a.2. Exploding bridge wire (EBW);
    a.3. Slapper;
    a.4. Exploding foil initiators (EFI)
    b. Arrangements using single or multiple detonators designed to 
nearly simultaneously initiate an expolsive surface (over greater than 
5,000 mm\2\) from a single firing signal (with an initiation timing 
spread over the surface of less than 2.5 microseconds).
    Technical Note: The detonators controlled by 3A232 utilize a small 
electrical conductor (bridge, bridgewire, or foil) that explosively 
vaporizes when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through 
it. In nonslapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical 
detonation in a contacting high-explosive material such as PETN 
(pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive 
vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper 
across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a 
chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic 
force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a 
slapper-type detonator. Also, the word initiator is sometimes used in 
place of the word detonator.

                  Outline of ``CTP'' Calculation Method

    ``CTP'' is a measure of computational performance given in millions 
of theoretical operations per second (Mtops). In calculating the 
``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') of an aggregation of 
``Computing Elements'' (``CEs''), the following three steps are 
required:
    1. Calculate the effective calculating rate (R) for each ``computing 
element'' (``CE'');
    2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effective calculating 
rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance (TP) for each 
``computing element'' (``CE'');
    3. If there is more than one ``computing element'' (``CE''), combine 
the Theoretical Performances (TPs), resulting in a ``Composite 
Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') for the aggregation. Details for 
these steps are given in the following section.
    Note 1: For aggregations of multiple ``computing elements'' 
(``CEs'') that have both shared and unshared memory subsystems, the 
calculation of ``CTP'' is completed hierarchically, in two steps: first, 
aggregate the group of ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') sharing memory, 
second calculate the ``CTP'' of the groups using the calculation method 
for multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') not sharing memory.
    Note 2: ``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that are limited to input/
output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and 
video display controllers) are not aggregated into the ``CTP'' 
calculation.

[[Page 564]]

    The following table shows the method of calculating the ``Effective 
Calculating Rate'' (R) for each ``Computing Element'' (``CE''):
    Step 1: The effective calculating rate R. For Computing Elements 
(CEs) Implementing: Effective calculating Rate, R
    Note: Every ``CE'' must be evaluated independently
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.014
    
    If no add is implemented use:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.015
    
    If neither add nor multiply is implemented use the fastest available 
arithmetic operation as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.016

    See Notes X and Y.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.017
    
    See Notes X and Y.
    Both FP and XP (R).
    Calculate both R<INF>xp</INF>, R<INF>fp</INF>.
    For simple logic processors not implementing any of the specified 
arithmetic operations.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.018

    Where t<INF>log</INF> is the execute time of the XOR, or for logic 
hardware not implementing the XOR, the fastest simple logic operation.
    See Notes X and Z.
    For special logic processors not using any of the specified 
arithmetic or logic operations. R = R<SUP>t</SUP> x WL/64
    Where R is the number of results per second, WL is the number of 
bits upon which the logic operation occurs, and 64 is a factor to 
normalize to a 64 bit operation.
    Note W: For a pipelined ``CE'' capable of executing up to one 
arithmetic or logic operation every clock cycle after the pipeline is 
full, a pipelined rate can be established. The effective calculating 
rate (R) for such a ``CE'' is the faster of the pipelined rate or non-
pipelined execution rate.
    Note X: For a ``CE'' that performs multiple operations of a specific 
type in a single cycle (e.g., two additions per cycle or two identical 
logic operations per cycle), the execution time t is given by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.019

    ``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that perform different types of 
arithmetic or logic operations in a single machine cycle are to be 
treated as multiple separate ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') performing 
simultaneously (e.g., a ``CE'' performing an addition and a 
multiplication in one cycle is to be treated as two ``CEs'', the first 
performing an addition in one cycle and the second performing a 
multiplication in one cycle).
    If a single ``Computing element'' (``CE'') has both scalar function 
and vector function, use the shorter execution time value.
    Note Y: For the ``CE'' that does not implement FP add or FP 
multiply, but that performs FP divide:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.020

    If the ``CE'' implements FP reciprocal, but not FP add, FP multiply 
or FP divide, then:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.021

    If the divide is not implemented, the fp reciprocal should be used.
    If none of the specified instructions is implemented, the effective 
floating point (FP) rate is 0.
    Note Z: In simple logic operations, a single instruction performs a 
single logic manipulation of no more than two operands of given lengths. 
In complex logic operations, a single instruction performs multiple 
logic manipulations to produce one or more results from two or more 
operands.
    Rates should be calculated for all supported operand lengths 
considering both

[[Page 565]]

pipelined operations (if supported), and non-pipelined operations, using 
the fastest executing instruction for each operand length based on:
    1. Pipelined or register-to-register operations. Exclude 
extraordinarily short execution times generated for operations on a 
predetermined operand or operands (for example, multiplication by 0 or 
1). If no register-to-register operations are implemented, continue with 
(2).
    2. The faster of register-to-memory or memory-to-register 
operations; if these also do not exist, then continue with (3).
    3. Memory-to-memory.
    In each case above, use the shortest execution time certified by the 
manufacturer.
    Step 2: TP for each supported operand length WL:
    Adjust the effective rate R (or R<SUP>t</SUP>) by the word length 
adjustment L as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.022

    Note: The word length WL used in these calculations is the operand 
length in bits. (If an operation uses operands of different lengths, 
select the largest word length.)
    The combination of a mantissa ALU and an exponent ALU of a floating 
point processor or unit is considered to be one ``computing Element'' 
(``CE'') with a Word Length (WL) equal to the number of bits in the data 
representation (typically 32 or 64) for purposes of the ``Composite 
Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') calculations.
    This adjustment is not applied to specialized logic processors that 
do not use XOR instructions. In this case TP = R.
    Select the maximum resulting value of TP for:
    Each XP-only ``CE'' (R<INF>xp</INF>);
    Each FP-only ``CE'' (R<INF>fp</INF>);
    Each combined FP and XP ``CE'' (R);
    Each simple logic processor not implementing any of the specified 
arithmetic operations; and
    Each special logic processor not using any of the specified 
arithmetic or logic operations.
    Step 3: ``CTP'' for aggregations of ``CEs'', including CPU's:
    For a CPU with a single ``CE'', ``CTP'' = TP (for CEs performing 
both fixed and floating point operations, TP = max (TP<INF>fp</INF>, 
TP<INF>xp</INF>)).
    ``CTP'' for aggregations of multiple ``CEs'' operating 
simultaneously is calculated as follows:
    Note 1: For aggregations that do not allow all of the ``CEs'' to run 
simultaneously, the possible combination of ``CEs'' that provides the 
largest ``CTP'' should be used. The TP of each contributing ``CE'' is to 
be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the 
``CTP'' of the combination is derived.
    N.B.: To determine the possible combinations of simultaneously 
operating ``CEs'', generate an instruction sequence that initiates 
operations in multiple ``CEs'', beginning with the slowest ``CE'' (the 
one needing the largest number of cycles to complete its operation) and 
ending with the fastest ``CE''. At each cycle of the sequence, the 
combination of ``CEs'' that are in operation during that cycle is a 
possible combination. The instruction sequence must take into account 
all hardware and/or architectural constraints on overlapping operations.
    Note 2: A single integrated circuit chip or board assembly may 
contain multiple ``CEs''.
    Note 3: Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the 
computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel or simultaneous 
operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.
    Note 4: ``CTP'' values are not to be aggregated for ``CE''-
combinations (inter)connected by ``Local Area Networks'', Wide Area 
Networks, Input/Output shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and 
any communication interconnection implemented by ``software''.
    Note 5: ``CTP'' values must be aggregated for multiple ``CEs'' 
specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operating 
simultaneously and sharing memory,-- or multiple memory/``CE''--
combinations operating simultaneously utilizing specially designed 
hardware. This aggregation does not apply to ``electronic assemblies'' 
controlled by 4A003.c.
    ``CTP'' = TP<INF>1</INF> + C<INF>2</INF> * TP<INF>2</INF> + . . . + 
C<INF>n</INF> * TP<INF>n</INF>, where the TPs are ordered by value, with 
TP<INF>1</INF>, being the highest, TP<INF>2</INF> being the second 
highest, . . . and TP<INF>n</INF> being the lowest. C<INF>i</INF> is a 
coefficient determined by the strength of the interconnection between 
``CEs'', as follows:
    For multiple ``CEs'' operating simultaneously and sharing memory:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.023
    
    Note 1: When the ``CTP'' calculated by the above method does not 
exceed 194 Mtops, the following formula may be used to calculate 
C<INF>i:</INF>
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR25MR96.024

    where m = the number of ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' sharing access.
    Provided:
    1. The TP<INF>i</INF> of each ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' does not 
exceed 30 Mtops;
    2. The ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' share access to main memory 
(excluding cache memory) over a single channel; and
    3. Only one ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' can have use of the channel 
at any given time.

    N.B.: This does not apply to items controlled under Category 3.
    Note 2: ``CEs'' share memory if they access a common segment of 
solid state memory. This memory may include cache memory, main memory, 
or other internal memory. Peripheral memory devices such as disk drives, 
tape drives, or RAM disks are not included.
    For multiple ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'' not sharing memory, 
interconnected by one or more data channels:

C<INF>i</INF>=0.75*k<INF>i</INF> (i=2, . . ., 32) (see NOTE on 
          k<INF>i</INF> factor)

=0.30*k<INF>i</INF> (i>256)


[[Page 566]]


    The value of C<INF>i</INF> is based on the number of ``CEs'', not 
the number of nodes.

where k<INF>i</INF>=min (S<INF>i</INF>/K<INF>r</INF>, 1), and
K<INF>r</INF>=normalizing factor of 20 MByte/s.
S<INF>i</INF>=sum of the maximum data rates (in units of MBytes/s) for 
all data channels connected to the i<INF>th</INF> ``CE'' or group of 
``CEs'' sharing memory.

    When calculating a C<INF>i</INF> for a group of ``CEs'', the number 
of the first ``CE'' in a group determines the proper limit for 
C<INF>i</INF>. For example, in an aggregation of groups consisting of 3 
``CEs'' each, the 22nd group will contain ``CE''<INF>64</INF>, 
``CE''<INF>65</INF> and ``CE''<INF>66</INF> . The proper limit for 
C<INF>i</INF> for this group is 0.60.
    Aggregation (of ``CEs'' or groups of ``CEs'') should be from the 
fastest-to-slowest; i.e.:
    TP<INF>1</INF><gr-thn-eq>TP<INF>2</INF><gr-thn-eq>TP<INF>3</INF>; 
and in the case of TP<INF>i</INF>=TP<INF>i</INF>+<INF>1</INF>, from the 
largest to smallest, i.e.:
    C<INF>i</INF><gr-thn-eq>C<INF>i</INF>+<INF>1</INF>
    Note: The k<INF>i</INF> factor is not to be applied to ``CEs'' to 2 
to 12 if the TP i / of the ``CE'' or group of ``CEs'' is more than 50 
Mtops; i.e., C<INF>i</INF> for ``CEs'' 2 to 12 is 0.75.

rms reference, when the hydrophone sensor, without a pre-amplifier, is 
placed in a plane wave acoustic field with an rms pressure of 1 
micropascal. For example, a hydrophone of -160 dB (reference 1 V per 
micropascal) would yield an output voltage of 10<SUP>-8</SUP> V in such

Related Definition: (1) Maintenance Level I: The failure of an inertial 
navigation unit is detected on the aircraft by indications from the 
Control and Display Unit (CDU) or by the status message from the 
corresponding sub-system. By following the manufacturer's manual, the 
cause of the failure may be localized at the level of the malfunctioning 
line replaceable unit (LRU). The operator then removes the LRU and 
replaces it with a spare.
(2) Maintenance Level II: The defective LRU is sent to the maintenance 
workshop (the manufacturer's or that of the operator responsible for 
level II maintenance). At the maintenance workshop, the malfunctioning 
LRU is tested by various appropriate means to verify and localize the 
defective shop replaceable assembly (SRA) module responsible for the 
failure. This SRA is removed and replaced by an operative spare. The 
defective SRA (or possibly the complete LRU) is then shipped to the 
manufacturer. Maintenance Level II does not include the removal of 
controlled accelerometers or gyro sensors from the SRA.

List of Items Controlled

    Unit: Equipment in number; systems, components, parts and 
accessories in $ value.
    Related Controls: (1) The corresponding EU list number controls 
space launch vehicles (not including their payloads) and other 
``spacecraft'' (not identified in this CCL entry). These items are 
subject to the export licensing authority of the U.S. Department of 
State, Office of Defense Trade Controls (See 22 CFR part 121, Category 
XV). For the control status of products contained in ``spacecraft'' 
payloads, see the appropriate

[[Page 617]]

categories of the U.S. Munitions List (USML). (2) For the control status 
of items contained in ``spacecraft'' payloads subject to the EAR, see 
the appropriate entries on the CCL.
    Related Definition: Transferring registration or operational control 
to any foreign person of any commercial communications satellite 
controlled by this entry must be authorized on a license issued by the 
Bureau of Export Administration. This requirement applies whether the 
commercial communications satellite is physically located in the United 
States or abroad.

                                  Items

    a. Commercial communications Satellites;


    Technical Note:  Commercial communications satellites are subject to 
Commerce licensing jurisdiction even if they include the individual 
munitions list systems, components, or parts identified in Category 
XV(f) of the United States Munitions List (USML). In all other cases, 
these Category XV(f) systems, components, or parts remain on the USML, 
except that satellite fuel, ground support equipment, test equipment, 
payload adapter/interface hardware, replacement parts for the preceding 
items, and non-embedded, solid propellant orbit transfer engines (``kick 
motors'') are subject to Commerce licensing jurisdiction (and not 
controlled on the USML) when they are to be utilized for the specific 
commercial communications satellite launch, provided the solid 
propellant ``kick motor'' being utilized is not specifically designed or 
modified for military use or capable of being restarted after 
achievement of mission orbit (such orbit transfer engines are always 
controlled under Category IV of the USML). Technical data (as defined in 
Sec. 120.10 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) and 
defense services (as defined in Sec. 120.9 of the ITAR) related to the 
systems, components, or parts referred to in Category XV(f) of the USML 
are always controlled under the USML, even when the satellite itself is 
licensed by the Department of Commerce.



    Notes:  1. Military communication satellites or multi-mission 
satellites, including commercial communications satellites having 
additional non-communication mission(s) or payload(s) are under the 
jurisdiction of the Department of State.
    2. As indicated in the Technical Note, under some circumstances a 
license application under 9A004 includes other items, which are 
necessary for the commercial communications satellite launch, but are 
normally subject to State Department jurisdiction. Certain of these 
items (e.g., kickmotors, satellite fuel, etc.) are controlled by the 
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Equipment and Technology Annex.


    b. [Reserved]
    c. Other ``spacecraft'' not subject to the export licensing 
authority of the U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade 
Controls under 22 CFR part 121, Category XV.


    Notes:  1. ECCN 9A004.c includes the international space station 
being developed, launched and operated under the supervision of the U.S. 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Exporters requesting a 
license from the Department of Commerce for spacecraft other than the 
international space station or a commercial communications satellite 
specified in 9A004 must provide a statement from the Department of 
State, Office of Defense Trade Controls, verifying that the item 
intended for export is under the licensing jurisdiction of the 
Department of Commerce.
    2. All other spacecraft, including all other satellites not 
controlled under 9A004 and components, parts, accessories, attachments, 
associated equipment, and ground support equipment therefor are subject 
to the export licensing authority of the Department of State.
    3. Items on Category XV(f) of the USML and certain other USML items 
designated in the technical note, above, that are included in a 
commercial communications satellite to be exported under a Commerce 
license must be specifically listed on the Commerce license application. 
Such USML items when not included in a specific commercial 
communications satellite are under the jurisdiction of the Department of 
State.
    4. Technical data provided to the launch provider (form, fit, 
function, mass, electrical, mechanical, dynamic/environmental, 
telemetry, safety, facility, launch pad access, and launch parameters) 
for commercial communications satellites that describe the interfaces 
for mating of the satellite to the launch vehicle and parameters for 
launch (e.g., orbit, timing) of the satellite, are under Commerce 
jurisdiction. Other technical data and all defense services and 
technical assistance for satellite and/or launch vehicles, including 
compatibility, integration, or processing data are controlled and 
subject to licensing by the Department of State, in accordance with 22 
CFR parts 120 through 130. Approval for such technical assistance will 
require a Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA) and may require U.S. 
Government oversight.
    5. Once a satellite is launched, items remaining unlaunched are 
required to be returned immediately to the United States. If the 
satellite launch is canceled or unduly delayed, the satellite and all 
support equipment must be returned immediately to the United States.
    6. Detailed design, development, production, or manufacturing data 
for all spacecraft, including satellites, regardless of

[[Page 618]]

which agency has jurisdiction over the export, and all systems 
components, parts, accessories, attachments, and associated equipment 
(including ground support equipment) specifically designed or modified 
for articles under Category XV on the United States Munitions List 
(including software source code and operating algorithms) are subject to 
licensing by the Department of State. This does not include that level 
of technical data (including marketing data) necessary and reasonable 
for a purchaser to have assurance that a U.S.-built item intended to 
operate in space has been designed, manufactured and tested in 
conformance with specified contract requirements (e.g., operational 
performance, reliability, lifetime, product quality, or delivery 
expectations) as well as data necessary for normal in-orbit satellite 
operations, to evaluate in-orbit anomalies, and to operate and maintain 
associated ground station equipment (except encryption hardware).

                      Advisory Notes for Category 9

    Advisory Note 1: Licenses are likely to be approved, as 
administrative exceptions, for export and reexport to satisfactory end-
users in Country Group D:1 of marine gas turbine engines controlled by 
9A002, for installation in civil marine vessels for civil end-use, 
provided that their specific fuel consumption exceeds 0.23 kg/kW-hr. and 
their continuous ISO rating is less than 20,000 kW.

    Editorial Note: For additional Federal Register citations to 
Supplement No. 1 to part 774, see the List of CFR Sections Affected in 
the Finding Aids section of this volume.

   Supplement No. 2 to Part 774--General Technology and Software Notes

    1. General Technology Note. The export of ``technology'' that is 
``required'' for the ``development'', ``production'', or ``use'' of 
items on the Commerce Control List is controlled according to the 
provisions in each Category.
    ``Technology'' ``required'' for the ``development'', ``production'', 
or ``use'' of a controlled product remains controlled even when 
applicable to a product controlled at a lower level.
    License Exception OTS is available for ``technology'' that is the 
minimum necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance 
(checking), and repair of those products that are eligible for License 
Exceptions or that are exported under a license.
    N.B.: This does not allow release under a License Exception of the 
repair ``technology'' controlled by 1E002.e, 1E002.f, 7E003, or 8E002.a.
    N.B.: The 'minimum necessary' excludes ``development'' or 
``production'' technology and permits ``use'' technology only to the 
extent ``required'' to ensure safe and efficient use of the product. 
Individual ECCNs may further restrict export of ``minimum necessary'' 
information.
    II. General Software Note. License Exception TSU (``mass market'' 
software) is available to all destinations, except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, 
Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, for release of software that is 
generally available to the public by being:
    a. Sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction, by 
means of:
    1. Over the counter transactions;
    2. Mail order transactions; or
    3. Telephone call transactions; and
    b. Designed for installation by the user without further substantial 
support by the supplier.
    Note: License Exception TSU for mass market software does not apply 
to encryption software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002. 
Encryption software may become eligible after a one-time BXA review 
according to the provision of Sec. 742.15(b)(1) of the EAR.
