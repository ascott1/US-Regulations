                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2002), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

assigned to that vessel has been reached, or when there is not a DML 
assigned to that vessel.
    (3) Upon written request made in advance of entering the ETP, the 
limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section may 
be waived by the Administrator, Southwest Region, for the purpose of 
allowing transit through the ETP. The waiver will provide, in writing, 
the terms and conditions under which the vessel must operate, including 
a requirement to report by radio to the Administrator, Southwest Region, 
the vessel's date of exit from or subsequent entry into the permit area.
    (b) Permits--(1) Vessel permit. The owner or managing owner of a 
United States purse seine fishing vessel of greater than 400 st (362.8 
mt) carrying capacity that participates in commercial fishing operations 
in the ETP must possess a valid vessel permit issued under this 
paragraph (b) of this section. This permit is not transferable and must 
be renewed annually. If a vessel permit holder surrenders his/her permit 
to the Administrator, Southwest Region, the permit will not be returned 
and a new permit will not be issued before the end of the calendar year. 
Vessel permits are valid through December 31 of each year.
    (2) Operator permit. The person in charge of and actually 
controlling fishing operations (hereinafter referred to as the operator) 
on a United States purse seine fishing vessel engaged in commercial 
fishing operations under a vessel permit must possess a valid operator 
permit issued under paragraph (b) of this section. Such permits are not 
transferable and must be renewed annually. To receive a permit, the 
operator must have satisfactorily completed all required training under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The operator's permit is valid only 
when the permit holder is on a vessel with a valid vessel permit. 
Operator permits will be valid through December 31 of each year.
    (3) Possession and display. A valid vessel permit issued pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be on board the vessel while 
engaged in fishing operations, and a valid operator permit issued 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be in the possession 
of the operator to whom it was issued. Permits must be shown upon 
request to NMFS enforcement agents, or to U.S. Coast Guard officers, or 
to designated agents of NMFS or the IATTC (including observers). A 
vessel owner or operator who is at sea on a fishing trip when his or her 
permit expires and to whom a permit for the next year has been issued 
may take marine mammals under the terms of the new permit without having 
to display it on board the vessel until the vessel returns to port.
    (4) Application for vessel permit. The owner or managing owner of a 
purse seine vessel may apply for a vessel permit from the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, allowing at least 45 days for processing. The 
application must be signed by the applicant and contain:
    (i) The name, official number, tonnage, carrying capacity in short 
or metric tons, maximum speed in knots, processing equipment, and type 
and

paragraph (c)(2) of this section if the application is for purse seining 
involving the intentional taking of marine mammals, of the vessel that 
is to be covered under the permit;
    (ii) A statement of whether the vessel will make sets involving the 
intentional taking of marine mammals;
    (iii) The type and identification number(s) of Federal, State, and 
local commercial fishing licenses under which vessel operations are 
conducted, and the dates of expiration;
    (iv) The name(s) of the operator(s) anticipated to be used; and
    (v) The name of the applicant, whether he/she is the owner or the 
managing owner, his/her address, telephone and fax numbers, and, if 
applicable, the name, address, telephone and fax numbers of the agent or 
organization acting on behalf of the vessel.
    (5) Application for operator permit. A person wishing to operate a 
purse seine vessel may apply for an operator permit from the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, allowing at least 45 days for 
processing. The application must be signed by the applicant or the 
applicant's representative, if applicable, and contain:
    (i) The name, address, telephone and fax numbers of the applicant;
    (ii) The type and identification number(s) of any Federal, state, 
and local fishing licenses held by the applicant;
    (iii) The name of the vessel(s) on which the applicant anticipates 
serving as an operator; and
    (iv) The date, location, and provider of any training for the 
operator permit.
    (6) Fees. (i) Vessel permit application fees. An application for a 
permit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must include a fee for 
each vessel as specified on the application form. The Assistant 
Administrator may change the amount of this fee at any time if a 
different fee is determined in accordance with the NOAA Finance Handbook 
and specified by the Administrator, Southwest Region, on the application 
form.
    (ii) Operator permit fee. There is no fee for a operator permit 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The Assistant Administrator may 
impose a fee or change the amount of this fee at any time if a different 
fee is determined in accordance with the NOAA Finance Handbook and 
specified by the Administrator, Southwest Region, on the application 
form.
    (iii) Observer placement fee. The vessel permit holder must submit 
the fee for the placement of observers, as established by the IATTC or 
other approved observer program, to the Administrator, Southwest Region, 
by September 1 of the year prior to the year in which the vessel will be 
operated in the ETP. The Administrator, Southwest Region, will forward 
all observer placement fees to the IATTC or to the applicable 
international organization approved by the Administrator, Southwest 
Region.
    (7) Application approval. The Administrator, Southwest Region, will 
determine the adequacy and completeness of an application and, upon 
determining that an application is adequate and complete, will approve 
that application and issue the appropriate permit, except for applicants 
having unpaid or overdue civil penalties, criminal fines, or other 
liabilities incurred in a legal proceeding.
    (8) Conditions applicable to all permits-- (i) General Conditions. 
Failure to comply with the provisions of a permit or with these 
regulations may lead to suspension, revocation, modification, or denial 
of a permit. The permit holder, vessel, vessel owner, operator, or 
master may be subject, jointly or severally, to the penalties provided 
for under the MMPA. Procedures governing permit sanctions and denials 
are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (ii) Observer placement. By obtaining a permit, the permit holder 
consents to the placement of an observer on the vessel during every trip 
involving operations in the ETP and agrees to payment of the fees for 
observer placement. No observer will be assigned to a vessel unless that 
vessel owner has submitted payment of observer fees to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. The observers may be placed under an 
observer program of NMFS, IATTC, or another international observer 
program approved by the IDCP and the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (iii) Explosives. The use of explosive devices is prohibited during 
all tuna

[[Page 22]]

purse seine operations that involve marine mammals.
    (iv) Reporting requirements. (A) The vessel permit holder of each 
permitted vessel must notify the Administrator, Southwest Region or the 
IATTC contact designated by the Administrator, Southwest Region, at 
least 5 days in advance of the vessel's departure on a fishing voyage to 
allow for observer placement on every voyage.
    (B) The vessel permit holder must notify the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, or the IATTC contact designated by the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, of any change of vessel operator at least 48 hours 
prior to departing on a trip. In the case of a change in operator due to 
an emergency, notification must be made within 72 hours of the change.
    (v) Data release. By using a permit, the permit holder authorizes 
the release to NMFS and the IATTC of all data collected by observers 
aboard purse seine vessels during fishing trips under the IATTC observer 
program or another international observer program approved by the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. The permit holder must furnish the 
international observer program with all release forms required to 
authorize the observer data to be provided to NMFS and the IATTC. Data 
obtained under such releases will be used for the same purposes as would 
data collected directly by observers placed by NMFS and will be subject 
to the same standards of confidentiality.
    (9) Mortality and serious injury reports. The Administrator, 
Southwest Region, will provide to the public periodic status reports 
summarizing the estimated incidental dolphin mortality and serious 
injury by U.S. vessels of individual species and stocks.
    (c) Purse seining by vessels with DMLs. In addition to the terms and 
conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, any permit for a 
vessel to which a DML has been assigned under paragraph (c)(8) of this 
section and any operator permit when used on such a vessel are subject 
to the following terms and conditions:
    (1) A vessel may be used to chase and encircle schools of dolphins 
in the ETP only under the immediate direction of the holder of a valid 
operator's permit.
    (2) No retention of Marine Mammals. Except as otherwise authorized 
by a specific permit, marine mammals incidentally taken must be 
immediately returned to the ocean without further injury. The operator 
of a purse seine vessel must take every precaution to refrain from 
causing or permitting incidental mortality or serious injury of marine 
mammals. Live marine mammals must not be brailed, sacked up, or hoisted 
onto the deck during ortza retrieval.
    (3) Gear and equipment required for valid permit. A vessel 
possessing a vessel permit for purse seining involving the intentional 
taking of marine mammals may not engage in fishing operations involving 
the intentional deployment of the net on or encirclement of dolphins 
unless it is equipped with a dolphin safety panel in its purse seine, 
has the other required gear and equipment, and uses the required 
procedures.
    (i) Dolphin safety panel. The dolphin safety panel must be a minimum 
of 180 fathoms in length (as measured before installation), except that 
the minimum length of the panel in nets deeper than 18 strips must be 
determined in a ratio of 10 fathoms in length for each strip of net 
depth. It must be installed so as to protect the perimeter of the 
backdown area. The perimeter of the backdown area is the length of 
corkline that begins at the outboard end of the last bowbunch pulled and 
continues to at least two-thirds the distance from the backdown channel 
apex to the stern tiedown point. The dolphin safety panel must consist 
of small mesh webbing not to exceed 1 1/4 inches (3.18 centimeter (cm)) 
stretch mesh extending downward from the corkline and, if present, the 
base of the dolphin apron to a minimum depth equivalent to two strips of 
100 meshes of 4 1/4 inches (10.80 cm) stretch mesh webbing. In addition, 
at least a 20-fathom length of corkline must be free from bunchlines at 
the apex of the backdown channel.
    (ii) Dolphin safety panel markers. Each end of the dolphin safety 
panel and dolphin apron must be identified with an easily 
distinguishable marker.

[[Page 23]]

    (iii) Dolphin safety panel hand holds. Throughout the length of the 
corkline under which the dolphin safety panel and dolphin apron are 
located, hand hold openings must be secured so that they will not allow 
the insertion of a 1 3/8 inch (3.50 cm) diameter cylindrical-shaped 
object.
    (iv) Dolphin safety panel corkline hangings. Throughout the length 
of the corkline under which the dolphin safety panel and dolphin apron 
are located, corkline hangings must be inspected by the vessel operator 
following each trip. Hangings found to have loosened to the extent that 
a cylindrical object with a 1 3/8 inch (3.50 cm) diameter can be 
inserted between the cork and corkline hangings, must be tightened so as 
not to allow the insertion of a cylindrical object with a 1 3/8 inch 
(3.50 cm) diameter.
    (v) Speedboats. A minimum of three speedboats in operating condition 
must be carried. All speedboats carried aboard purse seine vessels and 
in operating condition must be rigged with tow lines and towing bridles 
or towing posts. Speedboat hoisting bridles may not be substituted for 
towing bridles.
    (vi) Raft. A raft suitable to be used as a dolphin observation-and-
rescue platform must be carried.
    (vii) Face mask and snorkel, or view box. At least two face masks 
and snorkels or view boxes must be carried.
    (viii) Lights. The vessel must be equipped with lights capable of 
producing a minimum of 140,000 lumens of output for use in darkness to 
ensure sufficient light to observe that procedures for dolphin release 
are carried out and to monitor incidental dolphin mortality.
    (4) Vessel inspection--(i) Annual. At least once during each 
calendar year, purse seine nets and other gear and equipment required 
under Sec. 216.24(c)(2) must be made available for inspection and for a 
trial set/net alignment by an authorized NMFS inspector or IATTC staff 
as specified by the Administrator, Southwest Region, in order to obtain 
a vessel permit.
    (ii) Reinspection. Purse seine nets and other gear and equipment 
required by these regulations must be made available for reinspection by 
an authorized NMFS inspector or IATTC staff as specified by the 
Administrator, Southwest Region. The vessel permit holder must notify 
the Administrator, Southwest Region, of any net modification at least 5 
days prior to departure of the vessel in order to determine whether a 
reinspection or trial set/net alignment is required.
    (iii) Upon failure to pass an inspection or reinspection, a vessel 
may not engage in purse seining involving the intentional taking of 
marine mammals until the deficiencies in gear or equipment are corrected 
as required by NMFS.
    (5) Operator permit holder training requirements. An operator must 
maintain proficiency sufficient to perform the procedures required 
herein, and must attend and satisfactorily complete a formal training 
session approved by the Administrator, Southwest Region, in order to 
obtain his or her permit. At the training session an attendee will be 
instructed on the relevant provisions and regulatory requirements of the 
MMPA and the IDCP, and the fishing gear and techniques that are required 
for, or will contribute to, reducing serious injury and mortality of 
dolphin incidental to purse seining for tuna. Operators who have 
received a written certificate of satisfactory completion of training 
and who possess a current or previous calendar year permit will not be 
required to attend additional formal training sessions unless there are 
substantial changes in the relevant provisions or implementing 
regulations of the MMPA or the IDCP, or in fishing gear and techniques. 
Additional training may be required for any operator who is found by the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, to lack proficiency in the required 
fishing procedures or familiarity with the relevant provisions or 
regulations of the MMPA or the IDCP.
    (6) Marine mammal release requirements. All operators must use the 
following procedures during all sets involving the incidental taking of 
marine mammals in association with the capture and landing of tuna.
    (i) Backdown procedure. Backdown must be performed following a purse 
seine set in which dolphins are captured in the course of catching tuna, 
and must be continued until it is no

[[Page 24]]

longer possible to remove live dolphins from the net by this procedure. 
At least one crewman must be deployed during backdown to aid in the 
release of dolphins. Thereafter, other release procedures required will 
be continued so that all live dolphins are released prior to the 
initiation of the sack-up procedure.
    (ii) Prohibited use of sharp or pointed instrument. The use of a 
sharp or pointed instrument to remove any marine mammal from the net is 
prohibited.
    (iii) Sundown sets prohibited. On every set encircling dolphin, the 
backdown procedure must be completed no later than one-half hour after 
sundown, except as provided here. For the purpose of this section, 
sundown is defined as the time at which the upper edge of the sun 
disappears below the horizon or, if the view of the sun is obscured, the 
local time of sunset calculated from tables developed by the U.S. Naval 
Observatory or other authoritative source approved by the Administrator, 
Southwest Region. A sundown set is a set in which the backdown procedure 
has not been completed and rolling the net to sack-up has not begun 
within one-half hour after sundown. Should a set extend beyond one-half 
hour after sundown, the operator must use the required marine mammal 
release procedures including the use of the high intensity lighting 
system. In the event a sundown set occurs where the seine skiff was let 
go 90 or more minutes before sundown, and an earnest effort to rescue 
dolphins is made, the International Review Panel of the IDCP may 
recommend to the United States that in the view of the International 
Review Panel, prosecution by the United States is not recommended. Any 
such recommendation will be considered by the United States in 
evaluating the appropriateness of prosecution in a particular 
circumstance.
    (iv) Dolphin safety panel. During backdown, the dolphin safety panel 
must be positioned so that it protects the perimeter of the backdown 
area. The perimeter of the backdown area is the length of corkline that 
begins at the outboard end of the last bow bunch pulled and continues to 
at least two-thirds the distance from the backdown channel apex to the 
stern tiedown point.
    (7) Experimental fishing operations. The Administrator, Southwest 
Region, may authorize experimental fishing operations, consistent with 
the provisions of the IDCP, for the purpose of testing proposed 
improvements in fishing techniques and equipment that may reduce or 
eliminate dolphin mortality or serious injury, or do not require the 
encirclement of dolphins in the course of fishing operations. The 
Administrator, Southwest Region, may waive, as appropriate, any 
requirements of this section except DMLs and the obligation to carry an 
observer.
    (i) A vessel permit holder may apply to the Administrator, Southwest 
Region, for an experimental fishing operation waiver allowing for 
processing no less than 90 days before the date the proposed operation 
is intended to begin. An application must be signed by the permitted 
operator and contain:
    (A) The name(s) of the vessel(s) and the vessel permit holder(s) to 
participate;
    (B) A statement of the specific vessel gear and equipment or 
procedural requirement to be exempted and why such an exemption is 
necessary to conduct the experiment;
    (C) A description of how the proposed modification to the gear and 
equipment or procedures is expected to reduce incidental mortality or 
serious injury of marine mammals;
    (D) A description of the applicability of this modification to other 
purse seine vessels;
    (E) The planned design, time, duration, and general area of the 
experimental operation;
    (F) The name(s) of the permitted operator(s) of the vessel(s) during 
the experiment; and
    (G) A statement of the qualifications of the individual or company 
doing the analysis of the research.
    (ii) The Administrator, Southwest Region, will acknowledge receipt 
of the application and, upon determining that it is complete, will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register summarizing the application, 
making the full application available for inspection and inviting 
comments for a minimum period of 30 days from the date of publication.

[[Page 25]]

    (iii) The Administrator, Southwest Region, after considering the 
information in the application and the comments received on it, will 
either issue a waiver to conduct the experiment which includes 
restrictions or conditions deemed appropriate, or deny the application, 
giving the reasons for denial.
    (iv) A waiver for an experimental fishing operation will be valid 
only for the vessels and operators named in the permit, for the time 
period and areas specified, for trips carrying an observer designated by 
the Administrator, Southwest Region, when all the terms and conditions 
of the permit are met.
    (v) The Administrator, Southwest Region, may suspend or revoke an 
experimental fishing waiver in accordance with 15 CFR part 904 if the 
terms and conditions of the waiver or the provisions of the regulations 
are not followed.
    (8) Operator permit holder performance requirements. [Reserved]
    (9) Vessel permit holder dolphin mortality limits. For purposes of 
this paragraph, the term ``vessel permit holder'' includes both the 
holder of a current vessel permit and also the holder of a vessel permit 
for the following year.
    (i) By September 1 each year, a vessel permit holder desiring a DML 
for the following year must provide to the Administrator, Southwest 
Region, the name of the United States purse seine fishing vessel(s) of 
carrying capacity greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity that 
the owner intends to use to intentionally deploy purse seine fishing 
nets in the ETP to encircle dolphins in an effort to capture tuna during 
the following year. NMFS will forward the list of purse seine vessels to 
the Director of the IATTC on or before October 1, or as otherwise 
required by the IDCP, for assignment of a DML for the following year 
under the provisions of Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP.
    (ii) Each vessel permit holder that desires a DML only for the 
period between July 1 to December 31 must provide the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, by September 1 of the prior year, the name of the 
United States purse seine fishing vessel(s) of greater than 400 st 
(362.8 mt) carrying capacity that the owner intends to use to 
intentionally deploy purse seine fishing nets in the ETP to encircle 
dolphins in an effort to capture tuna during the period. NMFS will 
forward the list of purse seine vessels to the Director of the IATTC on 
or before October 1, or as otherwise required under the IDCP, for 
possible assignment of a DML for the 6-month period July 1 to December 
31. Under the IDCP, the DML will be calculated by the IDCP from any 
unutilized pool of DMLs in accordance with the procedure described in 
Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP and will not exceed one-third of 
an unadjusted full-year DML as calculated by the IDCP.
    (iii)(A) The Administrator, Southwest Region, will notify vessel 
owners of the DML assigned for each vessel for the following year, or 
the second half of the year, as applicable.
    (B) The Administrator, Southwest Region, may adjust the DMLs in 
accordance with Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP. All adjustments 
of full-year DMLs will be made before January 1, and the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, will notify the Director of the IATTC of any 
adjustments prior to a vessel departing on a trip using its adjusted 
DML. The notification will be no later than February 1 in the case of 
adjustments to full-year DMLs, and no later than May 1 in the case of 
adjustments to DMLs for the second half of the year.
    (C) Within the requirements of Annex IV of the Agreement on the 
IDCP, the Administrator, Southwest Region, may adjust a vessel's DML if 
it will further scientific or technological advancement in the 
protection of marine mammals in the fishery or if the past performance 
of the vessel indicates that the protection or use of the yellowfin tuna 
stocks or marine mammals is best served by the adjustment, within the 
mandates of the MMPA. Experimental fishing operation waivers or 
scientific research permits will be considered a basis for adjustments.
    (iv)(A) A vessel assigned a full-year DML that does not make a set 
on dolphins by April 1 or that leaves the fishery will lose its DML for 
the remainder of the year, unless the failure to set on dolphins is due 
to force majeure or other

[[Page 26]]

extraordinary circumstances as determined by the International Review 
Panel.
    (B) A vessel assigned a DML for the second half of the year will be 
considered to have lost its DML if the vessel has not made a set on 
dolphins before December 31, unless the failure to set on dolphins is 
due to force majeure or extraordinary circumstances as determined by the 
International Review Panel.
    (C) Any vessel that loses its DML for 2 consecutive years will not 
be eligible to receive a DML for the following year.
    (D) NMFS will determine, based on available information, whether a 
vessel has left the fishery.
    (1) A vessel lost at sea, undergoing extensive repairs, operating in 
an ocean area other than the ETP, or for which other information 
indicates will no longer be conducting purse seine operations in the ETP 
for the remainder of the period covered by the DML will be determined to 
have left the fishery.
    (2) NMFS will make all reasonable efforts to determine the 
intentions of the vessel owner, and the owner of any vessel that has 
been preliminarily determined to have left the fishery will be provided 
notice of such preliminary determination and given the opportunity to 
provide information on whether the vessel has left the fishery prior to 
NMFS making a final determination under 15 CFR part 904 and notifying 
the IATTC.
    (v) Any vessel that exceeds its assigned DML after any applicable 
adjustment under paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section will have its DML 
for the subsequent year reduced by 150 percent of the overage, unless 
another adjustment is determined by the International Review Panel.
    (vi) A vessel that is covered by a valid vessel permit and that does 
not normally fish for tuna in the ETP but desires to participate in the 
fishery on a limited basis may apply for a per-trip DML from the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, at any time, allowing at least 60 days 
for processing. The request must state the expected number of trips 
involving sets on dolphins and the anticipated dates of the trip or 
trips. The request will be forwarded to the Director of the IATTC for 
processing in accordance with Annex IV of the Agreement on the IDCP. A 
per-trip DML will be assigned if one is made available in accordance 
with the terms of Annex IV of the IDCP. If a vessel assigned a per-trip 
DML does not set on dolphins during that trip, the vessel will be 
considered to have lost its DML unless this was a result of force 
majeure or other extraordinary circumstances as determined by the 
International Review Panel. After two consecutive losses of a DML, a 
vessel will not be eligible to receive a DML for the next fishing year.
    (vii) Observers will make their records available to the vessel 
operator at any reasonable time, including after each set, in order for 
the operator to monitor the balance of the DML(s) remaining for use.
    (viii) Vessel and operator permit holders must not deploy a purse 
seine net on or encircle any school of dolphins containing individuals 
of a particular stock of dolphins:
    (A) When the applicable per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit 
for that stock of dolphins (or for that vessel, if so assigned) has been 
reached or exceeded; or
    (B) After the time and date provided in actual notification or 
notification in the Federal Register by the Administrator, Southwest 
Region, based upon the best available evidence, stating when any 
applicable per-stock per-year dolphin mortality limit has been reached 
or exceeded, or is expected to be reached in the near future.
    (ix) If individual dolphins belonging to a stock that is prohibited 
from being taken are not reasonably observable at the time the net skiff 
attached to the net is released from the vessel at the start of a set, 
the fact that individuals of that stock are subsequently taken will not 
be cause for enforcement action provided that all procedures required by 
the applicable regulations have been followed.
    (x) Vessel and operator permit holders must not intentionally deploy 
a purse seine net on or encircle dolphins intentionally:
    (A) When the vessel's DML, as adjusted, is reached or exceeded; or

[[Page 27]]

    (B) After the date and time provided in actual notification by 
letter, facsimile, radio, or electronic mail, or notice in the Federal 
Register by the Administrator, Southwest Region, based upon the best 
available evidence, that intentional sets on dolphins must cease because 
the total of the DMLs assigned to the U.S. fleet has been reached or 
exceeded, or is expected to be exceeded in the near future.
    (xi) Sanctions recommended by the International Review Panel for any 
violation of these rules will be considered by NMFS and NOAA in 
enforcement actions brought under these regulations.
    (xii) Intentionally deploying a purse seine net on, or to encircle, 
dolphins after a vessel's DML, as adjusted, has been reached will 
disqualify the vessel from consideration for a DML for the following 
year. If already assigned, the DML for the following year will be 
withdrawn, and the Director of the IATTC will be notified by NMFS that 
the DML assigned to that vessel will be unutilized. Procedures found at 
15 CFR part 904 apply to the withdrawal of the permit.
    (d) Purse seining by vessels without assigned DMLs. In addition to 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, a vessel permit used 
for a trip not involving an assigned DML and the operator's permit when 
used on such a vessel are subject to the following terms and conditions: 
a permit holder may take marine mammals provided that such taking is an 
accidental occurrence in the course of normal commercial fishing 
operations and the vessel does not intentionally deploy its net on, or 
to encircle, dolphins; marine mammals taken incidental to such 
commercial fishing operations must be immediately returned to the 
environment where captured without further injury, using release 
procedures such as hand rescue, and aborting the set at the earliest 
effective opportunity; the use of one or more rafts and face masks or 
view boxes to aid in the rescue of dolphins is recommended.
    (e) Observers: (1) The holder of a vessel permit must allow an 
observer duly authorized by the Administrator, Southwest Region, to 
accompany the vessel on all fishing trips in the ETP for the purpose of 
conducting research and observing operations, including collecting 
information that may be used in civil or criminal penalty proceedings, 
forfeiture actions, or permit sanctions. A vessel that fails to carry an 
observer in accordance with these requirements may not engage in fishing 
operations.
    (2) Research and observation duties will be carried out in such a 
manner as to minimize interference with commercial fishing operations. 
Observers must be provided access to vessel personnel and to dolphin 
safety gear and equipment, electronic navigation equipment, radar 
displays, high powered binoculars, and electronic communication 
equipment. The navigator must provide true vessel locations by latitude 
and longitude, accurate to the nearest minute, upon request by the 
observer. Observers must be provided with adequate space on the bridge 
or pilothouse for clerical work, as well as space on deck adequate for 
carrying out observer duties. No vessel owner, master, operator, or crew 
member of a permitted vessel may impair, or in any way interfere with, 
the research or observations being carried out. Masters must allow 
observers to use vessel communication equipment to report information 
concerning the take of marine mammals and other observer collected data 
upon request of the observer.
    (3) Any marine mammals killed during fishing operations that are 
accessible to crewmen and requested from the permit holder or master by 
the observer must be brought aboard the vessel and retained for 
biological processing, until released by the observer for return to the 
ocean. Whole marine mammals or marine mammal parts designated as 
biological specimens by the observer must be retained in cold storage 
aboard the vessel until retrieved by authorized personnel of NMFS or the 
IATTC when the vessel returns to port for unloading.
    (4) It is unlawful for any person to forcibly assault, impede, 
intimidate, interfere with, or to influence or attempt to influence an 
observer, or to harass (including sexual harassment) an observer by 
conduct which has the

[[Page 28]]

purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the observer's work 
performance, or which creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive 
environment. In determining whether conduct constitutes harassment, the 
totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the conduct and 
the context in which it occurred, will be considered. The determination 
of the legality of a particular action will be made from the facts on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (5)(i) All observers must be provided sleeping, toilet and eating 
accommodations at least equal to that provided to a full crew member. A 
mattress or futon on the floor or a cot is not acceptable in place of a 
regular bunk. Meal and other galley privileges must be the same for the 
observer as for other crew members.
    (ii) Female observers on a vessel with an all-male crew must be 
accommodated either in a single-person cabin or, if reasonable privacy 
can be ensured by installing a curtain or other temporary divider, in a 
two-person cabin shared with a licensed officer of the vessel. If the 
cabin assigned to a female observer does not have its own toilet and 
shower facilities that can be provided for the exclusive use of the 
observer, then a schedule for time-sharing common facilities must be 
established before the placement meeting and approved by NMFS or other 
approved observer program and must be followed during the entire trip.
    (iii) In the event there are one or more female crew members, the 
female observer must be provided a bunk in a cabin shared solely with 
female crew members, and provided toilet and shower facilities shared 
solely with these female crew members.
    (f) Importation, purchase, shipment, sale and transport. (1)(i) It 
is illegal to import into the United States any fish, whether fresh, 
frozen, or otherwise prepared, if the fish have been caught with 
commercial fishing technology that results in the incidental kill or 
incidental serious injury of marine mammals in excess of that allowed 
under this part for U.S. fishermen, or as specified at paragraphs (f)(7) 
through (f)(9) of this section.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph(f), and in applying the 
definition of an ``intermediary nation,'' an import occurs when the fish 
or fish product is released from a nation's Customs' custody and enters 
into the territory of the nation. For other purposes, ``import'' is 
defined in Sec. 216.3.
    (2)(i) HTS numbers requiring a Fisheries Certificate of Origin, 
subject to yellowfin tuna embargo. The following U.S. Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule (HTS) numbers identify yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna 
products that are harvested in the ETP purse seine fishery and imported 
into the United States. All shipments containing tuna or tuna products 
imported into the United States under these HTS numbers must be 
accompanied by a Fisheries Certificate of Origin (FCO), NOAA Form 370. 
Yellowfin tuna identified by any of the following HTS numbers that was 
harvested using a purse seine in the ETP may not be imported into the 
United States unless both the nation with jurisdiction over the 
harvesting vessel and the exporting nation (if different) have an 
affirmative finding under paragraph (f)(9) of this section.

the United States, through final processing, and it must

[[Page 30]]

be endorsed at each change in ownership. FCOs that require multiple 
endorsements must be submitted to the Administrator, Southwest Region, 
by the last endorser when all required endorsements are completed. An 
invoice must accompany the shipment at the time of importation or, in 
the alternative, must be made available within 30 days of a request by 
the Secretary or the Administrator, Southwest Region, to produce the 
invoice.
    (5) Contents of Fisheries Certificate of Origin. An FCO, certified 
to be accurate by the first exporter of the accompanying shipment, must 
include the following information:
    (i) Customs entry identification;
    (ii) Date of entry;
    (iii) Exporter's full name and complete address;
    (iv) Importer's or consignee's full name and complete address;
    (v) Species description, product form, and HTS number;
    (vi) Total net weight of the shipment in kilograms;
    (vii) Ocean area where the fish were harvested (ETP, Western Pacific 
Ocean, South Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Indian Ocean, 
or other);
    (viii) Type of fishing gear used to harvest the fish (purse seine, 
longline, baitboat, large-scale driftnet, gillnet, trawl, pole and line, 
or other);
    (ix) Country under whose laws the harvesting vessel operated based 
upon the flag of the vessel or, if a certified charter vessel, the 
country that accepted responsibility for the vessel's fishing 
operations;
    (x) Dates on which the fishing trip began and ended;
    (xi) If the shipment includes tuna or products harvested with a 
purse seine net, the name of the harvesting vessel;
    (xii) Dolphin safe condition of the shipment;
    (xiv) For shipments harvested by vessels of a nation known to use 
large-scale driftnets, as determined by the Secretary pursuant to 
paragraph (f)(8) of this section, a statement must be included on the 
Fisheries Certificate of Origin that is dated and signed by a 
responsible government official of the harvesting nation, certifying 
that the fish or fish products were harvested by a method other than 
large-scale driftnet; and
    (xii) If the shipment contains tuna harvested in the ETP by a purse 
seine vessel of more than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity, each 
importer or processor who takes custody of the shipment must sign and 
date the form to certify that the form and attached documentation 
accurately describe the shipment of fish that they accompany.
    (6) Dolphin-safe label. Tuna or tuna products sold in or exported 
from the United States that include on the label the term ``dolphin-
safe'' or any other term or symbol that claims or suggests the tuna were 
harvested in a manner not injurious to dolphins are subject to the 
requirements of subpart H of this part.
    (7) Scope of embargoes--(i) ETP yellowfin tuna embargo. Yellowfin 
tuna or yellowfin tuna products harvested using a purse seine in the ETP 
identified by an HTS number listed in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section may not be imported into the United States if such tuna or tuna 
products were:
    (A) Harvested on or after March 3, 1999, the effective date of 
section 4 of the IDCPA, and harvested by, or exported from, a nation 
that the Assistant Administrator has determined has purse seine vessels 
of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity harvesting tuna in 
the ETP, unless the Assistant Administrator has made an affirmative 
finding required for importation for that nation under paragraph (f)(9) 
of this section;
    (B) Exported from an intermediary nation, as defined in section 3 of 
the MMPA, and a ban is currently in force prohibiting the importation 
from that nation under paragraph (f)(9)(viii) of this section; or
    (C) Harvested before March 3, 1999, the effective date of section 4 
of the IDCPA, and would have been banned from importation under section 
101(a)(2) of the MMPA at the time of harvest.
    (ii) Driftnet embargo. A shipment containing an item listed in 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section may not be imported into the United 
States if it:
    (A) Was exported from or harvested on the high seas by any nation 
determined by the Assistant Administrator

[[Page 31]]

to be engaged in large-scale driftnet fishing, unless the FCO is 
accompanied by an original statement by a responsible government 
official of the harvesting nation, signed and dated by that official, 
certifying that the fish or fish products were harvested by a method 
other than large-scale driftnet; or
    (B) Is identified on the FCO as having been harvested by a large-
scale driftnet.
    (8) Large-scale driftnet nation: determination. Based upon the best 
information available, the Assistant Administrator will determine which 
nations have registered vessels that engage in fishing using large-scale 
driftnets. Such determinations will be published in the Federal 
Register. A responsible government official of any such nation may 
certify to the Assistant Administrator that none of the nation's vessels 
use large-scale driftnets. Upon receipt of the certification, the 
Assistant Administrator may find, and publish such finding in the 
Federal Register, that none of that nation's vessels engage in fishing 
with large-scale driftnets.
    (9) Affirmative finding procedure for nations harvesting yellowfin 
tuna using a purse seine in the ETP. (i) The Assistant Administrator 
will determine, on an annual basis, whether to make an affirmative 
finding based upon documentary evidence provided by the government of 
the exporting nation, by the government of the harvesting nation, if 
different, or by the IDCP and the IATTC, and will publish the finding in 
the Federal Register. A finding will remain valid for 1 year or for such 
other period as the Assistant Administrator may determine. An 
affirmative finding will be terminated if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that the requirements of this paragraph are no longer being 
met. Every 5 years, the government of the harvesting nation, must submit 
such documentary evidence directly to the Assistant Administrator and 
request an affirmative finding. Documentary evidence needs to be 
submitted by the harvesting nation for the first affirmative finding 
subsequent to the effective date of this rule. The Assistant 
Administrator may require the submission of supporting documentation or 
other verification of statements made in connection with requests to 
allow importations. An affirmative finding applies to tuna and tuna 
products that were harvested by vessels of the nation after February 15, 
1999. To make an affirmative finding, the Assistant Administrator must 
find that:
    (A) The harvesting nation participates in the IDCP and is either a 
member of the IATTC or has initiated (and within 6 months thereafter 
completed) all steps required of applicant nations, in accordance with 
article V, paragraph 3, of the Convention establishing the IATTC, to 
become a member of that organization;
    (B) The nation is meeting its obligations under the IDCP and its 
obligations of membership in the IATTC, including all financial 
obligations;
    (C)(1) The annual total dolphin mortality of the nation's purse 
seine fleet (including certified charter vessels operating under its 
jurisdiction) did not exceed the aggregated total of the mortality 
limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's purse seine vessels for 
the year preceding the year in which the finding would start; or
    (2)(i) Because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of 
the nation and the vessel captains, the total dolphin mortality of the 
nation's purse seine fleet (including certified charter vessels 
operating under its jurisdiction) exceeded the aggregated total of the 
mortality limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's purse seine 
vessels; and
    (ii) Immediately after the national authorities discovered the 
aggregate mortality of its fleet had been exceeded, the nation required 
all its vessels to cease fishing for tuna in association with dolphins 
for the remainder of the calendar year; and
    (D)(1) For calendar year 2000 and any subsequent years in which the 
parties agree to a global allocation system for per-stock per-year 
individual stock quotas, the nation responded to the notification from 
the IATTC that an individual stock quota had been reached by prohibiting 
any additional sets on the stock for which the quota had been reached;

[[Page 32]]

    (2) If a per-stock per-year quota is allocated to each nation, the 
annual per-stock per-year dolphin mortality of the nation's purse seine 
fleet (including certified charter vessels operating under its 
jurisdiction) did not exceed the aggregated total of the per-stock per-
year limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's purse seine vessels 
(if any) for the year preceding the year in which the finding would 
start; or
    (3)(i) Because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of 
the nation and the vessel captains, the per-stock per-year dolphin 
mortality of the nation's purse seine fleet (including certified charter 
vessels operating under its jurisdiction) exceeded the aggregated total 
of the per-stock per-year limits assigned by the IDCP for that nation's 
purse seine vessels; and
    (ii) Immediately after the national authorities discovered the 
aggregate per-stock mortality limits of its fleet had been exceeded, the 
nation required all its vessels to cease fishing for tuna in association 
with the stocks whose limits had been exceeded, for the remainder of the 
calendar year.
    (ii) Documentary Evidence and Compliance with the IDCP.--(A) 
Documentary Evidence. The Assistant Administrator will make an 
affirmative finding under paragraph (f)(9)(i) of this section only if 
the government of the harvesting nation provides directly to the 
Assistant Administrator, or authorizes the IATTC to release to the 
Assistant Administrator, complete, accurate, and timely information that 
enables the Assistant Administrator to determine whether the harvesting 
nation is meeting the obligations of the IDCP, and whether ETP-harvested 
tuna imported from such nation comports with the tracking and 
verification regulations of subpart H of this part.
    (B) Revocation. After considering the information provided under 
paragraph (f)(9)(ii)(A) of this section, each party's financial 
obligations to the IATTC, and any other relevant information, including 
information that a nation is consistently failing to take enforcement 
actions on violations which diminish the effectiveness of the IDCP, the 
Assistant Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, 
will revoke an affirmative finding issued to a nation that is not 
meeting the obligations of the IDCP.
    (iii) A harvesting nation may apply for an affirmative finding at 
any time by providing to the Assistant Administrator the information and 
authorizations required in paragraphs (f)(9)(i) and (f)(9)(ii) of this 
section, allowing at least 60 days from the submission of complete 
information to NMFS for processing.
    (iv) The Assistant Administrator will make or renew an affirmative 
finding for the period from April 1 through March 31, or portion 
thereof, if the harvesting nation has provided all the information and 
authorizations required by paragraphs (f)(9)(i) and (f)(9)(ii) of this 
section, and has met the requirements of paragraphs (f)(9)(i) and 
(f)(9)(ii) of this section.
    (v) Reconsideration of finding. The Assistant Administrator may 
reconsider a finding upon a request from, and the submission of 
additional information by, the harvesting nation, if the information 
indicates that the nation has met the requirements under paragraphs 
(f)(9)(i) and (f)(9)(ii) of this section.
    (vi) Intermediary nation. Except as authorized under this paragraph, 
no tuna or tuna products classified under one of the HTS numbers listed 
in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section may be imported into the United 
States from any intermediary nation. An ``intermediary nation'' is a 
nation that exports yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products to the 
United States and that imports yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products 
that are subject to a direct ban on importation into the United States 
pursuant to section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA, unless shown not to be 
yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products harvested using purse seine in 
the ETP. The Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal 
Register a notice announcing when NMFS has determined, based on the best 
information available, that a nation is an ``intermediary nation.'' 
After the effective date of that notice, these import restrictions shall 
apply. Shipments of yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products shipped 
through a nation on a through bill of lading or in another

[[Page 33]]

manner that does not enter the shipments into that nation as an 
importation do not make that nation an intermediary nation.
    (A) Intermediary nation determination status. Imports from an 
intermediary nation of tuna and tuna products classified under any of 
the HTS numbers in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section may be imported 
into the United States only if the Assistant Administrator determines 
and publishes in the Federal Register that the intermediary nation has 
provided certification and reasonable proof that it has not imported in 
the preceding 6 months yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that 
are subject to a ban on direct importation into the United States under 
section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. At that time, the nation shall no 
longer be considered an ``intermediary nation'' and these import 
restrictions shall no longer apply.
    (B) Changing the status of intermediary nation determinations. The 
Assistant Administrator will review decisions under this paragraph upon 
the request of an intermediary nation. Such requests must be accompanied 
by specific and detailed supporting information or documentation 
indicating that a review or reconsideration is warranted. For purposes 
of this paragraph, the term ``certification and reasonable proof'' means 
the submission to the Assistant Administrator by a responsible 
government official from the nation of a document reflecting the 
nation's customs records for the preceding 6 months, together with a 
certification attesting that the document is accurate.
    (vii) Pelly certification. After 6 months of an embargo being in 
place against a nation under this section, that fact will be certified 
to the President for purposes of certification under section 8(a) of the 
Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978(a)) for as long as 
the embargo remains in effect.
    (viii) Coordination. The Assistant Administrator will promptly 
advise the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury of 
embargo decisions, actions and finding determinations.
    (10) Fish refused entry. If fish is denied entry under paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section, the District Director of Customs shall refuse to 
release the fish for entry into the United States and shall issue a 
notice of such refusal to the importer or consignee.
    (11) Disposition of fish refused entry into the United States; 
redelivered fish. Fish which is denied entry under paragraph (f)(3) of 
this section and which is not exported under Customs supervision within 
90 days from the date of notice of refusal of admission or date of 
redelivery shall be disposed of under Customs laws and regulations. 
Provided however, that any disposition shall not result in an 
introduction into the United States of fish caught in violation of the 
MMPA.
    (12) Market Prohibitions. It is unlawful for any person to sell, 
purchase, offer for sale, transport, or ship in the United States, any 
tuna or tuna products unless the tuna products are either:
    (i) Dolphin-safe under subpart H; or
    (ii) harvested in compliance with the IDCP by vessels under the 
jurisdiction of a nation that is a member of the IATTC or has initiated, 
and within 6 months thereafter completes, all steps required by 
applicant nations to become members of the IATTC.
    (iii) For purposes of this section, tuna or tuna products are 
``dolphin-safe'' if they are dolphin-safe under subpart H.
    (g) Penalties. Any person or vessel subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States will be subject to the penalties provided for under 
the MMPA for the conduct of fishing operations in violation of these 
regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 216.26  Collection of certain marine mammal parts without prior authorization.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart:
    (a) Any bones, teeth or ivory of any dead marine mammal may be 
collected from a beach or from land within \1/4\ of a mile of the ocean. 
The term ocean includes bays and estuaries.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subpart D, soft parts that are 
sloughed, excreted, or discharged naturally by a living marine mammal in 
the wild may be collected or imported for bona fide scientific research 
and enhancement, provided that collection does not involve the taking of 
a living marine mammal in the wild.
    (c) Any marine mammal part collected under paragraph (a) of this 
section or any marine mammal part collected and imported under paragraph 
(b) of this section must be registered and identified, and may be 
transferred or otherwise possessed, in accordance with Sec. 216.22(c). 
In registering a marine mammal part collected or imported under 
paragraph (b) of this section, the person who collected or imported the 
part must also state the scientific research or enhancement purpose for 
which the part was collected or imported.
    (d) No person may purchase, sell or trade for commercial purposes 
any marine mammal part collected or imported under this section.
    (e) The export of parts collected without prior authorization under 
paragraph (b) of this section may occur if consistent with the 
provisions at Sec. 216.37(d) under subpart D.

<R05>
Sec. 216.27  Release, non-releasability, and disposition under special exception permits for rehabilitated marine mammals.

    (a) Release requirements. (1) Any marine mammal held for 
rehabilitation must be released within six months of capture or import 
unless the attending veterinarian determines that:
    (i) The marine mammal might adversely affect marine mammals in the 
wild;
    (ii) Release of the marine mammal to the wild will not likely be 
successful given the physical condition and behavior of the marine 
mammal; or
    (iii) More time is needed to determine whether the release of the 
marine mammal to the wild will likely be successful. Releasability must 
be reevaluated at intervals of no less than six months until 24 months 
from capture or import, at which time there will be a rebuttable 
presumption that release into the wild is not feasible.
    (2) The custodian of the rehabilitated marine mammal shall provide 
written notification prior to any release into the wild.
    (i) Notification shall be provided to:
    (A) The NMFS Regional Director at least 15 days in advance of 
releasing any beached or stranded marine mammal, unless advance notice 
is waived in writing by the Regional Director; or
    (B) The Office Director at least 30 days in advance of releasing any 
imported marine mammal.
    (ii) Notification shall include the following:
    (A) A description of the marine mammal, including its physical 
condition and estimated age;
    (B) The date and location of release; and
    (C) The method and duration of transport prior to release.

[[Page 35]]

    (3) The Regional Director, or the Office Director as appropriate, 
may:
    (i) Require additional information prior to any release;
    (ii) Change the date or location of release, or the method or 
duration of transport prior to release;
    (iii) Impose additional conditions to improve the likelihood of 
success or to monitor the success of the release; or
    (iv) Require other disposition of the marine mammal.
    (4) All marine mammals must be released near wild populations of the 
same species, and stock if known, unless a waiver is granted by the 
Regional Director or the Office Director.
    (5) All marine mammals released must be tagged or marked in a manner 
acceptable to the Regional Director or the Office Director. The tag 
number or description of the marking must be reported to the Regional 
Director or Office Director following release.
    (b) Non-releasability and postponed determinations. (1) The 
attending veterinarian shall provide the Regional Director or Office 
Director with a written report setting forth the basis of any 
determination under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (2) Upon receipt of a report under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
the Regional Director or Office Director, in their sole discretion, may:
    (i) Order the release of the marine mammal;
    (ii) Order continued rehabilitation for an additional 6 months; or
    (iii) Order other disposition as authorized.
    (3) No later than 30 days after a marine mammal is determined 
unreleasable in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of 
this section, the person with authorized custody must:
    (i) Request authorization to retain or transfer custody of the 
marine mammal in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or;
    (ii) Humanely euthanize the marine mammal or arrange any other 
disposition of the marine mammal authorized by the Regional Director or 
Office Director.
    (4) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, the 
Office Director may require use of a rehabilitated marine mammal for any 
activity authorized under subpart D in lieu of animals taken from the 
wild.
    (5) Any rehabilitated beached or stranded marine mammal placed on 
public display following a non-releasability determination under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and pending disposition under paragraph 
(c) of this section, or any marine mammal imported for medical treatment 
otherwise unavailable and placed on public display pending disposition 
after such medical treatment is concluded, must be held in captive 
maintenance consistent with all requirements for public display.
    (c) Disposition for a special exception purpose. (1) Upon receipt of 
an authorization request made under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, 
or release notification under (a)(2), the Office Director may authorize 
the retention or transfer of custody of the marine mammal for a special 
exception purpose authorized under subpart D.
    (2) The Office Director will first consider requests from a person 
authorized to hold the marine mammal for rehabilitation. The Office 
Director may authorize such person to retain or transfer custody of the 
marine mammal for scientific research, enhancement, or public display 
purposes.
    (3) The Office Director may authorize retention or transfer of 
custody of the marine mammal only if:
    (i) Documentation has been submitted to the Office Director that the 
person retaining the subject animal or the person receiving custody of 
the subject animal by transfer, hereinafter referred to as the 
recipient, complies with public display requirements of 16 U.S.C. 
1374(c)(2)(A) or, for purposes of scientific research and enhancement, 
holds an applicable permit, or an application for such a special 
exception permit under Sec. 216.33 or a request for a major amendment 
under Sec. 216.39 has been submitted to the Office Director and has been 
found complete;
    (ii) The recipient agrees to hold the marine mammal in conformance 
with all applicable requirements and standards; and
    (iii) The recipient acknowledges that the marine mammal is subject 
to seizure by the Office Director:

[[Page 36]]

    (A) If, at any time pending issuance of the major amendment or 
permit, the Office Director determines that seizure is necessary in the 
interest of the health or welfare of the marine mammal;
    (B) If the major amendment or permit is denied; or
    (C) If the recipient is issued a notice of violation and assessment, 
or is subject to permit sanctions, in accordance with 15 CFR part 904.
    (4) There shall be no remuneration associated with any transfer, 
provided that, the transferee may reimburse the transferor for any and 
all costs associated with the rehabilitation and transport of the marine 
mammal.
    (5) Marine mammals undergoing rehabilitation or pending disposition 
under this section shall not be subject to public display, unless such 
activities are specifically authorized by the Regional Director or the 
Office Director, and conducted consistent with the requirements 
applicable to public display. Such marine mammals shall not be trained 
for performance or be included in any aspect of a program involving 
interaction with the public; and
    (6) Marine mammals undergoing rehabilitation shall not be subject to 
intrusive research, unless such activities are specifically authorized 
by the Office Director in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission 
and its Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals, and are 
conducted pursuant to a scientific research permit.
    (d) Reporting. In addition to the report required under 
Sec. 216.22(b), the person authorized to hold marine mammals for 
rehabilitation must submit reports to the Regional Director or Office 
Director regarding release or other disposition. These reports must be 
provided in the form and frequency specified by the Regional Director or 
Office Director.

    (i) Agrees to abide by all terms and conditions set forth in the 
permit, and all restrictions and relevant regulations under this 
subpart; and
    (ii) Acknowledges that the authority to conduct certain activities 
specified in the permit is conditional and subject to authorization by 
the Office Director.
    (4) Notice of the decision of the Office Director shall be published 
in the Federal Register within 10 days after the date of permit issuance 
or denial and shall indicate where copies of the permit, if issued, may 
be reviewed or obtained. If the permit issued involves marine mammals 
listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA, the notice shall 
include a finding by the Office Director that the permit:
    (i) Was applied for in good faith;
    (ii) If exercised, will not operate to the disadvantage of such 
endangered or threatened species; and
    (iii) Is consistent with the purposes and policy set forth in 
section 2 of the ESA.
    (5) If the permit is denied, the Office Director shall provide the 
applicant with an explanation for the denial.
    (6) Under the MMPA, the Office Director may issue a permit for 
scientific research before the end of the public comment period if 
delaying issuance could result in injury to a species, stock, or 
individual, or in loss of unique research opportunities. The Office 
Director also may waive the 30-day comment period required under the ESA 
in an emergency situation where the health or life of an endangered or 
threatened marine mammal is threatened and no reasonable alternative is 
available. If a permit is issued under these circumstances, notice of 
such issuance before the end of the comment period shall be published in 
the Federal Register within 10 days of issuance.

corporation responsible for supervision of the principal investigator.
    (2) For any scientific research involving captive maintenance, the 
application must include supporting documentation from the person 
responsible for the facility or other temporary enclosure.
    (b) Issuance Criteria. For the Office Director to issue any 
scientific research or enhancement permit, the applicant must 
demonstrate that:
    (1) The proposed activity furthers a bona fide scientific or 
enhancement purpose;
    (2) If the lethal taking of marine mammals is proposed:
    (i) Non-lethal methods for conducting the research are not feasible; 
and
    (ii) For depleted, endangered, or threatened species, the results 
will directly benefit that species or stock, or will fulfill a 
critically important research need.
    (3) Any permanent removal of a marine mammal from the wild is 
consistent with any applicable quota established by the Office Director.
    (4) The proposed research will not likely have significant adverse 
effects on any other component of the marine ecosystem of which the 
affected species or stock is a part.

[[Page 43]]

    (5) For species or stocks designated or proposed to be designated as 
depleted, or listed or proposed to be listed as endangered or 
threatened:
    (i) The proposed research cannot be accomplished using a species or 
stock that is not designated or proposed to be designated as depleted, 
or listed or proposed to be listed as threatened or endangered;
    (ii) The proposed research, by itself or in combination with other 
activities will not likely have a long-term direct or indirect adverse 
impact on the species or stock;
    (iii) The proposed research will either:
    (A) Contribute to fulfilling a research need or objective identified 
in a species recovery or conservation plan, or if there is no 
conservation or recovery plan in place, a research need or objective 
identified by the Office Director in stock assessments established under 
section 117 of the MMPA;
    (B) Contribute significantly to understanding the basic biology or 
ecology of the species or stock, or to identifying, evaluating, or 
resolving conservation problems for the species or stock; or
    (C) Contribute significantly to fulfilling a critically important 
research need.
    (6) For proposed enhancement activities:
    (i) Only living marine mammals and marine mammal parts necessary for 
enhancement of the survival, recovery, or propagation of the affected 
species or stock may be taken, imported, exported, or otherwise affected 
under the authority of an enhancement permit. Marine mammal parts would 
include in this regard clinical specimens or other biological samples 
required for the conduct of breeding programs or the diagnosis or 
treatment of disease.
    (ii) The activity will likely contribute significantly to 
maintaining or increasing distribution or abundance, enhancing the 
health or welfare of the species or stock, or ensuring the survival or 
recovery of the affected species or stock in the wild.
    (iii) The activity is consistent with:
    (A) An approved conservation plan developed under section 115(b) of 
the MMPA or recovery plan developed under section 4(f) of the ESA for 
the species or stock; or
    (B) If there is no conservation or recovery plan, with the Office 
Director's evaluation of the actions required to enhance the survival or 
recovery of the species or stock in light of the factors that would be 
addressed in a conservation or recovery plan.
    (iv) An enhancement permit may authorize the captive maintenance of 
a marine mammal from a threatened, endangered, or depleted species or 
stock only if the Office Director determines that:
    (A) The proposed captive maintenance will likely contribute directly 
to the survival or recovery of the species or stock by maintaining a 
viable gene pool, increasing productivity, providing necessary 
biological information, or establishing animal reserves required to 
support directly these objectives; and
    (B) The expected benefit to the species or stock outweighs the 
expected benefits of alternatives that do not require removal of marine 
mammals from the wild.
    (v) The Office Director may authorize the public display of marine 
mammals held under the authority of an enhancement permit only if:
    (A) The public display is incidental to the authorized captive 
maintenance;

<R05>
Sec. 216.71  Allowable take of fur seals.

    Pribilovians may take fur seals on the Pribilof Islands if such 
taking is
    (a) For subsistence uses, and
    (b) Not accomplished in a wasteful manner.

[51 FR 24840, July 9, 1986. Redesignated at 61 FR 11750, Mar. 22, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 216.72  Restrictions on taking.

    (a) The harvests of seals on St. Paul and St. George Islands shall 
be treated independently for the purposes of this section. Any 
suspension, termination, or extension of the harvest is applicable only 
to the island for which it is issued.
    (b) By April 1 of every third year, beginning April 1994, the 
Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a summary 
of the preceding 3 years of harvesting and a discussion of the number of 
seals expected to be taken annually over the next 3 years to satisfy the 
subsistence requirements of each island. This discussion will include an 
assessment of factors and conditions on St. Paul and St. George Islands 
that influence the need by Pribilof Aleuts to take seals for subsistence 
uses and an assessment of any changes to those conditions indicating 
that the number of seals that may be taken for subsistence each year 
should be made higher or lower. Following a 30-day public comment 
period, a final notification of the expected annual harvest levels for 
the next 3 years will be published.
    (c)(1) No fur seal may be taken on the Pribilof Islands before June 
23 of each year.
    (2) No fur seal may be taken except by experienced sealers using the 
traditional harvesting methods, including stunning followed immediately 
by exsanguination. The harvesting method shall include organized drives 
of subadult males to killing fields unless it is determined by the NMFS 
representatives, in consultation with the Pribilovians conducting the 
harvest, that alternative methods will not result in increased 
disturbance to the rookery or the increased accidental take of female 
seals.
    (3) Any taking of adult fur seals or pups, or the intentional taking 
of subadult female fur seals is prohibited.
    (4) Only subadult male fur seals 124.5 centimeters or less in length 
may be taken.
    (5) Seals with tags and/or entangling debris may only be taken if so 
directed by NMFS scientists.
    (d) The scheduling of the harvest is at the discretion of the 
Pribilovians, but must be such as to minimize stress to the harvested 
seals. The Pribilovians must give adequate advance notice of their 
harvest schedules to the NMFS representatives to allow for necessary 
monitoring activities. Scheduling must be consistent with the following 
restrictions:
    (1) St. Paul Island--Seals may only be harvested from the following 
haulout areas: Zapadni, English Bay, Northeast Point, Polovina, Lukanin, 
Kitovi, and Reef. No haulout area may be harvested more than once per 
week.
    (2) St. George Island--Seals may only be harvested from the 
following haulout areas: Northeast and Zapadni. Neither haulout area may 
be harvested more than twice per week.
    (e)(1) The Assistant Administrator is required to suspend the take 
provided for in Sec. 215.31 when:

[[Page 49]]

    (i) He determines, after reasonable notice by NMFS representatives 
to the Pribilovians on the island, that the subsistence needs of the 
Pribilovians on the island have been satisfied;

or
    (ii) He determines that the harvest is otherwise being conducted in 
a wasteful manner; or
    (iii) The lower end of the range of the estimated subsistence level 
provided in the notice issued under paragraph (b) of this section is 
reached.
    (2) A suspension based on a determination under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) 
of this section may be lifted by the Assistant Administrator if he finds 
that the conditions which led to the determination that the harvest was 
being conducted in a wasteful manner have been remedied.
    (3) A suspension issued in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of 
this section may not exceed 48 hours in duration and shall be followed 
immediately by a review of the harvest data to determine if a finding 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is warranted. If a the harvest 
is not suspended under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the 
Assistant Administrator must provide a revised estimate of the number of 
seals required to satisfy the Pribilovians' subsistence needs.
    (f) The Assistant Administrator shall terminate the take provided 
for in Sec. 215.31 on August 8 of each year or when it is determined 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section that the subsistence needs of 
the Pribilovians on the island have been satisfied, whichever occurs 
first.

seller of any tuna products that are exported from

[[Page 51]]

or offered for sale in the United States to include on the label of 
those products the term ``dolphin-safe'' or any other term or symbol 
that claims or suggests that the tuna contained in the products were 
harvested using a method of fishing that is not harmful to dolphins if 
the products contain tuna harvested:
    (1) ETP large purse seine vessel. In the ETP by a purse seine vessel 
of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity unless:
    (i) The documentation requirements for dolphin-safe tuna under 
Secs. 216.92 and 216.94 are met;
    (ii) No dolphin were killed or seriously injured during the sets in 
which the tuna were caught; or

purse seine nets on or encirclement of dolphins is having a significant 
adverse impact on any depleted stock:
    (A) No tuna products were caught on a trip using a purse seine net 
intentionally deployed on or to encircle dolphins; and
    (B) No dolphins were killed or seriously injured during the sets in 
which the tuna were caught.
    (2) Non-ETP purse seine vessel. Outside the ETP by a vessel using a 
purse seine net:
    (i) In a fishery in which the Assistant Administrator has determined 
that a regular and significant association occurs between dolphins and 
tuna (similar to the association between dolphins and tuna in the ETP), 
unless such products are accompanied by a written statement, executed by 
the captain of the vessel and an observer participating in a national or 
international program acceptable to the Assistant Administrator, 
certifying that no purse seine net was intentionally deployed on or used 
to encircle dolphins during the particular voyage on which the tuna were 
caught and no dolphins were killed or seriously injured in the sets in 
which the tuna were caught; or
    (ii) In any other fishery unless the products are accompanied by a 
written statement executed by the captain of the vessel certifying that 
no purse seine net was intentionally deployed on or used to encircle 
dolphins during the particular voyage on which the tuna was harvested;
    (3) Driftnet. By a vessel engaged in large-scale driftnet fishing; 
or
    (4) Other fisheries. By a vessel in a fishery other than one 
described in paragraphs (a)(1) through(a)(3) of this section that is 
identified by the Assistant Administrator as having a regular and 
significant mortality or serious injury of dolphins, unless such product 
is accompanied by a written statement, executed by the captain of the 
vessel and an observer participating in a national or international 
program acceptable to the Assistant Administrator, that no dolphins were 
killed or seriously injured in the sets or other gear deployments in 
which the tuna were caught, provided that the Assistant Administrator 
determines that such an observer statement is necessary.
    (b) It is a violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission 
Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to willingly and knowingly use a label referred to in 
this section in a campaign or effort to mislead or deceive consumers 
about the level of protection afforded dolphins under the IDCP.
    (c) A tuna product that is labeled with the official mark, described 
in Sec. 216.96, may not be labeled with any other label or mark that 
refers to dolphins, porpoises, or marine mammals.

and presented for import into the United States are dolphin safe if:
    (1) The tuna was harvested by a U.S. vessel fishing in compliance 
with the requirements of the IDCP and applicable U.S. law, or by a 
vessel belonging to a nation that has obtained an affirmative finding of 
Sec. 216.24(f)(9);
    (2) The tuna or tuna products are accompanied by a properly 
completed FCO;
    (3) The tuna or tuna products are accompanied by valid documentation 
signed by a representative of the appropriate IDCP member nation, 
certifying that:
    (i) There was an IDCP approved observer on board the vessel(s) 
during the entire trip(s); and
    (ii) The tuna contained in the shipment were caught according to the 
dolphin-safe labeling standards of Sec. 216.91;
    (4) The documentation provided in paragraph(b)(3) of this section 
includes a listing of vessel names and identifying numbers of the 
associated Tuna Tracking Forms for each trip of which tuna in the 
shipment originates; and
    (5) The FCO is properly endorsed by each exporter, importer, and 
processor certifying that, to the best of his or her knowledge and 
belief, the FCO and attached documentation are complete and accurate.

Sec. 216.94  Tracking and verification program.

    The Administrator, Southwest Region, has established a national 
tracking and verification program to accurately document the ``dolphin-
safe'' condition of tuna, under the standards set forth in 
Sec. 216.91(a). The tracking program includes procedures and reports for 
use when importing tuna into the U.S. and during U.S. purse seine 
fishing, processing, and marketing in the U.S. and abroad. Verification 
of tracking system operations is attained through the establishment of 
audit and document review requirements. The tracking program is 
consistent with the international tuna tracking and verification program 
adopted by the Parties to the IDCP.
    (a) Tuna tracking forms. Whenever a U.S. flag tuna purse seine 
vessel of greater than 400 st (362.8 mt) carrying capacity fishes in the 
ETP, IDCP approved Tuna Tracking Forms (TTFs), bearing the IATTC cruise 
number assigned to that trip, are used by the observer to record every 
set made during that trip. One TTF is used to record ``dolphin-safe'' 
sets and a second TTF is used to record ``non-dolphin-safe'' sets. The 
information entered on the TTFs following each set includes date of 
trip, set number, date of loading, name of the vessel, vessel Captain's 
name, observer's name, well number, weights by species composition, 
estimated tons loaded, and date of the set. The observer and the vessel 
engineer initial the entry for each set, and the vessel Captain and 
observer review and

[[Page 53]]

sign both TTFs at the end of the fishing trip certifying that the 
information on the form is accurate. The captain's and observer's 
certification of the TTF on which dolphin-safe sets are recorded 
complies with 16 U.S.C. 1385(h).
    (b) Tracking fishing operations. (1) During ETP fishing trips by 
purse seine vessels, tuna caught in sets designated as ``dolphin-safe'' 
by the vessel observer must be stored separately from tuna caught in 
``non-dolphin-safe'' sets from the time of capture through unloading, 
except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Vessel personnel 
will decide into which wells tuna will be loaded. The observer will 
initially designate whether each set is ``dolphin-safe'' or not, based 
on his/her observation of the set. The observer will initially identify 
a vessel fish well as ``dolphin-safe'' if the first tuna loaded into the 
well during a trip was captured in a set in which no dolphin died or was 
seriously injured. The observer will initially identify a vessel fish 
well as ``non-dolphin-safe'' if the first tuna loaded into the well 
during a trip was captured in a set in which a dolphin died or was 
seriously injured. Any tuna loaded into a well previously designated 
``non-dolphin-safe'' or ``mixed well'' is considered ``non-dolphin-
safe'' tuna. Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section, the observer will change the designation of a ``dolphin-safe'' 
well to ``non-dolphin-safe'' if any tuna are loaded into the well that 
were captured in a set in which a dolphin died or was seriously injured.
    (2) Mixed wells. Only two acceptable conditions exist under which a 
``mixed'' well can be created.
    (i) In the event that a set has been designated ``dolphin-safe'' by 
the observer, but during the loading process dolphin mortality or 
serious injury is identified, the ``dolphin-safe'' designation of the 
set will change to ``non-dolphin-safe.'' If one or more of the wells 
into which the newly designated ``non-dolphin-safe'' tuna are loaded 
already contains ``dolphin-safe'' tuna loaded during a previous set, the 
observer will note in his or her trip records the well numbers and the 
estimated weight of such ``non-dolphin-safe'' tuna and designate such 
well(s) as ``mixed well(s).'' Once a well has been identified as ``non-
dolphin-safe'' or ``mixed'' all tuna subsequently loaded into that well 
will be designated as ``non-dolphin-safe.'' When the contents of such a 
``mixed well'' are received by a processor, the tuna will be weighed and 
separated according to the observer's report of the estimated weight of 
``dolphin-safe'' and ``non-dolphin-safe'' tuna contained in that well. 
In addition, 15 percent of the ``dolphin-safe'' tuna unloaded from the 
``mixed well'' will be designated as ``non-dolphin-safe.''
    (ii) Near the end of an ETP fishing trip, if the only well space 
available is in a ``non-dolphin-safe'' well, and there is an opportunity 
to make one last set, ``dolphin-safe'' tuna caught in that set may be 
loaded into the ``non-dolphin-safe'' well. The ``dolphin-safe'' tuna 
must be kept physically separate from the ``non-dolphin-safe'' tuna 
already in the well, using netting or other material.
    (3) The captain, managing owner, or vessel agent of a U.S. purse 
seine vessel returning to port from a trip, any part of which included 
fishing in the ETP, must provide at least 48 hours notice of the 
vessel's intended place of landing, arrival time, and schedule of 
unloading to the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (4) If the trip terminates when the vessel enters port to unload 
part or all of its catch, new TTFs will be assigned to the new trip, and 
any information concerning tuna retained on the vessel will be recorded 
as the first entry on the TTFs for the new trip. If the trip is not 
terminated following a partial unloading, the vessel will retain the 
original TTFs and submit a copy of those TTFs to the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, within 5 working days. In either case, the species and 
amount unloaded will be noted on the respective originals.
    (5) Tuna offloaded to trucks, storage facilities or carrier vessels 
must be loaded or stored in such a way as to maintain and safeguard the 
identification of the ``dolphin-safe'' or ``non-dolphin-safe'' 
designation of the tuna as it left the fishing vessel.
    (6)(i) When ETP caught tuna is to be offloaded from a U.S. purse 
seiner directly to a U.S. canner within the 50

[[Page 54]]

states, Puerto Rico, or American Samoa, or in any port and subsequently 
loaded aboard a carrier vessel for transport to a U.S. processing 
location, a NMFS representative may meet the U.S. purse seiner to 
receive the TTFs from the vessel observer and to monitor the handling of 
``dolphin-safe'' and ``non-dolphin-safe'' tuna.
    (ii) When ETP caught tuna is offloaded from an U.S. purse seiner in 
any port and subsequently loaded aboard a carrier vessel for transport 
to a cannery outside the jurisdiction of the United States, a NMFS 
representative may meet the vessel to receive copies of the TTFs from 
the observer and monitor the offloading. The U.S. caught tuna becomes 
the tracking and verification responsibility of the foreign buyer when 
it is offloaded from the U.S. vessel.
    (iii) If a NMFS representative does not meet the vessel in port at 
the time of arrival, the observer may take the signed TTFs to the IATTC 
office and mail copies to the Administrator, Southwest Region, from that 
location within 5 working days of the end of the trip.
    (iv) When ETP caught tuna is offloaded from a U.S. purse seiner 
directly to a processing facility located outside the jurisdiction of 
the United States in a country that is a party to the IDCP, the national 
authority in whose area of jurisdiction the tuna is to be processed will 
assume the responsibility for tracking and verification of the tuna 
offloaded. A representative of the national authority will receive 
copies of the TTFs from the observer, and copies of the TTFs will be 
forwarded to the Administrator, Southwest Region.
    (c) Tracking cannery operations. (1) Whenever a tuna canning company 
in the 50 states, Puerto Rico, or American Samoa is scheduled to receive 
a domestic or imported shipment of ETP caught tuna for processing, the 
company must provide at least 48 hours notice of the location and 
arrival date and time of such a shipment, to the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, so that a NMFS representative can be present to 
monitor delivery and verify that ``dolphin-safe'' and ``non-dolphin-
safe'' tuna are clearly identified and remain segregated.
    (2) At the close of delivery activities, which may include weighing, 
boxing or containerizing, and transfer to cold storage or processing, 
the company must provide a copy of the processor's receiving report to 
the NMFS representative, if present. If a NMFS representative is not 
present, the company must submit a copy of the processor's receiving 
report to the Administrator, Southwest Region, electronically, by mail, 
or by fax within 5 working days. The processor's receiving report must 
contain, at a minimum: date of delivery, catcher vessel name and flag, 
trip number and dates, storage container number(s), ``dolphin-safe'' or 
``non-dolphin-safe'' designation of each container, species, product 
description, and weight of tuna in each container.
    (3) Tuna canning companies will report on a monthly basis the 
amounts of ETP-caught tuna that are removed from cold storage. This 
report may be submitted in conjunction with the monthly report required 
in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. This report must contain:
    (i) The date of removal;
    (ii) Storage container number(s) and ``dolphin-safe'' or ``non-
dolphin-safe'' designation of each container; and
    (iii) Details of the disposition of fish (for example, canning, 
sale, rejection, etc.).
    (4) During canning activities, ``non-dolphin-safe'' tuna may not be 
mixed in any manner or at any time in its processing with any ``dolphin-
safe'' tuna or tuna products and may not share the same storage 
containers, cookers, conveyers, tables, or other canning and labeling 
machinery.
    (5) Canned tuna processors must submit a report to the 
Administrator, Southwest Region, of all tuna received at their 
processing facilities in each calendar month whether or not the tuna is 
actually canned or stored during that month. Monthly cannery receipt 
reports must be submitted electronically or by mail before the last day 
of the month following the month being reported. Monthly reports must 
contain the following information:
    (i) Domestic receipts: species, condition (round, loin, dressed, 
gilled and gutted, other), weight in short tons to

[[Page 55]]

the fourth decimal, ocean area of capture (eastern tropical Pacific, 
western Pacific, Indian, eastern and western Atlantic, other), catcher 
vessel, trip dates, carrier name, unloading dates, and location of 
unloading.
    (ii) Import receipts: In addition to the information required in 
paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, a copy of the FCO for each imported 
receipt must be provided.
    (d) Tracking imports. All tuna products, except fresh tuna, that are 
imported into the United States must be accompanied by a properly 
certified FCO as required by Sec. 216.24(f).
    (e) Verification requirements.--(1) Record maintenance. Any 
exporter, transshipper, importer, or processor of any tuna or tuna 
products containing tuna harvested in the ETP must maintain records 
related to that tuna for at least 3 years. These records include, but 
are not limited to: FCO and required certifications, any report required 
in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section, invoices, other import 
documents, and trip reports.
    (2) Record submission. Within 30 days of receiving a written request 
from the Administrator, Southwest Region, any exporter, transshipper, 
importer, or processor of any tuna or tuna products containing tuna 
harvested in the ETP must submit to the Administrator any record 
required to be maintained under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (3) Audits and spot-checks. Upon request of the Administrator, 
Southwest Region, any such exporter, transshipper, importer, or 
processor must provide the Administrator, Southwest Region, timely 
access to all pertinent records and facilities to allow for audits and 
spot-checks on caught, landed, and processed tuna.
    (f) Confidentiality of proprietary information. Information 
submitted to the Assistant Administrator under this section will be 
treated as confidential in accordance with NOAA Administrative Order 
216-100 ``Protection of Confidential Fisheries Statistics.''

 Subpart I--General Regulations Governing Small Takes of Marine Mammals 
                   Incidental to Specified Activities

    Source: 61 FR 15887, Apr. 10, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 216.101  Purpose.

    The regulations in this subpart implement section 101(a)(5) (A) 
through (D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, 16 
U.S.C. 1371(a)(5), which provides a mechanism for allowing, upon 
request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity 
(other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographic region.


<R05>
Sec. 216.102  Scope.

    The taking of small numbers of marine mammals under section 
101(a)(5) (A) through (D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act may be 
allowed only if the National Marine Fisheries Service:
    (a) Finds, based on the best scientific evidence available, that the 
total taking by the specified activity during the specified time period 
will have a negligible impact on species or stock of marine mammal(s) 
and will not have

[[Page 57]]

an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of those species or 
stocks of marine mammals intended for subsistence uses;
    (b) Prescribes either regulations under Sec. 216.106, or 
requirements and conditions contained within an incidental harassment 
authorization issued under Sec. 216.107, setting forth permissible 
methods of taking and other means of effecting the least practicable 
adverse impact on the species or stock of marine mammal and its habitat 
and on the availability of the species or stock of marine mammal for 
subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar significance; and
    (c) Prescribes either regulations or requirements and conditions 
contained within an incidental harassment authorization, as appropriate, 
pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking. The specific 
regulations governing certain specified activities are contained in 
subsequent subparts of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 216.103  Definitions.

    In addition to definitions contained in the MMPA, and in Sec. 216.3, 
and unless the context otherwise requires, in subsequent subparts to 
this part:
    Arctic waters means the marine and estuarine waters north of 60[deg] 
N. lat.
    Citizens of the United States and U.S. citizens mean individual U.S. 
citizens or any corporation or similar entity if it is organized under 
the laws of the United States or any governmental unit defined in 16 
U.S.C. 1362(13). U.S. Federal, state and local government agencies shall 
also constitute citizens of the United States for purposes of this part.
    Incidental harassment, incidental taking and incidental, but not 
intentional, taking all mean an accidental taking. This does not mean 
that the taking is unexpected, but rather it includes those takings that 
are infrequent, unavoidable or accidental. (A complete definition of 
``take'' is contained in Sec. 216.3).
    Negligible impact is an impact resulting from the specified activity 
that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, 
adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival.
    Small numbers means a portion of a marine mammal species or stock 
whose taking would have a negligible impact on that species or stock.
    Specified activity means any activity, other than commercial 
fishing, that takes place in a specified geographical region and 
potentially involves the taking of small numbers of marine mammals.
    Specified geographical region means an area within which a specified 
activity is conducted and that has certain biogeographic 
characteristics.
    Unmitigable adverse impact means an impact resulting from the 
specified activity:
    (1) That is likely to reduce the availability of the species to a 
level insufficient for a harvest to meet subsistence needs by:
    (i) Causing the marine mammals to abandon or avoid hunting areas;
    (ii) Directly displacing subsistence users; or
    (iii) Placing physical barriers between the marine mammals and the 
subsistence hunters; and
    (2) That cannot be sufficiently mitigated by other measures to 
increase the availability of marine mammals to allow subsistence needs 
to be met.


<R05>
Sec. 216.104  Submission of requests.

    (a) In order for the National Marine Fisheries Service to consider 
authorizing the taking by U.S. citizens of small numbers of marine 
mammals incidental to a specified activity (other than commercial 
fishing), or to make a finding that an incidental take is unlikely to 
occur, a written request must be submitted to the Assistant 
Administrator. All requests must include the following information for 
their activity:
    (1) A detailed description of the specific activity or class of 
activities that can be expected to result in incidental taking of marine 
mammals;
    (2) The date(s) and duration of such activity and the specific 
geographical region where it will occur;
    (3) The species and numbers of marine mammals likely to be found 
within the activity area;

[[Page 58]]

    (4) A description of the status, distribution, and seasonal 
distribution (when applicable) of the affected species or stocks of 
marine mammals likely to be affected by such activities;
    (5) The type of incidental taking authorization that is being 
requested (i.e., takes by harassment only; takes by harassment, injury 
and/or death) and the method of incidental taking;
    (6) By age, sex, and reproductive condition (if possible), the 
number of marine mammals (by species) that may be taken by each type of 
taking identified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and the number of 
times such takings by each type of taking are likely to occur;
    (7) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the species or stock 
of marine mammal;
    (8) The anticipated impact of the activity on the availability of 
the species or stocks of marine mammals for subsistence uses;
    (9) The anticipated impact of the activity upon the habitat of the 
marine mammal populations, and the likelihood of restoration of the 
affected habitat;
    (10) The anticipated impact of the loss or modification of the 
habitat on the marine mammal populations involved;
    (11) The availability and feasibility (economic and technological) 
of equipment, methods, and manner of conducting such activity or other 
means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact upon the 
affected species or stocks, their habitat, and on their availability for 
subsistence uses, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar significance;
    (12) Where the proposed activity would take place in or near a 
traditional Arctic subsistence hunting area and/or may affect the 
availability of a species or stock of marine mammal for Arctic 
subsistence uses, the applicant must submit either a plan of cooperation 
or information that identifies what measures have been taken and/or will 
be taken to minimize any adverse effects on the availability of marine 
mammals for subsistence uses. A plan must include the following:
    (i) A statement that the applicant has notified and provided the 
affected subsistence community with a draft plan of cooperation;
    (ii) A schedule for meeting with the affected subsistence 
communities to discuss proposed activities and to resolve potential 
conflicts regarding any aspects of either the operation or the plan of 
cooperation;
    (iii) A description of what measures the applicant has taken and/or 
will take to ensure that proposed activities will not interfere with 
subsistence whaling or sealing; and
    (iv) What plans the applicant has to continue to meet with the 
affected communities, both prior to and while conducting the activity, 
to resolve conflicts and to notify the communities of any changes in the 
operation;
    (13) The suggested means of accomplishing the necessary monitoring 
and reporting that will result in increased knowledge of the species, 
the level of taking or impacts on populations of marine mammals that are 
expected to be present while conducting activities and suggested means 
of minimizing burdens by coordinating such reporting requirements with 
other schemes already applicable to persons conducting such activity. 
Monitoring plans should include a description of the survey techniques 
that would be used to determine the movement and activity of marine 
mammals near the activity site(s) including migration and other habitat 
uses, such as feeding. Guidelines for developing a site-specific 
monitoring plan may be obtained by writing to the Director, Office of 
Protected Resources; and
    (14) Suggested means of learning of, encouraging, and coordinating 
research opportunities, plans, and activities relating to reducing such 
incidental taking and evaluating its effects.
    (b)(1) The Assistant Administrator shall determine the adequacy and 
completeness of a request and, if determined to be adequate and 
complete, will begin the public review process by publishing in the 
Federal Register either:
    (i) A proposed incidental harassment authorization; or
    (ii) A notice of receipt of a request for the implementation or 
reimplementation of regulations governing the incidental taking.

[[Page 59]]

    (2) Through notice in the Federal Register, newspapers of general 
circulation, and appropriate electronic media in the coastal areas that 
may be affected by such activity, NMFS will invite information, 
suggestions, and comments for a period not to exceed 30 days from the 
date of publication in the Federal Register. All information and 
suggestions will be considered by the National Marine Fisheries Service 
in developing, if appropriate, the most effective regulations governing 
the issuance of letters of authorization or conditions governing the 
issuance of an incidental harassment authorization.
    (3) Applications that are determined to be incomplete or 
inappropriate for the type of taking requested, will be returned to the 
applicant with an explanation of why the application is being returned.
    (c) The Assistant Administrator shall evaluate each request to 
determine, based upon the best available scientific evidence, whether 
the taking by the specified activity within the specified geographic 
region will have a negligible impact on the species or stock and, where 
appropriate, will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of such species or stock for subsistence uses. If the 
Assistant Administrator finds that the mitigating measures would render 
the impact of the specified activity negligible when it would not 
otherwise satisfy that requirement, the Assistant Administrator may make 
a finding of negligible impact subject to such mitigating measures being 
successfully implemented. Any preliminary findings of ``negligible 
impact'' and ``no unmitigable adverse impact'' shall be proposed for 
public comment along with either the proposed incidental harassment 
authorization or the proposed regulations for the specific activity.
    (d) If, subsequent to the public review period, the Assistant 
Administrator finds that the taking by the specified activity would have 
more than a negligible impact on the species or stock of marine mammal 
or would have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such 
species or stock for subsistence uses, the Assistant Administrator shall 
publish in the Federal Register the negative finding along with the 
basis for denying the request.


<R05>
Sec. 216.105  Specific regulations.

    (a) For all petitions for regulations under this paragraph, 
applicants must provide the information requested in Sec. 216.104(a) on 
their activity as a whole, which includes, but is not necessarily 
limited to, an assessment of total impacts by all persons conducting the 
activity.
    (b) For allowed activities that may result in incidental takings of 
small numbers of marine mammals by harassment, serious injury, death or 
a combination thereof, specific regulations shall be established for 
each allowed activity that set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of taking;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species and its habitat and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses; and
    (3) Requirements for monitoring and reporting, including 
requirements for the independent peer-review of proposed monitoring 
plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.
    (c) Regulations will be established based on the best available 
information. As new information is developed, through monitoring, 
reporting, or research, the regulations may be modified, in whole or in 
part, after notice and opportunity for public review.


<R05>
Sec. 216.106  Letter of Authorization.

    (a) A Letter of Authorization, which may be issued only to U.S. 
citizens, is required to conduct activities pursuant to any regulations 
established under Sec. 216.105. Requests for Letters of Authorization 
shall be submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources. The 
information to be submitted in a request for an authorization will be 
specified in the appropriate subpart to this part or may be obtained by 
writing to the above named person.
    (b) Issuance of a Letter of Authorization will be based on a 
determination that the level of taking will be consistent with the 
findings made for the total taking allowable under the specific 
regulations.

[[Page 60]]

    (c) Letters of Authorization will specify the period of validity and 
any additional terms and conditions appropriate for the specific 
request.
    (d) Notice of issuance of all Letters of Authorization will be 
published in the Federal Register within 30 days of issuance.
    (e) Letters of Authorization shall be withdrawn or suspended, either 
on an individual or class basis, as appropriate, if, after notice and 
opportunity for public comment, the Assistant Administrator determines 
that:
    (1) The regulations prescribed are not being substantially complied 
with; or
    (2) The taking allowed is having, or may have, more than a 
negligible impact on the species or stock or, where relevant, an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock 
for subsistence uses.
    (f) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in 
Sec. 216.106(e) shall not apply if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that an emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the 
wellbeing of the species or stocks of marine mammals concerned.
    (g) A violation of any of the terms and conditions of a Letter of 
Authorization or of the specific regulations shall subject the Holder 
and/or any individual who is operating under the authority of the 
Holder's Letter of Authorization to penalties provided in the MMPA.


<R05>
Sec. 216.107  Incidental harassment authorization for Arctic waters.

    (a) Except for activities that have the potential to result in 
serious injury or mortality, which must be authorized under 
Sec. 216.105, incidental harassment authorizations may be issued, 
following a 30-day public review period, to allowed activities that may 
result in only the incidental harassment of a small number of marine 
mammals. Each such incidental harassment authorization shall set forth:
    (1) Permissible methods of taking by harassment;
    (2) Means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on the 
species, its habitat, and on the availability of the species for 
subsistence uses; and
    (3) Requirements for monitoring and reporting, including 
requirements for the independent peer-review of proposed monitoring 
plans where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.
    (b) Issuance of an incidental harassment authorization will be based 
on a determination that the number of marine mammals taken by harassment 
will be small, will have a negligible impact on the species or stock of 
marine mammal(s), and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of species or stocks for taking for subsistence uses.
    (c) An incidental harassment authorization will be either issued or 
denied within 45 days after the close of the public review period.
    (d) Notice of issuance or denial of an incidental harassment 
authorization will be published in the Federal Register within 30 days 
of issuance of a determination.
    (e) Incidental harassment authorizations will be valid for a period 
of time not to exceed 1 year but may be renewed for additional periods 
of time not to exceed 1 year for each reauthorization.
    (f) An incidental harassment authorization shall be modified, 
withdrawn, or suspended if, after notice and opportunity for public 
comment, the Assistant Administrator determines that:
    (1) The conditions and requirements prescribed in the authorization 
are not being substantially complied with; or
    (2) The authorized taking, either individually or in combination 
with other authorizations, is having, or may have, more than a 
negligible impact on the species or stock or, where relevant, an 
unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock 
for subsistence uses.
    (g) The requirement for notice and opportunity for public review in 
paragraph (f) of this section shall not apply if the Assistant 
Administrator determines that an emergency exists that poses a 
significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of marine 
mammals concerned.
    (h) A violation of any of the terms and conditions of an incidental 
harassment authorization shall subject the

[[Page 61]]

holder and/or any individual who is operating under the authority of the 
holder's incidental harassment authorization to penalties provided in 
the MMPA.

Sec. 216.108  Requirements for monitoring and reporting under incidental harassment authorizations for Arctic waters.

    (a) Holders of an incidental harassment authorization in Arctic 
waters and their employees, agents, and designees must cooperate with 
the National Marine Fisheries Service and other designated Federal, 
state, or local agencies to monitor the impacts of their activity on 
marine mammals. Unless stated otherwise within an incidental harassment 
authorization, the holder of an incidental harassment authorization 
effective in Arctic waters must notify the Alaska Regional Director, 
National Marine Fisheries Service, of any activities that may involve a 
take by incidental harassment in Arctic waters at least 14 calendar days 
prior to commencement of the activity.
    (b) Holders of incidental harassment authorizations effective in 
Arctic waters may be required by their authorization to designate at 
least one qualified biological observer or another appropriately 
experienced individual to observe and record the effects of activities 
on marine mammals. The number of observers required for monitoring the 
impact of the activity on marine mammals will be specified in the 
incidental harassment authorization. If observers are required as a 
condition of the authorization, the observer(s) must be approved in 
advance by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (c) The monitoring program must, if appropriate, document the 
effects (including acoustical) on marine mammals and document or 
estimate the actual level of take. The requirements for monitoring 
plans, as specified in the incidental harassment authorization, may vary 
depending on the activity, the location, and the time.
    (d) Where the proposed activity may affect the availability of a 
species or stock of marine mammal for taking for subsistence purposes, 
proposed monitoring plans or other research proposals must be 
independently peer-reviewed prior to issuance of an incidental 
harassment authorization under this subpart. In order to complete the 
peer-review process within the time frames mandated by the MMPA for an 
incidental harassment authorization, a proposed monitoring plan 
submitted under this paragraph must be submitted to the Assistant 
Administrator no later than the date of submission of the application 
for an incidental harassment authorization. Upon receipt of a complete 
monitoring plan, and at its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries 
Service will either submit the plan to members of a peer review panel 
for review or within 60 days of receipt of the proposed monitoring plan, 
schedule a workshop to review the plan. The applicant must submit a 
final monitoring plan to the Assistant Administrator prior to the 
issuance of an incidental harassment authorization.
    (e) At its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries Service may 
place an observer aboard vessels, platforms, aircraft, etc., to monitor 
the impact of activities on marine mammals.
    (f)(1) As specified in the incidental harassment authorization, the 
holder of an incidental harassment authorization for Arctic waters must 
submit reports to the Assistant Administrator within 90 days of 
completion of any individual components of the activity (if any), within 
90 days of completion of the activity, but no later than 120 days prior 
to expiration of the incidental harassment authorization, whichever is 
earlier. This report must include the following information:
    (i) Dates and type(s) of activity;
    (ii) Dates and location(s) of any activities related to monitoring 
the effects on marine mammals; and
    (iii) Results of the monitoring activities, including an estimate of 
the actual level and type of take, species name and numbers of each 
species observed, direction of movement of species, and any observed 
changes or modifications in behavior.
    (2) Monitoring reports will be reviewed by the Assistant 
Administrator and, if determined to be incomplete or inaccurate, will be 
returned to the

[[Page 62]]

holder of the authorization with an explanation of why the report is 
being returned. If the authorization holder disagrees with the findings 
of the Assistant Administrator, the holder may request an independent 
peer review of the report. Failure to submit a complete and accurate 
report may result in a delay in processing future authorization 
requests.
    (g) Results of any behavioral, feeding, or population studies, that 
are conducted supplemental to the monitoring program, should be made 
available to the National Marine Fisheries Service before applying for 
an incidental harassment authorization for the following year.

    Effective August 1, 2002 through February 2, 2004.


<R05>
Sec. 216.143  Permissible methods of taking; mitigation.

    (a) The use of the following means in conducting the activities 
identified in Sec. 216.141 are permissible: Bulk explosives, shaped 
explosive charges, mechanical or abrasive cutters, and underwater arc 
cutters.
    (b) All activities identified in Sec.  216.141 must be conducted in 
a manner that minimizes, to the greatest extent practicable, adverse 
effects on bottlenose dolphins, spotted dolphins, and their habitat. 
When using explosives, the following mitigation measures must be 
utilized:
    (1)(i) If bottlenose or spotted dolphins are observed within 3,000 
ft (910 m) of the structure prior to detonating charges, detonation must 
be delayed until either the marine mammal(s) are more than 3,000 ft (910 
m) from the structure or actions (e.g., operating a vessel in the 
vicinity of the dolphins to stimulate bow riding, then steering the 
vessel away from the structure to be removed) are successful in removing 
them at least 3,000 ft (910 m) from the detonation site;
    (ii) Whenever the conditions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section occur, the aerial survey required under Sec. 216.145(b)(1) 
must be repeated prior to detonation of charges.
    (2) Detonation of explosives must occur no earlier than 1hour after 
sunrise and no later than 1 hour before sunset;
    (3) If weather or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial, shipboard 
or subsurface surveillance, detonations must be delayed until conditions 
improve sufficiently for surveillance to be undertaken; and
    (4) Detonations must be staggered by a minimum of 0.9 seconds for 
each group of charges.


<R05>
Sec. 216.144  Prohibitions.

    Notwithstanding takings authorized by Sec. 216.141 or by a Letter of 
Authorization issued under Sec. 216.106, the following activities are 
prohibited:
    (a) The taking of a marine mammal that is other than unintentional, 
except that the intentional passive herding of dolphins from the 
vicinity of the structure may be authorized under section 109(h) of the 
Act as described in a Letter of Authorization;
    (b) The violation of, or failure to comply with, the terms, 
conditions, and requirements of this part or a Letter of Authorization 
issued or renewed under Sec. 216.106 or Sec. 216.146;
    (c) The incidental taking of any marine mammal of a species either 
not specified in this subpart or whenever the taking authorization for 
authorized species has been reached;
    (d) The use of single explosive charges having an impulse and 
pressure greater than that generated by a 50-lb (22.7 kg) explosive 
charge detonated outside the structure piling; and
    (e) The taking of a marine mammal in water depths greater than 656 
ft (200 m).


<R05>
Sec. 216.145  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) Observer(s) approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 
advance of the detonation must be used to monitor the area around the 
site

[[Page 70]]

prior to, during, and after detonation of charges.
    (b)(1) Both before and after each detonation episode, a 30-minute or 
more aerial survey by NMFS-approved observers must be conducted within 1 
hour of the detonation episode. To ensure that no marine mammals are 
within the designated 3,000 ft (941 m) safety zone nor are likely to 
enter the designated safety zone prior to or at the time of detonation, 
the pre-detonation survey must encompass all waters within one nautical 
mile of the structure.
    (2) A second post-detonation aerial or vessel survey of the 
detonation site must be conducted no earlier than 48 hours and no later 
than 1 week after the oil and gas structure is removed, unless a 
systematic underwater marine mammal survey, either by divers or remotely 
operated vehicles that are dedicated to marine mammals and sea turtles, 
of the site has been successfully conducted with 24 hours of the 
detonation event. The aerial or vessel survey must concentrate down-
current from the structure.
    (3) The NMFS-approved observer may waive post-detonation monitoring 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section provided no marine mammals 
were sighted during either the aerial surveys before detonation or 
during the 48 hour pre-detonation observer monitoring period.
    (c) During all diving operations (working dives as required in the 
course of the removals), divers must be instructed to scan the 
subsurface areas surrounding the structure (detonation) sites for 
bottlenose or spotted dolphins and if marine mammals are sighted to 
inform either the NMFS-approved observer or the agent of the holder of 
the Letter of Authorization immediately upon surfacing.
    (d) In water depths of 150 ft (46 m) or greater, or in cases where 
divers are not deployed in the course of normal removal operations, a 
remotely operated vehicle (ROV) must be deployed prior to detonation to 
scan areas below structures. If marine mammals are sighted, the ROV 
operator must inform either the NMFS-approved observer or the agent of 
the holder of the Letter of Authorization immediately.
    (e) In water depths of 328 ft (100 m) or greater, passive acoustic 
detection must be employed prior to detonation. If marine mammals are 
detected by the acoustic device, the operator must inform either the 
U.S. government observer or the agent of the holder of the Letter of 
Authorization immediately.
    (f)(1) A report summarizing the results of structure removal 
activities, mitigation measures, monitoring efforts, and other 
information as required by a Letter of Authorization, must be submitted 
to the Regional Administrator, NMFS, Southeast Region, 9721 Executive 
Center Drive N, St. Petersburg, FL 33702 within 30 calendar days of 
completion of the removal of the structure.
    (2) NMFS will accept the NMFS-approved observer report as the 
activity report if all requirements for reporting contained in the 
Letter of Authorization are provided to that observer before the 
observer's report is complete.


<R05>
Sec. 216.146  Letters of Authorization.

    (a) To incidentally take bottlenose and spotted dolphins pursuant to

Sec. 216.162  Effective dates.

    Regulations in this subpart are effective May 1 through September 30 
of any single year between the years 2000 and 2004, inclusive.


<R05>
Sec. 216.163  Permissible methods of taking; mitigation.

    (a) Under a Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 216.106, 
the U.S. Navy may incidentally, but not intentionally, take marine 
mammals by harassment, injury or mortality in the course detonating five 
4,536 kg (10,000 lb) conventional explosive charges within the area 
described in Sec. 216.161(a), provided all terms, conditions, and 
requirements of these regulations and such Letter of Authorization are 
complied with.
    (b) The activity identified in paragraph (a) of this section must be 
conducted in a manner that minimizes, to the greatest extent possible, 
adverse impacts on marine mammals and their habitat. When detonating 
explosives, the following mitigation measures must be utilized:

[[Page 72]]

    (1) If marine mammals are observed within the designated safety zone 
prescribed in the Letter of Authorization, or within the buffer zone 
prescribed in the Letter of Authorization and on a course that will put 
them within the safety zone prior to detonation, detonation must be 
delayed until marine mammals are either no longer within the safety zone 
or are on a course within the buffer zone that is taking them away from 
the safety zone, except that no detonation will occur if a marine mammal 
listed as threatened or endangered under Sec. 17.11 of this title is 
detected within the buffer zone and subsequently cannot be detected 
until such time as sighting and acoustic teams have searched the area 
for 2.5 hours (approximately 3 times the typical large whale dive 
duration). If a northern right whale is seen within the safety or buffer 
zone, detonation must not occur until the animal is positively 
reacquired outside the buffer zone and at least one additional aerial 
monitoring of the safety range and buffer zone shows that no other right 
whales are present.
    (2) If weather and/or sea conditions as described in the Letter of 
Authorization preclude adequate aerial surveillance, detonation must be 
delayed until conditions improve sufficiently for aerial surveillance to 
be undertaken.
    (3) If post-test surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take 
of a marine mammal has occurred, or if any marine mammals are observed 
in the safety range immediately after a detonation, the test procedure 
and the monitoring methods must be reviewed by NMFS in consultation with 
the Navy and appropriate changes made prior to conducting the next 
detonation.


<R05>
Sec. 216.164  Prohibitions.

    Notwithstanding takings authorized by Sec. 216.161(b) and by a 
Letter of Authorization issued under Sec. 216.106, the following 
activities are prohibited:
    (a) The taking of a marine mammal that is other than unintentional.
    (b) The violation of, or failure to comply with, the terms, 
conditions, and requirements of this part or a Letter of Authorization 
issued under Sec. 216.106.
    (c) The incidental taking of any marine mammal of a species not 
specified in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 216.165  Requirements for monitoring and reporting.

    (a) The holder of the Letter of Authorization is required to 
cooperate with the National Marine Fisheries Service and any other 
Federal, state or local agency monitoring the impacts of the activity on 
marine mammals. The holder must notify the Administrator, Southeast 
Region at least 2 weeks prior to activities involving the detonation of 
explosives in order to satisfy paragraph (g) of this section.
    (b) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must designate 
qualified on-site individuals, as specified in the Letter of 
Authorization, to record the effects of explosives detonation on marine 
mammals that inhabit the Atlantic Ocean test area.
    (c) The Atlantic Ocean test area must be surveyed by marine mammal 
biologists and other trained individuals, and the marine mammal 
populations monitored, approximately 3 weeks prior to detonation, 48-72 
hours prior to a scheduled detonation, on the day of detonation, and for 
a period of time specified in the Letter of Authorization after each 
detonation. Monitoring shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, 
aerial, shipboard, and acoustic surveillance sufficient to ensure that 
no marine mammals are within the designated safety zone nor are likely 
to enter the designated safety zone immediately prior to, or at the time 
of, detonation.
    (d) Under the direction of a certified marine mammal veterinarian, 
examination and recovery of any dead or injured marine mammals will be 
conducted. Necropsies will be performed and tissue samples taken from 
any dead animals. After completion of the necropsy, animals not retained 
for shoreside examination will be tagged and returned to the sea. The 
occurrence of live marine mammals will also be documented.
    (e) The holder of the Letter of Authorization is required to measure 
during the first detonation, and provide a

[[Page 73]]

report on, prior to the second detonation, the attenuation of the sound 
pressure levels of the HBX1 explosive charge. Measurements must be made 
at a number of distances from the detonation sufficient to verify the 
model predictions for the 3.7 km (2 nm) safety zone. Based upon the 
results of this test, the monitoring and safety zones described in the 
Letter of Authorization, may be modified accordingly.
    (f) Activities related to the monitoring described in paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section, or in the Letter of Authorization issued under 
Sec. 216.106, including the retention of marine mammals, may be 
conducted without the need for a separate scientific research permit. 
The use of retained marine mammals for scientific research other than 
shoreside examination must be authorized pursuant to subpart D of this 
part.
    (g) In coordination and compliance with appropriate Navy 
regulations, at its discretion, the National Marine Fisheries Service 
may place observer(s) on any ship or aircraft involved in marine mammal 
reconnaissance, or monitoring either prior to, during, or after 
explosives detonation in order to monitor the impact on marine mammals.
    (h) A final report must be submitted to the Administrator, Southeast 
Region, no later than 120 days after completion of shock testing the USS 
SEAWOLF. This report must contain the following information:
    (1) Date and time of all detonations conducted under the Letter of 
Authorization.
    (2) A description of all pre-detonation and post-detonation 
activities related to mitigating and monitoring the effects of 
explosives detonation on marine mammal populations.
    (3) Results of the monitoring program, including numbers by species/
stock of any marine mammals noted injured or killed as a result of the 
detonation and numbers that may have been harassed due to presence 
within the designated safety zone.
    (4) Results of coordination with coastal marine mammal/sea turtle 
stranding networks.
    (i) A final report on results of necropsies of stranded marine 
mammals funded by the U.S. Navy must be submitted to the Director, 
Office of Protected Resources, no later than 18 months after completion 
of shock testing the USS SEAWOLF.

Sec. 222.103  Federal/state cooperation in the conservation of endangered and threatened species.

    (a) Application for and renewal of cooperative agreements. (1) The 
Assistant Administrator may enter into a Cooperative Agreement with any 
state that establishes and maintains an active and adequate program for 
the conservation of resident species listed as endangered or threatened. 
In order for a state program to be deemed an adequate and active 
program, the Assistant Administrator must find, and annually reconfirm 
that the criteria of either sections 6(c)(1) (A) through (E) or sections 
6(c)(1) (i) and (ii) of the Act have been satisfied.
    (2) Following receipt of an application by a state for a Cooperative 
Agreement with a copy of a proposed state program, and a determination 
by the Assistant Administrator that the state program is adequate and 
active, the Assistant Administrator shall enter into an Agreement with 
the state.
    (3) The Cooperative Agreement, as well as the Assistant 
Administrator's finding upon which it is based, must be reconfirmed 
annually to ensure that it reflects new laws, species lists, rules or 
regulations, and programs and to demonstrate that it is still adequate 
and active.
    (b) Allocation and availability of funds. (1) The Assistant 
Administrator shall allocate funds, appropriated for the purpose of 
carrying out section 6 of the Act, to various states using the following 
as the basis for the determination:
    (i) The international commitments of the United States to protect 
endangered or threatened species;
    (ii) The readiness of a state to proceed with a conservation program 
consistent with the objectives and purposes of the Act;
    (iii) The number of federally listed endangered and threatened 
species within a state;
    (iv) The potential for restoring endangered and threatened species 
within a state; and

[[Page 93]]

    (v) The relative urgency to initiate a program to restore and 
protect an endangered or threatened species in terms of survival of the 
species.
    (2) Funds allocated to a state are available for obligation during 
the fiscal year for which they are allocated and until the close of the 
succeeding fiscal year. Obligation of allocated funds occurs when an 
award or contract is signed by the Assistant Administrator.
    (c) Financial assistance and payments. (1) A state must enter into a 
Cooperative Agreement before financial assistance is approved by the 
Assistant Administrator for endangered or threatened species projects. 
Specifically, the Agreement must contain the actions that are to be 
taken by the Assistant Administrator and/or by the state, the benefits 
to listed species expected to be derived from these actions, and the 
estimated cost of these actions.
    (2) Subsequent to such Agreement, the Assistant Administrator may 
further agree with a state to provide financial assistance in the 
development and implementation of acceptable projects for the 
conservation of endangered and threatened species. Documents to provide 
financial assistance will consist of an application for Federal 
assistance and an award or a contract. The availability of Federal funds 
shall be contingent upon the continued existence of the Cooperative 
Agreement and compliance with all applicable Federal regulations for 
grant administration and cost accounting principles.
    (3)(i) The payment of the Federal share of costs incurred when 
conducting activities included under a contract or award shall not 
exceed 75 percent of the program costs as stated in the agreement. 
However, the Federal share may be increased to 90 percent when two or 
more states having a common interest in one or more endangered or 
threatened resident species, the conservation of which may be enhanced 
by cooperation of such states, jointly enter into an agreement with the 
Assistant Administrator.
    (ii) The state share of program costs may be in the form of cash or 
in-kind contributions, including real property, subject to applicable 
Federal regulations.
    (4) Payments of funds, including payment of such preliminary costs 
and expenses as may be incurred in connection with projects, shall not 
be made unless all necessary or required documents are first submitted 
to and approved by the Assistant Administrator. Payments shall only be 
made for expenditures reported and certified by the state agency. 
Payments shall be made only to the state office or official designated 
by the state agency and authorized under the laws of the state to 
receive public funds for the state.

The number must remain affixed to the item until the item is sold to an 
ultimate user, as defined in Sec. 222.201(d).
    (iii) No renewals will be issued for scrimshaw products in excess of 
any quantities declared in the original application for a Certificate of 
Exemption.
    (6) A Certification in the following language: I hereby certify that 
the foregoing information is complete, true, and correct to the best of 
my knowledge and belief. I understand that this information is submitted 
for the purpose of obtaining a renewal of my Certificate of Exemption 
under the Endangered Species Act, as amended, and the Department of 
Commerce regulations issued thereunder, and that any false statement may 
subject me to the criminal penalties of 18 U.S.C. 1001, or to the 
penalties under the Act.
    (7) Signature of the applicant.
    (d) Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed application 
for renewal, the applicant shall be notified of the deficiency in the 
application for renewal. If the application for renewal is not corrected 
and received by the Assistant Administrator within 30 days following the 
date of receipt of notification, the application for renewal shall be 
considered abandoned.


<R05>
Sec. 222.203  Modification, amendment, suspension, and revocation of certificates.

    (a) When circumstances have changed so that an applicant or 
certificate holder desires to have any material, term, or condition of 
the application or certificate modified, the applicant or certificate 
holder must submit in writing full justification and supporting 
information in conformance with the provisions of this part.
    (b) All certificates are issued subject to the condition that the 
Assistant Administrator reserves the right to amend the provisions of a 
Certificate of Exemption for just cause at any time. Such amendments 
take effect on the date of notification, unless otherwise specified.
    (c) Any violation of the applicable provisions of parts 222, 223, or 
224 of this chapter, or of the Act, or of a condition of the certificate 
may subject the certificate holder to penalties provided in the Act and 
to suspension, revocation, or modification of the Certificate of 
Exemption, as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.


<R05>
Sec. 222.204  Administration of certificates.

    (a) The Certificate of Exemption covers the business or activity 
specified in the Certificate of Exemption at the address described 
therein. No Certificate of Exemption is required to cover a separate 
warehouse facility used by the certificate holder solely for storage of 
pre-Act endangered species parts, if the records required by this 
subpart are maintained at the address specified in the Certificate of 
Exemption served by the warehouse or storage facility.
    (b) Certificates of Exemption issued under this subpart are not 
transferable. However, in the event of the lease, sale, or other 
transfer of the operations or activity authorized by the Certificate of 
Exemption, the successor is not required to obtain a new Certificate of 
Exemption prior to commencing such operations or activity. In such case, 
the successor will be treated as a purchaser and must comply with the 
record and reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 222.201(d).
    (c) The Certificate of Exemption holder must notify the Assistant 
Administrator, in writing, of any change in address, in trade name of 
the business, or in activity specified in the certificate. The Assistant 
Administrator must be notified within 10 days of a change of address, 
and within 30 days of a change in trade name. The certificate with the 
change of address or in trade name must be endorsed by the Assistant 
Administrator, who shall provide an amended certificate to the person to 
whom it was issued. A certificate holder who seeks amendment of a 
certificate may continue all authorized activities while awaiting action 
by the Assistant Administrator.
    (d) A Certificate of Exemption issued under this subpart confers no 
right or

[[Page 96]]

privilege to conduct a business or an activity contrary to state or 
other law. Similarly, compliance with the provisions of any state or 
other law affords no immunity under any Federal laws or regulations of 
any other Federal agency.
    (e) Any person authorized to enforce the Act may enter the premises 
of any Certificate of Exemption holder or of any purchaser during 
business hours, including places of storage, for the purpose of 
inspecting or of examining any records or documents and any endangered 
species parts.
    (f) The records pertaining to pre-Act endangered species parts 
prescribed by this subpart shall be in permanent form and shall be 
retained at the address shown on the Certificate of Exemption or at the 
principal address of a purchaser in the manner prescribed by this 
subpart.
    (g)(1) Holders of Certificates of Exemption must maintain records of 
all pre-Act endangered species parts they receive, sell, transfer, 
distribute or dispose of otherwise. Purchasers of pre-Act endangered 
species parts, unless ultimate users, as defined in Sec. 222.201(d), 
must similarly maintain records of all such parts or products they 
receive.
    (2) Such records referred to in paragraph (g)(1) of this section may 
consist of invoices or other commercial records, which must be filed in 
an orderly manner separate from other commercial records maintained and 
be readily available for inspection. Such records must show the name and 
address of the purchaser, seller, or other transferor; show the type, 
quantity, and identity of the part or product; show the date of such 
sale or transfer; and be retained, in accordance with the requirements 
of this subpart, for a period of not less than 3 years following the 
date of sale or transfer. Each pre-Act endangered species part will be 
identified by its number on the updated inventory required to renew a 
Certificate of Exemption.
    (i) Each Certificate of Exemption holder must submit a quarterly 
report (to the address given in the certificate) containing all record 
information required by paragraph (g)(2) of this section, on all 
transfers of pre-Act endangered species parts made in the previous 
calendar quarter, or such other record information the Assistant 
Administrator may specify from time to time.
    (ii) Quarterly reports are due on January 15, April 15, July 15, and 
October 15.
    (3) The Assistant Administrator may authorize the record information 
to be submitted in a manner other than that prescribed in paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section when the record holder demonstrates that an 
alternate method of reporting is reasonably necessary and will not 
hinder the effective administration or enforcement of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 222.205  Import and export requirements.

    (a) Any fish and wildlife subject to the jurisdiction of the 
National Marine Fisheries Service and is intended for importation into 
or exportation from the United States, shall not be imported or exported 
except at a port(s) designated by the Secretary of the Interior. 
Shellfish and fishery products that are neither endangered nor 
threatened species and that are imported for purposes of human or animal 
consumption or taken in waters under the jurisdiction of the United 
States or on the high seas for recreational purposes are excluded from 
this requirement. The Secretary of the Interior may permit the 
importation or exportation at nondesignated ports in the interest of the 
health or safety of the species for other reasons if the Secretary deems 
it appropriate and consistent with the purpose of facilitating 
enforcement of the Act and reducing the costs thereof. Importers and 
exporters are advised to see 50 CFR part 14 for importation and 
exportation requirements and information.
    (b) No pre-Act endangered species part shall be imported into the 
United States. A Certificate of Exemption issued in accordance with the 
provisions of this subpart confers no right or privilege to import into 
the United States any such part.
    (c)(1) Any person exporting from the United States any pre-Act 
endangered

[[Page 97]]

species part must possess a valid Certificate of Exemption issued in 
accordance with the provisions of this subpart. In addition, the 
exporter must provide to the Assistant Administrator, in writing, not 
less than 10 days prior to shipment, the following information: The name 
and address of the foreign consignee, the intended port of exportation, 
and a complete description of the parts to be exported. No shipment may 
be made until these requirements are met by the exporter.
    (2) The exporter must send a copy of the Certificate of Exemption, 
and any endorsements thereto, to the District Director of Customs at the 
port of exportation, which must precede or accompany the shipment in 
order to permit the appropriate inspection prior to lading. Upon 
receipt, the District Director may order such inspection, as deemed 
necessary; the District will clear the merchandise for export, prior to 
the lading of the merchandise. If they are satisfied that the shipment 
is proper and complies with the information contained in the certificate 
and any endorsement thereto. The certificate, and any endorsements, will 
be forwarded to the Chief of the Office of Enforcement for NMFS.
    (3) No pre-Act endangered species part in compliance with the 
requirements of this subpart may be exported except at a port or ports 
designated by the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to Sec. 222.103.
    (4) Notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, it shall not be 
required that the Assistant Administrator authorizes the transportation 
in interstate or foreign commerce of pre-Act endangered species parts.

    Effective Date Note: At 64 FR 14054, Mar. 23, 1999, part 222 was 
revised effective Mar. 23, 1999, with the exception of Sec. 222.205 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2), which contain information collection 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R04>
                  Subpart C--General Permit Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 222.301  General requirements.

    (a)(1) The regulations in this subpart C provide uniform rules and 
procedures for application, issuance, renewal, conditions, and general 
administration of permits issuable pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224 
of this chapter. While this section provides generic rules and 
procedures applicable to all permits, other sections may provide more 
specific rules and procedures with respect to certain types of permits. 
In such cases, the requirements in all applicable sections must be 
satisfied.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Assistant 
Administrator may approve variations from the requirements of parts 222, 
223, and 224 of this chapter when the Assistant Administrator finds that 
an emergency exists and that the proposed variations will not hinder 
effective administration of those parts and will not be unlawful. Other 
sections within parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter may allow for a 
waiver or variation of specific requirements for emergency situations, 
upon certain conditions. In such cases, those conditions must be 
satisfied in order for the waiver or variation to be lawful.
    (b) No person shall take, import, export or engage in any other 
prohibited activity involving any species of fish or wildlife under the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce that has been determined to be 
endangered under the Act, or that has been determined to be threatened 
and for which the prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the Act have been 
applied by regulation, without a valid permit issued pursuant to these 
regulations. The permit shall entitle the person to whom it is issued to 
engage in the activity specified in the permit, subject to the 
limitations of the Act and the regulations in parts 222, 223, and 224 of 
this chapter, for the period stated on the permit, unless sooner 
modified, suspended or revoked.
    (c) Each person intending to engage in an activity for which a 
permit is required by parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter or by the 
Act shall, before commencing such activity, obtain a valid permit 
authorizing such activity. Any person who desires to obtain permit 
privileges authorized by parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter must 
apply for such permit in accordance with the requirements of these 
sections. If the information required for each specific,

[[Page 98]]

permitted activity is included, one application may be accepted for all 
permits required, and a single permit may be issued.
    (d)(1) Any permit issued under these regulations must be in the 
possession of the person to whom it is issued (or of an agent of such 
person) while any animal subject to the permit is in the possession of 
such person or agent. Specifically, a person or his/her agent must be in 
possession of a permit during the time of the authorized taking, 
importation, exportation, or of any other act and during the period of 
any transit incident to such taking, importation, exportation, or to any 
other act.
    (2) A duplicate copy of the issued permit must be physically 
attached to the tank, container, package, enclosure, or other means of 
containment, in which the animal is placed for purposes of storage, 
transit, supervision, or care.
    (e) The authorizations on the face of a permit setting forth 
specific times, dates, places, methods of taking, numbers and kinds of 
fish or wildlife, location of activity, authorize certain circumscribed 
transactions, or otherwise permit a specifically limited matter, are to 
be strictly construed and shall not be interpreted to permit similar or 
related matters outside the scope of strict construction.
    (f) Permits shall not be altered, erased, or mutilated, and any 
permit which has been altered, erased, or mutilated shall immediately 
become invalid.
    (g) Any permit issued under parts 222, 223, and 224 of this chapter 
shall be displayed for inspection, upon request, to an authorized 
officer, or to any other person relying upon its existence.
    (h) Permittees may be required to file reports of the activities 
conducted under the permit. Any such reports shall be filed not later 
than March 31 for the preceding calendar year ending December 31, or any 
portion thereof, during which a permit was in force, unless the 
regulations of parts 222, 223, or 224 of this chapter or the provisions 
of the permit set forth other reporting requirements.
    (i) From the date of issuance of the permit, the permittee shall 
maintain complete and accurate records of any taking, possession, 
transportation, sale, purchase, barter, exportation, or importation of 
fish or wildlife pursuant to such permit. Such records shall be kept 
current and shall include the names and addresses of persons with whom 
any fish or wildlife has been purchased, sold, bartered, or otherwise 
transferred, and the date of such transaction, and such other 
information as may be required or appropriate. Such records, unless 
otherwise specified, shall be entered in books, legibly written in the 
English language. Such records shall be retained for 5 years from the 
date of issuance of the permit.
    (j) Any person holding a permit pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224 
of this chapter shall allow the Assistant Administrator to enter the 
permit holder's premises at any reasonable hour to inspect any fish or 
wildlife held or to inspect, audit, or copy any permits, books, or 
records required to be kept by these regulations or by the Act. Such 
person shall display any permit issued pursuant to these regulations or 
to the Act upon request by an authorized officer or by any other person 
relying on its existence.


<R05>
Sec. 222.302  Procedure for obtaining permits.

    (a) Applications must be submitted to the Assistant Administrator, 
by letter containing all necessary information, attachments, 
certification, and signature, as specified by the regulations in parts 
222, 223, and 224 of this chapter, or by the Act. In no case, other than 
for emergencies pursuant to Sec. 222.301(a)(2), will applications be 
accepted either orally or by telephone.
    (b) Applications must be received by the Assistant Administrator at 
least 90 calendar days prior to the date on which the applicant desires 
to have the permit made effective, unless otherwise specified in the 
regulations or guidelines pertaining to a particular permit. The 
National Marine Fisheries Service will attempt to process applications 
deemed sufficient in the shortest possible time, but does not guarantee 
that the permit will be issued 90 days after notice of receipt of the 
application is published in the Federal Register.

[[Page 99]]

    (c)(1) Upon receipt of an insufficiently or improperly executed 
application, the applicant shall be notified of the deficiency in the 
application. If the applicant fails to supply the deficient information 
or otherwise fails to correct the deficiency within 60 days following 
the date of notification, the application shall be considered abandoned.
    (2) The sufficiency of the application shall be determined by the 
Assistant Administrator in accordance with the requirements of this 
part. The Assistant Administrator, however, may waive any requirement 
for information or require any elaboration or further information deemed 
necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 222.303  Issuance of permits.

    (a)(1) No permit may be issued prior to the receipt of a written 
application unless an emergency pursuant to Sec. 222.301(a)(2) exists, 
and a written variation from the requirements is recorded by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (2) No representation of an employee or agent of the United States 
shall be construed as a permit unless it meets the requirements of a 
permit defined in Sec. 222.102.
    (3) Each permit shall bear a serial number. Upon renewal, such a 
number may be reassigned to the permittee to whom issued so long as the 
permittee maintains continuity of renewal.
    (b) When an application for a permit received by the Assistant 
Administrator is deemed sufficient, the Assistant Administrator shall, 
as soon as practicable, publish a notice in the Federal Register. 
Information received by the Assistant Administrator as a part of the 
application shall be available to the public as a matter of public 
record at every stage of the proceeding. An interested party, within 30 
days after the date of publication of such notice, may submit to the 
Assistant Administrator written data, views, or arguments with respect 
to the taking, importation, or to other action proposed in the 
application, and may request a hearing in connection with the action to 
be taken thereon.
    (c) If a request for a hearing is made within the 30-day period 
referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, or if the Assistant 
Administrator determines that a hearing would otherwise be advisable, 
the Assistant Administrator may, within 60 days after the date of 
publication of the notice referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, 
afford to such requesting party or parties an opportunity for a hearing. 
Such hearing shall also be open to participation by any interested 
members of the public. Notice of the date, time, and place of such 
hearing shall be published in the Federal Register not less than 15 days 
in advance of such hearing. Any interested person may appear at the 
hearing in person or through a representative and may submit any 
relevant material, data, views, comments, arguments, or exhibits. A 
summary record of the hearing shall be kept.
    (d) Except as provided in subpart D to 15 CFR part 904, as soon as 
practicable but not later than 30 days after the close of the hearing. 
If no hearing is held, as soon as practicable but not later than 30 days 
from the publication of the notice in the Federal Register, the 
Assistant Administrator shall issue or deny issuance of the permit. 
Notice of the decision of the Assistant Administrator shall be published 
in the Federal Register within 10 days after the date of the issuance or 
denial and indicate where copies of the permit, if issued, may be 
obtained.
    (e)(1) The Assistant Administrator shall issue the permit unless:
    (i) Denial of the permit has been made pursuant to subpart D to 15 
CFR part 904;
    (ii) The applicant has failed to disclose material or information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with the application;
    (iii) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit or a showing of responsibility;
    (iv) The authorization requested potentially threatens a fish or 
wildlife population; or
    (v) The Assistant Administrator finds through further inquiry or 
investigation, or otherwise, that the applicant is not qualified.

[[Page 100]]

    (2) The applicant shall be notified in writing of the denial of any 
permit request, and the reasons thereof. If authorized in the notice of 
denial, the applicant may submit further information or reasons why the 
permit should not be denied. Such further information shall not be 
considered a new application. The final action by the Assistant 
Administrator shall be considered the final administrative decision of 
the Department of Commerce.
    (f) If a permit is issued under Sec. 222.308, the Assistant 
Administrator shall publish notice thereof in the Federal Register, 
including the Assistant Administrator's finding that such permit--
    (1) Was applied for in good faith;
    (2) Will not operate to the disadvantage of such endangered species; 
and
    (3) Will be consistent with the purposes and policy set forth in 
section 2 of the Act.
    (g) The Assistant Administrator may waive the 30-day period in an 
emergency situation where the health or life of an endangered animal is 
threatened and no reasonable alternative is available to the applicant. 
Notice of any such waiver shall be published by the Assistant 
Administrator in the Federal Register within 10 days following the 
issuance of the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 222.304  Renewal of permits.

    When the permit is renewable and a permittee intends to continue the 
activity described in the permit during any portion of the year ensuing 
its expiration, the permittee shall, unless otherwise notified in 
writing by the Assistant Administrator, file a request for permit 
renewal, together with a certified statement, verifying that the 
information in the original application is still currently correct. If 
the information is incorrect the permittee shall file a statement of all 
changes in the original application, accompanied by any required fee at 
least 30 days prior to the expiration of the permit. Any person holding 
a valid renewable permit, who has complied with the foregoing provision 
of this section, may continue such activities as were authorized by the 
expired permit until the renewal application is acted upon.


<R05>
Sec. 222.305  Rights of succession and transfer of permits.

    (a)(1) Permits issued pursuant to parts 222, 223, and 224 of this 
chapter are not transferable or assignable. In the event that a permit

commercial enterprise, which is then subject to any subsequent lease, 
sale or transfer, the successor to that enterprise must obtain a permit 
prior to continuing the permitted activity, with the exceptions provided 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) Certain persons, other than the permittee, are granted the right 
to carry on a permitted activity for the remainder of the term of a 
current permit, provided that they furnish the permit to the issuing 
officer for endorsement within 90 days from the date the successor 
begins to carry on the activity. Such persons are the following:
    (i) The surviving spouse, child, executor, administrator, or other 
legal representative of a deceased permittee, and
    (ii) The receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or a court designated 
assignee for the benefit of creditors.
    (b) Except as otherwise stated on the face of the permit, any person 
who is under the direct control of the permittee, or who is employed by 
or under contract to the permittee for purposes authorized by the 
permit, may carry out the activity authorized by the permit.

    Effective Date Notes: 1. At 64 FR 14054, Mar. 23, 1999, part 222 was

<R05>
Sec. 222.306  Modification, amendment, suspension, cancellation, and revocation of permits.

    (a) When circumstances have changed so that an applicant or a 
permittee desires to have any term or condition of the application or 
permit modified, the applicant or permittee must submit in writing full 
justification and supporting information in conformance with the 
provisions of this part and the part under which the permit has been 
issued or requested. Such applications for modification are subject to 
the same issuance criteria as original applications.
    (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, a permittee may change the mailing address or trade name under 
which business is conducted without obtaining a new permit or being 
subject to the same issuance criteria as original permits. The permittee 
must notify the Assistant Administrator, in writing within 30 days, of 
any change in address or of any change in the trade name for the 
business or activity specified in the permit. The permit with the change 
of address or in trade name must be endorsed by the Assistant 
Administrator, who shall provide an amended permit to the person to whom 
it was issued.
    (c) All permits are issued subject to the condition that the 
National Marine Fisheries Service reserves the right to amend the 
provisions of a permit for just cause at any time during its term. Such 
amendments take effect on the date of notification, unless otherwise 
specified.
    (d) When any permittee discontinues the permitted activity, the 
permittee shall, within 30 days thereof, mail the permit and a request 
for cancellation to the issuing officer, and the permit shall be deemed 
void upon receipt. No refund of any part of an amount paid as a permit 
fee shall be made when the operations of the permittee are, for any 
reason, discontinued during the tenure of an issued permit.
    (e) Any violation of the applicable provisions of parts 222, 223, or 
224 of this chapter, or of the Act, or of a term or condition of the 
permit may subject the permittee to both the penalties provided in the 
Act and suspension, revocation, or amendment of the permit, as provided 
in subpart D to 15 CFR part 904.


<R05>
Sec. 222.307  Permits for incidental taking of species.

    (a) Scope. (1) The Assistant Administrator may issue permits to take 
endangered and threatened species incidentally to an otherwise lawful 
activity under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act. The regulations in this 
section apply to all endangered species, and those threatened species 
for which the prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the Act, under the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce, apply.
    (2) If the applicant represents an individual or a single entity, 
such as a corporation, the Assistant Administrator will issue an 
individual incidental take permit. If the applicant represents a group 
or organization

[[Page 102]]

whose members conduct the same or a similar activity in the same 
geographical area with similar impacts on listed species for which a 
permit is required, the Assistant Administrator will issue a general 
incidental take permit. To be covered by a general incidental take 
permit, each individual conducting the activity must have a certificate 
of inclusion issued under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Permit application procedures. Applications should be sent to 
the Assistant Administrator. The Assistant Administrator shall determine 
the sufficiency of the application in accordance with the requirements 
of this section. At least 120 days should be allowed for processing. 
Each application must be signed and dated and must include the 
following:
    (1) The type of application, either:
    (i) Application for an Individual Incidental Take Permit under the 
Act; or
    (ii) Application for a General Incidental Take Permit under the Act;
    (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant. If the 
applicant is a partnership or a corporate entity or is representing a 
group or an organization, the applicable details;
    (3) The species or stocks, by common and scientific name, and a 
description of the status, distribution, seasonal distribution, habitat 
needs, feeding habits and other biological requirements of the affected 
species or stocks;
    (4) A detailed description of the proposed activity, including the 
anticipated dates, duration, and specific location. If the request is 
for a general incidental take permit, an estimate of the total level of 
activity expected to be conducted;
    (5) A conservation plan, based on the best scientific and commercial 
data available, which specifies the following:
    (i) The anticipated impact (i.e., amount, extent, and type of 
anticipated taking) of the proposed activity on the species or stocks;
    (ii) The anticipated impact of the proposed activity on the habitat 
of the species or stocks and the likelihood of restoration of the 
affected habitat;

    (2) To issue the permit, the Assistant Administrator must find that-
-
    (i) The taking will be incidental;
    (ii) The applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, monitor, 
minimize, and mitigate the impacts of such taking;
    (iii) The taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the 
survival and recovery of the species in the wild;
    (iv) The applicant has amended the conservation plan to include any 
measures (not originally proposed by the applicant) that the Assistant 
Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate; and
    (v) There are adequate assurances that the conservation plan will be

whether the terms and conditions are being complied with;
    (2) The species and number of animals covered;
    (3) The authorized method of taking;
    (4) The procedures to be used to handle or dispose of any animals 
taken; and
    (5) The payment of an adequate fee to the National Marine Fisheries 
Service to process the application.
    (e) Duration of permits. The duration of permits issued under this 
section will be such as to provide adequate assurances to the permit 
holder to commit funding necessary for the activities authorized by the 
permit, including conservation activities. In determining the duration 
of a permit, the Assistant Administrator will consider the duration of 
the proposed activities, as well as the possible positive and negative 
effects on listed species associated with issuing a permit of the 
proposed duration, including the extent to which the conservation plan 
is likely to enhance the habitat of the endangered species or to 
increase the long-term survivability of the species.
    (f) Certificates of inclusion. (1) Any individual who wishes to 
conduct an activity covered by a general incidental take permit must 
apply to the Assistant Administrator for a Certificate of Inclusion. 
Each application must be signed and dated and must include the 
following:
    (i) The general incidental take permit under which the applicant 
wants coverage;
    (ii) The name, address, and telephone number of the applicant. If 
the applicant is a partnership or a corporate entity, the applicable 
details;
    (iii) A description of the activity the applicant seeks to have 
covered under the general incidental take permit, including the 
anticipated dates, duration, and specific location; and
    (iv) A signed certification that the applicant has read and 
understands the general incidental take permit and the conservation 
plan, will comply with their terms and conditions, and will fund and 
implement applicable measures of the conservation plan.
    (2) To issue a Certificate of Inclusion, the Assistant Administrator 
must find that:
    (i) The applicant will be engaged in the activity covered by the 
general permit, and
    (ii) The applicant has made adequate assurances that the applicable 
measures of the conservation plan will be funded and implemented.
    (g) Assurances provided to permittee in case of changed or 
unforeseen circumstances. The assurances in this paragraph (g) apply 
only to incidental take permits issued in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section where the conservation plan is being properly 
implemented, and apply only with respect to species adequately covered 
by the conservation plan. These assurances cannot be provided to Federal 
agencies. This rule does not apply to incidental take permits issued 
prior to March 25, 1998. The assurances provided in incidental take 
permits issued prior to March 25, 1998, remain in effect, and those 
permits will not be revised as a result of this rulemaking.
    (1) Changed circumstances provided for in the plan. If additional 
conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to respond to 
changed circumstances and were provided for in the plan's operating 
conservation program, the permittee will implement the measures 
specified in the plan.
    (2) Changed circumstances not provided for in the plan. If 
additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed necessary to 
respond to changed circumstances and such measures were not provided for 
in the plan's operating conservation program, NMFS will not require any 
conservation and mitigation measures in addition to those provided for 
in the plan without the consent of the permittee, provided the plan is 
being properly implemented.
    (3) Unforeseen circumstances. (i) In negotiating unforeseen 
circumstances, NMFS will not require the commitment of additional land, 
water, or financial compensation or additional restrictions on the use 
of land, water, or

[[Page 104]]

other natural resources beyond the level otherwise agreed upon for the 
species covered by the conservation plan without the consent of the 
permittee.
    (ii) If additional conservation and mitigation measures are deemed 
necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances, NMFS may require 
additional measures of the permittee where the conservation plan is 
being properly implemented. However, such additional measures are 
limited to modifications within any conserved habitat areas or to the 
conservation plan's operating conservation program for the affected 
species. The original terms of the conservation plan will be maintained 
to the maximum extent possible. Additional conservation and mitigation 
measures will not involve the commitment of additional land, water, or 
financial compensation or additional restrictions on the use of land, 
water, or other natural resources otherwise available for development or 
use under the original terms of the conservation plan without the 
consent of the permittee.
    (iii) NMFS has the burden of demonstrating that unforeseen 
circumstances exist, using the best scientific and commercial data 
available. These findings must be clearly documented and based upon 
reliable technical information regarding the status and habitat 
requirements of the affected species. NMFS will consider, but not be 
limited to, the following factors:
    (A) Size of the current range of the affected species;
    (B) Percentage of range adversely affected by the conservation plan;
    (C) Percentage of range conserved by the conservation plan;
    (D) Ecological significance of that portion of the range affected by 
the conservation plan;
    (E) Level of knowledge about the affected species and the degree of 
specificity of the species' conservation program under the conservation 
plan; and
    (F) Whether failure to adopt additional conservation measures would 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the 
affected species in the wild.
    (h) Nothing in this rule will be construed to limit or constrain the 
Assistant Administrator, any Federal, State, local, or Tribal government 
agency, or a private entity, from taking additional actions at his or 
her own expense to protect or conserve a species included in a 
conservation plan.

presents a threat to the health, safety, or life of a person or presents 
a significant threat to the vessel or property.
    (5) Exemptions. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply to 
any activity authorized by a prior written exemption from the Director, 
Alaska Region, National Marine Fisheries Service. Concurrently with the 
issuance of any exemption, the Assistant Administrator will publish 
notice of the exemption in the Federal Register. An exemption may be 
granted only if the activity will not have a significant adverse affect 
on Steller sea lions, the activity has been conducted historically or 
traditionally in the buffer zones, and there is no readily available and 
acceptable alternative to or site for the activity.
    (6) Navigational transit. Paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not 
prohibit a vessel in transit from passing through a strait, narrows, or 
passageway listed in this paragraph if the vessel proceeds in continuous 
transit and maintains a minimum of 1 nautical mile from the rookery 
site. The listing of a strait, narrows, or passageway does not indicate 
that the area is safe for navigation. The listed straits, narrows, or 
passageways include the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Rookery                     Straits, narrows, or pass
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sec. 223.203  Anadromous fish.

    Available guidance documents cited in the regulatory text are listed 
in Appendix A to this section.
    (a) Prohibitions. The prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the ESA (16 
U.S.C. 1538(a)(1)) relating to endangered species apply to the 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102(a)(1) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(22), except as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section and Sec.  223.209(a).
    (b) Limits on the prohibitions. (1) The exceptions of section 10 of 
the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1539) and other exceptions under the Act relating to 
endangered species, including regulations in part 222 of this

[[Page 142]]

chapter implementing such exceptions, also apply to the threatened 
species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102(a)(1) through (a)(10), and 
(a)(12) through (a)(22).
    (2) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(5) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to activities 
specified in an application for a permit for scientific purposes or to 
enhance the conservation or survival of the species, provided that the 
application has been received by the Assistant Administrator for 
Fisheries, NOAA (AA), no later than October 10, 2000. The prohibitions 
of paragraph (a) of this section apply to these activities upon the AA's 
rejection of the application as insufficient, upon issuance or denial of 
a permit, or March 7, 2001, whichever occurs earliest.
    (3) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(4) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to any employee or 
designee of NMFS, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, any 
Federal land management agency, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game 
(IDFG), Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), the Oregon 
Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), California Department of Fish 
and Game (CDFG), or of any other governmental entity that has co-
management authority for the listed salmonids, when the employee or 
designee, acting in the course of his or her official duties, takes a 
threatened salmonid without a permit if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured, or stranded salmonid,
    (ii) Dispose of a dead salmonid, or
    (iii) Salvage a dead salmonid which may be useful for scientific 
study.
    (iv) Each agency acting under this limit on the take prohibitions of 
paragraph (a) of this section is to report to NMFS the numbers of fish 
handled and their status, on an annual basis. A designee of the listed 
entities is any individual the Federal or state fishery agency or other 
co-manager has authorized in writing to perform the listed functions.
    (4) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(5) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to fishery harvest 
activities provided that:
    (i) Fisheries are managed in accordance with a NMFS-approved Fishery 
Management and Evaluation Plan (FMEP) and implemented in accordance with 
a letter of concurrence from NMFS. NMFS will approve an FMEP only if it 
clearly defines its intended scope and area of impact and sets forth the 
management objectives and performance indicators for the plan. The plan 
must adequately address the following criteria:
    (A) Define populations within affected listed ESUs, taking into 
account spatial and temporal distribution, genetic and phenotypic 
diversity, and other appropriate identifiably unique biological and life 
history traits. Populations may be aggregated for management purposes 
when dictated by information scarcity, if consistent with survival and 
recovery of the listed ESU. In identifying management units, the plan 
shall describe the reasons for using such units in lieu of population 
units, describe how the management units are defined, given biological 
and life history traits, so as to maximize consideration of the 
important biological diversity contained within the listed ESU, respond 
to the scale and complexity of the ESU, and help ensure consistent 
treatment of listed salmonids across a diverse geographic and 
jurisdictional range.
    (B) Utilize the concepts of ``viable'' and ``critical'' salmonid 
population thresholds, consistent with the concepts contained in the 
technical document entitled ``Viable Salmonid Populations (NMFS, 
2000b).'' The VSP paper provides a framework for identifying the 
biological requirements of listed salmonids, assessing the effects of 
management and conservation actions, and ensuring that such actions 
provide for the survival and recovery of listed species. Proposed 
management actions must recognize the significant differences in risk 
associated with viable and critical population threshold states and 
respond accordingly to minimize the long-term risks to population

[[Page 143]]

persistence. Harvest actions impacting populations that are functioning 
at or above the viable threshold must be designed to maintain the 
population or management unit at or above that level. For populations 
shown with a high degree of confidence to be above critical levels but 
not yet at viable levels, harvest management must not appreciably slow 
the population's achievement of viable function. Harvest actions 
impacting populations that are functioning at or below critical 
threshold must not be allowed to appreciably increase genetic and 
demographic risks facing the population and must be designed to permit 
the population's achievement of viable function, unless the plan 
demonstrates that the likelihood of survival and recovery of the entire 
ESU in the wild would not be appreciably reduced by greater risks to 
that individual population.
    (C) Set escapement objectives or maximum exploitation rates for each 
management unit or population based on its status and on a harvest 
program that assures that those rates or objectives are not exceeded. 
Maximum exploitation rates must not appreciably reduce the likelihood of 
survival and recovery of the ESU. Management of fisheries where 
artificially propagated fish predominate must not compromise the 
management objectives for commingled naturally spawned populations.
    (D) Display a biologically based rationale demonstrating that the 
harvest management strategy will not appreciably reduce the likelihood 
of survival and recovery of the ESU in the wild, over the entire period 
of time the proposed harvest management strategy affects the population, 
including effects reasonably certain to occur after the proposed actions 
cease.
    (E) Include effective monitoring and evaluation programs to assess 
compliance, effectiveness, and parameter validation. At a minimum, 
harvest monitoring programs must collect catch and effort data, 
information on escapements, and information on biological 
characteristics, such as age, fecundity, size and sex data, and 
migration timing.
    (F) Provide for evaluating monitoring data and making any revisions 
of assumptions, management strategies, or objectives that data show are 
needed.
    (G) Provide for effective enforcement and education. Coordination 
among involved jurisdictions is an important element in ensuring 
regulatory effectiveness and coverage.
    (H) Include restrictions on resident and anadromous species 
fisheries that minimize any take of listed species, including time, 
size, gear, and area restrictions.
    (I) Be consistent with plans and conditions established within any 
Federal court proceeding with continuing jurisdiction over tribal 
harvest allocations.
    (ii) The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids 
occurring in its fisheries and provides to NMFS on a regular basis, as 
defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence for the FMEP, a report 
summarizing this information, as well as the implementation and 
effectiveness of the FMEP. The state shall provide NMFS with access to 
all data and reports prepared concerning the implementation and 
effectiveness of the FMEP.
    (iii) The state confers with NMFS on its fishing regulation changes 
affecting listed ESUs to ensure consistency with the approved FMEP. 
Prior to approving a new or amended FMEP, NMFS will publish notification 
in the Federal Register announcing its availability for public review 
and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a comment period on 
the draft FMEP of not less than 30 days.
    (iv) NMFS provides written concurrence of the FMEP which specifies 
the implementation and reporting requirements. NMFS' approval of a plan 
shall be a written approval by NMFS Southwest or Northwest Regional 
Administrator, as appropriate. On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate 
the effectiveness of the program in protecting and achieving a level of 
salmonid productivity commensurate with conservation of the listed 
salmonids. If it is not, NMFS will identify ways in which the program 
needs to be altered or strengthened. If the responsible agency does not 
make changes to respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will 
publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its

[[Page 144]]

intention to withdraw the limit for activities associated with that 
FMEP. Such an announcement will provide for a comment period of not less 
than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a final determination whether 
to withdraw the limit so that the prohibitions would then apply to those 
fishery harvest activities. A template for developing FMEPs is available 
from NMFS Northwest Region's website (www.nwr.noaa.gov).
    (v) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of steelhead listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(5) through 
(a)(9), (a)(14), and (a)(15) do not apply to fisheries managed solely by 
the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and California until January 8, 
2001.
    (5) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(5) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to activity associated 
with artificial propagation programs provided that:
    (i) A state or Federal Hatchery and Genetics Management Plan (HGMP) 
has been approved by NMFS as meeting the following criteria:
    (A) The HGMP has clearly stated goals, performance objectives, and 
performance indicators that indicate the purpose of the program, its 
intended results, and measurements of its performance in meeting those 
results. Goals shall address whether the program is intended to meet 
conservation objectives, contribute to the ultimate sustainability of 
natural spawning populations, and/or intended to augment tribal, 
recreational, or commercial fisheries. Objectives should enumerate the 
results desired from the program that will be used to measure the 
program's success or failure.
    (B) The HGMP utilizes the concepts of viable and critical salmonid 
population threshold, consistent with the concepts contained in the 
technical document entitled ``Viable Salmonid Populations'' (NMFS, 
2000b). Listed salmonids may be purposefully taken for broodstock 
purposes only if the donor population is currently at or above the 
viable threshold and the collection will not impair its function; if the 
donor population is not currently viable but the sole objective of the 
current collection program is to enhance the propagation or survival of 
the listed ESU; or if the donor population is shown with a high degree 
of confidence to be above critical threshold although not yet 
functioning at viable levels, and the collection will not appreciably 
slow the attainment of viable status for that population.
    (C) Taking into account health, abundances, and trends in the donor 
population, broodstock collection programs reflect appropriate 
priorities. The primary purpose of broodstock collection programs of 
listed species is to reestablish indigenous salmonid populations for 
conservation purposes. Such programs include restoration of similar, at-
risk populations within the same ESU, and reintroduction of at-risk 
populations to underseeded habitat. After the species' conservation 
needs are met and when consistent with survival and recovery of the ESU, 
broodstock collection programs may be authorized by NMFS such for 
secondary purposes, as to sustain tribal, recreational, and commercial 
fisheries.
    (D) The HGMP includes protocols to address fish health, broodstock 
collection, broodstock spawning, rearing and release of juveniles, 
deposition of hatchery adults, and catastrophic risk management.
    (E) The HGMP evaluates, minimizes, and accounts for the propagation 
program's genetic and ecological effects on natural populations, 
including disease transfer, competition, predation, and genetic 
introgression caused by the straying of hatchery fish.
    (F) The HGMP describes interrelationships and interdependencies with 
fisheries management. The combination of artificial propagation programs 
and harvest management must be designed to provide as many benefits and 
as few biological risks as possible for the listed species. For programs 
whose purpose is to sustain fisheries, HGMPs must not compromise the 
ability of FMEPs or other management plans to conserve listed salmonids.
    (G) Adequate artificial propagation facilities exist to properly 
rear progeny of naturally spawned broodstock, to

[[Page 145]]

maintain population health and diversity, and to avoid hatchery-
influenced selection or domestication.
    (H) Adequate monitoring and evaluation exist to detect and evaluate 
the success of the hatchery program and any risks potentially impairing 
the recovery of the listed ESU.
    (I) The HGMP provides for evaluating monitoring data and making any 
revisions of assumptions, management strategies, or objectives that data 
show are needed;
    (J) NMFS provides written concurrence of the HGMP which specifies 
the implementation and reporting requirements. For Federally operated or 
funded hatcheries, the ESA section 7 consultation will achieve this 
purpose.
    (K) The HGMP is consistent with plans and conditions set within any 
Federal court proceeding with continuing jurisdiction over tribal 
harvest allocations.
    (ii) The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids 
occurring in its hatchery program and provides to NMFS on a regular 
basis a report summarizing this information, and the implementation and 
effectiveness of the HGMP as defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence. The 
state shall provide NMFS with access to all data and reports prepared 
concerning the implementation and effectiveness of the HGMP.
    (iii) The state confers with NMFS on a regular basis regarding 
intended collections of listed broodstock to ensure congruity with the 
approved HGMP.
    (iv) Prior to final approval of an HGMP, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing its availability for 
public review and comment for a period of at least 30 days.
    (v) NMFS' approval of a plan shall be a written approval by NMFS 
Southwest or Northwest Regional Administrator, as appropriate.
    (vi) On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of the 
HGMP in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid productivity 
commensurate with the conservation of the listed salmonids. If the HGMP 
is not effective, the NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in 
which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. If the 
responsible agency does not make changes to respond adequately to the 
new information, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing its intention to withdraw the limit on activities associated 
with that program. Such an announcement will provide for a comment 
period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a final 
determination whether to withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions, 
likeall other activity not within a limit, would then apply to that 
program. A template for developing HGMPs is available from NMFS 
Northwest Region's website (www.nwr.noaa.gov).
    (6) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(7), (a)(8), 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to actions undertaken 
in compliance with a resource management plan developed jointly by the 
States of Washington, Oregon and/or Idaho and the Tribes (joint plan) 
within the continuing jurisdiction of United States v. Washington or 
United States v. Oregon, the on-going Federal court proceedings to 
enforce and implement reserved treaty fishing rights, provided that:
    (i) The Secretary has determined pursuant to 50 CFR 223.209 and the 
government-to-government processes therein that implementing and 
enforcing the joint tribal/state plan will not appreciably reduce the 
likelihood of survival and recovery of affected threatened ESUs.
    (ii) The joint plan will be implemented and enforced within the 
parameters set forth in United States v. Washington orUnited States v. 
Oregon.
    (iii) In making that determination for a joint plan, the Secretary 
has taken comment on how any fishery management plan addresses the 
criteria in Sec. 223.203(b)(4), or on how any hatchery and genetic 
management plan addresses the criteria in Sec. 223.203(b)(5).
    (iv) The Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of 
any determination whether or not a joint plan, will appreciably reduce 
the likelihood of survival and recovery of affected threatened ESUs, 
together with a discussion of the biological analysis underlying that 
determination.

[[Page 146]]

    (v) On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of the 
joint plan in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid productivity 
commensurate with conservation of the listed salmonids. If the plan is 
not effective, then NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which 
the joint plan needs to be altered or strengthened. If the responsible 
agency does not make changes to respond adequately to the new 
information, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing its intention to withdraw the limit on activities associated 
with that joint plan. Such an announcement will provide for a comment 
period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a final 
determination whether to withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions 
would then apply to that joint plan as to all other activity not within 
a limit.
    (7) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a)(5) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to scientific research 
activities provided that:
    (i) Scientific research activities involving purposeful take is 
conducted by employees or contractors of the ODFW, WDFW (Agencies), 
IDFG, or CDFG (Agencies), or as a part of a monitoring and research 
program overseen by or coordinated with that Agency.
    (ii) The Agencies provide for NMFS' review and approval a list of 
all scientific research activities involving direct take planned for the 
coming year, including an estimate of the total direct take that is 
anticipated, a description of the study design, including a 
justification for taking the species and a description of the techniques 
to be used, and a point of contact.
    (iii) The Agencies annually provide to NMFS the results of 
scientific research activities directed at threatened salmonids, 
including a report of the direct take resulting from the studies and a 
summary of the results of such studies.
    (iv) Scientific research activities that may incidentally take 
threatened salmonids are either conducted by agency personnel, or are in 
accord with a permit issued by the Agency.
    (v) The Agencies provide NMFS annually, for its review and approval, 
a report listing all scientific research activities it conducts or 
permits that may incidentally take threatened salmonids during the 
coming year. Such reports shall also contain the amount of incidental 
take of threatened salmonids occurring in the previous year's scientific 
research activities and a summary of the results of such research.
    (vi) Electrofishing in any body of water known or suspected to 
contain threatened salmonids is conducted in accordance with NMFS 
``Guidelines for Electrofishing Waters Containing Salmonids Listed Under 
the Endangered Species Act'' (NMFS, 2000a).
    (vii) NMFS' approval of a research program shall be a written 
approval by NMFS Northwest or Southwest Regional Administrator.
    (8) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a)(5) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12), through (a)(19) do not apply to habitat 
restoration activities, as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this 
section, provided that the activity is part of a watershed conservation 
plan, and:
    (i) The watershed conservation plan has been certified by the State 
of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, or California (State) to be consistent 
with the state's watershed conservation plan guidelines.
    (ii) The State's watershed conservation plan guidelines have been 
found by NMFS to provide for plans that:
    (A) Take into account the potential severity of direct, indirect, 
and cumulative impacts of proposed activities in light of the status of 
affected species and populations.
    (B) Will not reduce the likelihood of either survival or recovery of 
listed species in the wild.
    (C) Ensure that any taking will be incidental.
    (D) Minimize and mitigate any adverse impacts.
    (E) Provide for effective monitoring and adaptive management.

[[Page 147]]

    (F) Use the best available science and technology, including 
watershed analysis.
    (G) Provide for public and scientific review and input.
    (H) Include any measures that NMFS determines are necessary or 
appropriate.
    (I) Include provisions that clearly identify those activities that 
are part of plan implementation.
    (J) Control risk to listed species by ensuring funding and 
implementation of the above plan components.
    (iii) NMFS will periodically review state certifications of 
Watershed Conservation Plans to ensure adherence to approved watershed 
conservation plan guidelines.
    (iv) ``Habitat restoration activity'' is defined as an activity 
whose primary purpose is to restore natural aquatic or riparian habitat 
conditions or processes. ``Primary purpose'' means the activity would 
not be undertaken but for its restoration purpose.
    (v) Prior to approving watershed conservation plan guidelines under 
paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, NMFS will publish notification in 
the Federal Register announcing the availability of the proposed 
guidelines for public review and comment. Such an announcement will 
provide for a comment period on the draft guidelines of no less than 30 
days.
    (9) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102(a)(5) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to the physical 
diversion of water from a stream or lake, provided that:
    (i) NMFS' engineering staff or any resource agency or tribe NMFS 
designates (authorized officer) has agreed in writing that the diversion 
facility is screened, maintained, and operated in compliance with 
Juvenile Fish Screen Criteria, National Marine Fisheries Service, 
Northwest Region, Revised February 16, 1995, with Addendum of May 9, 
1996, or in California with NMFS' Southwest Region ``Fish Screening 
Criteria for Anadromous Salmonids, January 1997'' or with any subsequent 
revision.
    (ii) The owner or manager of the diversion allows any NMFS engineer 
or authorized officer access to the diversion facility for purposes of 
inspection and determination of continued compliance with the criteria.
    (iii) On a case by case basis, NMFS or an Authorized Officer will 
review and approve a juvenile fish screen design and construction plan 
and schedule that the water diverter proposes for screen installation. 
The plan and schedule will describe interim operation measures to avoid 
take of threatened salmonids. NMFS may require a commitment of 
compensatory mitigation if implementation of the plan and schedule is 
terminated prior to completion. If the plan and schedule are not met, or 
if a schedule modification is made that is not approved by NMFS or 
Authorized Officer, or if the screen installation deviates from the 
approved design, the water diversion will be subject to take 
prohibitions and mitigation.
    (iv) This limit on the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section 
does not encompass any impacts of reduced flows resulting from the 
diversion or impacts caused during installation of the diversion device. 
These impacts are subject to the prohibition on take of listed 
salmonids.
    (10) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(5) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to routine road 
maintenance activities provided that:
    (i) The activity results from routine road maintenance activity 
conducted by ODOT employees or agents that complies with ODOT's 
Transportation Maintenance Management System Water Quality and Habitat 
Guide (July, 1999); or by employees or agents of a state, county, city 
or port that complies with a program substantially similar to that 
contained in the ODOT Guide that is determined to meet or exceed the 
protections provided by the ODOT Guide; or by employees or agents of a 
state, county, city or port that complies with a routine road 
maintenance program that meets proper functioning habitat conditions as 
described further in subparagraph (ii) following. NMFS' approval of 
state, city, county, or port programs that are

[[Page 148]]

equivalent to the ODOT program, or of any amendments, shall be a written 
approval by NMFS Northwest or Southwest Regional Administrator, 
whichever is appropriate. Any jurisdiction desiring its routine road 
maintenance activities to be within this limit must first commit in 
writing to apply management practices that result in protections 
equivalent to or better than those provided by the ODOT Guide, detailing 
how it will assure adequate training, tracking, and reporting, and 
describing in detail any dust abatement practices it requests to be 
covered.
    (ii) NMFS finds the routine road maintenance activities of any 
state, city, county, or port to be consistent with the conservation of 
listed salmonids' habitat when it contributes, as does the ODOT Guide, 
to the attainment and maintenance of properly functioning condition 
(PFC). NMFS defines PFC as the sustained presence of natural habitat-
forming processes that are necessary for the long-term survival of 
salmonids through the full range of environmental variation. Actions 
that affect salmonid habitat must not impair properly functioning 
habitat, appreciably reduce the functioning of already impaired habitat, 
or retard the long-term progress of impaired habitat toward PFC. 
Periodically, NMFS will evaluate an approved program for its 
effectiveness in maintaining and achieving habitat function that 
provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. Whenever warranted, 
NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which the program needs 
to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be identified if the program 
is not protecting desired habitat functions, or where even with the 
habitat characteristics and functions originally targeted, habitat is 
not supporting population productivity levels needed to conserve the 
ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit does not make changes to 
respond adequately to the new information in the shortest amount of time 
feasible, but not longer than one year, NMFS will publish notification 
in the Federal Register announcing its intention to withdraw the limit 
so that take prohibitions would then apply to the program as to all 
other activity not within a limit. Such an announcement will provide for 
a comment period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a 
final determination whether to subject the activities to the ESA section 
9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (iii) Prior to implementing any changes to a program within this 
limit the jurisdiction provides NMFS a copy of the proposed change for 
review and approval as within this limit.
    (iv) Prior to approving any state, city, county, or port program as 
within this limit, or approving any substantive change in a program 
within this limit, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal 
Register announcing the availability of the program or the draft changes 
for public review and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of not less than 30 days.
    (v) Pesticide and herbicide spraying is not included within this 
limit, even if in accord with the ODOT guidance.
    (11) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(5) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to activities within 
the City of Portland, Oregon Parks and Recreation Department's (PP&R) 
Pest Management Program (March 1997), including its Waterways Pest 
Management Policy updated December 1, 1999, provided that:
    (i) Use of only the following chemicals is included within this 
limit on the take prohibitions: Round Up, Rodeo, Garlon 3A, Surfactant 
LI-700, Napropamide, Cutrine Plus, and Aquashade.
    (ii) Any chemical use is initiated in accord with the priorities and 
decision processes of the Department's Pest Management Policy, including 
the Waterways Pest Management Policy, updated December 1, 1999.
    (iii) Any chemical use within a 25 ft. (7.5 m) buffer complies with 
the buffer application constraints contained in PP&R's Waterways Pest 
Management Policy (update December 1, 1999).
    (iv) Prior to implementing any changes to this limit, the PP&R 
provides NMFS with a copy of the proposed change for review and approval 
as within this limit.

[[Page 149]]

    (v) Prior to approving any substantive change in a program within 
this limit, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing the availability of the program or the draft changes for 
public review and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of no less than 30 days.
    (vi) NMFS' approval of amendments shall be a written approval by 
NMFS Northwest Regional Administrator.
    (vii) NMFS finds the PP&R Pest Management Program activities to be 
consistent with the conservation of listed salmonids' habitat by 
contributing to the attainment and maintenance of properly functioning 
condition (PFC). NMFS defines PFC as the sustained presence of a 
watershed's natural habitat-forming processes that are necessary for the 
long-term survival of salmonids through the full range of environmental 
variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must not impair properly 
functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the functioning of already 
impaired habitat, or retard the long-term progress of impaired habitat 
toward PFC. Periodically, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of an 
approved program in maintaining and achieving habitat function that 
provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. Whenever warranted, 
NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which the program needs 
to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be identified if the program 
is not protecting desired habitat functions, or where even with the 
habitat characteristics and functions originally targeted, habitat is 
not supporting population productivity levels needed to conserve the 
ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit does not make changes to 
respond adequately to the new information in the shortest amount of time 
feasible, but not longer than 1 year, NMFS will publish notification in 
the Federal Register announcing its intention to withdraw the limit so 
that take prohibitions would then apply to the program as to all other 
activity not within a limit. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of no less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a 
final determination whether to subject the activities to the ESA section 
9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (12) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(5) through 
(a)(10), and (a)(12) through (a)(19) do not apply to municipal, 
residential, commercial, and industrial (MRCI) development (including 
redevelopment) activities provided that:
    (i) Such development occurs pursuant to city, county, or regional 
government ordinances or plans that NMFS has determined are adequately 
protective of listed species; or within the jurisdiction of the Metro 
regional government in Oregon and pursuant to ordinances that Metro has 
found comply with its Urban Growth Management Functional Plan 
(Functional Plan) following a determination by NMFS that the Functional 
Plan is adequately protective. NMFS approval or determinations about any 
MRCI development ordinances or plans, including the Functional Plan, 
shall be a written approval by NMFS Northwest or Southwest Regional 
Administrator, whichever is appropriate. NMFS will apply the following 
12 evaluation considerations when reviewing MRCI development ordinances 
or plans to assess whether they adequately conserve listed salmonids by 
maintaining and restoring properly functioning habitat conditions:
    (A) MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that development will 
avoid inappropriate areas such as unstable slopes, wetlands, areas of 
high habitat value, and similarly constrained sites.
    (B) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately avoids stormwater 
discharge impacts to water quality and quantity or to the hydrograph of 
the watershed, including peak and base flows of perennial streams.
    (C) MRCI development ordinance or plan provides adequately 
protective riparian area management requirements to attain or maintain 
PFC around all rivers, estuaries, streams, lakes, deepwater habitats, 
and intermittent streams. Compensatory mitigation is provided, where 
necessary, to offset unavoidable damage to PFC due to MRCI

[[Page 150]]

development impacts to riparian management areas.
    (D) MRCI development ordinance or plan avoids stream crossings by 
roads, utilities, and other linear development wherever possible, and, 
where crossings must be provided, minimize impacts through choice of 
mode, sizing, and placement.
    (E) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects 
historical stream meander patterns and channel migration zones and 
avoids hardening of stream banks and shorelines.
    (F) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects wetlands 
and wetland functions, including isolated wetlands.
    (G) MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately preserves the 
hydrologic capacity of permanent and intermittent streams to pass peak 
flows.
    (H) MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate provisions 
for landscaping with native vegetation to reduce need for watering and 
application of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizer.
    (I) MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate provisions 
to prevent erosion and sediment run-off during construction.
    (J) MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that water supply 
demands can be met without impacting flows needed for threatened 
salmonids either directly or through groundwater withdrawals and that 
any new water diversions are positioned and screened in a way that 
prevents injury or death of salmonids.
    (K) MRCI development ordinance or plan provides necessary 
enforcement, funding, reporting, and implementation mechanisms and 
formal plan evaluations at intervals that do not exceed 5 years.
    (L) MRCI development ordinance and plan complies with all other 
state and Federal environmental and natural resource laws and permits.
    (ii) The city, county or regional government provides NMFS with 
annual reports regarding implementation and effectiveness of the 
ordinances, including: any water quality monitoring information the 
jurisdiction has available; aerial photography (or some other graphic 
display) of each MRCI development or MRCI expansion area at sufficient 
detail to demonstrate the width and vegetation condition of riparian 
set-backs; information to demonstrate the success of stormwater 
management and other conservation measures; and a summary of any flood 
damage, maintenance problems, or other issues.
    (iii) NMFS finds the MRCI development activity to be consistent with 
the conservation of listed salmonids' habitat when it contributes to the 
attainment and maintenance of PFC. NMFS defines PFC as the sustained 
presence of a watershed's habitat-forming processes that are necessary 
for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full range of 
environmental variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must not 
impair properly functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the functioning 
of already impaired habitat, or retard the long-term progress of 
impaired habitat toward PFC. Periodically, NMFS will evaluate an 
approved program for its effectiveness in maintaining and achieving 
habitat function that provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. 
Whenever warranted, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in which 
the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be 
identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat functions, 
or where even with the habitat characteristics and functions originally 
targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity levels 
needed to conserve the ESU. If any jurisdiction within the limit does 
not make changes to respond adequately to the new information in the 
shortest amount of time feasible, but not longer than 1 year, NMFS will 
publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions would then apply to the 
program as to all other activity not within a limit. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days, 
after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to subject the 
activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (iv) Prior to approving any city, county, or regional government 
ordinances or plans as within this limit, or approving any substantive 
change in

[[Page 151]]

an ordinance or plan within this limit, NMFS will publish notification 
in the Federal Register announcing the availability of the ordinance or 
plan or the draft changes for public review and comment. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days.
    (13) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec. 223.102 (a)(12), (a)(13), 
(a)(16), (a)(17), and (a) (19) do not apply to non-Federal forest 
management activities conducted in the State of Washington provided 
that:
    (i) The action is in compliance with forest practice regulations 
adopted and implemented by the Washington Forest Practices Board that 
NMFS has found are at least as protective of habitat functions as are 
the regulatory elements of the Forests and Fish Report dated April 29, 
1999, and submitted to the Forest Practices Board by a consortium of 
landowners, tribes, and state and Federal agencies.
    (ii) All non-regulatory elements of the Forests and Fish Report are 
being implemented.
    (iii) Actions involving use of herbicides, pesticides, or fungicides 
are not included within this limit.
    (iv) Actions taken under alternative plans are included in this 
limit provided that the Washington Department of Natural Resources 
(WDNR) finds that the alternate plans protect physical and biological 
processes at least as well as the state forest practices rules and 
provided that NMFS, or any resource agency or tribe NMFS designates, has 
the opportunity to review the plan at every stage of the development and 
implementation. A plan may be excluded from this limit if, after such 
review, WDNR determines that the plan is not likely to adequately 
protect listed salmon.
    (v) Prior to determining that regulations adopted by the Forest 
Practice Board are at least as protective as the elements of the Forests 
and Fish Report, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing the availability of the Report and regulations for public 
review and comment.
    (vi) NMFS finds the activities to be consistent with the 
conservation of listed salmonids' habitat by contributing to the 
attainment and maintenance of PFC. NMFS defines PFC as the sustained 
presence of a watershed's natural habitat-forming processes that are 
necessary for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full range 
of environmental variation. Actions that affect salmonid habitat must 
not impair properly functioning habitat, appreciably reduce the 
functioning of already impaired habitat, or retard the long-term 
progress of impaired habitat toward PFC. Programs must meet this 
biological standard in order for NMFS to find they qualify for a 
habitat-related limit. NMFS uses the best available science to make 
these determinations. NMFS may review and revise previous findings as 
new scientific information becomes available. NMFS will evaluate the 
effectiveness of the program in maintaining and achieving habitat 
function that provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. If the 
program is not adequate, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction ways in 
which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes may be 
identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat functions or 
where even with the habitat characteristics and functions originally 
targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity levels 
needed to conserve the ESU. If Washington does not make changes to 
respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit on activities associated with the program. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of no less than 30 days, 
after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to subject the 
activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) take prohibitions.
    (vii) NMFS approval of regulations shall be a written approval by 
NMFS Northwest Regional Administrator.
    (14) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102 (a)(20) through 
(a)(22) do not apply to activities specified in an application for a 
permit for scientific purposes or to enhance the conservation or 
survival of the species, provided that the application has been received 
by the

[[Page 152]]

Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), no later than April 9, 
2002. The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section apply to these 
activities upon the AA's rejection of the application as insufficient, 
upon issuance or denial of a permit, or September 9, 2002, whichever 
occurs earliest.
    (15) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102 (a)(3), and 
(a)(20) through (a)(22) do not apply to any employee or designee of 
NMFS, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, any Federal land 
management agency, the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), or 
of any other governmental entity that has co-management authority for 
the listed salmonids, when the employee or designee, acting in the 
course of his or her official duties, takes a threatened salmonid 
without a permit if such action is necessary to:
    (i) Aid a sick, injured, or stranded salmonid,
    (ii) Dispose of a dead salmonid, or
    (iii) Salvage a dead salmonid which may be useful for scientific 
study.
    (iv) Each agency acting under this limit on the take prohibitions of 
paragraph (a) of this section is to report to NMFS the numbers of fish 
handled and their status, on an annual basis. A designee of the listed 
entities is any individual the Federal or state fishery agency or other 
co-manager has authorized in writing to perform the listed functions.
    (16) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102 (a)(3), and 
(a)(20) through (a)(22) do not apply to fishery harvest activities 
provided that:
    (i) Fisheries are managed in accordance with a NMFS-approved Fishery 
Management and Evaluation Plan (FMEP) and implemented in accordance with 
a letter of concurrence from NMFS. NMFS will approve an FMEP only if it 
clearly defines its intended scope and area of impact and sets forth the 
management objectives and performance indicators for the plan. The plan 
must adequately address the following criteria:
    (A) Define populations within affected listed ESUs, taking into 
account spatial and temporal distribution, genetic and phenotypic 
diversity, and other appropriate identifiably unique biological and life 
history traits. Populations may be aggregated for management purposes 
when dictated by information scarcity, if consistent with survival and 
recovery of the listed ESU. In identifying management units, the plan 
shall describe the reasons for using such units in lieu of population 
units, describe how the management units are defined, given biological 
and life history traits, so as to maximize consideration of the 
important biological diversity contained within the listed ESU, respond 
to the scale and complexity of the ESU, and help ensure consistent 
treatment of listed salmonids across a diverse geographic and 
jurisdictional range.
    (B) Utilize the concepts of ``viable'' and ``critical'' salmonid 
population thresholds, consistent with the concepts contained in NMFS's 
technical report entitled ``Viable Salmonid Populations and the Recovery 
of ESUs'' (NMFS, 2000b). This report provides a framework for 
identifying the biological requirements of listed salmonids, assessing 
the effects of management and conservation actions, and ensuring that 
such actions provide for the survival and recovery of listed species. 
Proposed management actions must recognize the significant differences 
in risk associated with viable and critical population threshold states 
and respond accordingly to minimize the long-term risks to population 
persistence. Harvest actions impacting populations that are functioning 
at or above the viable threshold must be designed to maintain the 
population or management unit at or above that level. For populations 
shown with a high degree of confidence to be above critical levels but 
not yet at viable levels, harvest management must not appreciably slow 
the population's achievement of viable function. Harvest actions 
impacting populations that are functioning at or below critical 
threshold must not be allowed to appreciably increase genetic and 
demographic risks facing the population and must be designed to permit 
the population's achievement of viable function, unless the plan 
demonstrates that

[[Page 153]]

the likelihood of survival and recovery of the entire ESU in the wild 
would not be appreciably reduced by greater risks to that individual 
population.
    (C) Set escapement objectives or maximum exploitation rates for each 
management unit or population based on its status and on a harvest 
program that assures that those rates or objectives are not exceeded. 
Maximum exploitation rates must not appreciably reduce the likelihood of 
survival and recovery of the ESU. Management of fisheries where 
artificially propagated fish predominate must not compromise the 
management objectives for commingled naturally spawned populations.
    (D) Display a biologically based rationale demonstrating that the 
harvest management strategy will not appreciably reduce the likelihood 
of survival and recovery of the ESU in the wild, over the entire period 
of time the proposed harvest management strategy affects the population, 
including effects reasonably certain to occur after the proposed actions 
cease.
    (E) Include effective monitoring and evaluation programs to assess 
compliance, effectiveness, and parameter validation. At a minimum, 
harvest monitoring programs must collect catch and effort data, 
information on escapements, and information on biological 
characteristics, such as age, fecundity, size and sex data, and 
migration timing.
    (F) Provide for evaluating monitoring data and making any revisions 
of assumptions, management strategies, or objectives that data show are 
needed.
    (G) Provide for effective enforcement and education. Coordination 
among involved jurisdictions is an important element in ensuring 
regulatory effectiveness and coverage.
    (H) Include restrictions on resident and anadromous species 
fisheries that minimize any take of listed species, including time, 
size, gear, and area restrictions.
    (I) Be consistent with plans and conditions established within any 
Federal court proceeding with continuing jurisdiction over tribal 
harvest allocations.
    (ii) The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids 
occurring in its fisheries and provides to NMFS on a regular basis, as 
defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence for the FMEP, a report 
summarizing this information, as well as the implementation and 
effectiveness of the FMEP. The state shall provide NMFS with access to 
all data and reports prepared concerning the implementation and 
effectiveness of the FMEP.
    (iii) The state confers with NMFS on its fishing regulation changes 
affecting listed ESUs to ensure consistency with the approved FMEP. 
Prior to approving a new or amended FMEP, NMFS will publish notification 
in the Federal Register announcing its availability for public review 
and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a comment period on 
the draft FMEP of not less than 30 days.
    (iv) NMFS provides written concurrence of the FMEP which specifies 
the implementation and reporting requirements. NMFS' approval of a plan 
shall be a written approval by the NMFS' Southwest Regional 
Administrator. On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness 
of the program in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid 
productivity commensurate with conservation of the listed salmonids. If 
the program is deficient, NMFS will identify ways in which the program 
needs to be altered or strengthened. If the responsible agency does not 
make changes to respond adequately to the new information, NMFS will 
publish notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit for activities associated with that FMEP. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of not less than 30 days, 
after which NMFS will make a final determination whether to withdraw the 
limit so that the prohibitions would then apply to those fishery harvest 
activities. A template for developing FMEPs is available from NMFS' 
Southwest Region web site (http://swr.nmfs.noaa.gov).
    (v) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species listed in Sec.  223.102 (a)(20) do not apply to 
fishery harvest activities managed solely by the State of California 
until July 8, 2002.

[[Page 154]]

    (17) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102 (a)(3) and 
(a)(20) through (a)(22) do not apply to activity associated with 
artificial propagation programs provided that:
    (i) A state or Federal Hatchery and Genetics Management Plan (HGMP) 
has been approved by NMFS as meeting the following criteria:
    (A) The HGMP has clearly stated goals, performance objectives, and 
performance indicators that indicate the purpose of the program, its 
intended results, and measurements of its performance in meeting those 
results. Goals shall address whether the program is intended to meet 
conservation objectives, contribute to the ultimate sustainability of 
natural spawning populations, and/or is intended to augment tribal, 
recreational, or commercial fisheries. Objectives should enumerate the 
results desired from the program that will be used to measure the 
program's success or failure.
    (B) The HGMP utilizes the concepts of viable and critical salmonid 
population threshold, consistent with the concepts contained in NMFS' 
technical report entitled: ``Viable Salmonid Populations and Recovery of 
ESUs'' (NMFS, 2000b). Listed salmonids may be purposefully taken for 
broodstock purposes only if the donor population is currently at or 
above the viable threshold and the collection will not impair its 
function; if the donor population is not currently viable but the sole 
objective of the current collection program is to enhance the 
propagation or survival of the listed ESU; or if the donor population is 
shown with a high degree of confidence to be above critical threshold 
although not yet functioning at viable levels, and the collection will 
not appreciably slow the attainment of viable status for that 
population.
    (C) Broodstock collection programs reflect appropriate priorities 
taking into account health, abundances, and trends in the donor 
population. The primary purpose of broodstock collection programs of 
listed species is to re-establish indigenous salmonid populations for 
conservation purposes. Such programs include restoration of similar, at-
risk populations within the same ESU, and reintroduction of at-risk 
populations to underseeded habitat. After the species' conservation 
needs are met and when consistent with survival and recovery of the ESU, 
broodstock collection programs may be authorized by NMFS for secondary 
purposes such as to sustain tribal, recreational, and commercial 
fisheries.
    (D) The HGMP includes protocols to address fish health, broodstock 
collection, broodstock spawning, rearing and release of juveniles, 
deposition of hatchery adults, and catastrophic risk management.
    (E) The HGMP evaluates, minimizes, and accounts for the propagation 
program's genetic and ecological effects on natural populations, 
including disease transfer, competition, predation, and genetic 
introgression caused by the straying of hatchery fish.
    (F) The HGMP describes interrelationships and interdependencies with 
fisheries management. The combination of artificial propagation programs 
and harvest management must be designed to provide as many benefits and 
as few biological risks as possible for the listed species. For those 
programs of which the purpose is to sustain fisheries, HGMPs must not 
compromise the ability of FMEPs or other management plans to conserve 
listed salmonids.
    (G) The HGMP provides for adequate artificial propagation facilities 
to properly rear progeny of naturally spawned broodstock, to maintain 
population health and diversity, and to avoid hatchery-influenced 
selection or domestication.
    (H) The HGMP provides for adequate monitoring and evaluation to 
detect and evaluate the success of the hatchery program and any risks 
potentially impairing the recovery of the listed ESU.
    (I) The HGMP provides for evaluating monitoring data and making any 
revisions of assumptions, management strategies, or objectives that data 
show are needed;
    (J) NMFS provides written concurrence of the HGMP which specifies 
the

[[Page 155]]

implementation and reporting requirements. For federally operated or 
funded hatcheries, the ESA section 7 consultation will achieve this 
purpose.
    (ii) The state monitors the amount of take of listed salmonids 
occurring in its hatchery program and provides to NMFS on a regular 
basis a report summarizing this information, and the implementation and 
effectiveness of the HGMP as defined in NMFS' letter of concurrence. The 
state shall provide NMFS with access to all data and reports prepared 
concerning the implementation and effectiveness of the HGMP.
    (iii) The state confers with NMFS on a regular basis regarding 
intended collections of listed broodstock to ensure consistency with the 
approved HGMP.
    (iv) Prior to final approval of an HGMP, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing its availability for 
public review and comment for a period of at least 30 days.
    (v) NMFS' approval of an HGMP shall be a written approval by NMFS' 
Southwest Regional Administrator.
    (vi) On a regular basis, NMFS will evaluate the effectiveness of the 
HGMP in protecting and achieving a level of salmonid productivity 
commensurate with the conservation of the listed salmonids. If the HGMP 
is not effective, NMFS will identify to the responsible agency ways in 
which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. If the 
responsible agency does not make changes to respond adequately to the 
new information, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing its intention to withdraw the limit on activities associated 
with that program. Such an announcement will provide for a comment 
period of not less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a final 
determination whether to withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions 
would then apply to that program. A template for developing HGMPs is 
available from NMFS Northwest Region's web site (www.nwr.noaa.gov).
    (vii) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species listed in Sec.  223.102 (a)(20) do not apply to 
artificial propagation programs managed solely by the State of 
California until July 8, 2002.
    (18) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102(a)(3) and 
(a)(20) through (a)(22) do not apply to scientific research activities 
provided that:
    (i) Scientific research activities involving purposeful take are 
conducted by employees or contractors of CDFG or as a part of a 
monitoring and research program overseen by or coordinated with CDFG.
    (ii) CDFG provides for NMFS' review and approval a list of all 
scientific research activities involving direct take planned for the 
coming year, including an estimate of the total direct take that is 
anticipated, a description of the study design, including a 
justification for taking the species and a description of the techniques 
to be used, and a point of contact.
    (iii) CDFG annually provides to NMFS the results of scientific 
research activities directed at threatened salmonids, including a report 
of the direct take resulting from the studies and a summary of the 
results of such studies.
    (iv) Scientific research activities that may incidentally take 
threatened salmonids are either conducted by CDFG personnel, or are in 
accord with a permit issued by the CDFG.
    (v) CDFG provides NMFS annually, for its review and approval, a 
report listing all scientific research activities it conducts or permits 
that may incidentally take threatened salmonids during the coming year. 
Such reports shall also contain the amount of incidental take of 
threatened salmonids occurring in the previous year's scientific 
research activities and a summary of the results of such research.
    (vi) Electrofishing in any body of water known or suspected to 
contain threatened salmonids is conducted in accordance with NMFS' 
Guidelines for Electrofishing Waters Containing Salmonids Listed Under 
the Endangered Species Act (NMFS 2000a).
    (vii) NMFS' approval of a research program shall be a written 
approval by NMFS' Southwest Regional Administrator.

    (19) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102(a)(3) and 
(a)(20) through (a)(22) do not apply to habitat restoration activities, 
as defined in paragraph (b)(19)(iv), provided that the activity is part 
of a watershed conservation plan, and:
    (i) The watershed conservation plan has been certified by the State 
of California to be consistent with the state's watershed conservation 
plan guidelines.
    (ii) The State's watershed conservation plan guidelines have been 
found by NMFS to provide for plans that:
    (A) Take into account the potential severity of direct, indirect, 
and cumulative impacts of proposed activities in light of the status of 
affected species that are listed as threatened.
    (B) Will not reduce the likelihood of either survival or recovery of 
listed species in the wild.
    (C) Ensure that any taking will be incidental.
    (D) Minimize and mitigate any adverse impacts.
    (E) Provide for effective monitoring and adaptive management.
    (F) Use the best available science and technology, including 
watershed analysis.
    (G) Provide for public and scientific review and input.
    (H) Include any measures that NMFS determines are necessary or 
appropriate.
    (I) Include provisions that clearly identify those activities that 
are part of plan implementation.
    (J) Control risk to listed species by ensuring funding and 
implementation of the above plan components.
    (iii) NMFS will periodically review state certifications of 
watershed conservation plans to ensure adherence to approved watershed 
conservation plan guidelines.
    (iv) ``Habitat restoration activity'' is defined as an activity 
whose primary purpose is to restore natural aquatic or riparian habitat 
conditions or processes. ``Primary purpose'' means the activity would 
not be undertaken but for its restoration purpose.
    (v) Prior to approving state watershed conservation plan guidelines 
under paragraph (b)(19)(ii) of this section, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing the availability of the 
proposed guidelines for public review and comment. Such an announcement 
will provide for a comment period on the draft guidelines of not less 
than 30 days.
    (20) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102(a)(3) and 
(a)(20) through (a)(22) do not apply to the physical diversion of water 
from a stream or lake, provided that:
    (i) NMFS' engineering staff or any resource agency or tribe NMFS 
designates (authorized officer) has agreed in writing that the diversion 
facility is screened, maintained, and operated in compliance with NMFS' 
Southwest Region ``Fish Screening Criteria for Anadromous Salmonids, 
January 1997'' or with any subsequent revision.
    (ii) The owner or manager of the diversion allows any NMFS engineer 
or authorized officer access to the diversion facility for purposes of 
inspection and determination of continued compliance with the criteria.
    (iii) On a case-by-case basis, NMFS or an Authorized Officer will 
review and may approve a juvenile fish screen design and construction 
plan and schedule that the water diverter proposes for screen 
installation. The plan and schedule will describe interim operation 
measures to avoid take of threatened salmonids. NMFS may require a 
commitment of compensatory mitigation if implementation of the plan and 
schedule is terminated prior to completion. If the plan and schedule are 
not met, or if a schedule modification is made that is not approved by 
NMFS or the Authorized Officer, or if the screen installation deviates 
from the approved design, the water diversion will be subject to take 
prohibitions and mitigation.
    (iv) This limit on the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section 
does not include any impacts or take caused by reduced flows resulting 
from the diversion or impacts caused during installation of the 
diversion device. These impacts are subject to the prohibition on take 
of listed salmonids.

[[Page 157]]

    (21) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102 (a)(3) and 
(a)(20) through (a)(22) do not apply to routine road maintenance 
activities provided that:
    (i) The activity results from routine road maintenance conducted by 
employees or agents of the State of California, or any county, city or 
port in California, that complies with a program substantially similar 
to that contained in the Oregon Department of Transportation's (ODOT) 
Transportation Maintenance Management System Water Quality and Habitat 
Guide (July, 1999) or that is determined to meet or exceed the 
protections provided by the ODOT Guide; or by employees or agents of the 
State of California or any county, city or port in California that 
complies with a routine road maintenance program that meets proper 
functioning habitat conditions as described further in paragraph 
(a)(21)(ii) of this section. NMFS' approval of state, city, county, or 
port programs that are equivalent to the ODOT program, or of any 
amendments, shall be a written approval by NMFS' Southwest Regional 
Administrator. Any jurisdiction desiring its routine road maintenance 
activities to be considered within this limit must first commit in 
writing to apply management practices that result in protections 
equivalent to or better than those provided by the ODOT Guide, detailing 
how it will assure adequate training, tracking, and reporting, and 
describing in detail any dust abatement practices it requests to be 
covered.
    (ii) NMFS finds the routine road maintenance activities of the State 
of California, or any city, county, or port, to be consistent with the 
conservation of threatened salmonids' habitat when it contributes to the 
attainment and maintenance of properly functioning condition (PFC). NMFS 
defines PFC as the sustained presence of natural habitat-forming 
processes that are necessary for the long-term survival of salmonids 
through the full range of environmental variation. Actions that affect 
salmonid habitat must not impair properly functioning habitat, 
appreciably reduce the functioning of already impaired habitat, or 
retard the long-term progress of impaired habitat toward PFC. 
Periodically, NMFS will evaluate an approved program for its 
effectiveness in maintaining and achieving habitat function that 
provides for conservation of the listed salmonids. Whenever warranted, 
NMFS will identify ways in which the program needs to be altered or 
strengthened. Changes may be identified if the program is not protecting 
desired habitat functions, or where even with the habitat 
characteristics and functions originally targeted, habitat is not 
supporting population productivity levels needed to conserve the 
threatened ESUs. If any jurisdiction within the limit does not make 
changes to respond adequately to the new information in the shortest 
amount of time feasible, but not longer than 1 year, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing its intention to 
withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions would then apply to the 
program. Such an announcement will provide for a comment period of not 
less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a final determination 
whether to subject the activities to the ESA section 9(a)(1) 
prohibitions.
    (iii) Prior to implementing any changes to a program within this 
limit the jurisdiction provides NMFS a copy of the proposed change for 
review and approval as to being within this limit.
    (iv) Prior to approving any State of California, city, county, or 
port program as being within this limit, or approving any substantive 
change in a program as being within this limit, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register announcing the availability of the 
program or the draft changes for public review and comment. Such an 
announcement will provide for a comment period of not less than 30 days.
    (v) Pesticide and herbicide spraying is not included within this 
limit, even if in accord with the ODOT guidance.
    (22) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section relating to 
threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102 (a)(3) and 
(a)(20) through (a)(22) do not

[[Page 158]]

apply to municipal, residential, commercial, and industrial (MRCI) 
development (including redevelopment) activities provided that:
    (i) Such development occurs pursuant to city, county, or regional 
government ordinances or plans that NMFS has determined are adequately 
protective of threatened species by maintaining or restoring properly 
functioning habitat conditions. NMFS approval or determinations about 
any MRCI development ordinances or plans shall be a written approval by 
the NMFS Southwest Regional Administrator. NMFS will apply the following 
12 evaluation considerations when reviewing MRCI development ordinances 
or plans to assess whether they adequately conserve threatened salmonids 
by maintaining and restoring properly functioning habitat conditions:
    (A) The MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that development 
will avoid inappropriate areas such as unstable slopes, wetlands, areas 
of high habitat value, and similarly constrained sites.
    (B) The MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately avoids 
stormwater discharge impacts to water quality and quantity or to the 
hydrograph of the watershed, including peak and base flows of perennial 
streams.
    (C) The MRCI development ordinance or plan provides adequately 
protective riparian area management requirements to attain or maintain 
PFC around all rivers, estuaries, streams, lakes, deepwater habitats, 
and intermittent streams. Compensatory mitigation is provided, where 
necessary, to offset unavoidable damage to properly functioning habitat 
conditions caused by MRCI development impacts to riparian management 
areas.
    (D) The MRCI development ordinance or plan avoids stream crossings 
by roads, utilities, and other linear development wherever possible, 
and, where crossings must be provided, minimizes impacts through choice 
of mode, sizing, and placement.
    (E) The MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects 
historical stream meander patterns and channel migration zones and 
avoids hardening of stream banks and shorelines.
    (F) The MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately protects 
wetlands and wetland functions, including isolated wetlands.
    (G) The MRCI development ordinance or plan adequately preserves the 
hydrologic capacity of permanent and intermittent streams to pass peak 
flows.
    (H) The MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate 
provisions for landscaping with native vegetation to reduce need for 
watering and application of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizer.
    (I) The MRCI development ordinance or plan includes adequate 
provisions to prevent erosion and sediment run-off during construction.
    (J) The MRCI development ordinance or plan ensures that water supply 
demands can be met without impacting flows needed for threatened 
salmonids either directly or through groundwater withdrawals and that 
any new water diversions are positioned and screened in a way that 
prevents injury or death of salmonids.
    (K) The MRCI development ordinance or plan provides necessary 
enforcement, funding, reporting, and implementation mechanisms and 
formal plan evaluations at intervals that do not exceed 5 years.
    (L) The MRCI development ordinance and plan complies with all other 
state and Federal environmental and natural resource laws and permits.
    (ii) The city, county or regional government provides NMFS with 
annual reports regarding implementation and effectiveness of the 
ordinances, including: any water quality monitoring information the 
jurisdiction has available; aerial photography (or some other graphic 
display) of each MRCI development or MRCI expansion area at sufficient 
detail to demonstrate the width and vegetation condition of riparian 
set-backs; information to demonstrate the success of stormwater 
management and other conservation measures; and a summary of any flood 
damage, maintenance problems, or other issues.
    (iii) NMFS finds the MRCI development activity to be consistent with 
the conservation of threatened salmonids' habitat when it contributes to 
the attainment and maintenance of properly functioning habitat 
conditions. For

[[Page 159]]

this purpose, NMFS defines properly functioning habitat conditions as 
the sustained presence of a watershed's habitat-forming processes that 
are necessary for the long-term survival of salmonids through the full 
range of environmental variation. To contribute to the attainment and 
maintenance of properly functioning habitat conditions, activities that 
affect salmonid habitat must not impair properly functioning habitat, 
appreciably reduce the functioning of already impaired habitat, or 
retard the long-term progress of impaired habitat toward achieving 
properly functioning habitat conditions. Periodically, NMFS will 
evaluate an approved program for its effectiveness in maintaining and 
achieving habitat function that provides for conservation of the listed 
salmonids. Whenever warranted, NMFS will identify to the jurisdiction 
ways in which the program needs to be altered or strengthened. Changes 
may be identified if the program is not protecting desired habitat 
functions, or where even with the habitat characteristics and functions 
originally targeted, habitat is not supporting population productivity 
levels needed to conserve the threatened species. If any jurisdiction 
within the limit does not make changes to respond adequately to the new 
information in the shortest amount of time feasible, but not longer than 
1 year, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
announcing its intention to withdraw the limit so that take prohibitions 
would then apply to the program. Such an announcement will provide for a 
comment period of not less than 30 days, after which NMFS will make a 
final determination whether to subject the activities to the ESA section 
9(a)(1) prohibitions.
    (iv) Prior to approving any city, county, or regional government 
ordinances or plans as being within this limit, or approving any 
substantive change in an ordinance or plan as being within this limit, 
NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register announcing the 
availability of the ordinance or plan or the draft changes for public 
review and comment. Such an announcement will provide for a comment 
period of not less than 30 days.
    (c) Affirmative Defense. In connection with any action alleging a 
violation of the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section with 
respect to the threatened species of salmonids listed in Sec.  223.102 
(a)(3), (a)(5) through (a)(10) and (a)(12) through (a)(22), any person 
claiming the benefit of any limit listed in paragraph (b) of this 
section or Sec.  223.209(a) shall have a defense where the person can 
demonstrate that the limit is applicable and was in force, and that the 
person fully complied with the limit at the time of the alleged 
violation. This defense is an affirmative defense that must be raised, 
pleaded, and proven by the proponent. If proven, this defense will be an 
absolute defense to liability under section 9(a)(1)(G) of the ESA with 
respect to the alleged violation.
    (d) Severability. The provisions of this section and the various 
applications thereof are distinct and severable from one another. If any 
provision or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is 
stayed or determined to be invalid, such stay or invalidity shall not 
affect other provisions, or the application of such provisions to other 
persons or circumstances, which can be given effect without the stayed 
or invalid provision or application.

the coast, and in the bay, estuarine or freshwater fisheries regulated 
under the sole authority of the State of Oregon is not prohibited, if 
the take results from a fisheries harvest program conducted in 
accordance with the Oregon Coastal Salmon Restoration Initiative of 
March 1997 (OCSRI). NMFS must have issued a written concurrence that the 
fisheries regulations are consistent with the OCSRI, using information 
provided through the April 1997 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between 
the State of Oregon and NMFS.
    (2) Incidental take of SONCC coho salmon in ocean fisheries within 3 
miles (approximately 5 km) of the coast that are regulated under the 
sole authority of the State of California is not prohibited, provided 
that the ocean salmon fishing regulations adopted by the California Fish 
and Game Commission and CDFG for recreational and commercial fisheries 
within 3 miles (approximately 5 km) of the coast are consistent with the 
Pacific Fishery Management Council's Fishery Management Plan for Ocean 
Salmon Fisheries and the annual ocean salmon fishing regulations issued 
by the Secretary of Commerce for the Federal EEZ.
    (3) Take of SONCC coho salmon in a hatchery program regulated under 
the sole authority of the State of Oregon is not prohibited, if the take 
results from a hatchery program conducted in accordance with the OCSRI, 
and the take is counted against the total allocation of harvest-related 
mortality as specified in the OCSRI. NMFS must have issued a written 
concurrence stating that the hatchery program is consistent with the 
OCSRI including the hatchery and genetic management plan adopted 
pursuant to the OCSRI, using information provided through the MOA.
    (4) Take of SONCC coho salmon in fisheries research and monitoring 
activities conducted in California and Oregon is not prohibited provided 
that:
    (i) Research and monitoring involving directed take of coho salmon 
is conducted by CDFG personnel (in California) and ODFW personnel (in 
Oregon);
    (ii) The CDFG and ODFW, respectively, provide NMFS with a list of 
all research and monitoring activities involving coho salmon directed 
take planned for the coming year for NMFS' review and approval. This 
report shall include an estimate of the total directed take that is 
anticipated, a description of the study design, including a 
justification for taking the species and a description of the techniques 
to be used, and a point of contact;
    (iii) The CDFG and ODFW, respectively, provide NMFS annually with 
the results of research and monitoring studies directed at SONCC coho 
salmon, including a report of the directed take resulting from the 
studies;
    (iv) The CDFG and ODFW, provide NMFS annually with a list of all 
research and monitoring studies permitted that may allow incidental take 
of listed coho salmon during the coming year and report the level of 
incidental take of listed coho salmon from the previous year's research 
and monitoring activities, for NMFS' review and approval.
    (v) The research and monitoring activities do not include the use of 
electrofishing in any body of water known or suspected to contain coho 
salmon.
    (5) Incidental take of the SONCC coho salmon in Oregon resulting 
from a habitat restoration activity is not prohibited, provided that:
    (i) The activity is conducted pursuant to a watershed action or 
restoration plan that has been affirmed by the state in writing as 
consistent with NMFS' approved state watershed plan guidelines set forth 
in Sec. 222.307(c) of this chapter. NMFS shall also concur in writing 
that the plan is consistent with the state watershed plan guidelines; or
    (ii) Until a watershed action or restoration plan is approved by 
both Oregon and NMFS as described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this 
section, or until August 18, 1999, whichever occurs first, the ODFW has 
made a written finding that the activity is consistent with

[[Page 161]]

state restoration activity guidelines that NMFS has agreed, in writing, 
meet the standards set forth in Sec. 222.307(c) of this chapter.
    (6) Incidental take of the SONCC coho salmon in California resulting 
from a habitat restoration activity, as defined in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) 
of this section, is not prohibited, provided that California has a 
program in effect that NMFS finds will assure technically supported 
watershed assessments and coordinated long-term monitoring strategies 
for watershed protection plans and activities and:
    (i) The activity is conducted pursuant to a watershed protection 
plan that CDFG has affirmed, in writing, is consistent with NMFS' 
approved state watershed plan guidelines set forth in Sec. 222.307(c) of 
this chapter for California's Watershed Protection Program. NMFS must 
concur, in writing, that the plan is consistent with those guidelines; 
or
    (ii) Until a watershed protection or restoration plan is certified 
by the State of California and NMFS as described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) 
of this section, or until August 18, 1999, whichever occurs first, when 
NMFS has made a written finding that the activity is consistent with 
State of California conservation guidelines previously found to meet the 
standards set forth in Sec. 222.307(c) of this chapter by NMFS.

<R05>
Sec. 223.206  Exceptions to prohibitions relating to sea turtles.

    (a) Permits--(1) Scientific research, education, zoological 
exhibition, or species enhancement permits. The Assistant Administrator 
may issue permits authorizing activities which would otherwise be 
prohibited under Sec. 223.205(a) for scientific or educational purposes, 
for zoological exhibition, or to enhance the propagation or survival of 
threatened species of sea turtles, in accordance with and subject to the 
conditions of part 222, subpart C--General Permit Procedures.
    (2) Incidental-take permits. The Assistant Administrator may issue 
permits authorizing activities that would otherwise be prohibited under 
Sec. 223.205(a) in accordance with section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act (16 
U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(B)), and in accordance with, and subject to, the 
implementing regulations in part 222 of this chapter. Such permits may 
be issued for the incidental taking of threatened and endangered species 
of sea turtles.
    (b) Exception for injured, dead, or stranded specimens. If any 
member of any threatened species of sea turtle is found injured, dead, 
or stranded, any agent or employee of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, or any 
other Federal land or water management agency, or any agent or employee 
of a state agency responsible for fish and wildlife who is designated by 
his or her agency for such purposes, may, when acting in the course of 
his or her official duties, take such specimens without a permit if such 
taking is necessary to aid a sick, injured, or stranded specimen or 
dispose of a dead specimen or salvage a dead specimen which may be 
useful for scientific study. Whenever possible, live specimens shall be 
returned to their aquatic environment as soon as possible. Every action 
shall be reported in writing to the Assistant Administrator within 30 
days, and reports of further occurrence shall be made as deemed 
appropriate by the Assistant Administrator until the specimen is either 
returned to its environment or disposed of. Reports shall be mailed by 
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Assistant 
Administrator and shall contain the following information:
    (1) Name and position of the official or employee involved;
    (2) Description of the specimen(s) involved;
    (3) Date and location of disposal;
    (4) Circumstances requiring the action;
    (5) Method of disposal;
    (6) Disposition of the specimen(s), including, where the specimen(s) 
has been retained in captivity, a description of the place and means of 
confinement, and the measures taken for its maintenance and care; and
    (7) Such other information as the Assistant Administrator may 
require.
    (c) Exception for research or conservation. Any employee or agent of 
the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, or 
a state fish and wildlife agency operating a conservation program 
pursuant to the terms of a Cooperative Agreement with the National 
Marine Fisheries Service or the Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance 
with section 6(c) of the Act, designated by his or her agency for such 
purposes, may, when acting in the course of his or her official duties, 
take

[[Page 163]]

any threatened species to carry out scientific research or conservation 
programs. All such takings shall be reported within 30 days of the 
taking to the Assistant Administrator who may request additional reports 
of the taking and research at the Assistant Administrator's discretion.
    (d) Exception for incidental taking. The prohibitions against taking 
in Sec. 223.205(a) do not apply to the incidental take of any member of 
a threatened species of sea turtle (i.e., a take not directed toward 
such member) during fishing or scientific research activities, to the 
extent that those involved are in compliance with all applicable 
requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section, or in 
compliance with the terms and conditions of an incidental take permit 
issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) Handling and resuscitation requirements. (i) Any specimen taken 
incidentally during the course of fishing or scientific research 
activities must be handled with due care to prevent injury to live 
specimens, observed for activity, and returned to the water according to 
the following procedures:
    (A) Sea turtles that are actively moving or determined to be dead as 
described in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) of this section must be released 
over the stern of the boat. In addition, they must be released only when 
fishing or scientific collection gear is not in use, when the engine 
gears are in neutral position, and in areas where they are unlikely to 
be recaptured or injured by vessels.
    (B) Resuscitation must be attempted on sea turtles that are 
comatose, or inactive, as determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, by:
    (1) Placing the turtle on its bottom shell (plastron) so that the 
turtle is right side up and elevating its hindquarters at least 6 inches 
(15.2 cm) for a period of 4 up to 24 hours. The amount of the elevation 
depends on the size of the turtle; greater elevations are needed for 
larger turtles. Periodically, rock the turtle gently left to right and 
right to left by holding the outer edge of the shell (carapace) and 
lifting one side about 3 inches (7.6 cm) then alternate to the other 
side. Gently touch the eye and pinch the tail (reflex test) periodically 
to see if there is a response.
    (2) Sea turtles being resuscitated must be shaded and kept damp or 
moist but under no circumstance be placed into a container holding 
water. A water-soaked towel placed over the head, carapace, and flippers 
is the most effective method in keeping a turtle moist.
    (3) Sea turtles that revive and become active must be released over 
the stern of the boat only when fishing or scientific collection gear is 
not in use, when the engine gears are in neutral position, and in areas 
where they are unlikely to be recaptured or injured by vessels. Sea 
turtles that fail to respond to the reflex test or fail to move within 4 
hours (up to 24, if possible) must be returned to the water in the same 
manner as that for actively moving turtles.
    (C) A turtle is determined to be dead if the muscles are stiff 
(rigor mortis) and/or the flesh has begun to rot; otherwise the turtle 
is determined to be comatose or inactive and resuscitation attempts are 
necessary.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section, a person aboard a pelagic longline vessel in the Atlantic 
issued an Atlantic permit for highly pelagic species under 50 CFR 635.4, 
must follow the handling and resuscitation requirements in 50 CFR 
635.21.
    (iii) Any specimen taken incidentally during the course of fishing 
or scientific research activities must not be consumed, sold, landed, 
offloaded, transshipped, or kept below deck.
    (2) Gear requirements--(i) TED requirement for shrimp trawlers. Any 
shrimp trawler that is in the Atlantic Area or Gulf Area must have an 
approved TED installed in each net that is rigged for fishing. A net is 
rigged for fishing if it is in the water, or if it is shackled, tied, or 
otherwise connected to any trawl door or board, or to any tow rope, 
cable, pole or extension, either on board or attached in any manner to 
the shrimp trawler. Exceptions to the TED requirement for shrimp 
trawlers are provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Exemptions from the TED requirement--(A) Alternative tow-time 
restrictions. A shrimp trawler is exempt from

[[Page 164]]

the TED requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section if it 
complies with the alternative tow-time restrictions in paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section and if it:
    (1) Has on board no power or mechanical-advantage trawl retrieval 
system (i.e., any device used to haul any part of the net aboard);
    (2) Is a bait shrimper that retains all live shrimp on board in a 
container with a circulating seawater system, if it does not possess 
more than 32 pounds (14.5 kg) of dead shrimp on board, and if it has on 
board a valid original state bait-shrimp license (if in a state that 
requires such a license);
    (3) Has only a pusher-head trawl, skimmer trawl, or wing net rigged 
for fishing;
    (4) Is in an area during a period for which tow-time restrictions 
apply under paragraphs (d)(3) (ii) or (iii) of this section, if it 
complies with all applicable provisions imposed under those paragraphs.
    (B) Exempted gear or activities. The following fishing gear or 
activities are exempted from the TED requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) 
of this section:
    (1) A single test net (try net) with a headrope length of 12 ft (3.6 
m) or less and with a footrope length of 15 ft (4.6 m) or less, if it is 
either pulled immediately in front of another net or is not connected to 
another net in any way, if no more than one test net is used at a time, 
and if it is not towed as a primary net;
    (2) A beam or roller trawl, if the frame is outfitted with rigid 
vertical bars, and if none of the spaces between the bars, or between 
the bars and the frame, exceeds 4 inches (10.2 cm); and
    (3) A shrimp trawler fishing for, or possessing, royal red shrimp, 
if royal red shrimp constitutes at least 90 percent (by weight) of all 
shrimp either found on board, or offloaded from that shrimp trawler.
    (iii) Gear requirement--summer flounder trawlers--(A) TED 
requirement. (1) Any summer flounder trawler in the summer flounder 
fishery-sea turtle protection area must have an approved TED installed 
in each net that is rigged for fishing. A net is rigged for fishing if 
it is in the water, or if it is shackled, tied, or otherwise connected 
to any trawl door or board, or to any tow rope, cable, pole or 
extension, either on board or attached in any manner to the summer 
flounder trawler. Exceptions to the TED requirement for summer flounder 
trawlers are provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (2) Any approved hard TED or special hard TED installed in a summer 
flounder trawl must be installed in a TED extension. The TED extension 
is a cylindrical piece of webbing distinct from the main trawl's body, 
wings, codend, and any other net extension(s). The TED extension must be 
constructed of webbing no larger than 3.5 inch (8.9 cm) stretched mesh. 
The TED extension must extend at least 24 inches (61.0 cm) but not more 
than 36 inches (91.4 cm) forward of the leading edge of the TED and aft 
of the trailing edge of the grid.
    (B) Exemptions from the TED requirement. Any summer flounder trawler 
north of 35[deg]46.1[min] N. lat. (Oregon Inlet, NC) from January 15 
through March 15 annually is exempt from the TED requirement of 
paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, unless the Assistant 
Administrator determines that TED use is necessary to protect sea 
turtles or ensure compliance, pursuant to the procedures of paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section.
    (C) Monitoring. Summer flounder trawlers must carry onboard a NMFS-
approved observer if requested by the Southeast Regional Administrator 
or the Northeast Regional Administrator. A written notification will be 
sent to the address specified for the vessel in either the NMFS or state 
fishing permit application, or to the address specified for registration 
or documentation purposes, or upon written notification otherwise served 
on the owner or operator of the vessel. Owners and operators must comply 
with the terms and conditions specified in such written notification. 
All NMFS-approved observers will report any violations of this section, 
or other applicable regulations and laws. Information collected by 
observers may be used for enforcement purposes.
    (D) Additional sea turtle conservation measures. The Assistant 
Administrator may impose other such restrictions upon summer flounder 
trawlers as the

[[Page 165]]

Assistant Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to protect sea 
turtles and ensure compliance, pursuant to the procedures of paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section. Such measures may include, but are not limited 
to, a requirement to use TEDs in areas other than summer flounder 
fishery-sea turtle protection area, a requirement to use limited tow-
times, and closure of the fishery.
    (iv) Gear requirement--leatherback conservation zone--(A) 
Leatherback surveys. From January 1 through June 30 of each year, weekly 
aerial surveys will be conducted in the leatherback conservation zone by 
NMFS or state agents, contingent upon weather conditions. If sighting 
rates of greater than 10 leatherback turtles per 50 nautical miles (92.6 
km) of trackline are observed, the aerial surveys of that area will be 
replicated within 24 hours, or as soon as practicable thereafter.
    (B) TED requirements and registration. If surveys pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section indicate a sighting rate within 
the leatherback conservation zone of greater than 10 leatherback sea 
turtles per 50 nautical miles (92.6 km) of trackline, NMFS will close an 
area of the leatherback conservation zone encompassing all, or a portion 
of, inshore waters and offshore waters 10 nautical miles (18.5 km) 
seaward of the COLREGS demarcation line, bounded by 1[deg] lat. 
coinciding with the trackline, within the leatherback conservation zone. 
This closure will be for a 2-week period. Within such a closed area, 
fishing by any shrimp trawler required to have a NMFS-approved TED in 
each net rigged for fishing is prohibited, unless the TED installed is 
one described at Sec.  223.207(a)(7)(ii)(B) or Sec.  
223.207(c)(1)(iv)(B), and the owner or operator of the shrimp trawl has 
notified the Southeast Regional Administrator of his or her intention to 
fish in that area, in accordance with the procedure provided in 
paragraph (d)(5) of this section. If requested in writing from the 
Southeast Regional Administrator, owners and operators of shrimp 
trawlers in the leatherback conservation zone must carry NMFS-approved 
observers aboard such vessel(s). A shrimp trawler in the leatherback 
conservation zone must comply with the terms and conditions specified in 
such written request, as well as provide information on trawling hours, 
gear modifications, and turtle captures.
    (C) Notification. NMFS will immediately announce specific area 
closures on the NOAA weather radio channel, in newspapers, and other 
media. Specific area closures will be effective upon filing for public 
inspection at the Office of the Federal Register. Owners and operators 
of shrimp trawl vessels in the leatherback conservation zone are 
responsible for monitoring the NOAA weather radio channel for closure 
announcements. Shrimp trawlers may also call the Southeast Regional 
Office at (813) 570-5312 to receive updated area closure information.
    (v) Gear requirement--pound net leaders--(A) Restrictions on pound 
net leaders. During the time period of May 8 through June 30 of each 
year, any pound net leader in the waters described in paragraph 
(d)(2)(v)(B) of this section must have a mesh size less than 12 inches 
(30.5 cm) stretched mesh and may not employ stringers. Any pound net 
leader with stretched mesh measuring 12 inches (30.5 cm) or greater or 
any pound net leader with stringers must be removed from the waters 
described in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(B) of this section prior to May 8 of 
each year and may not be reset until July 1 of each year unless that 
date is extended by the AA pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(v)(E) of this 
section.
    (B) Regulated waters. The restrictions on pound net leaders 
described in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section apply to the 
following waters: the Virginia waters of the mainstem Chesapeake Bay 
from the Maryland-Virginia State line (approximately 37[deg] 55' N. 
lat., 75[deg] 55' W. long.) to the COLREGS line at the mouth of the 
Chesapeake Bay; the James River downstream of the Hampton Roads Bridge 
Tunnel (I-64; approximately 36[deg] 59.55' N. lat., 76[deg] 18.64' W. 
long.); the York River downstream of the Coleman Memorial Bridge (Route 
17; approximately 37[deg] 14.55' N. lat, 76[deg] 30.40' W. long.); and 
the Rappahannock River downstream of the Robert Opie Norris Jr. Bridge 
(Route 3; approximately 37[deg] 37.44' N. lat, 76[deg] 25.40' W. long.).

[[Page 166]]

    (C) Reporting requirement. At any time during the year, if a turtle 
is taken live and uninjured in a pound net operation, in the pound or in 
the leader, the operator of vessel must report the incident to the NMFS 
Northeast Regional Office, (978) 281-9388 or fax (978) 281-9394, within 
24 hours of returning from the trip in which the incidental take 
occurred. The report shall include a description of the turtle's 
condition at the time of release and the measures taken as required in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. At any time during the year, if a 
turtle is taken in a pound net operation, and is determined to be 
injured, or if a turtle is captured dead, the operator of the vessel 
shall immediately notify NMFS Northeast Regional Office and the 
appropriate rehabilitation or stranding network, as determined by NMFS 
Northeast Regional Office.
    (D) Monitoring. Pound net fishing operations must be observed by a 
NMFS-approved observer if requested by the Northeast Regional 
Administrator. All NMFS-approved observers will report any violations of 
this section, or other applicable regulations and laws. Information 
collected by observers may be used for law enforcement purposes.
    (E) Expedited modification of restrictions and effective dates. From 
May 8 to June 30 of each year, if NMFS receives information that one sea 
turtle is entangled alive or that one sea turtle is entangled dead, and 
NMFS determines that the entanglement contributed to its death, in pound 
net leaders that are in compliance with the restrictions described in 
paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section on pound net leaders in the 
waters identified in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(B) of this section, the AA may 
issue a final rule modifying the restrictions on pound net leaders as 
necessary to protect threatened sea turtles. Such modifications may 
include, but are not limited to, reducing the maximum allowable mesh 
size of pound net leaders and prohibiting the use of pound net leaders 
regardless of mesh size. In addition, if information indicates that a 
significant level of sea turtle strandings will likely continue beyond 
June 30, the AA may issue a final rule extending the effective date of 
the restrictions, including any additional restrictions imposed under 
this subparagraph, for an additional 30 days, but not beyond July 30, to 
protect threatened sea turtles.
    (3) Tow-time restrictions--(i) Duration of tows. If tow-time 
restrictions are utilized pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii), 
or (d)(3)(iii) of this section, a shrimp trawler must limit tow times. 
The tow time is measured from the time that the trawl door enters the 
water until it is removed from the water. For a trawl that is not 
attached to a door, the tow time is measured from the time the codend 
enters the water until it is removed from the water. Tow times may not 
exceed:
    (A) 55 minutes from April 1 through October 31; and
    (B) 75 minutes from November 1 through March 31.
    (ii) Alternative--special environmental conditions. The Assistant 
Administrator may allow compliance with tow-time restrictions, as an 
alternative to the TED requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section, if the Assistant Administrator determines that the presence of 
algae, seaweed, debris or other special environmental conditions in a 
particular area makes trawling with TED-equipped nets impracticable.
    (iii) Substitute--ineffectiveness of TEDs. The Assistant 
Administrator may require compliance with tow-time restrictions, as a 
substitute for the TED requirement of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this 
section, if the Assistant Administrator determines that TEDs are 
ineffective in protecting sea turtles.
    (iv) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator 
will publish notification concerning any tow-time restriction imposed 
under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section in the Federal 
Register and will announce it in summary form on channel 16 of the 
marine VHF radio. A notification of tow-time restrictions will include 
findings in support of these restrictions as an alternative to, or as 
substitute for, the TED requirements. The notification will specify the 
effective dates, the geographic area where tow-time restrictions apply, 
and any applicable conditions or restrictions that the Assistant 
Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to protect sea 
turtles and ensure compliance, including, but not limited to, a

[[Page 167]]

requirement to carry observers, to register vessels in accordance with 
procedures at paragraph (d)(5) of this section, or for all shrimp 
trawlers in the area to synchronize their tow times so that all trawl 
gear remains out of the water during certain times. A notification 
withdrawing tow-time restrictions will include findings in support of 
that action.
    (v) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the 
appropriate fishery officials (state or Federal) where the affected 
shrimp fishery is located in issuing a notification concerning tow-time 
restrictions. An emergency notification can be effective for a period of 
up to 30 days and may be renewed for additional periods of up to 30 days 
each if the Assistant Administrator finds that the conditions 
necessitating the imposition of tow-time restrictions continue to exist. 
The Assistant Administrator may invite comments on such an action, and 
may withdraw or modify the action by following procedures similar to 
those for implementation. The Assistant Administrator will implement any 
permanent tow-time restriction through rulemaking.
    (4) Limitations on incidental takings during fishing activities--(i) 
Limitations. The exemption for incidental takings of sea turtles in 
paragraph (d) of this section does not authorize incidental takings 
during fishing activities if the takings:
    (A) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an 
incidental take statement or biological opinion;
    (B) Would violate the restrictions, terms, or conditions of an 
incidental take permit; or
    (C) May be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a species 
listed under the Act.
    (ii) Determination; restrictions on fishing activities. The 
Assistant Administrator may issue a determination that incidental 
takings during fishing activities are unauthorized. Pursuant thereto, 
the Assistant Administrator may restrict fishing activities in order to 
conserve a species listed under the Act, including, but not limited to, 
restrictions on the fishing activities of vessels subject to paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section. The Assistant Administrator will take such 
action if the Assistant Administrator determines that restrictions are 
necessary to avoid unauthorized takings that may be likely to jeopardize 
the continued existence of a listed species. The Assistant Administrator 
may withdraw or modify a determination concerning unauthorized takings 
or any restriction on fishing activities if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that such action is warranted.
    (iii) Notice; applicability; conditions. The Assistant Administrator 
will publish a notification of a determination concerning unauthorized 
takings or a notification concerning the restriction of fishing 
activities in the Federal Register. The Assistant Administrator will 
provide as much advance notice as possible, consistent with the 
requirements of the Act, and will announce the notification in summary 
form on channel 16 of the marine VHF radio. Notification of a 
determination concerning unauthorized takings will include findings in 
support of that determination; specify the fishery, including the target 
species and gear used by the fishery, the area, and the times, for which 
incidental takings are not authorized; and include such other conditions 
and restrictions as the Assistant Administrator determines are necessary 
or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance. 
Notification of restriction of fishing activities will include findings 
in support of the restriction, will specify the time and area where the 
restriction is applicable, and will specify any applicable conditions or 
restrictions that the Assistant Administrator determines are necessary 
or appropriate to protect sea turtles and ensure compliance. Such 
conditions and restrictions may include, but are not limited to, 
limitations on the types of fishing gear that may be used, tow-time 
restrictions, alteration or extension of the periods of time during 
which particular tow-time requirements apply, requirements to use TEDs, 
registration of vessels in accordance with procedures at paragraph 
(d)(5) of this section, and requirements to provide observers. 
Notification of withdrawal or modification will include findings in 
support of that action.

[[Page 168]]

    (iv) Procedures. The Assistant Administrator will consult with the 
appropriate fisheries officials (state or Federal) where the fishing 
activities are located in issuing notification of a determination 
concerning unauthorized takings or notification concerning the 
restriction of fishing activities. An emergency notification will be 
effective for a period of up to 30 days and may be renewed for 
additional periods of up to 30 days each. The Assistant Administrator 
may invite comments on such action, and may withdraw or modify the 
action by following procedures similar to those for implementation. The 
Assistant Administrator will implement any permanent determination or 
restriction through rulemaking.
    (5) Registration. If the Assistant Administrator imposes 
restrictions under paragraph (d)(2)(iv), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), or 
(d)(4)(ii) of this section, the Assistant Administrator may require the 
owner and operator of a vessel to register before entering an area 
where, and during the time when, the restrictions apply. If registration 
is required, the vessel's owner and operator must submit the following 
information to the NMFS Regional Office:
    (i) The name and official number (or registration number) of the 
vessel;
    (ii) The names, mailing and street addresses, and telephone numbers 
of the vessel owner and operator;
    (iii) The permit number or other identification of relevant state or 
Federal fishing permit(s);
    (iv) Where and when the vessel intends to fish;
    (v) Where and when the vessel will depart on any fishing trip, with 
sufficient specificity to allow for an observer to embark on the trip; 
and
    (vi) Any changes in the information submitted under paragraphs 
(d)(5)(i) through (d)(5)(v) of this section. Failure to do so 
immediately will void the registration, rendering unlawful any 
subsequent entry of the fishing vessel into the area where and during 
the time when the restrictions apply.
    (6) Restrictions applicable to the California/Oregon drift gillnet 
fishery--(i) Pacific leatherback conservation area. No person may fish 
with, set, or haul back drift gillnet gear in U.S. waters of the Pacific 
Ocean from August 15 through November 15 in the area bounded by straight 
lines connecting the following coordinates in the order listed:
    (A) Point Sur (36[deg]18.5[min] N) to 34[deg]27[min] N 123[deg]35' 
W[min];
    (B) 34[deg]27[min] N 123[deg]35[min] W to 34[deg]27[min] N 129[deg] 
W;
    (C) 34[deg]27[min] N 129[deg] W to 45[deg] N 129[deg] W;
    (D) 45[deg] N 129[deg] W to the point 45[deg] N intersects the 
Oregon coast.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (7) Restrictions applicable to gillnet fisheries in North Carolina. 
No person may fish with gillnet fishing gear which has a stretched mesh 
size larger than 4 1/4 inches (10.8 cm), annually from September 1 
through December 15, in the inshore waters of Pamlico Sound, North 
Carolina, and all contiguous tidal waters, bounded on the north by 
35[deg]46.3' N. lat., on the south by 35[deg]00' N. lat., and on the 
west by 76[deg]30' W. long.
    (8) Restrictions applicable to large-mesh gillnet fisheries in the 
mid-Atlantic region. No person may fish (including, but not limited to, 
setting, hauling back, or leaving in the ocean) with, or possess any 
gillnet with a stretched mesh size larger than 8 inches (20.3 cm), 
unless all gillnets are covered with canvas or other similar material 
and lashed or otherwise securely fastened to the deck or the rail, and 
all buoys larger than 6 inches (15.24 cm) in diameter, high flyers, and 
anchors are disconnected. This restriction is effective starting on 
March 15, 2002, in the Atlantic Exclusive Economic Zone (as defined in 
50 CFR 600.10) during the following time periods and in the following 
areas:
    (i) Waters north of 33[deg]51.0' N (North Carolina/South Carolina 
border at the coast) and south of 35[deg]46.0' N (Oregon Inlet) at any 
time;
    (ii) Waters north of 35[deg]46.0' N (Oregon Inlet) and south of 
36[deg]22.5' N (Currituck Beach Light, NC) from March 16 through January 
14;
    (iii) Waters north of 36[deg]22.5' N (Currituck Beach Light, NC) and 
south of 37[deg]34.6' N (Wachapreague Inlet, VA) from April 1 through 
January 14; and
    (iv) Waters north of 37[deg]34.6' N (Wachapreague Inlet, VA) and 
south of

[[Page 169]]

37[deg]56.0' N (Chincoteague, VA) from April 16 through January 14.
    (e) Exception for incidental taking. The prohibitions against taking 
in Sec. 223.205(a) do not apply to the incidental take of any member of 
a threatened species of sea turtle (i.e., a take not directed toward 
such member) during fishing or scientific research activities, to the 
extent that those involved are in compliance with all applicable 
requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section, or in 
compliance with the terms and conditions of an incidental take permit 
issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 223.207  Approved TEDs.

    Any netting, webbing, or mesh that may be measured to determine 
compliance with this section is subject to measurement, regardless of 
whether it is wet or dry. Any such measurement will be of the stretched 
mesh size.
    (a) Hard TEDs. Hard TEDs are TEDs with rigid deflector grids and are 
categorized as ``hooped hard TEDs,'' such as the NMFS and Cameron TEDs 
(Figures 1 & 2 to this part), or ``single-grid hard TEDs,'' such as the 
Matagorda and Georgia TEDs (Figures 3 & 4 to this part). Hard TEDs 
complying with the following generic design criteria are approved TEDs:
    (1) Construction materials. A hard TED must be constructed of one or 
a combination of the following materials, with minimum dimensions as 
follows:
    (i) Solid steel rod with a minimum outside diameter of \1/4\ inch 
(0.64 cm);
    (ii) Fiberglass or aluminum rod with a minimum outside diameter of 
\1/2\ inch (1.27 cm); or
    (iii) Steel or aluminum tubing with a minimum outside diameter of 
\1/2\ inch (1.27 cm) and a minimum wall thickness of \1/8\ inch (0.32 
cm) (also known as schedule 40 tubing).
    (2) Method of attachment. A hard TED must be sewn into the trawl 
around the entire circumference of the TED with heavy twine.
    (3) Angle of deflector bars. (i) The angle of the deflector bars 
must be between 30[deg] and 55[deg] from the normal, horizontal flow 
through the interior of the trawl, except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) For any shrimp trawler fishing in the Gulf SFSTCA or the 
Atlantic SFSTCA, a hard TED with the position of the escape opening at 
the bottom of the net when the net is in its deployed position, the 
angle of the deflector bars from the normal, horizontal flow through the 
interior of the trawl, at any point, must not exceed 55[deg], and:
    (A) If the deflector bars that run from top to bottom are attached 
to the bottom frame of the TED, the angle of the bottom-most 4 inches 
(10.2 cm) of each deflector bar, measured along the bars, must not 
exceed 45[deg] (Figures 14a and 14b to this part);
    (B) If the deflector bars that run from top to bottom are not 
attached to the bottom frame of the TED, the angle of the imaginary 
lines connecting the bottom frame of the TED to the bottom end of each 
deflector bar which runs from top to bottom must not exceed 45[deg] 
(Figure 15 to this part).
    (4) Space between bars. The space between deflector bars and between 
the deflector bars and the frame must not exceed 4 inches (10.2 cm).
    (5) Direction of bars. The deflector bars must run from top to 
bottom of the TED, as the TED is positioned in the net, except that up 
to four of the bottom bars and two of the top bars, including the frame, 
may run from side to side of the TED.
    (6) Position of escape opening. The entire width of the escape 
opening from

[[Page 170]]

the trawl must be centered on and immediately forward of the frame at 
either the top or bottom of the net when the net is in its deployed 
position. The escape opening must be at the top of the net when the 
slope of the deflector bars from forward to aft is upward, and must be 
at the bottom when such slope is downward. For a single-grid TED, the 
escape opening must be cut horizontally along the same plane as the TED, 
and may not be cut in a fore-and-aft direction.
    (7) Size of escape opening--(i) Hooped hard TED. On a hooped hard 
TED, the escape opening must not be smaller than 25 inches by 25 inches 
(63.5 cm by 63.5 cm) in the Gulf Area, or 30 inches by 30 inches (76.2 
cm by 76.2 cm) in the Atlantic Area. A door frame may not be used over 
the escape opening; however, a webbing flap may be used as provided in 
paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section.
    (ii) Single-grid hard TED--(A) Escape opening for standard single-
grid hard TED. On a single-grid hard TED, the cut in the trawl webbing 
for the escape opening cannot be narrower than the outside width of the 
grid minus 4 inches (10.2 cm) on both sides of the grid, when measured 
as a straight line width. (Figure 13 to this part illustrates the 
dimensions of this cut.) The resulting escape opening in the net webbing 
must measure at least 32 inches (81.3 cm) in horizontal taut length and, 
simultaneously, 10 inches (25.4 cm) in vertical taut height in the Gulf 
Area; or 35 inches (88.9 cm) in horizontal taut length and, 
simultaneously, 12 inches (30.5 cm) in vertical taut height in the 
Atlantic Area. The vertical measurement must be taken at the midpoint of 
the horizontal measurement.
    (B) Escape opening for leatherback turtles--(1) Standard leatherback 
opening. A single-grid hard TED escape opening shall be enlarged to 
allow leatherback turtles to escape by cutting an exit hole in the 
extension forward of the TED frame 26 inches (66 cm) deep, on each side, 
by 83 inches (211 cm) across (Figures 12a and 12b to this part). Excess 
webbing is removed by cutting across \1/2\ mesh forward of the TED 
frame. The exit hole cover is made by cutting a 133-inch (388 cm) by 58-
inch (148 cm) piece of webbing no smaller than 1\1/2\ inch (4 cm) 
stretch mesh and no larger than 1 \5/8\ inch (4.2 cm) stretch mesh. The 
133-inch (338 cm) edge of the cover is attached to the forward edge of 
the opening (83-inch (211 cm) edge) with a sewing sequence of 3:2. The 
cover must overlap 5 inches (13 cm) of the exit hole on each side. The 
side of the cover is attached, maintaining the 5-inch (13 cm) overlap, 
to the side of the opening by sewing 28 inches (71 cm) of the cover to 
26 inches (66 cm) of the opening forward of the TED frame and by sewing 
15 inches (38 cm) of the extension behind the TED frame. The cover may 
extend no more than 24 inches (61 cm) behind the posterior edge of the 
TED frame. The circumference of the exit opening must be 142 inches (361 
cm) when stretched. If an accelerator funnel is used with a single-grid 
hard TED, modified as above, it must have a minimum circumference of 142 
inches (361 cm).
    (2) Double cover flap TED opening. A single-grid hard TED escape 
opening shall be enlarged to allow leatherback turtles to escape by 
cutting an exit hole in the extension forward of the TED frame 20 inches 
(51 cm) deep, on each side, by 56 inches (142 cm) across. Excess webbing 
is removed by cutting across \1/2\ mesh forward of the TED frame. The 
exit hole cover is made by cutting two equal size rectangular panels of 
webbing with mesh sizes no smaller than 1\1/2\ inch (4 cm) stretch mesh 
and no larger than 1 \5/8\ inch (4.2 cm) stretch mesh. Each panel must 
be no less than 58 inches (147 cm) wide. The 58-inch (147 cm) edges of 
each panel are attached to the forward edge of the opening (56-inch (142 
cm) edge) with a sewing sequence of 3:2. When both panels are attached, 
they may overlap each other by no more than 15 inches (38 cm). The 
panels may only be sewn together along the leading edge of the cut. The 
panels may not overlap the escape hole cut by more than 3 meshes on 
either side. The outer edges of the panels may be attached in the same 
row of meshes forward and aft. The end of each panel may not extend more 
than 6 inches (15 cm) past the posterior edge of the grid. Accelerator 
funnels and chafing webbing may not be used with

[[Page 171]]

this TED. (Figure 16 of this part illustrates the escape opening and 
flap dimensions for the double cover flap TED.)
    (8) Size of hoop or grid--(i) Hooped hard TED. (A) An oval front 
hoop on a hard TED must have an inside horizontal measurement of at 
least 32 inches (81.3 cm) and an inside vertical measurement of at least 
20 inches (50.8 cm) in the Gulf Area, or an inside horizontal 
measurement of at least 35 inches (88.9 cm) and an inside vertical 
measurement of at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) in the Atlantic Area.
    (B) A circular front hoop on a hard TED must have an inside diameter 
of at least 32 inches (81.3 cm) in the Gulf Area or 35 inches (88.9 cm) 
in the Atlantic Area.
    (ii) Single-grid hard TED. A single-grid hard TED must have an 
inside horizontal and vertical measurement of at least 28 inches (71.1 
cm) in the Gulf Area or 30 inches (76.2 cm) in the Atlantic Area. The 
required inside measurements must be at the mid-point of the deflector 
grid.
    (9) Flotation. Floats must be attached to the top one-half of all 
hard TEDs with bottom escape openings. The floats may be attached either 
outside or inside the net, but not to a flap. Floats attached inside the 
net must be behind the rear surface of the TED. Floats must be attached 
with heavy twine or rope. Floats must be constructed of aluminum, hard 
plastic, expanded polyvinyl chloride, or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate 
unless otherwise specified. The requirements of this paragraph may be 
satisfied by compliance with either the dimension requirements of 
paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, or the buoyancy requirements of 
paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section, or the buoyancy-dimension 
requirements of paragraph (a)(9)(iii) of this section. If roller gear is 
used pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the roller gear must 
be included in the circumference measurement of the TED or the total 
weight of the TED.
    (i) Float dimension requirements. (A) For hard TEDs with a 
circumference of 120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, a minimum of either one 
round, aluminum or hard plastic float, no smaller than 9.8 inches (25.0 
cm) in diameter, or two expanded polyvinyl chloride or expanded ethylene 
vinyl acetate floats, each no smaller than 6.75 inches (17.2 cm) in 
diameter by 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) in length, must be attached.
    (B) For hard TEDs with a circumference of less than 120 inches 
(304.8 cm), a minimum of either one round, aluminum or hard plastic 
float, no smaller than 9.8 inches (25.0 cm) in diameter, or one expanded 
polyvinyl chloride or expanded ethylene vinyl acetate float, no smaller 
than 6.75 inches (17.2 cm) in diameter by 8.75 inches (22.2 cm) in 
length, must be attached.
    (ii) Float buoyancy requirements. Floats of any size and in any 
combination must be attached such that the combined buoyancy of the 
floats, as marked on the floats, equals or exceeds the weight of the 
hard TED, as marked on the TED. The buoyancy of the floats and the 
weight of the TED must be clearly marked on the floats and the TED as 
follows:
    (A) Float buoyancy markings. Markings on floats must be made in 
clearly legible raised or recessed lettering by the original 
manufacturer. The marking must identify the buoyancy of the float in 
water, expressed in grams or kilograms, and must include the metric unit 
of measure. The marking may additionally include the buoyancy in English 
units. The marking must identify the nominal buoyancy for the 
manufactured float.
    (B) TED weight markings. The marking must be made by the original 
TED manufacturer and must be permanent and clearly legible. The marking 
must identify the in-air, dry weight of the TED, expressed in grams or 
kilograms, and must include the metric unit of measure. The marking may 
additionally include the weight in English units. The marked weight must 
represent the actual weight of the individual TED as manufactured. 
Previously manufactured TEDs may be marked upon return to the original 
manufacturer. Where a TED is comprised of multiple detachable 
components, the weight of each component must be separately marked.
    (iii) Buoyancy-dimension requirements. Floats of any size and in any 
combination, provided that they are marked pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(9)(ii)(A) of

[[Page 172]]

this section, must be attached such that the combined buoyancy of the 
floats equals or exceeds the following values:
    (A) For floats constructed of aluminum or hard plastic, regardless 
of the size of the TED grid, the combined buoyancy must equal or exceed 
14 lb (6.4 kg);
    (B) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride or 
expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference of the TED is 
120 inches (304.8 cm) or more, the combined buoyancy must equal or 
exceed 20 lb (9.1 kg); or
    (C) For floats constructed of expanded polyvinyl chloride or 
expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, where the circumference of the TED is 
less than 120 inches (304.8 cm), the combined buoyancy must equal or 
exceed 10 lb (4.5 kg).
    (b) Special Hard TEDs. Special hard TEDs are hard TEDs which do not 
meet all of the design and construction criteria of the generic 
standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The following 
special hard TEDs are approved TEDs:
    (1) Flounder TED (Figure 10 to this part). The Flounder TED is 
approved for use only in the Atlantic summer flounder bottom trawl 
fishery. The Flounder TED is not an approved TED for use by shrimp 
trawlers. The Flounder TED must be constructed of at least 1\1/4\ inch 
(3.2 cm) outside diameter aluminum or steel pipe with a wall thickness 
of at least \1/8\ inch (0.3 cm). It must have a rectangular frame with 
outside dimensions which can be no less than 51 inches (129.5 cm) in 
length and 32 inches (81.3 cm) in width. It must have at least five 
vertical deflector bars, with bar spacings of no more than 4 inches 
(10.2 cm). The vertical bars must be connected to the top of the frame 
and to a single horizontal bar near the bottom. The horizontal bar must 
be connected at both ends to the sides of the frame and parallel to the 
bottom bar of the frame. There must be a space no larger than 10 inches 
(25.4 cm) between the horizontal bar and the bottom bar of the frame. 
One or more additional vertical bars running from the bottom bar to the 
horizontal bar must divide the opening at the bottom into two or more 
rectangles, each with a maximum height of 10 inches (25.4 cm) and a 
maximum width of 14\1/2\ inches (36.8 cm). This TED must comply with 
paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(6), and (a)(7)(ii) of this section with 
respect to the method of attachment, the angle of the deflector bars, 
the position of the escape opening, and the size of the escape opening, 
except that the deflector bars must be positioned in the net to deflect 
turtles to the escape opening in the top of the trawl. This TED may not 
be configured with a bottom escape opening. Installation of an 
accelerator funnel is not permitted with this TED.
    (2) Jones TED (Figure 11 to this part). The Jones TED must be 
constructed of at least 1\1/4\ inch (3.2 cm) outside diameter aluminum 
or steel pipe, and the pipe must have a wall thickness of at least \1/8\ 
inch (0.3 cm). It must be generally oval in shape with a flattened 
bottom. The deflector bars must be attached to the frame at a 45[deg] 
angle from the horizontal positioning downward and each bar must be 
attached at only one end to the frame. The deflector bars must be 
attached and lie in the same plane as the frame. The space between the 
ends of the bottom deflector bars and the bottom frame bar must be no 
more than 3 inches (7.6 cm). The spacing between the bottom three 
deflector bars on each side must be no greater than 2\1/2\ inches (6.4 
cm). The spacing between all other deflector bars must not exceed 3\1/2\ 
inches (8.9 cm) and spacing between ends of opposing deflector bars also 
must not exceed 3\1/2\ inches (8.9 cm). This TED must comply with 
paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(6), (a)(7)(ii), (a)(8)(ii), and (a)(9) of 
this section with respect to the method of attachment, the angle of the 
deflector bars, the position of the escape opening, the size of the 
escape opening, the size of the grid, and flotation.
    (c) Soft TEDs. Soft TEDs are TEDs with deflector panels made from 
polypropylene or polyethylene netting. The following soft TEDs are 
approved TEDs:
    (1) Parker TED. The Parker TED is a soft TED, consisting of a single 
triangular panel, composed of webbing of two different mesh sizes, that 
forms a complete barrier inside a trawl and

[[Page 173]]

that angles toward an escape opening in the top of the trawl.
    (i) Excluder Panel. (Figure 5 to this part) The excluder panel of 
the Parker TED must be constructed of a single triangular piece of 8-
inch (20.3 cm) stretched mesh webbing and two trapezoidal pieces of 4-
inch (10.2-cm) stretched mesh webbing. The webbing must consist of 
number 48 (3-mm thick) or larger polypropylene or polyethylene webbing 
that is heat-set knotted or braided. The leading edge of the 8-inch 
(20.3-cm) mesh panel must be 36 meshes wide. The 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh 
panel must be tapered on each side with all-bar cuts to converge on an 
apex, such that the length of each side is 36 bars. The leading edges of 
the 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must be 8 meshes wide. The edges of the 
4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must be cut with all-bar cuts running 
parallel to each other, such that the length of the inner edge is 72 
bars and the length of the outer edge is 89 bars and the resulting fore-
and-aft edge is 8 meshes deep. The two 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels must 
be sewn to the 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh panel to create a single triangular 
excluder panel. The 72-bar edge of each 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panel must 
be securely joined with twine to one of the 36-bar edges of the 8-inch 
(20.3-cm) mesh panel, tied with knots at each knot of the 4-inch (10.2-
cm) webbing and at least two wraps of twine around each bar of 4-inch 
(10.2-cm) mesh and the adjoining bar of the 8-inch (20.3-cm) mesh. The 
adjoining fore-and-aft edges of the two 4-inch (10.2-cm) mesh panels 
must be sewn together evenly.
    (ii) Limitations on which trawls may have a Parker TED installed. 
The Parker TED must not be installed or used in a two-seam trawl with a 
tongue, nor in a triple-wing trawl (a trawl with a tongue along the 
headrope and a second tongue along the footrope). The Parker TED may be 
installed and used in any other trawl if the taper of the body panels of 
the trawl does not exceed 4b1p and if it can be properly installed in 
compliance with paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) Panel installation--(A) Leading edge attachment. The leading 
edge of the excluder panel must be attached to the inside of the bottom 
of the trawl across a straight row of meshes. For a two-seam trawl or a 
four-seam, tapered-wing trawl, the row of meshes for attachment to the 
trawl must run the entire width of the bottom body panel, from seam to 
seam. For a four-seam, straight-wing trawl, the row of meshes for 
attachment to the trawl must run the entire width of the bottom body 
panel and half the height of each wing panel of the trawl. Every mesh of 
the leading edge of the excluder panel must be evenly sewn to this row 
of meshes; meshes may not be laced to the trawl. The row of meshes for 
attachment to the trawl must contain the following number of meshes, 
depending on the stretched mesh size used in the trawl:
    (1) For a mesh size of 2\1/4\ inches (5.7 cm), 152-168 meshes;
    (2) For a mesh size of 2\1/8\ inches (5.4 cm), 161-178 meshes;
    (3) For a mesh size of 2 inches (5.1 cm), 171-189 meshes;
    (4) For a mesh size of 1\7/8\ inches (4.8 cm), 182-202 meshes;
    (5) For a mesh size of 1\3/4\ inches (4.4 cm), 196-216 meshes;
    (6) For a mesh size of 1\5/8\ inches (4.1 cm), 211-233 meshes;
    (7) For a mesh size of 1\1/2\ inches (3.8 cm), 228-252 meshes;
    (8) For a mesh size of 1\3/8\ inches (3.5 cm), 249-275 meshes; and
    (9) For a mesh size of 1\1/4\ inches (3.2 cm), 274-302 meshes.
    (B) Apex attachment. The apex of the triangular excluder panel must 
be attached to the inside of the top body panel of the trawl at the 
centerline of the trawl. The distance, measured aft along the centerline 
of the top body panel from the same row of meshes for attachment of the 
excluder panel to the bottom body panel of the trawl, to the apex 
attachment point must contain the following number of meshes, depending 
on the stretched mesh size used in the trawl:
    (1) For a mesh size of 2\1/4\ inches (5.7 cm), 78-83 meshes;
    (2) For a mesh size of 2\1/8\ inches (5.4 cm), 83-88 meshes;
    (3) For a mesh size of 2 inches (5.1 cm), 87-93 meshes;
    (4) For a mesh size of 1\7/8\ inches (4.8 cm), 93-99 meshes;
    (5) For a mesh size of 1\3/4\ inches (4.4 cm), 100-106 meshes;

[[Page 174]]

    (6) For a mesh size of 1\5/8\ inches (4.1 cm), 107-114 meshes;
    (7) For a mesh size of 1\1/2\ inches (3.8 cm), 114-124 meshes;
    (8) For a mesh size of 1\3/8\ inches (3.5 cm), 127-135 meshes; and
    (9) For a mesh size of 1\1/4\ inches (3.2 cm), 137-146 meshes.
    (C) Side attachment. The sides of the excluder panel must be 
attached evenly to the inside of the trawl from the outside attachment 
points of the excluder panel's leading edge to the apex of the excluder 
panel. Each side must be sewn with the same sewing sequence, and, if the 
sides of the excluder panel cross rows of bars in the trawl, the 
crossings must be distributed evenly over the length of the side 
attachment.
    (iv) Escape opening. The escape opening for the Parker soft TED must 
match one of the following specifications:
    (A) Longitudinal cut. A slit at least 56 inches (1.4 m) in taut 
length must be cut along the centerline of the top body panel of the 
trawl net immediately forward of the apex of the panel webbing. The slit 
must not be covered or closed in any manner. The edges and end points of 
the slit must not be reinforced in any way; for example, by attaching 
additional rope or webbing or by changing the orientation of the 
webbing.
    (B) Leatherback escape opening. A horizontal cut extending from the 
attachment of one side of the deflector panel to the trawl to the 
attachment of the other side of the deflector panel to the trawl must be 
made in a single row of meshes across the top of the trawl and measure 
at least 96 inches (244 cm) in taut width. All trawl webbing above the 
deflector panel between the 96-inch (244-cm) cut and edges of the 
deflector panel must be removed. A rectangular flap of nylon webbing not 
larger than 2-inch (5.1-cm) stretched mesh may be sewn to the forward 
edge of the escape opening. The width of the flap must not be larger 
than the width of the forward edge of the escape opening. The flap must 
not extend more than 12 inches (30.4 cm) beyond the rear point of the 
escape opening. The sides of the flap may be attached to the top of the 
trawl but must not be attached farther aft than the row of meshes 
through the rear point of the escape opening. One row of steel chain not 
larger than \3/16\ inch (4.76 mm) may be sewn evenly to the back edge of 
the flap. The stretched length of the chain must not exceed 96 inches 
(244 cm). A Parker TED using the escape opening described in this 
paragraph meets the requirements of Sec. 223.206(d)(2)(iv)(B).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) Allowable modifications to hard TEDs and special hard TEDs. 
Unless otherwise prohibited in paragraph (b) of this section, only the 
following modifications may be made to an approved hard TED or an 
approved special hard TED:
    (1) Floats. In addition to floats required pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(9) of this section, floats may be attached to the top one-half of 
the TED, either outside or inside the net, but not to a flap. Floats 
attached inside the net must be behind the rear surface at the top of 
the TED.
    (2) Accelerator funnel. An accelerator funnel may be installed in 
the trawl, if it is made of net webbing material with a stretched mesh 
size not greater than 1\5/8\ inches (4.1 cm), if it has an inside 
horizontal opening of at least 39 inches (99.1 cm) when measured in a 
taut position, if it is inserted in the net immediately forward of the 
TED, and if its rear edge does not extend past the bars of the TED. The 
trailing edge of the accelerator funnel may be attached to the TED on 
the side opposite the escape opening if not more than \1/3\ of the 
circumference of the funnel is attached, and if the inside horizontal 
opening of at least 39 inches (99.1 cm) is maintained. In a bottom-
opening TED, only the top \1/3\ of the circumference of the funnel may 
be attached to the TED. In a top-opening TED, only the bottom \1/3\ of 
the circumference of the funnel may be attached to the TED.
    (3) Webbing flap. A webbing flap may be used to cover the escape 
opening under the following conditions: No device holds it closed or 
otherwise restricts the opening; it is constructed of webbing with a 
stretched mesh size no larger than 1\5/8\ inches (4.1 cm); it lies on 
the outside of the trawl; it is attached along its entire forward edge 
forward of the escape opening; it is not attached on the sides beyond 
the row of

[[Page 175]]

meshes that lies 6 inches (15.2 cm) behind the posterior edge of the 
grid; and it does not extend more than 24 inches (61.0 cm) beyond the 
posterior edge of the grid, except for trawlers fishing in the Gulf 
SFSTCA or Atlantic SFSTCA with a hard TED with the position of the 
escape opening at the bottom of the net when the net is in its deployed 
position, in which case the webbing flap must not extend beyond the 
posterior edge of the grid.
    (4) Chafing webbing. A single piece of nylon webbing, with a twine 
size no smaller than size 36 (2.46 mm in diameter), may be attached 
outside of the escape opening webbing flap to prevent chafing on bottom 
opening TEDs. This webbing may be attached along its leading edge only. 
This webbing may not extend beyond the trailing edge or sides of the 
existing escape opening webbing flap, and it must not interfere or 
otherwise restrict the turtle escape opening.
    (5) Roller gear. Roller gear may be attached to the bottom of a TED 
to prevent chafing on the bottom of the TED and the trawl net. When a 
webbing flap is used in conjunction with roller gear, the webbing flap 
must be of a length such that no part of the webbing flap can touch or 
come in contact with any part of the roller gear assembly or the means 
of attachment of the roller gear assembly to the TED, when the trawl net 
is in its normal, horizontal position. Roller gear must be constructed 
according to one of the following design criteria:
    (i) A single roller consisting of hard plastic shall be mounted on 
an axle rod, so that the roller can roll freely about the axle. The 
maximum diameter of the roller shall be 6 inches (15.24 cm), and the 
maximum width of the axle rod shall be 12 inches (30.4 cm). The axle rod 
must be attached to the TED by two support rods. The maximum clearance 
between the roller and the TED shall not exceed 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the 
center of the roller. The support rods and axle rod must be made from 
solid steel or solid aluminum rod no larger than \1/2\ inch (1.28 cm) in 
diameter. The attachment of the support rods to the TED shall be such 
that there are no protrusions (lips, sharp edges, burrs, etc.) on the 
front face of the grid. The axle rod and support rods must lie entirely 
behind the plane of the face of the TED grid.
    (ii) A single roller consisting of hard plastic tubing shall be 
tightly tied to the back face of the TED grid with rope or heavy twine 
passed through the center of the roller tubing. The roller shall lie 
flush against the TED. The maximum outside diameter of the roller shall 
be 3\1/2\ inches (8.0 cm), the minimum outside diameter of the roller 
shall be 2 inches (5.1 cm), and the maximum length of the roller shall 
be 12 inches (30.4 cm). The roller must lie entirely behind the plane of 
the face of the grid.
    (e) Revision of generic design criteria, and approval of TEDs, of 
allowable modifications of hard TEDs, and of special hard TEDs. (1) The 
Assistant Administrator may revise the generic design criteria for hard 
TEDs set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, may approve special 
hard TEDs in addition to those listed in paragraph (b) of this section, 
may approve allowable modifications to hard TEDs in addition to those 
authorized in paragraph (d) of this section, or may approve other TEDs, 
by regulatory amendment, if, according to a NMFS-approved scientific 
protocol, the TED demonstrates a sea turtle exclusion rate of 97 percent 
or greater (or an equivalent exclusion rate). Two such protocols have 
been published by NMFS (52 FR 24262, June 29, 1987; and 55 FR 41092, 
October 9, 1990) and will be used only for testing relating to hard TED 
designs. Testing under any protocol must be conducted under the 
supervision of the Assistant Administrator, and shall be subject to all 
such conditions and restrictions as the Assistant Administrator deems 
appropriate. Any person wishing to participate in such testing should 
contact the Director, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, 75 
Virginia Beach Dr., Miami, FL 33149-1003.
    (2) Upon application, the Assistant Administrator may issue permits, 
subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Assistant 
Administrator deems appropriate, authorizing public or private 
experimentation aimed at improving shrimp retention efficiency of 
existing approved TEDs and at developing additional TEDs, or conducting

[[Page 176]]

fishery research, that would otherwise be subject to Sec. 223.206(d)(2). 
Applications should be made to the Southeast Regional Administrator (see 
Sec. 222.102 definition of ``Southeast Regional Administrator'').

<R05>
Sec. 223.209  Tribal plans.

    (a) Limits on the prohibitions. The prohibitions of Sec. 223.203(a) 
of this subpart relating to threatened species of salmonids listed in 
Sec. 223.102 do not apply to any activity undertaken by a tribe, tribal 
member, tribal permittee, tribal employee, or tribal agent in compliance 
with a Tribal resource management plan (Tribal Plan), provided that the 
Secretary determines that implementation of such Tribal Plan will not 
appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival and recovery of the listed 
salmonids. In making that determination the Secretary shall use the best 
available biological data (including any tribal data and analysis) to 
determine the Tribal Plan's impact on the biological requirements of the 
species, and will assess the effect of the Tribal Plan on survival and 
recovery, consistent with legally enforceable tribal rights and with the 
Secretary's trust responsibilities to tribes.
    (b) Consideration of a Tribal Plan. (1) A Tribal Plan may include 
but is not limited to plans that address fishery harvest, artificial 
production, research, or water or land management, and may be developed 
by one tribe or jointly with other tribes. The Secretary will consult on 
a government-to-government basis with any tribe that so requests and 
will provide to the maximum extent practicable technical assistance in 
examining impacts on listed salmonids and other salmonids as tribes 
develop Tribal resource management plans that meet the management 
responsibilities and needs of the tribes. A Tribal Plan must specify the 
procedures by which the tribe will enforce its provisions.
    (2) Where there exists a Federal court proceeding with continuing

Sec. 224.102  Permits for endangered marine and anadromous species.

    No person shall take, import, export, or engage in any activity 
prohibited by section 9 of the Act involving any marine species that has 
been determined to be endangered under the Endangered Species 
Conservation Act of 1969 or the Act, and that is under the jurisdiction 
of the Secretary, without a valid permit issued pursuant to part 222, 
subpart C of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 224.103  Special prohibitions for endangered marine mammals.

    (a) Approaching humpback whales in Hawaii. Except as provided in 
part 222, subpart C, of this chapter (General Permit Procedures), it is 
unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
to commit, to attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit, or to 
cause to be committed, within 200 nautical miles (370.4 km) of the 
Islands of Hawaii, any of the following acts with respect to humpback 
whales (Megaptera novaeangliae):
    (1) Operate any aircraft within 1,000 feet (300 m) of any humpback 
whale;
    (2) Approach, by any means, within 100 yard (90 m) of any humpback 
whale;
    (3) Cause a vessel or other object to approach within 100 yd (90 m) 
of a humpback whale; or
    (4) Disrupt the normal behavior or prior activity of a whale by any 
other act or omission. A disruption of normal behavior may be manifested 
by, among other actions on the part of the whale, a rapid change in 
direction or speed; escape tactics such as prolonged diving, underwater 
course changes, underwater exhalation, or evasive swimming patterns; 
interruptions of breeding, nursing, or resting activities, attempts by a 
whale to shield a calf from a vessel or human observer by tail swishing 
or by other protective movement; or the abandonment of a previously 
frequented area.
    (b) Approaching humpback whales in Alaska--(1) Prohibitions. Except 
as provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is unlawful for 
any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to commit, 
to attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit, or to cause to be 
committed, within 200 nautical miles (370.4 km) of Alaska, or within 
inland waters of the state, any of the acts in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
through (b)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to humpback whales 
(Megaptera novaeangliae):
    (i) Approach, by any means, including by interception (i.e., placing 
a vessel in the path of an oncoming humpback whale so that the whale 
surfaces within 100 yards (91.4 m) of the vessel), within 100 yards 
(91.4 m) of any humpback whale;
    (ii) Cause a vessel or other object to approach within 100 yards 
(91.4 m) of a humpback whale; or
    (iii) Disrupt the normal behavior or prior activity of a whale by 
any other act or omission, as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section.
    (2) Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to this paragraph 
(b), but any person who claims the applicability of an exception has the 
burden of proving that the exception applies:
    (i) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply if an approach 
is authorized by the National Marine Fisheries Service through a permit 
issued under part 222, subpart C, of this chapter (General Permit 
Procedures) or through a similar authorization.
    (ii) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent 
that a vessel is restricted in her ability to maneuver and, because of 
the restriction, cannot comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to commercial 
fishing vessels lawfully engaged in actively setting, retrieving or 
closely tending commercial fishing gear. For purposes of this paragraph 
(b), commercial fishing means taking or harvesting fish or fishery 
resources to sell, barter, or trade. Commercial fishing does not include 
commercial passenger fishing operations (i.e. charter operations or 
sport fishing activities).
    (iv) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to state, 
local, or Federal government vessels operating in the course of official 
duty.
    (v) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not affect the rights of 
Alaska Natives under 16 U.S.C. 1539(e).
    (vi) These regulations shall not take precedence over any more 
restrictive

[[Page 191]]

conflicting Federal regulation pertaining to humpback whales, including 
the regulations at 36 CFR 13.65 that pertain specifically to the waters 
of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.
    (3) General measures. Notwithstanding the prohibitions and 
exceptions in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, to avoid 
collisions with humpback whales, vessels must operate at a slow, safe 
speed when near a humpback whale. ``Safe speed'' has the same meaning as 
the term is defined in 33 U.S.C. 2006 and the International Regulations 
for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (see 33 U.S.C. 1602), with respect 
to avoiding collisions with humpback whales.
    (c) Approaching North Atlantic right whales--(1) Prohibitions. 
Except as provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it is 
unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
to commit, attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit, or cause to 
be committed any of the following acts:
    (i) Approach (including by interception) within 500 yards (460 m) of 
a right whale by vessel, aircraft, or any other means;
    (ii) Fail to undertake required right whale avoidance measures 
specified under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Right whale avoidance measures. Except as provided under 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the following avoidance measures must 
be taken if within 500 yards (460 m) of a right whale:
    (i) If underway, a vessel must steer a course away from the right 
whale and immediately leave the area at a slow safe speed.
    (ii) An aircraft must take a course away from the right whale and 
immediately leave the area at a constant airspeed.
    (3) Exceptions. The following exceptions apply to this section, but 
any person who claims the applicability of an exception has the burden 
of proving that the exception applies:
    (i) Paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section do not apply if a 
right whale approach is authorized by the National Marine Fisheries 
Service through a permit issued under part 222, subpart C, of this 
chapter (General Permit Procedures) or through a similar authorization.
    (ii) Paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section do not apply where 
compliance would create an imminent and serious threat to a person, 
vessel, or aircraft.
    (iii) Paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section do not apply when 
approaching to investigate a right whale entanglement or injury, or to 
assist in the disentanglement or rescue of a right whale, provided that 
permission is received from the National Marine Fisheries Service or 
designee prior to the approach.
    (iv) Paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section do not apply to an 
aircraft unless the aircraft is conducting whale watch activities.
    (v) Paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply to the extent 
that a vessel is restricted in her ability to maneuver and, because of 
the restriction, cannot comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) Special prohibitions relating to endangered Steller sea lion 
protection. The regulatory provisions set forth in part 223 of this 
chapter, which govern threatened Steller sea lions, shall also apply to 
the western population of Steller sea lions, which consists of all 
Steller sea lions from breeding colonies located west of 144[deg] W. 
long.

Sec. 228.16  Conduct of the hearing.

    (a) The hearing shall be held at the time and place fixed in the 
notice of the hearing, unless the presiding officer changes the time or 
place. If a change occurs, the presiding officer shall publish the 
change in the Federal Register and shall expeditiously notify all 
parties by telephone or by mail: Provided, that if that change in time 
or place of hearing is made less than 5 days before the date previously 
fixed for the hearing, the presiding officer shall also announce, or 
cause to be announced, the change at the time and place previously fixed 
for the hearing.
    (b) The presiding officer shall, at the commencement of the hearing, 
introduce into the record: the notice of hearing as published in the 
Federal Register; all subsequent documents published in the Federal 
Register; the draft Environmental Impact Statement if it is required and 
the comments thereon and agency responses to the comments; and a list of 
all parties. Direct testimony shall then be received with respect to the 
matters specified in the final agenda in such order as the presiding 
officer shall announce. With respect to direct testimony submitted as 
rebuttal testimony or in response to new issues presented by the 
prehearing conference, the presiding officer shall determine the 
relevancy of such testimony.
    (c) The hearing shall be publicly conducted and reported verbatim by 
an official reporter.
    (d) If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any direct 
testimony or to any other ruling of the presiding officer during the 
hearing, he or she shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, 
whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is 
overruled by the presiding officer. The transcript shall not include 
argument or debate thereon except as ordered by the presiding officer. 
The ruling by the presiding officer on any objection shall be a part of 
the transcript and shall be subject to review at the same time and in 
the same manner as the Assistant Administrator's final decision. Only 
objections made before the presiding officer may subsequently be relied 
upon in the proceedings.
    (e) All motions and requests shall be addressed to, and ruled on by, 
the presiding officer, if made prior to his certification of the 
transcript or by the Assistant Administrator if made thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 228.17  Direct testimony.

    (a) Only direct testimony submitted by affidavit as provided in 
these regulations and introduced at the hearing by a witness shall be

expert, the witness shall briefly state the scientific or technical 
training which qualifies the witness as an expert;
    (3) Identify the direct testimony previously submitted in accordance 
with these regulations; and
    (4) Submit to appropriate cross and direct examination. Cross-
examination shall be by a party whose interests are adverse on the issue 
presented, to the witness', if the witness is a party, or to the 
interests of the party who presented the witness.
    (c) A party shall be deemed to have waived the right to introduce 
direct testimony if such party fails to present a witness to introduce 
the direct testimony.
    (d) Official notice may be taken of such matters as are judicially 
noticed by the courts of the United States: Provided, that parties shall 
be given adequate notice, by the presiding officer, at the hearing, of 
matters so noticed and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that 
such facts are inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.


<R05>
Sec. 228.18  Cross-examination.

    (a) The presiding officer may:
    (1) Require the cross-examiner to outline the intended scope of the 
cross-examination;

[[Page 239]]

    (2) Prohibit parties from cross-examining witnesses unless the 
presiding officer has determined that the cross-examiner has an adverse 
interest on the facts at issue to the party-witness or the party 
presenting the witness. For the purposes of this subsection, the 
Assistant Administrator's or his or her representative's interest shall 
be considered adverse to all parties;
    (3) Limit the number of times any party or parties having a common 
interest may cross-examine an ``adverse'' witness on the same matter; 
and
    (4) Exclude cross-examination questions that are immaterial, 
irrelevant or unduly repetitious.
    (b) Any party shall be given an opportunity to appear, either in 
person or through an authorized counsel or representative, to cross-
examine witnesses. Before cross-examining a witness, the party or 
counsel shall state his or her name, address and occupation. If counsel 
cross-examines the witness, counsel shall state for the record the 
authority to act as counsel. Cross-examiners shall be assumed to be 
familiar with the direct testimony.
    (c) Any party or party's counsel who fails to appear at the hearing 
to cross-examine an ``adverse'' witness shall be deemed to have waived 
the right to cross-examine that witness.
    (d) Scientific, technical or commercial publications may only be 
utilized for the limited purposes of impeaching witnesses under cross-
examination unless previously submitted and introduced in accordance 
with these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 228.19  Oral and written arguments.

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 229.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part implement sections 101(a)(5)(E) and 
118 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 
1371(a)(5)(E) and 1387) that provide for exceptions for the taking of 
marine mammals incidental to certain commercial fishing operations from 
the Act's general moratorium on the taking of marine mammals.
    (b) Section 118 of the Act, rather than sections 103 and 104, 
governs the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of 
commercial fishing operations by persons using vessels of the United 
States, other than vessels fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern 
tropical Pacific Ocean purse seine fishery, and vessels that have valid 
fishing permits issued in accordance with section 204(b) of the Magnuson 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)).
    (c) The regulations of Subpart B also govern the incidental taking 
by commercial fishers of marine mammals from species or stocks 
designated under the Act as depleted on the basis of their listing as 
threatened species or

[[Page 241]]

endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.).
    (d) The regulations of this part do not apply to the incidental 
taking of California sea otters or to Northwest treaty Indian tribal 
members exercising treaty fishing rights.
    (e) Authorizations under subpart A of this part are exemptions only 
from the taking prohibitions under the Act and not those under the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973. To be exempt from the taking 
prohibitions under the Endangered Species Act, specific authorization 
under subpart B of this part is required.
    (f) Authorizations under this part do not apply to the intentional 
lethal taking of marine mammals in the course of commercial fishing 
operations except as provided for under Secs. 229.4(k) and 229.5(f).
    (g) The purposes of the regulations in this part are to:
    (1) Reduce the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine 
mammals occurring in the course of commercial fishing operations below 
the potential biological removal level for a particular stock, and
    (2) Reduce the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine 
mammals occurring in the course of commercial fishing operations to 
insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury 
rate by the statutory deadline of April 30, 2001.

[60 FR 45100, Aug. 30, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 9086, Feb. 24, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 229.2  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions contained in the Act and Sec. 216.3 
of this chapter, and unless the context otherwise requires, in this part 
229:
    Act or MMPA means the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.).
    American lobster or lobster means Homarus americanus.
    Anchored gillnet means any gillnet gear, including a sink gillnet or 
stab net, that is set anywhere in the water column and which is 
anchored, secured or weighted to the bottom of the sea. Also called a 
set gillnet.
    Assistant Administrator means the Assistant Administrator for 
Fisheries of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    Authorization Certificate means a document issued by the Assistant 
Administrator, or designee, under the authority of section 118 of the 
Act that authorizes the incidental, but not intentional, taking of 
marine mammals in Category I or II fisheries.
    Breaking strength means the highest tensile force which an object 
can withstand before breaking.
    Bridle means the lines connecting a gillnet to an anchor or buoy 
line.
    Buoy line means a line connecting fishing gear in the water to a 
buoy at the surface of the water.
    Category I fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the 
Assistant Administrator to have frequent incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial fishery that frequently 
causes mortality or serious injury of marine mammals is one that is by 
itself responsible for the annual removal of 50 percent or more of any 
stock's potential biological removal level.
    Category II fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the 
Assistant Administrator to have occasional incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial fishery that occasionally 
causes mortality or serious injury of marine mammals is one that, 
collectively with other fisheries, is responsible for the annual removal 
of more than 10 percent of any marine mammal stock's potential 
biological removal level and that is by itself responsible for the 
annual removal of between 1 and 50 percent, exclusive, of any stock's 
potential biological removal level. In the absence of reliable 
information indicating the frequency of incidental mortality and serious 
injury of marine mammals by a commercial fishery, the Assistant 
Administrator will determine whether the incidental serious injury or 
mortality is ``occasional'' by evaluating other factors such as fishing 
techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target 
species, seasons and areas fished, qualitative data from logbooks or 
fisher reports, stranding data, and the species and distribution of 
marine mammals in the

[[Page 242]]

area, or at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator. Eligible 
commercial fisheries not specifically identified in the list of 
fisheries are deemed to be Category II fisheries until the next list of 
fisheries is published.
    Category III fishery means a commercial fishery determined by the 
Assistant Administrator to have a remote likelihood of, or no known 
incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. A commercial 
fishery that has a remote likelihood of causing incidental mortality and 
serious injury of marine mammals is one that collectively with other 
fisheries is responsible for the annual removal of:
    (1) Ten percent or less of any marine mammal stock's potential 
biological removal level, or
    (2) More than 10 percent of any marine mammal stock's potential 
biological removal level, yet that fishery by itself is responsible for 
the annual removal of 1 percent or less of that stock's potential 
biological removal level. In the absence of reliable information 
indicating the frequency of incidental mortality and serious injury of 
marine mammals by a commercial fishery, the Assistant Administrator will 
determine whether the incidental serious injury or mortality is 
``remote'' by evaluating other factors such as fishing techniques, gear 
used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and 
areas fished, qualitative data from logbooks or fisher reports, 
stranding data, and the species and distribution of marine mammals in 
the area or at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator.
    Commercial fishing operation means the catching, taking, or 
harvesting of fish from the marine environment (or other areas where 
marine mammals occur) that results in the sale or barter of all or part 
of the fish harvested. The term includes licensed commercial passenger 
fishing vessel (as defined in Sec. 216.3 of this chapter) activities and 
aquaculture activities.
    Depleted species means any species or population that has been 
designated as depleted under the Act and is listed in Sec. 216.15 of 
this chapter or part 18, subpart E of this title, or any endangered or 
threatened species of marine mammal.
    Driftnet, drift gillnet, or drift entanglement gear means a gillnet 
or gillnets that is/are unattached to the ocean bottom and not anchored, 
secured or weighted to the bottom, regardless of whether attached to a 
vessel.

or operator of gear in a nonvessel fishery.
    Fishery has the same meaning as in section 3 of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802).
    Fishing trip means any time spent away from port actively engaged in 
commercial fishing operations. The end of a fishing trip will be the 
time of a fishing vessel's return to port or the return of a fisher from 
tending gear in a nonvessel fishery.
    Fishing vessel or vessel means any vessel, boat, ship, or other 
craft that is used for, equipped to be used for, or of a type normally 
used for, fishing.
    Float-line means the rope at the top of a gillnet from which the 
mesh portion of the net is hung.
    Gillnet means fishing gear consisting of a wall of webbing (meshes) 
or nets, designed or configured so that the webbing (meshes) or nets are 
placed in the water column, usually held approximately vertically, and 
are designed to capture fish by entanglement, gilling, or wedging. The 
term ``gillnet'' includes gillnets of all types, including but not 
limited to sink gillnets, other anchored gillnets (e.g. stab and set 
nets), and drift gillnets. Gillnets may or may not be attached to a 
vessel.
    Groundline, with reference to lobster trap gear, means a line 
connecting lobster traps in a lobster trap trawl, and, with reference to 
gillnet gear, means a line connecting a gillnet or gillnet bridle to an 
anchor or buoy line.
    Incidental means, with respect to an act, a non-intentional or 
accidental act that results from, but is not the purpose of, carrying 
out an otherwise lawful action.
    Injury means a wound or other physical harm. Signs of injury to a 
marine mammal include, but are not limited to, visible blood flow, loss 
of or damage to an appendage or jaw, inability to use one or more 
appendages, asymmetry in the shape of the body or body position,

[[Page 243]]

noticeable swelling or hemorrhage, laceration, puncture or rupture of 
eyeball, listless appearance or inability to defend itself, inability to 
swim or dive upon release from fishing gear, or signs of equilibrium 
imbalance. Any animal that ingests fishing gear, or any animal that is 
released with fishing gear entangling, trailing or perforating any part 
of the body will be considered injured regardless of the absence of any 
wound or other evidence of an injury.
    Interaction means coming in contact with fishing gear or catch. An 
interaction may be characterized by a marine mammal entangled, hooked, 
or otherwise trapped in fishing gear, regardless of whether injury or 
mortality occurs, or situations where marine mammals are preying on 
catch. Catch means fish or shellfish that has been hooked, entangled, 
snagged, trapped or otherwise captured by commercial fishing gear.
    Large mesh gillnet means a gillnet constructed with a mesh size of 7 
inches (17.78 cm) to 18 inches (45.72 cm).
    Lead-line means the rope, weighted or otherwise, to which the bottom 
edge of a gillnet is attached.

fisheries published in the Federal Register by the Assistant 
Administrator, categorized according to the likelihood of incidental 
mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during commercial fishing 
operations.

to the North Carolina/South Carolina border.
    Minimum population estimate means an estimate of the number of 
animals in a stock that:
    (1) Is based on the best available scientific information on 
abundance, incorporating the precision and variability associated with 
such information; and
    (2) Provides reasonable assurance that the stock size is equal to or 
greater than the estimate.
    Mudhole means waters off New Jersey bounded as follows: From the 
point 40[deg]30[min] N. latitude where it intersects with the shoreline 
of New Jersey east to its intersection with 73[deg]20[min] W. longitude, 
then south to its intersection with 40[deg]05[min] N. latitude, then 
west to its intersection with the shoreline of New Jersey.
    Negligible impact has the same meaning as in Sec. 228.3 of this 
chapter.
    Net productivity rate means the annual per capita rate of increase 
in a stock resulting from additions due to reproduction, less losses due 
to mortality.
    Neutrally buoyant line means line with a specific gravity near that 
of sea water, so that the line neither sinks to the ocean floor nor 
floats at the surface, but remains close to the bottom.

half hour after sunrise.
    NMFS means the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    Nonvessel fishery means a commercial fishing operation that uses 
fixed or other gear without a vessel, such as gear used in set gillnet, 
trap, beach seine, weir, ranch, and pen fisheries.
    Observer means an individual authorized by NMFS, or a designated

activities.
    Operator, with respect to any vessel, means the master, captain, or 
other individual in charge of that vessel.
    Potential biological removal level means the maximum number of 
animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a 
marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to

[[Page 244]]

reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population. The potential 
biological removal level is the product of the following factors:
    (1) The minimum population estimate of the stock;
    (2) One-half the maximum theoretical or estimated net productivity 
rate of the stock at a small population size; and
    (3) A recovery factor of between 0.1 and 1.0.
    Qualified individual means an individual ascertained by NMFS to be 
reasonably able, though training or experience, to identify a right 
whale. Such individuals include, but are not limited to, NMFS staff, 
U.S. Coast Guard and Navy personnel trained in whale identification,

Sec. 229.4  Requirements for Category I and II fisheries.

    (a) General. (1) For a vessel owner or crew members to lawfully 
incidentally take marine mammals in the course of a commercial fishing 
operation in a Category I or II fishery, the owner or authorized 
representative of a fishing vessel or nonvessel fishing gear must have 
in possession a valid Certificate of Authorization. The owner of a 
fishing vessel or nonvessel fishing gear is responsible for obtaining a 
Certificate of Authorization.
    (2) The granting and administration of Authorization Certificates 
under this part will be integrated and coordinated with existing fishery 
license, registration, or permit systems and related programs wherever 
possible. These programs may include, but are not limited to, state or 
interjurisdictional fisheries programs. If the administration of 
Authorization Certificates is integrated into a program, NMFS will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the integrated 
program and summarizing how an owner or authorized representative of a 
fishing vessel or non-fishing gear may register under that program or 
how registration will be achieved if no action is required on the part 
of the affected fisher. NMFS will make additional efforts to contact 
participants in the affected fishery via other appropriate means of 
notification.
    (b) Registration. (1) The owner of a vessel, or for nonvessel gear 
fisheries, the owner of gear, who participates in a Category I or II 
fishery is required to be registered for a Certificate of Authorization.
    (2) Unless a notice is published in the Federal Register announcing 
an integrated registration program, the owner of a vessel, or for 
nonvessel fishery, the owner of the gear must register for and receive 
an Authorization Certificate. To register, owners must submit the 
following information using the format specified by NMFS:
    (i) Name, address, and phone number of owner.
    (ii) Name, address, and phone number of operator, if different from 
owner, unless the name of the operator is not known or has not been 
established at the time the registration is submitted.
    (iii) For a vessel fishery, vessel name, length, home port; U.S. 
Coast Guard documentation number or state registration number, and if 
applicable; state commercial vessel license number and for a nonvessel 
fishery, a description of the gear and state commercial license number, 
if applicable.
    (iv) A list of all Category I and II fisheries in which the fisher 
may actively engage during the calendar year.
    (v) A certification signed and dated by the owner of an authorized 
representative of the owner as follows: ``I hereby certify that I am the 
owner of the vessel, that I have reviewed all information contained on 
this document, and that it is true and complete to the best of my 
knowledge.''
    (vi) A check or money order made payable to NMFS in the amount 
specified in the notice of the final List of Fisheries must accompany 
each registration submitted to NMFS. The amount of this fee will be 
based on recovering the administrative costs incurred in granting an 
authorization. The Assistant Administrator may waive the fee requirement 
for good cause upon the recommendation of the Regional Director.
    (3) If a notice is published in the Federal Register announcing an 
integrated registration program, the owner of a vessel, or for nonvessel 
fishery, the owner of the gear may register by following the directions 
provided in that notice. If a person receives a registration to which he 
or she is not entitled or if the registration contains incorrect, 
inaccurate or incomplete information, the person shall notify NMFS 
within 10 days following receipt. If a fisher participating in a 
Category I or II fishery who expects to receive automatic registration 
does not receive that registration within the time specified in the 
notice announcing the integrated registration program, the person shall 
notify NMFS as directed in the notice or may apply for registration by 
submitting the information required under paragraph (b)(1)(i) through 
(b)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (c) Address. Unless the granting and administration of 
authorizations under this part 229 is integrated and coordinated with 
existing fishery licenses,

[[Page 248]]

registrations, or related programs pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section, requests for registration forms and completed registration and 
renewal forms should be sent to the NMFS Regional Offices as follows:
    (1) Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, 709 West 9th Street, 
Juneau, AK 99802; telephone: 907-586-7235;

    (5) Southeast Region, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive North, St. 
Petersburg, FL 33702; telephone: 727-570-5312.
    (d) Issuance. (1) For integrated fisheries, an Authorization 
Certificate or other proof of registration will be issued annually to 
each fisher registered for that fishery.
    (2) For all other fisheries (i.e., non-integrated fisheries), NMFS 
will issue an Authorization Certificate and, if necessary, a decal to an 
owner or authorized representative who:
    (i) Submits a completed registration form and the required fee.
    (ii) Has complied with the requirements of this section and 
Secs. 229.6 and 229.7
    (iii) Has submitted updated registration or renewal registration 
which includes a statement (yes/no) whether any marine mammals were 
killed or injured during the current or previous calender year.
    (3) If a person receives a renewed Authorization Certificate or a 
decal to which he or she is not entitled, the person shall notify NMFS 
within 10 days following receipt.
    (e) Authorization Certificate and decal requirements. (1) If a decal 
has been issued under the conditions specified in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, the decal must be attached to the vessel on the port side 
of the cabin or, in the absence of a cabin, on the forward port side of 
the hull, and must be free of obstruction and in good condition. The 
decal must be attached to the Authorization Certificate for nonvessel 
fisheries.
    (2) The Authorization Certificate, or a copy, must be on board the 
vessel while it is operating in a Category I or II fishery, or, in the 
case of nonvessel fisheries, the Authorization Certificate with decal 
attached, or copy must be in the possession of the person in charge of 
the fishing operation. The Authorization Certificate, or copy, must be 
made available upon request to any state or Federal enforcement agent 
authorized to enforce the Act, any designated agent of NMFS, or any 
contractor providing observer services to NMFS.
    (3) Authorization Certificates and decals are not transferable. In 
the event of the sale or change in ownership of the vessel, the 
Authorization Certificate is void and the new owner must register for an 
Authorization Certificate and decal.
    (4) An Authorization Certificate holder must notify the issuing 
office in writing:
    (i) If the vessel or nonvessel fishing gear will engage in any 
Category I or II fishery not listed on the initial registration form at 
least 30 days prior to engaging in that fishery; and,
    (ii) If there are any changes in the mailing address or vessel 
ownership within 30 days of such change.
    (f) Reporting. Any Authorization Certificate holders must comply 
with the reporting requirements specified under Sec. 229.6.
    (g) Disposition of marine mammals. Any marine mammal incidentally 
taken must be immediately returned to the sea with a minimum of further 
injury, unless directed otherwise by NMFS personnel, a designated 
contractor or an official observer, or authorized otherwise by a 
scientific research permit that is in the possession of the operator.
    (h) Monitoring. Authorization Certificate holders must comply with 
the observer or other monitoring requirements specified under 
Sec. 229.7.
    (i) Deterrence. When necessary to deter a marine mammal from 
damaging fishing gear, catch, or other private property, or from 
endangering personal safety, vessel owners and crew members engaged in a 
Category I or II

[[Page 249]]

fishery must comply with all deterrence provisions set forth in the Act 
and all guidelines and prohibitions published thereunder.
    (j) Self defense. When imminently necessary in self-defense or to 
save the life of a person in immediate danger, a marine mammal may be 
lethally taken if such taking is reported to NMFS in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 229.6.
    (k) Take reduction plans and emergency regulations. Authorization 
Certificate holders must comply with any applicable take reduction plans 
and emergency regulations.
    (l) Expiration. Authorization Certificates expire at the end of each 
calendar year.

participants in nonvessel fisheries must provide the gear permit number.

[60 FR 45100, Aug. 30, 1995, as amended at 64 FR 9087, Feb. 24, 1999]

[[Page 250]]


<R05>
Sec. 229.7  Monitoring of incidental mortalities and serious injuries.

    (a) Purpose. The Assistant Administrator will establish a program to 
monitor incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals during 
the course of commercial fishing operations in order to:
    (1) Obtain statistically reliable estimates of incidental mortality 
and serious injury;
    (2) Determine the reliability of reports of incidental mortality and 
injury under Sec. 229.6; and
    (3) Identify changes in fishing methods or technology that may 
increase or decrease incidental mortality and serious injury.
    (b) Observer program. Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Assistant Administrator may observe Category I and II vessels as 
necessary. Observers may, among other tasks:
    (1) Record incidental mortality and injury, and bycatch of other 
nontarget species;
    (2) Record numbers of marine mammals sighted; and
    (3) Perform other scientific investigations, which may include, but 
are not limited to, sampling and photographing incidental mortalities 
and serious injuries.
    (c) Observer requirements for participants in Category I and II 
fisheries. (1) If requested by NMFS or by a designated contractor 
providing observer services to NMFS, a vessel owner/operator must take 
aboard an observer to accompany the vessel on fishing trips.
    (2) After being notified by NMFS, or by a designated contractor 
providing observer services to NMFS, that the vessel is required to 
carry an observer, the vessel owner/operator must comply with the 
notification by providing information requested within the specified 
time on scheduled or anticipated fishing trips.
    (3) NMFS, or a designated contractor providing observer services to 
NMFS, may waive the observer requirement based on a finding that the 
facilities for housing the observer or for carrying out observer 
functions are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the 
observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized.
    (4) The vessel owner/operator and crew must cooperate with the 
observer in the performance of the observer's duties including:
    (i) Providing, at no cost to the observer, the United States 
government, or the designated observer provider, food, toilet, bathing, 
sleeping accommodations, and other amenities that are equivalent to 
those provided to the crew, unless other arrangements are approved in 
advance by the Regional Administrator;
    (ii) Allowing for the embarking and debarking of the observer as 
specified by NMFS personnel or designated contractors. The operator of a 
vessel must ensure that transfers of observers at sea are accomplished 
in a safe manner, via small boat or raft, during daylight hours if 
feasible, as weather and sea conditions allow, and with the agreement of 
the observer involved;
    (iii) Allowing the observer access to all areas of the vessel 
necessary to conduct observer duties;
    (iv) Allowing the observer access to communications equipment and 
navigation equipment, when available on the vessel, as necessary to 
perform observer duties;
    (v) Providing true vessel locations by latitude and longitude, 
accurate to the minute, or by loran coordinates, upon request by the 
observer;
    (vi) Sampling, retaining, and storing of marine mammal specimens, 
other protected species specimens, or target or non-target catch 
specimens, upon request by NMFS personnel, designated contractors, or 
the observer, if adequate facilities are available and if feasible;
    (vii) Notifying the observer in a timely fashion of when all 
commercial fishing operations are to begin and end;
    (viii) Not impairing or in any way interfering with the research or 
observations being carried out; and
    (ix) Complying with other guidelines or regulations that NMFS may 
develop to ensure the effective deployment and use of observers.
    (5) Marine mammals or other specimens identified in paragraph 
(c)(4)(vi) of this section, which are readily accessible to crew 
members, must be

[[Page 251]]

brought on board the vessel and retained for the purposes of scientific 
research if feasible and requested by NMFS personnel, designated 
contractors, or the observer. Specimens so collected and retained must, 
upon request by NMFS personnel, designated contractors, or the observer, 
be retained in cold storage on board the vessel, if feasible, until 
removed at the request of NMFS personnel, designated contractors, or the 
observer, retrieved by authorized personnel of NMFS, or released by the 
observer for return to the ocean. These biological specimens may be 
transported on board the vessel during the fishing trip and back to port 
under this authorization.
    (d) Observer requirements for participants in Category III 
fisheries. (1) The Assistant Administrator may place observers on 
Category III vessels if the Assistant Administrator:
    (i) Believes that the incidental mortality and serious injury of 
marine mammals from such fishery may be contributing to the immediate 
and significant adverse impact on a species or stock listed as a 
threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species 
Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); and
    (ii) Has complied with Sec. 229.9(a)(3)(i) and (ii); or
    (iii) Has the consent of the vessel owner.
    (2) If an observer is placed on a Category III vessel, the vessel 
owner and/or operator must comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 229.7(c).
    (e) Alternative observer program. The Assistant Administrator may 
establish an alternative observer program to provide statistically 
reliable information on the species and number of marine mammals 
incidentally taken in the course of commercial fishing operations. The 
alternative observer program may include direct observation of fishing 
activities from vessels, airplanes, or points on shore.

Sec. 229.8  Publication of List of Fisheries.

    (a) The Assistant Administrator will publish in the Federal Register 
a proposed revised List of Fisheries on or about July 1 of each year for 
the purpose of receiving public comment. Each year, on or about October 
1, the Assistant Administrator will publish a final revised List of 
Fisheries, which will become effective January 1 of the next calendar 
year.
    (b) The proposed and final revised List of Fisheries will:
    (1) Categorize each commercial fishery based on the definitions of 
Category I, II, and III fisheries set forth in Sec. 229.2; and
    (2) List the marine mammals that have been incidentally injured or 
killed by commercial fishing operations and the estimated number of 
vessels or persons involved in each commercial fishery.
    (c) The Assistant Administrator may publish a revised List of 
Fisheries at other times, after notification and opportunity for public 
comment.
    (d) The revised final List of Fisheries will become effective no 
sooner than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 229.9  Emergency regulations.

    (a) If the Assistant Administrator finds that the incidental 
mortality or serious injury of marine mammals from commercial fisheries 
is having, or is likely to have, an immediate and significant adverse 
impact on a stock or species, the Assistant Administrator will:
    (1) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction 
plan is in effect--
    (i) Prescribe emergency regulations that, consistent with such plan 
to the maximum extent practicable, reduce incidental mortality and 
serious injury in that fishery; and
    (ii) Approve and implement on an expedited basis, any amendments to 
such plan that are recommended by the Take Reduction Team to address 
such adverse impact;
    (2) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction 
plan is being developed--
    (i) Prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental 
mortality and serious injury in that fishery; and
    (ii) Approve and implement, on an expedited basis, such plan, which 
will

[[Page 252]]

provide methods to address such adverse impact if still necessary;
    (3) In the case of a stock or species for which a take reduction 
plan does not exist and is not being developed, or in the case of a 
Category III fishery that the Assistant Administrator believes may be 
contributing to such adverse impact,
    (i) Prescribe emergency regulations to reduce such incidental 
mortality and serious injury in that fishery, to the extent necessary to 
mitigate such adverse impact;
    (ii) Immediately review the stock assessment for such stock or 
species and the classification of such commercial fishery under this 
section to determine if a take reduction team should be established and 
if recategorization of the fishery is warranted; and
    (iii) Where necessary to address such adverse impact on a species or 
stock listed as a threatened species or endangered species under the 
Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), place observers on 
vessels in a Category III fishery if the Assistant Administrator has 
reason to believe such vessels may be causing the incidental mortality 
and serious injury to marine mammals from such stock.
    (b) Prior to taking any action under Sec. 229.9(a)(1) through (3), 
the Assistant Administrator will consult with the Marine Mammal 
Commission, all appropriate Regional Fishery Management Councils, state 
fishery managers, and the appropriate take reduction team, if 
established.
    (c) Any emergency regulations issued under this section:
    (1) Shall be published in the Federal Register and will remain in 
effect for no more than 180 days or until the end of the applicable 
commercial fishing season, whichever is earlier, except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (2) May be terminated by notification in the Federal Register at an 
earlier date if the Assistant Administrator determines that the reasons 
for the emergency regulations no longer exist.
    (d) If the Assistant Administrator finds that incidental mortality 
and serious injury of marine mammals in a commercial fishery is 
continuing to have an immediate and significant adverse impact on a 
stock or species, the Assistant Administrator may extend the emergency 
regulations for an additional period of not more than 90 days or until 
reasons for the emergency regulations no longer exist, whichever is 
earlier.

operations, of marine mammals from a species or stock designated as 
depleted because of its listing as an endangered species or threatened 
species under the

[[Page 254]]

Endangered Species Act of 1973 if the Assistant Administrator determines 
that:
    (1) The incidental mortality and serious injury from commercial 
fisheries will have a negligible impact on such species or stock;
    (2) A recovery plan has been developed or is being developed for 
such species or stock pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973;

III fisheries for which determinations are made under the procedures of 
paragraph (b) of this section will not be subject to the penalties of 
this Act for the incidental taking of marine mammals to which this 
subpart applies, as long as the vessel owner or operator of such vessel 
reports any incidental mortality or injury of such marine mammals in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 229.6.
    (e) Emergency authority. During the course of the commercial fishing 
season, if the Assistant Administrator determines that the level of 
incidental mortality or serious injury from commercial fisheries for 
which such a determination was made under this section has resulted or 
is likely to result in an impact that is more than negligible on the 
endangered or threatened species or stock, the Assistant Administrator 
will use the emergency authority of Sec. 229.9 to protect such species 
or stock, and may modify any permit granted under this paragraph as 
necessary.
    (f) Suspension, revocation, modification and amendment. The 
Assistant Administrator may, pursuant to the provisions of 15 CFR part 
904, suspend or revoke a permit granted under this section if the

Sec. 229.31  Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan.

    (a) Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to implement 
the Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan. Paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of this section apply to all U.S. drift gillnet fishing 
vessels operating in waters seaward of the coast of California or 
Oregon, including adjacent high seas waters. For purposes of this 
section, the fishing season is defined as beginning May 1 and ending on 
January 31 of the following year.
    (b) Extenders. An extender is a line that attaches a buoy (float) to 
a drift gillnet's floatline. The floatline is attached to the top of the 
drift gillnet. All extenders (buoy lines) must be at least 6 fathoms (36 
ft; 10.9 m) in length during all sets. Accordingly, all floatlines must 
be fished at a minimum of 36 feet (10.9 m) below the surface of the 
water.
    (c) Pingers. (1) For the purposes of this paragraph (c), a pinger is 
an acoustic deterrent device which, when immersed in water, broadcasts a 
10 kHz ([<greek-p><greek-l><greek-th><greek-s><greek-m><greek-n>] 2 kHz) 
sound at 132 dB 
([<greek-p><greek-l><greek-th><greek-s><greek-m><greek-n>] 4 dB) re 1 
micropascal at 1 m, lasting 300 milliseconds (+ 15 milliseconds), and 
repeating every 4 seconds (+ .2 seconds); and remains operational to a 
water depth of at least 100 fathoms (600 ft or 182.88 m).
    (2) While at sea, operators of drift gillnet vessels with gillnets 
onboard must carry enough pingers on the vessel to meet the requirements 
set forth under paragraphs (c)(3) through(6) of this section.
    (3) Floatline. Pingers shall be attached within 30 ft (9.14 m) of 
the floatline and spaced no more than 300 ft (91.44 m) apart.
    (4) Leadline. Pingers shall be attached within 36 ft (10.97 m) of 
the leadline and spaced no more than 300 ft (91.44 m) apart.
    (5) Staggered Configuration. Pingers attached within 30 ft (9.14 m) 
of the floatline and within 36 ft (10.97 m) of the leadline shall be 
staggered such that the horizontal distance between them is no more than 
150 ft (45.5 m).
    (6) Any materials used to weight pingers must not change its 
specifications set forth under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (7) The pingers must be operational and functioning at all times 
during deployment.
    (8) If requested, NMFS may authorize the use of pingers with 
specifications or pinger configurations differing from those set forth 
in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3) of this section for limited, 
experimental purposes within a single fishing season.
    (d) Skipper education workshops. After notification from NMFS, 
vessel operators must attend a skipper education workshop before 
commencing fishing each fishing season. For the 1997/1998 fishing 
season, all vessel operators must have attended one skipper education 
workshop by October 30, 1997. NMFS may waive the requirement to attend 
these workshops by notice to all vessel operators.

    (3) Requirements for Southeast U.S. Observer Area. Any person who 
owns or fishes with specified fishing gear in the Southeast U.S. 
Observer Area must mark that gear in accordance with (b)(3)(i) and 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section, unless otherwise required by the Assistant 
Administrator under paragraph (g) of this section.
    (i) Color code. Specified gear in the Southeast U.S. Observer Area 
must be marked with the appropriate color code to designate gear types 
and areas as follows:
    (A) Gear type code--Gillnet gear. Gillnet gear must be marked with a 
green marking.
    (B) Area code. Gear set in the Southeast U.S. Observer Area must be 
marked with a blue marking.
    (ii) Markings. All specified gear in specified areas must be marked 
with two color codes, one designating the gear type, the other 
indicating the area where the gear is set. Each color of the two-color 
code must be permanently marked on or along the line or lines specified 
under (f)(2) of this section. Each color mark of the color codes must be 
clearly visible when the gear is hauled or removed from the water. Each 
mark must be at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) long. The two color marks must 
be placed within 6 inches (15.2 cm) of each other. If the color of the 
rope is the same as or similar to a color code, a white mark may be 
substituted for that color code. In marking or affixing the color code, 
the line may be dyed, painted, or marked with thin colored whipping 
line, thin colored plastic, or heat-shrink tubing, or other material; or 
a thin line may be woven into or through the line; or the line may be 
marked as approved in writing by the Assistant Administrator (AA).
    (4) Requirements for other specified areas. Any person who owns or

removed from the water. Each mark must be at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) 
long. The mark must be placed along the buoy line midway in the water 
column.
    (5) Changes to requirements. If the Assistant Administrator revises 
the gear marking requirements in accordance with paragraph (g) of this 
section, the gear must be marked in compliance with those requirements.
    (c) Restrictions applicable to lobster trap gear in regulated 
waters--(1) Universal lobster trap gear requirements. In addition to the 
area-specific measures listed in (c)(2) through (c)(8) of this section, 
all lobster trap gear in regulated waters, including the Northern 
Inshore State Lobster Waters Area, must comply with the universal gear 
requirements listed here\1\. The Assistant Administrator may revise 
these requirements in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Fishers are also encouraged to maintain their buoy lines to be 
as knot-free as possible. Splices are not considered to be an 
entanglement threat and are thus preferable to knots.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) No line floating at the surface. No person may fish with lobster 
trap gear that has any portion of the buoy line that is directly 
connected to the gear at the ocean bottom floating at the surface at any 
time. If more than one buoy is attached to a single buoy line or if a 
high flyer and a buoy are used together on a single buoy line, floating 
line may be used between these objects.
    (ii) No wet storage of gear. Lobster traps must be hauled out of the 
water at least once every 30 days.
    (2) Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area--(i) Area. The CCB restricted area 
consists of the CCB right whale critical habitat area specified under 50 
CFR 226.203(b) unless the Assistant Administrator changes that area in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (ii) Area-specific gear requirements during the winter restricted 
period. No person may fish with lobster trap gear in the CCB Restricted 
Area during the winter restricted period unless that person's gear 
complies with the gear marking requirements in paragraph (b) of this 
section, the universal lobster trap gear requirements in (c)(1) of this 
section, and the area-specific requirements listed below for the winter 
restricted period. The Assistant Administrator may revise these 
requirements in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (A) Winter restricted period. The winter restricted period for the 
CCB Restricted Area is from January 1 through May 15 of each year unless 
the Assistant Administrator changes that area in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (B) Weak links. All buoy lines shall be attached to the main buoy 
with a weak link meeting the following specifications:
    (1) The breaking strength of the weak link must not exceed 500 lb 
(226.7 kg).
    (2) The weak link must be chosen from the following list of 
combinations approved by the NMFS gear research program: swivels, 
plastic weak links, rope of appropriate diameter, hog

[[Page 258]]

rings, rope stapled to a buoy stick, or other materials or devices 
approved in writing by the Assistant Administrator.
    (C) Single traps and multiple-trap trawls. Single traps and three-
trap trawls are prohibited. All traps must be set in either a two-trap

each 50-fathom (300-ft or 91.4-m) net panel in a net string or every 25 
fathoms for longer panels.
    (2) The breaking strength of these weak links may not exceed 1,100 
lb (498.8 kg).
    (C) Tending/anchoring. All gillnets must return to port with the 
vessel or be anchored at each end with an anchor capable of the holding 
power of at least a 22-lb (10.0-kg) Danforth-style anchor.
    (8) Gillnet Take Reduction Technology List. The following gear 
characteristics comprise the Gillnet Take Reduction Technology List:
    (i) All buoy lines are attached to the buoy line with a weak link 
having a maximum breaking strength of up to 1,100 lb (498.8 kg). Weak 
links may include swivels, plastic weak links, rope of appropriate 
diameter, hog rings, rope stapled to a buoy stick, or other materials or 
devices approved in writing by the Assistant Administrator.
    (ii) Weak links with a breaking strength of up to 1,100 lb (498.8 
kg) must be inserted in the center of the floatline (headrope) of each 
50 fathom net panel or every 25 fathoms for longer panels.
    (iii) All buoy lines must be comprised entirely of sinking and/or 
neutrally buoyant line.
    (e) Restrictions applicable to mid-Atlantic driftnet gear--(1) 
Restrictions. From December 1 through March 31 of the following year, no 
person may fish with driftnet gear at night in the mid-Atlantic coastal 
waters area unless that gear is tended. During that time, all driftnet 
gear set by that vessel in the

[[Page 264]]

mid-Atlantic coastal waters area must be removed from the water and 
stowed on board the vessel before a vessel returns to port. The 
Assistant Administrator may revise these requirements in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (f) Restrictions applicable to shark gillnet gear--(1) Management 
areas--(i) Southeast U.S. restricted area. The southeast U.S. restricted 
area consists of the area from 32[deg]00[min] N lat. (near Savannah, GA) 
south to 27[deg]51[min] N lat. (near Sebastian Inlet, FL), extending 
from the shore eastward to 80[deg]00[min] W long., unless the Assistant 
Administrator changes that area in accordance with paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (ii) Southeast U.S. observer area. The southeast U.S. observer area 
consists of the southeast U.S. restricted area and an additional area 
along the coast south to 26[deg]46.5[min] N lat. (near West Palm Beach, 
FL) and extending from the shore eastward out to 80[deg]00[min] W long., 
unless the Assistant Administrator changes that area in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (2) Gear marking requirements. From November 15 through March 31 of 
the following year, no person may fish with gillnet gear in the 
southeast U.S. observer area unless that gear is marked according to the 
gear marking code specified under paragraph (b) of this section. All 
buoy lines must be marked within 2 ft (0.6 m) of the top of the buoy 
line and midway along the length of the buoy line. From November 15, 
1999, each net panel must be marked along both the float line and the 
lead line at least once every 100 yards (92.4 m).
    (3) Restrictions--(i) Observer requirement. No person may fish with 
shark gillnet gear in the southeast U.S. observer area from November 15 
through March 31 of the following year unless the operator of the vessel 
calls the SE Regional Office in St. Petersburg, FL, not less than 48 
hours prior to departing on any fishing trip in order to arrange for 
observer coverage. If the Regional Office requests that an observer be 
taken on board a vessel during a fishing trip at any time from November 
15 through March 31 of the following year, no person may fish with shark 
gillnet gear aboard that vessel in the southeast U.S. observer area 
unless an observer is on board that vessel during the trip.
    (ii) Closure. Except as provided under paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this 
section, no person may fish with shark gillnet gear in the southeast 
U.S. restricted area during the closed period. The closed period for 
this area is from November 15 through March 31 of the following year, 
unless the Assistant Administrator changes that closed period in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (iii) Special provision for strikenets. Fishing for sharks with 
strikenet gear is exempt from the restriction under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) 
of this section if:
    (A) No nets are set at night or when visibility is less than 500 
yards (460 m).
    (B) Each set is made under the observation of a spotter plane.
    (C) No net is set within 3 nautical miles of a right, humpback, fin 
or minke whale.
    (D) If a right, humpback, fin or minke whale moves within 3 nautical 
miles of the set gear, the gear is removed immediately from the water.
    (g) Other provisions. In addition to any other emergency authority 
under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, or other 
appropriate authority, the Assistant administrator may take action under 
this section in the following situations:
    (1) Entanglements in critical habitat. If a serious injury or 
mortality of a right whale occurs in the Cape Cod Bay critical habitat 
from January 1 through May 15, in the Great South Channel Restricted 
Area from April 1 through June 30, or in the Southeast U.S. Restricted 
Area from November 15 through March 31 as a result of an entanglement by 
lobster or gillnet gear allowed to be used in those areas and times, the 
Assistant Administrator shall close that area to that gear type for the 
rest of that time period and for that same time period in each 
subsequent year, unless the Assistant Administrator revises the 
restricted period in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section or 
unless other measures are implemented under paragraph (g)(2).

[[Page 265]]

    (2) Other special measures. The Assistant Administrator may revise 
the requirements of this section through a publication in the Federal 
Register if:
    (i) NMFS verifies that certain gear characteristics are both 
operationally effective and reduce serious injuries and mortalities of 
endangered whales;
    (ii) New gear technology is developed and determined to be 
appropriate;
    (iii) Revised breaking strengths are determined to be appropriate;
    (iv) New marking systems are developed and determined to be 
appropriate;
    (v) NMFS determines that right whales are remaining longer than 
expected in a closed area or have left earlier than expected;
    (vi) NMFS determines that the boundaries of a closed area are not 
appropriate;
    (vii) Gear testing operations are considered appropriate; or
    (viii) Similar situations occur.
    (3) For the purpose of reducing the risk of fishery interactions 
with right whales, NMFS may establish a temporary Dynamic Area 
Management (DAM) zone in the following manner:
    (i) Trigger. Upon receipt of a single reliable report from a 
qualified individual of three or more right whales within an area NMFS 
will plot each individual sighting (event) and draw a circle with a 2.8 
nm (5.2 km) radius around it, which will be adjusted for the number of 
right whales sighted such that a density of at least 0.04 right whales 
per nm2 (1.85 km2) is maintained within the circle. If any circle or 
group of contiguous circles includes 3 or more right whales, NMFS would 
consider this core area and its surrounding waters a candidate DAM zone.
    (ii) DAM zone. Areas for consideration for DAM zones are limited to 
areas north of 40o N latitude. Having identified any circle or group of 
contiguous circles including 3 or more right whales as candidates for 
protection, as identified in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, NMFS 
will determine the extent of the DAM zone as follows:
    (A) A larger circular zone will be drawn to extend 15 nm (27.8 km) 
from the perimeter of a circle around each core area.
    (B) The DAM zone will then be defined by a polygon drawn outside but 
tangential to the circular buffer zone(s). The latitudinal and 
longitudinal coordinates of the corners of the polygon will then be 
identified.
    (iii) Requirements and prohibitions within DAM zones. Notice of 
specific area restrictions will be published in the Federal Register and 
will become effective 2 days after publication. Gear not in compliance 
with the imposed restrictions may not be set in the DAM zone after the 
effective date. NMFS may either:
    (A) require owners of gillnet and lobster gear set within the DAM 
zone to remove all such gear within 2 days after notice is published in 
the Federal Register, or
    (B) allow fishing within a DAM zone with gear modifications 
determined by NMFS to sufficiently reduce the risk of entanglement to 
right whales. Acceptable fishing practices and gear modifications would 
be identified in the Federal Register notification implementing the DAM 
zone.
    (C) The determination of whether restrictions will be imposed within 
a DAM zone would be based on NMFS' review of a variety of factors, 
including but not limited to: the location of the DAM zone with respect 
to other fishery closure areas, weather conditions as they relate to the 
safety of human life at sea, the type and amount of gear already present 
in the area, and a review of recent right whale entanglement and 
mortality data.
    (iv) Restricted period. Any DAM zone will remain in effect for a 
minimum period of 15 days. At the conclusion of the 15-day period, the 
DAM zone will expire automatically unless it is extended by subsequent 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (v) Extensions of the restricted period. Any 15-day period may be 
extended if NMFS determines that the trigger established in paragraph 
(g)(3)(i) of this section continues to be met.
    (vi) Reopening of restricted zone. NMFS may remove any gear 
restriction or prohibition and reopen the DAM zone prior to its 
automatic expiration if there are no confirmed sightings of right whales 
for at least 1

[[Page 266]]

week, or other credible evidence indicates that right whales have left 
the DAM zone. NMFS will notify the public of the reopening of a DAM zone 
prior to the expiration of the 15-day period by issuing a document in 
the Federal Register and through other appropriate media.
    (4) Seasonal Area Management (SAM) Program. All vessels deploying 
anchored gillnet or lobster trap gear may fish in the SAM Areas as 
described in paragraphs (g)(4)(i)(A) and (g)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, 
provided the vessel complies with the gear requirements during the times 
specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(i)(B) and (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. 
Copies of a chart depicting these areas are available from the Regional 
Administrator upon request.
    (i) SAM West. (A) Area. SAM West consists of all waters bounded by 
straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) Gear requirements. Unless otherwise authorized by the Assistant 
Administrator for Fisheries, NMFS, in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section, from March 1 through April 30, no person may fish with 
anchored gillnet or lobster gear unless that person's gear complies with 
the following gear characteristics:
    (1) Anchored gillnet gear. (i) Ground line--All ground lines area 
made entirely of sinking or neutrally buoyant line.
    (ii) Buoy weak links--All buoy lines are attached to the buoy with a 
weak link having a maximum breaking strength of up to 1,100 lb (498.9 
kg). Weak links may include swivels, plastic weak links, rope of 
appropriate diameter, hog rings, rope stapled to a buoy stick, or other 
materials or devices approved in writing by the Assistant Administrator.
    (iii) Net panel weak link--Each net panel must have a total of five 
weak links. The breaking strength of these weak links must not exceed 
1,100 lb (498.9 kg). The weak link requirements apply to all variations 
in panel size. Three of the five weak links must be located on the 
floatline. One floatline weak link must be placed at the center of the 
net panel, and two weak links must be placed as close as possible to 
each of the bridle ends of the net panel. The remaining two of the five 
weak links must be placed in the center of each of the up and down lines 
at either end of each panel.
    (iv) Buoy line--No more than one buoy line per net string may be 
used, and it must be deployed at the northern or western end of the 
gillnet string depending on the direction of the set.
    (v) Gillnet anchor--All anchored gillnets, regardless of the number 
of net panels, must be securely anchored with a holding power of at 
least a 22-lb (9.9-kg) Danforth-style anchor at each end of the net 
string.
    (2) Lobster Trap gear. (i) Sinking ground line--All ground lines 
must be made entirely of sinking or neutrally buoyant line.
    (ii) Offshore Lobster buoy weak links--All buoy lines must be 
attached to the buoy with a weak link having a maximum breaking strength 
of up to 1,500 lb (680.4 kg). Weak links may include swivels, plastic 
weak links, rope of appropriate diameter, hog rings, rope stapled to a 
buoy stick, or other materials or devices approved in writing by the 
Assistant Administrator.
    (iii) Buoy line--No more than one buoy line per trawl is allowed. 
The buoy line must be attached to the northern or western end of the 
trawl string depending on the direction of the set. These requirements 
supersede the requirements found at Sec. 697.21, which require one radar 
reflector at each end of a trawl with more than three traps.
    (ii) SAM East. (A) Area. SAM East consists of all waters bounded by 
straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated:

    (B) Gear requirements. Unless otherwise authorized by the Assistant 
Administrator for Fisheries, NMFS, in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section, from May 1 through July 31, no person may fish with 
anchored gillnet or lobster gear unless that person's gear complies with 
the gear characteristics found at paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B) of this 
section.
    Note to Sec. 229.32:
    Additional regulations that affect fishing with lobster trap gear 
have also been issued under authority of the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries 
Cooperative Management Act in part 697 of this title.

    (3) Observer requirement. No person may fish with shark gillnet gear 
in the southeast U.S. observer area from November 15 through March 31 of 
the following year unless the operator of the vessel calls the SE 
Regional Office in St. Petersburg, FL not less than 48 hours prior to 
departing on any fishing trip in order to arrange for observer coverage. 
If the Regional Office requests that an observer be taken on board a 
vessel during a fishing trip at any time from November 15 through March 
31 of the following year, no person may fish with shark gillnet gear 
aboard that vessel in the southeast U.S. observer area unless an 
observer is on board that vessel during the trip.
    (4) Restricted period, closure and restrictions, and exemption. (i) 
Restricted period. The restricted period for the southeast U.S. 
restricted area is from November 15 through March 31 of the following 
year, unless the Assistant Administrator revises this restricted period 
in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

    (b) Pingers--(1) Pinger specifications. For the purposes of this 
subpart, a pinger is an acoustic deterrent device which, when immersed 
in water, broadcasts a 10 kHz 
([<greek-p><greek-l><greek-th><greek-s><greek-m><greek-n>]2 kHz) sound 
at 132 dB ([<greek-p><greek-l><greek-th><greek-s><greek-m><greek-n>]4 
dB) re 1 micropascal at 1 m, lasting 300 milliseconds 
([<greek-p><greek-l><greek-th><greek-s><greek-m><greek-n>]15 
milliseconds), and repeating every 4 seconds 
([<greek-p><greek-l><greek-th><greek-s><greek-m><greek-n>].2 seconds).
    (2) Pinger attachment. An operating and functional pinger must be 
attached at the end of each string of the gillnets and at the bridle of 
every net within a string of nets.
    (c) Pinger training and certification. Beginning on January 1, 1999, 
the operator of a vessel may not fish with, set or haul back sink 
gillnets or gillnet gear, or allow such gear to be in closed areas where 
pingers are required as specified under paragraph (b) of this section, 
unless the operator has satisfactorily completed the pinger 
certification training program and possesses on board the vessel a valid 
pinger training certificate issued by NMFS. Notice will be given 
announcing the times and locations of pinger certification training 
programs.
    (d) Use of pingers in closed areas--(1) Vessels, subject to the 
restrictions and regulations specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, may fish in the Mid-coast Closure Area from September 15 
through May 31 of each fishing year, provided that pingers are used in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this 
section.
    (2) Vessels, subject to the restrictions and regulations specified 
in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, may fish in the Massachusetts Bay 
Closure Area from December 1 through the last day of February and from 
April 1 through May 31 of each fishing year, provided that pingers are 
used in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) 
of this section.
    (3) Vessels, subject to the restrictions and regulations specified 
in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, may fish in the Cape Cod South 
Closure Area from December 1 through the last day of February and from 
April 1 through May 31 of each fishing year, provided that pingers are 
used in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) 
of this section.
    (4) Vessels, subject to the restrictions and regulations specified 
in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, may fish in the Offshore Closure 
Area from November 1 through May 31 of each fishing year, with the 
exception of the Cashes Ledge Closure Area. From February 1 through the 
end of February, the area within the Offshore Closure Area defined as 
``Cashes Ledge'' is closed to all fishing with sink gillnets. Vessels 
subject to the restrictions and regulation specified in paragraph (a)(5) 
of this section may fish in the Offshore Closure Area outside the Cashes 
Ledge Area from February 1 through the end of February provided that 
pingers are used in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) 
(1) and (2) of this section.
    (e) Other special measures. The Assistant Administrator may revise 
the requirements of this section through notification published in the 
Federal Register if:
    (1) After plan implementation, NMFS determines that pinger operating 
effectiveness in the commercial fishery is inadequate to reduce bycatch 
to the PBR level with the current plan.
    (2) NMFS determines that the boundary or timing of a closed area is 
inappropriate, or that gear modifications (including pingers) are not 
reducing bycatch to below the PBR level.

restrictions shall also be incorporated in the relevant cooperative 
agreements.

[[Page 276]]

    (b) The relevant Native American whaling organization shall monitor 
the whale hunt and keep tally of the number of whales landed and struck. 
When a quota is reached, the organization shall declare the whaling 
season closed, and there shall be no further whaling under that quota 
during the calendar year. If the organization fails to close the whaling 
season after the quota has been reached, the Assistant Administrator may 
close it by filing notification in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 230.7  Salvage of stinkers.

    (a) Any person salvaging a stinker shall submit to the Assistant 
Administrator or his/her representative an oral or written report 
describing the circumstances of the salvage within 12 hours of such 
salvage. He/she shall provide promptly to the Assistant Administrator or 
his/her representative each harpoon, lance, or explosive dart found in 
or attached to the stinker. The device shall be returned to the owner 
thereof promptly, unless it is retained as evidence of a possible 
violation.
    (b) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a stinker has been 
struck by the captain whose mark appears on the harpoon, lance, or 
explosive dart found in or attached thereto, and, if no strike has been 
reported by such captain, such strike shall be deemed to have occurred 
at the time of recovery of the device.


<R05>
Sec. 230.8  Reporting by whaling captains.

    (a) The relevant Native American whaling organization shall require 
each whaling captain licensed pursuant to Sec. 230.5 to provide a 
written statement of his/her name and village of domicile and a 
description of the distinctive marking to be placed on each harpoon, 
lance, and explosive dart.
    (b) Each whaling captain shall provide to the relevant Native 
American whaling organization an oral or written report of whaling 
activities including but not limited to the striking, attempted 
striking, or landing of a whale and, where possible, specimens from 
landed whales. The Assistant Administrator is authorized to provide 
technological assistance to facilitate prompt reporting and collection 
of specimens from landed whales, including but not limited to ovaries, 
ear plugs, and baleen plates. The report shall include at least the 
following information:
    (1) The number, dates, and locations of each strike, attempted 
strike, or landing.
    (2) The length (taken as the straight-line measurement from the tip 
of the upper jaw to the notch between the tail flukes) and the sex of 
the whales landed.
    (3) The length and sex of a fetus, if present in a landed whale.
    (4) An explanation of circumstances associated with the striking or 
attempted striking of any whale not landed.
    (c) If the relevant Native American whaling organization fails to 
provide the National Marine Fisheries Service the required reports, the 
Assistant Administrator may require the reports to be submitted by the 
whaling captains directly to the National Marine Fisheries Service.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 253.1  Purpose.

    (a) The regulations in this part pertain to fisheries assistance 
programs. Subpart B of these rules governs the Fisheries Obligation 
Guarantee Program, which guarantees the repayment of certain long-term 
fisheries and aquacultural debts. This allows those debts to be placed 
in the same private investment market that buys U.S. Treasury 
securities, where interest rates are lower and maturities are longer. 
The Program does all credit work and holds and services all credit 
collateral. The Program's guarantee fee makes it self-supporting.
    (b) Subpart C implements Title III of Public Law 99-659 (16 U.S.C. 
4100 et seq.), which has two objectives:
    (1) To promote and encourage State activities in support of the 
management of interjurisdictional fishery resources identified in 
interstate or Federal fishery management plans; and
    (2) To promote and encourage management of interjurisdictional 
fishery resources throughout their range.
    (3) The scope of this part includes guidance on making financial 
assistance awards to States or Interstate Commissions to undertake 
projects in support of management of interjurisdictional fishery 
resources in both the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and State waters, 
and to encourage States to enter into enforcement agreements with either 
the Department of Commerce or the Department of the Interior.

<R05>
Sec. 253.11  Guarantee policy.

    (a) A guarantee financing or refinancing up to 80 percent of a 
project's actual cost shall be available to any qualified citizen 
otherwise eligible under the Act and these rules, except:
    (1) Vessel construction. The Program will not finance this project 
cost. The Program will only refinance this project cost for an existing 
vessel whose previous construction cost has already been financed (or 
otherwise paid). Refinancing this project cost for a vessel that already 
exists is not inconsistent with wise use, but financing it may be.
    (2) Vessel refurbishing that materially increases an existing 
vessel's harvesting capacity. The Program will not finance this project 
cost. The Program will only refinance this project cost for a vessel 
whose previous refurbishing cost has already been financed (or otherwise 
paid). Refinancing this project cost is not inconsistent with wise use, 
but financing it may be.
    (3) Purchasing a used vessel or used fishery facility. The Program 
will neither finance nor refinance this project cost (except for a used 
vessel or fishery facility that the Program purchased and is reselling), 
unless the used vessel or fishery facility will be refurbished in the 
United States and will be a contributory project or it will be used in 
an underutilized fishery.
    (b) Every project, other than those specified in paragraphs (a) (1) 
and (2) of this section, is consistent with wise use and every project, 
other than those specifically precluded in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of 
this section, may be financed, as well as refinanced.


<R05>
Sec. 253.12  Guaranteed note, U.S. note, and security documents.

    (a) Guaranteed note--(1) Principal. This may not exceed 80 percent 
of actual cost, but may, in the Division's credit judgment, be less.
    (2) Maturity. This may not exceed 25 years, but shall not exceed the 
project property's useful life and may, in the Division's credit 
judgment, be less.
    (3) Interest rate. This may not exceed the amount the Division deems 
reasonable.
    (4) Prepayment penalty. The Division will allow a reasonable 
prepayment penalty, but the guarantor will not guarantee a notemaker's 
payment of it.
    (5) Form. This will be the simple promissory note (with the 
guarantee attached) the Division prescribes, promising only to pay 
principal, interest, and prepayment penalty.
    (6) Sole security. The guaranteed note and the guarantee will be the 
noteholder's sole security.
    (b) U.S. note and security documents--(1) Form. The U.S. note and 
security documents will be in the form the Division prescribes.
    (2) U.S. note. This exists to evidence the notemaker's actual and 
contingent liability to the guarantor (contingent if the guarantor does 
not pay the guaranteed note (including any portion of it), on the 
notemaker's behalf or if the guarantor does not advance any other 
amounts or incur any other expenses on the notemaker's behalf to protect 
the U.S. or accommodate the notemaker; actual if, and to the same 
monetary extent that, the guarantor does). Payment of the guaranteed 
note

[[Page 280]]

by anyone but the guarantor will amortize the original principal balance 
(and interest accruing on it) of the U.S. note to the same extent that 
it amortizes the guaranteed note. The U.S note will, among other things, 
contain provisions for adding to its principal balance all amounts the 
Program advances, or expenses it incurs, to protect the U.S. or 
accommodate the notemaker.
    (3) Security documents. The Division will, at a minimum, require a 
pledge of all project property (or adequate substitute collateral). The 
Division will require such other security as it deems the circumstances 
of each notemaker and project require to protect the U.S. All security 
documents will secure the U.S. note. The security documents will, among 
other things, contain provisions for adding to the U.S. note all Program 
advances, expenditures, and expenses required to protect the U.S. or 
accommodate the notemaker.
    (4) Recourse. Significant Program reliance, as a secondary means of 
repayment, on the net worths of parties other than the notemaker will 
ordinarily require secured recourse against those net worths. Recourse 
may be by a repayment guarantee or irrevocable letter of credit. 
Ordinarily, the Division will require recourse against: All major 
shareholders of a closely-held corporate notemaker, the parent 
corporation of a subsidiary corporate notemaker without substantial 
pledged assets other than the project property, and all major limited 
partners. The Division may also require recourse against others it deems 
necessary to protect the U.S. The principal parties in interest, who 
ultimately stand most to benefit from the project, should ordinarily be 
held financially accountable for the project's performance. Where 
otherwise appropriate recourse is unavailable, the conservatively 
projected net liquidating value of the notemaker's assets pledged to the 
Program must, in the Division's credit judgment, substantially exceed 
all projected Program exposure.
    (c) Dual-use CCF. For a vessel, the Division may require annually 
depositing some portion of the project property's net income into a 
dual-use CCF. A dual-use CCF provides the normal CCF tax-deferral 
benefits, but also both gives the Program control of CCF withdrawals and 
recourse against CCF deposits and ensures an emergency refurbishing 
reserve (tax-deferred) for project property.


<R05>
Sec. 253.13  Ability and experience requirements.

    A notemaker and the majority of its principals must generally have 
the ability, experience, resources, character, reputation, and other 
qualifications the Division deems necessary for successfully operating 
the project property and protecting the U.S. The Program will ordinarily 
not provide guarantees: For venture capital purposes; to a notemaker 
whose principals are all from outside the industry; or for a notemaker 
the majority of whose principals cannot document successful industry 
ability and experience of a duration, degree, and nature consistent with 
protecting the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 253.14  Economic and financial requirements.

    (a) Income and expense projections. The Division's conservative 
income and expense projections for the project property's operation must 
prospectively indicate net earnings that can service all debt, properly 
maintain the project property, and protect the U.S. against the 
industry's cyclical economics and other risks of loss.
    (b) Working capital. The Division's conservative assessment of an 
applicant's financial condition must indicate initial working capital 
prospectively sufficient to provide for the project property to achieve 
net earnings projections, fund all foreseeable contingencies, and 
protect the U.S. At the Division's discretion, some portion of projected 
working capital needs may be met by something other than current assets 
minus current liabilities (i.e., by a line or letter of credit, 
noncurrent assets readily capable of generating working capital, a 
guarantor with sufficient financial resources, etc.).
    (c) Audited financial statements. These will ordinarily be required 
for any notemaker with large or financially extensive operations whose 
financial condition the Division believes it cannot

[[Page 281]]

otherwise assess with reasonable certainty.
    (d) Consultant services. Infrequently, expert consulting services 
may be necessary to help the Division assess a project's economic, 
technical, or financial feasibility. The Division will select and employ 
the necessary consultant, but require the applicant to reimburse the 
Division. A subsequently approved application will not be closed until 
the applicant reimburses the Division. This cost may, at the Division's 
discretion, be included in a guaranteed note's amount. For a declined 
application, the Division may reimburse itself from the remaining 25 
percent of the application fee.


<R05>
Sec. 253.15  Miscellaneous.

    (a) Applicant. Only the legal title holder of project property (or 
the lessee of an appropriate long-term financing lease) may apply for a 
guarantee. Applicants must submit an ``Application for Fisheries 
Obligation Program Guarantee'' to the appropriate NMFS Regional 
Financial Services Branch to be considered for a guaranteed loan.
    (b) Investigation and approval. The Division shall do a due 
diligence investigation of every application it accepts and determine 
if, in the Division's sole judgment, the application is eligible and 
qualified. Applications the Division deems ineligible or unqualified 
will be declined. The Division will approve eligible and qualified 
applications based on the applicability of the information obtained 
during the application and investigation process to the programmatic 
goals and financial requirements of the program and under terms and 
conditions that, in the Division's sole discretion, protect the U.S. The 
Division will state these terms and conditions in its approval in 
principal letter.
    (c) Insurance. All property and other risks shall be continuously 
insured during the term of the U.S. note. Insurers must be acceptable to 
the Division. Insurance must be in such forms and amounts and against 
such risks as the Division deems necessary to protect the U.S. Insurance 
must be endorsed to include the requirements the U.S., as respects its 
interest only, deems necessary to protect the U.S. (e.g., the Program 
will ordinarily be an additional insured as well as the sole loss payee 
for the amount of its interest; cancellation will require 20 days' 
advance written notice; vessel seaworthiness will be admitted, and the 
Program will be adequately protected against other insureds' breaches of 
policy warranties, negligence, omission, etc.)
    (d) Property inspections. The Division will require adequate 
condition and valuation inspection of all property as the basis for 
assessing the property's worth and suitability for guarantee. The 
Division may also require these at specified periods during guarantee 
life. These must be conducted by competent and impartial inspectors 
acceptable to the Division. Inspection cost will be at an applicant's 
expense. Those occurring before application approval may be included in 
actual cost.
    (e) Guarantee terms and conditions. The Division's approval in 
principle letter shall specify the terms and conditions of the 
guarantor's willingness to guarantee. These shall be incorporated in 
closing documents that the Division prepares. Terms and conditions are 
at the Division's sole discretion. An applicant's nonacceptance will 
result in disqualification for guarantee.
    (f) Noteholder. The Division will, as a gratuitous service, request 
parties interested in investing in guaranteed notes to submit offers to 
fund each prospective guaranteed note. The Division and the applicant 
will, by mutual consent, choose the responsive bidder, which ordinarily 
will be the prospective noteholder whose bid represents the lowest net 
effective annual cost of capital. Until the Division has closed the 
guarantee, arrangements between an applicant and a prospective 
noteholder are a matter of private contract between them, and the 
Program is not responsible to either for nonperformance by the other.
    (g) Closing--(1) Approval in principle letters. Every closing will 
be in strict accordance with a final approval in principle letter.
    (2) Contracts. The guaranteed note, U.S. note, and security 
documents will ordinarily be on standard Program forms that may not be 
altered without Divisional approval. The Division will

[[Page 282]]

ordinarily prepare all contracts, except certain pledges involving real 
property, which will be prepared by each notemaker's attorney at the 
direction and approval of the Division's attorney.
    (3) Closing schedules. The Division will ordinarily close guarantee 
transactions with minimal services from applicants' attorneys, except 
where real property pledges or other matters appropriate for private 
counsel are involved. Real property services required from an 
applicant's attorney may include: Title search, mortgage and other 
document preparation, execution and recording, escrow and disbursement, 
and a legal opinion and other assurances. An applicant's attorney's 
expense, and that of any other private contractor required, is for 
applicant's account. Attorneys and other contractors must be 
satisfactory to the Division. The Division will attempt to meet 
reasonable closing schedules, but will not be liable for adverse 
interest-rate fluctuations, loss of commitments, or other consequences 
of being unable to meet an applicant's and a prospective noteholder's 
closing schedule. These parties should work closely with the Division to 
ensure a closing schedule the Division can meet.


<R05>
Sec. 253.16  Fees.

    (a) Application fee. The Division will not accept an application 
without the application fee. Fifty percent of the application fee is 
fully earned at application acceptance, and is not refundable. The rest 
is fully earned when the Division issues an approval in principal 
letter, and it is refundable only if the Division declines an 
application or an applicant requests refund before the Division issues 
an approval in principal letter.
    (b) Guarantee fee. Each guarantee fee will be due in advance and 
will be based on the guaranteed note's repayment provisions for the 
prospective year. The first annual guarantee fee is due at guarantee 
closing. Each subsequent one is due and payable on the guarantee 
closing's anniversary date. Each is fully earned when due, and shall not 
subsequently be refunded for any reason.
    (c) Refinancing or assumption fee. This fee applies only to 
refinancing or assuming existing guaranteed notes. It is due upon 
application for refinancing or assuming a guaranteed note. It is fully 
earned when due and shall be nonrefundable. The Division may waive a 
refinancing or assumption fee's payment when the refinancing or 
assumption's primary purpose is to protect the U.S.
    (d) Where payable. Fees are payable by check made payable to ``NMFS/
FSFF.'' Other than those collected at application or closing, fees are 
payable by mailing checks to: U.S. Department of Commerce, National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries 
Service, P.O. Box 73004, Chicago, Ill. 60673. To ensure proper 
crediting, each check must include the official case number the Division 
assigns to each guarantee.


<R05>
Sec. 253.17  Demand and payment.

    Every demand must be delivered in writing to the Division. Each must 
include the noteholder's certified record of the date and amount of each 
payment made on the guaranteed note and the manner of its application. 
Should the Division not acknowledge receipt of a timely demand, the 
noteholder must possess evidence of the demand's timely delivery.


<R05>
Sec. 253.18  Program operating guidelines.

    The Division may issue Program operating guidelines, as the need 
arises, governing national Program policy and administrative issues not 
addressed by these rules.


<R05>
Sec. 253.19  Default and liquidation.

    Upon default of the security documents, the Division shall take such 
remedial action (including, where appropriate, liquidation) as it deems 
best able to protect the U.S.' interest.

equally weighted average of the volume and value of fishery resources 
harvested by domestic commercial fishermen and landed within such state 
during the 3 most recent calendar years for which data satisfactory to 
the Secretary are available bears to the total equally weighted average 
of the volume and value of all fishery resources harvested by domestic 
commercial fishermen and landed within all of the states during those 
calendar years.
    (1) The equally weighted average value is determined by the 
following formula:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01MY96.005

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01MY96.006

    (2) Upon appropriation of funds by Congress, the Secretary will take 
the following actions:
    (i) Determine each state's share according to the apportionment 
formula.
    (ii) Certify the funds to the respective NMFS Regional Director.
    (iii) Instruct NMFS Regional Directors to promptly notify states of 
funds' availability.
    (b) No state, under the apportionment formula in paragraph (a) of 
this section, that has a ratio of one-third of 1 percent or higher may 
receive an apportionment for any fiscal year that is less than 1 percent 
of the total amount of funds available for that fiscal year.
    (c) If a State's ratio under the apportionment formula in paragraph 
(b) of this section is less than one-third of 1 percent, that state may 
receive funding if the state:
    (1) Is signatory to an interstate fishery compact;
    (2) Has entered into an enforcement agreement with the Secretary 
and/or the Secretary of the Interior for a fishery that is managed under 
an interstate fishery management plan;
    (3) Borders one or more of the Great Lakes;
    (4) Has entered into an interstate cooperative fishery management 
agreement and has in effect an interstate fisheries management plan or 
an interstate fisheries research program; or
    (5) Has adopted a Federal fishery management plan for an 
interjurisdictional fishery resource.
    (d) Any state that has a ratio of less than one-third of 1 percent 
and meets any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) 
through (5) of this section may receive an apportionment for any fiscal 
year that is not less than 0.5 percent of the total amount of funds 
available for apportionment for such fiscal year.
    (e) No state may receive an apportionment under this section for any 
fiscal year that is more than 6 percent of the total amount of funds 
available for apportionment for such fiscal year.
    (f) Unused apportionments. Any part of an apportionment for any 
fiscal year to any state:
    (1) That is not obligated during that year;
    (2) With respect to which the state notifies the Secretary that it 
does not wish to receive that part; or
    (3) That is returned to the Secretary by the state, may not be 
considered to be appropriated to that state and must be added to such 
funds as are appropriated for the next fiscal year. Any notification or 
return of funds by a state referred to in this section is irrevocable.


<R05>
Sec. 253.22  State projects.

    (a) General--(1) Designation of state agency. The Governor of each 
state shall notify the Secretary of which agency of the state government 
is authorized under its laws to regulate commercial fisheries and is, 
therefore, designated receive financial assistance awards. An official 
of such agency shall certify which official(s) is authorized in 
accordance with state law to commit the state to participation under the 
Act, to sign project documents, and to receive payments.
    (2) States that choose to submit proposals in any fiscal year must 
so notify

[[Page 285]]

the NMFS Regional Director before the end of the third quarter of that 
fiscal year.
    (3) Any state may, through its state agency, submit to the NMFS 
Regional Director a completed NOAA Grants and Cooperative Agreement 
Application Package with its proposal for a project, which may be 
multiyear. Proposals must describe the full scope of work, 
specifications, and cost estimates for such project.
    (4) States may submit a proposal for a project through, and request 
payment to be made to, an Interstate Fisheries Commission. Any payment 
so made shall be charged against the apportionment of the appropriate 
state(s). Submitting a project through one of the Commissions does not 
remove the matching funds requirement for any state, as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Evaluation of projects. The Secretary, before approving any 
proposal for a project, will evaluate the proposal as to its 
applicability, in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 4104(a)(2).
    (c) State matching requirements. The Federal share of the costs of 
any project conducted under this subpart, including a project submitted 
through an Interstate Commission, cannot exceed 75 percent of the total 
estimated cost of the project, unless:
    (1) The state has adopted an interstate fishery management plan for 
the fishery resource to which the project applies; or
    (2) The state has adopted fishery regulations that the Secretary has 
determined are consistent with any Federal fishery management plan for 
the species to which the project applies, in which case the Federal 
share cannot exceed 90 percent of the total estimated cost of the 
project.
    (d) Financial assistance award. If the Secretary approves or 
disapproves a proposal for a project, he or she will promptly give 
written notification, including, if disapproved, a detailed explanation 
of the reason(s) for the disapproval.
    (e) Restrictions. (1) The total cost of all items included for 
engineering, planning, inspection, and unforeseen contingencies in 
connection with any works to be constructed as part of such a proposed 
project shall not exceed 10 percent of the total cost of such works, and 
shall be paid by the state as a part of its contribution to the total 
cost of the project.
    (2) The expenditure of funds under this subpart may be applied only 
to projects for which a proposal has been evaluated under paragraph (b) 
of this section and approved by the Secretary, except that up to $25,000 
each fiscal year may be awarded to a state out of the state's regular 
apportionment to carry out an ``enforcement agreement.'' An enforcement 
agreement does not require state matching funds.
    (f) Prosecution of work. All work must be performed in accordance 
with applicable state laws or regulations, except when such laws or 
regulations are in conflict with Federal laws or regulations such that 
the Federal law or regulation prevails.


<R05>
Sec. 253.23  Other funds.

    (a) Funds for disaster assistance. (1) The Secretary shall retain 
sole authority in distributing any disaster assistance funds made 
available under section 308(b) of the Act. The Secretary may distribute 
these funds after he or she has made a thorough evaluation of the 
scientific information submitted, and has determined that a commercial 
fishery failure of a fishery resource arising from natural or 
undetermined causes has occurred. Funds may only be used to restore the 
resource affected by the disaster, and only by existing methods and 
technology. Any fishery resource used in computing the states' amount 
under the apportionment formula in Sec. 253.21(a) will qualify for 
funding under this section. The Federal share of the cost of any 
activity conducted under the disaster provision of the Act shall be 
limited to 75 percent of the total cost.
    (2) In addition, pursuant to section 308(d) of the Act, the 
Secretary is authorized to award grants to persons engaged in commercial 
fisheries, for uninsured losses determined by the Secretary to have been 
suffered as a direct result of a fishery resource disaster.

[[Page 286]]

Funds may be distributed by the Secretary only after notice and 
opportunity for public comment of the appropriate limitations, terms, 
and conditions for awarding assistance under this section. Assistance 
provided under this section is limited to 75 percent of an uninsured 
loss to the extent that such losses have not been compensated by other 
Federal or State programs.
    (b) Funds for interstate commissions. Funds authorized to support 
the efforts of the three chartered Interstate Marine Fisheries 
Commissions to develop and maintain interstate fishery management plans 
for interjurisdictional fisheries will be divided equally among the 
Commissions.


<R05>
Sec. 253.24  Administrative requirements.

    Federal assistance awards made as a result of this Act are subject 
to all Federal laws, Executive Orders, Office of Management and Budget 
Circulars as incorporated by the award; Department of Commerce and NOAA 
regulations; policies and procedures applicable to Federal financial 
assistance awards; and terms and conditions of the awards.

Sec. 259.1  Execution of agreements and deposits made in a Capital Construction Fund.

    In the case of a taxable year of a taxpayer beginning after December 
31, 1969, and before January 1, 1972, the rules governing the execution 
of agreements and deposits under such agreements shall be as follows:
    (a) A capital construction fund agreement executed and entered into 
by the taxpayer on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the 
filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years 
will be deemed to be effective on the date of the execution of such 
agreement or as of the close of business of the last regular business 
day of each such taxable year or years to which such deposit relates, 
whichever day is earlier.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
where:
    (1) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and prior 
to January 1, 1971, an application for a capital construction fund 
agreement is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1972, and a capital 
construction fund agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer 
prior to March 1, 1972, and
    (2) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and prior 
to January 1, 1972, an application for a capital construction fund 
agreement is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1973, and a capital 
construction fund agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer 
prior to March 1, 1973 (or, if earlier, 60 days after the publication of 
final joint regulations under section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 
1936, as amended); then such a capital construction fund agreement will 
be deemed to be effective as of the close of business of the last 
regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which such 
deposit related.
    (c)(1) Deposits made in a capital construction fund pursuant to such 
an agreement within 60 days after the date of execution of the 
agreement, or on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the 
filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years, 
whichever date shall be later, shall be deemed to have been made on

[[Page 287]]

the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the 
last regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which 
such deposit relates, whichever day is earlier.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1970, and ending prior to January 1, 
1972, deposits made later than the last date permitted under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section but on or before January 9, 1973, in a capital 
construction fund pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of 
Commerce, acting by and through the Administrator of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall be deemed to have been 
made on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of 
the last regular business day of such taxable year, whichever is 
earlier.
    (d) Nothing in this section shall alter the rules and regulations 
governing the timing of deposits with respect to existing capital and 
special reserve funds or with respect to the treatment of deposits for 
any taxable year or years other than a taxable year or years beginning 
after December 31, 1969, and before January 1, 1972.<SUP>1

Sec. 259.30  Application for Interim Capital Construction Fund Agreement (``Interim CCF Agreement'').

    (a) General qualifications. To be eligible to enter into an Interim 
CCF Agreement an applicant must:
    (1) Be a citizen of the United States (citizenship requirements are 
those for documenting vessels in the coastwise trade within the meaning 
of section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended);
    (2) Own or lease one or more eligible vessels (as defined in section 
607(k)(1) of the Act) operating in the foreign or domestic commerce of 
the United States.
    (3) Have an acceptable program for the acquisition, construction, or 
reconstruction of one or more qualified vessels (as defined in section 
607(k)(2) of the Act). Qualified vessels must be for commercial 
operation in the fisheries of the United States. If the qualified vessel 
is 5 net tons or over, it must be documented in the fisheries of the 
United States. Dual documentation in both the fisheries and the 
coastwise trade of the United States is permissible. Any vessel which 
will carry fishing parties for hire must be inspected and certified 
(under 46 CFR part 176) by the U.S. Coast Guard as qualified to carry 
more than six passengers or demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction 
that the carrying of fishing parties for hire will constitute its 
primary activity. The program must be a firm representation of the 
applicant's actual intentions. Vague or contingent objectives will not 
be acceptable.
    (b) Content of application. Applicants seeking an Interim CCF 
Agreement may make application by letter providing the following 
information:
    (1) Proof of U.S. citizenship;
    (2) The first taxable year for which the Interim CCF Agreement is to 
apply (see Sec. 259.33 for the latest time at which applications for an 
Interim CCF Agreement relating to a previous taxable year may be 
received);
    (3) The following information regarding each ``eligible vessel'' 
which is to be incorporated in Schedule A of the Interim CCF Agreement 
for purposes of making deposits into a CCF pursuant to section 607 of 
the Act:
    (i) Name of vessel,
    (ii) Official number, or, in the case of vessels under 5 net tons, 
the State registration number where required,
    (iii) Type of vessel (i.e., catching vessel, processing vessel, 
transporting vessel, charter vessel, barge, passenger carrying fishing 
vessel, etc.),
    (iv) General characteristic (i.e., net tonnage, fish-carrying 
capacity, age, length, type of fishing gear, number of

[[Page 288]]

passengers carried or in the case of vessels operating in the foreign or 
domestic commerce the various uses of the vessel, etc.),
    (v) Whether owned or leased and, if leased, the name of the owner, 
and a copy of the lease,
    (vi) Date and place of construction,
    (vii) If reconstructed, date of redelivery and place of 
reconstruction,
    (viii) Trade (or trades) in which vessel is documented and date last 
documented,
    (ix) If a fishing vessel, the fishery of operation (which in this 
section means each species or group of species--each species must be 
specifically identified by acceptable common names--of fish, shellfish, 
or other living marine resources which each vessel catches, processes, 
or transports or will catch, process, or transport for commercial 
purposes such as marketing or processing the catch),
    (x) If a fishing vessel, the area of operation (which for fishing 
vessels means the general geographic areas in which each vessel will 
catch, process, or transport, or charter for each species or group of 
species of fish, shellfish, or other living marine resources).
    (4) The specific objectives to be achieved by the accumulation of 
assets in a Capital Construction Fund (to be incorporated in Schedule B 
of the Interim CCF Agreement) including:
    (i) Number of vessels,
    (ii) Type of vessel (i.e., catching, processing, transporting, or 
passenger carrying fishing vessel),
    (iii) General characteristics (i.e., net tonnage, fish-carrying 
capacity, age, length, type of fishing gear, number of passengers 
carried),
    (iv) Cost of projects,
    (v) Amount of indebtedness to be paid for vessels to be constructed, 
acquired, or reconstructed (all notes, mortgages, or other evidences of 
the indebtedness must be submitted as soon as available, together with 
sufficient additional evidence to establish that full proceeds of the 
indebtedness to be paid from a CCF under an Interim CCF Agreement, were 
used solely for the purpose of the construction, acquisition, or 
reconstruction of Schedule B vessels),
    (vi) Date of construction, acquisition, or reconstruction,
    (vii) Fishery of operation (which in this section means each species 
or group of species--each species must be specifically identified by 
acceptable common name--of fish, shellfish, or other living marine 
resources),
    (viii) Area of operation (which in this section means the general 
geographic areas in which each vessel will will operate for each species 
or group of species of fish, shellfish, or other living marine 
resources).
    (c) Filing. The application must be signed and submitted in 
duplicate to the Regional Office of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service's Financial Assistance Division corresponding to the region in 
which the party conducts its business. As a general rule, the Interim 
CCF Agreement must be executed and entered into by the taxpayer on or 
prior to the due date, with extensions, for the filing of the Federal 
tax return in order to be effective for the tax year to which that 
return relates. It is manifestly in the Applicant's best interest to 
file at least 45 days in advance of such date.

<R05>
Sec. 259.31  Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction.

    (a) Acquisition. No vessel having previously been operated in a 
fishery of the United States prior to its acquisition by the party 
seeking CCF withdrawal therefor shall be a qualified vessel for the 
purpose of acquisition, except in the cases specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (2) of this section:
    (1) A vessel not more than 5 years old, at the time of its 
acquisition by the party seeking CCF withdrawal therefor may be a 
qualified vessel for the purpose of acquisition, but only if each 
acquisition in this category becomes a Schedule A vessel and there 
exists for each acquisition in this category (on a one-for-one basis) an 
additional Schedule B construction or reconstruction. The sole 
consideration for permitting an acquisition in this category is that it 
will enable the party (but the Secretary will not attempt to 
predetermine such an ability) to accelerate accomplishment of the 
additional Schedule B construction or

[[Page 289]]

reconstruction. Should this consideration materially fail, the Secretary 
shall, at his discretion, disqualify previously qualified withdrawals in 
this category, seek liquidated damages as provided for in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section and/or terminate the Interim CCF Agreement.
    (2) A vessel more than 5 years old, but not more than 25 years old 
(special showing required if more than 25 years old, see paragraph (b) 
of this section), at the time of acquisition by the party seeking CCF 
withdrawal therefor may be a qualified vessel for the purpose of 
acquisition, but only if that same vessel becomes a Schedule A vessel 
and (in addition to being a Schedule B vessel for the purpose of its 
acquisition) becomes a Schedule B vessel for the purpose of that same 
vessel's reconstruction to be accomplished ordinarily within 7 years 
from the date of acquisition. The sole consideration for permitting an 
acquisition in this category is that it will enable a party (but the 
Secretary will not attempt to predetermine such an ability) to 
accelerate accomplishment of the Schedule B reconstruction of the vessel 
so acquired. Should this consideration materially fail, the same penalty 
prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies.
    (3) Reserved for minimum deposits under this section.
    (4) Reserved for liquidated damages.
    (b) Reconstruction. No reconstruction project costing less than 
$100,000 shall qualify a vessel for reconstruction, unless the 
reconstruction project costs, or will cost, 20 percent or more of the 
reconstructed vessel's acquisition cost (in its unreconstructed state) 
to the party seeking CCF withdrawal therefor. If the reconstruction 
project meets the $100,000 test, then the 20 percent test does not 
apply. Conversely, if the reconstruction project does not meet the 
$100,000 test, then the 20 percent test applies.
    (1) Reconstruction may include rebuilding, replacing, 
reconditioning, converting and/or improving any portion of a vessel. A 
reconstruction project must, however, substantially prolong the useful 
life of the reconstructed vessel, increase its value, or adapt it to a 
different commercial use in the fishing trade or industry.
    (2) All, or the major portion (ordinarily, not less than 80 
percent), of a reconstruction project's actual cost must (for the 
purpose of meeting the above dollar or percentage tests) be classifiable 
as a capital expenditure for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) purposes. 
That otherwise allowable (i.e., for the purpose of meeting the above 
dollar or percentage tests) portion of a reconstruction project's actual 
cost which is not classifiable as a capital expenditure shall, however, 
be excluded from the amount qualified for withdrawal as a result of the 
reconstruction project.
    (3) No vessel more than 25 years old at the time of withdrawal or 
request for withdrawal shall be a qualified vessel for the purpose of 
reconstruction unless a special showing is made, to the Secretary's 
discretionary satisfaction, that the type and degree of reconstruction 
intended will result in an efficient and productive vessel with an 
economically useful life at least 10 years beyond the date 
reconstruction is completed.
    (c) Time permitted for construction or reconstruction. Construction 
or reconstruction must be completed within 18 months from the date 
construction or reconstruction first commences, unless otherwise 
consented to by the Secretary.
    (d) Energy saving improvements. An improvement made to a vessel to 
conserve energy shall, regardless of cost, be treated as a 
reconstruction for the purpose of qualifying a CCF withdrawal for such 
expenditure and shall be exempted from having to meet conditional 
fishery requirements for reconstruction as set forth in Sec. 259.32 and 
from all qualifying tests for reconstruction set forth in paragraph (b) 
of this section with the following exceptions:
    (1) An energy saving improvement shall be required to meet both 
conditional fishery requirements and the qualifying tests for 
reconstruction if it serves the dual purpose of saving energy and 
meeting the reconstruction requirement of paragraph (a) of this section 
for qualifying a withdrawal for the acquisition of a used vessel.
    (2) That portion of the actual cost of an energy saving improvement 
which is

[[Page 290]]

to be paid for from the CCF must be classifiable and treated as a 
capital expenditure for Internal Revenue Service purposes.
    (e) Safety projects. The acquisition and installation of safety 
equipment for a qualified vessel and vessel modifications whose central 
purpose is materially increasing the safety of a qualified vessel or the 
acquisition and installation of equipment required by law or regulation 
that materially increases the safety of a qualified vessel shall, 
regardless of cost, be treated as reconstruction for the purpose of 
qualifying a CCF withdrawal for such expenditure, shall be exempt from 
having to meet conditional fishery requirements for reconstruction as 
set forth in Sec. 259.32, and shall be exempt from all qualifying tests 
for reconstruction set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, with the 
following exceptions:
    (1) A safety improvement shall be required to meet both conditional 
fishery requirements and all qualifying tests for reconstruction if it 
serves the dual purpose of safety and meeting the reconstruction 
requirement of paragraph (a) of this section for qualifying a withdrawal 
for the acquisition of a used vessel;
    (2) That portion of the actual cost of a safety improvement that is 
to be paid for from the CCF must be classifiable and treated as a 
capital expenditure for Internal Revenue Service purposes;
    (3) Safety improvement projects whose clear and central purpose is 
restricted to complying with the requirements of the Commercial Fishing 
Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-424 Sec. 1, 102 stat. 
1585 (1988) (codified in scattered sections of 46 U.S.C.)) shall, 
without further documentation, be considered to fall within this 
paragraph (e). Satisfactory documentation will be required for all other 
projects proposed to be considered as falling within this paragraph (e). 
Projects not required by law or regulation whose central purpose clearly 
involves something other than an improvement that materially increases 
the safety of a vessel will not be considered to fall within this 
paragraph (e).

<R05>
Sec. 259.32  Conditional fisheries.

    (a) The Secretary may from time-to-time establish certain fisheries 
in which CCF benefits will be restricted. The regulatory mechanism for 
so doing is part 251 of this chapter. Each fishery so restricted is 
termed a ``conditional fishery''. Subpart A of part 251 of this chapter 
establishes the procedure to be used by the Secretary in proposing and 
adopting a fishery as a conditional fishery. Subpart B of part 251 of 
this chapter enumerates each fishery actually adopted as a conditional 
fishery (part 251 of this chapter should be referred to for details). 
The purpose of this Sec. 259.32 is to establish the effect of 
conditional fishery adoption upon Interim CCF Agreements.
    (b) If a written request for an otherwise permissible action under 
an Interim CCF Agreement is submitted prior to the date upon which 
conditional fishery adoption occurs, then the Secretary will act, in an 
otherwise normal manner, upon so much of the action then applied for as 
is then permissible without regard to the subsequent adoption of a 
conditional fishery (even, if that adoption occurs before the Secretary 
gives his consent or issues an Interim CCF Agreement or amendment 
thereto, all as the case may be). Nevertheless, the conditions as set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.
    (c) If a written request for an otherwise permissible action under 
an Interim CCF Agreement, or an application for an Interim CCF 
Agreement, is submitted after the date upon which conditional fishery 
adoption occurs, then the Secretary will act, in an otherwise normal 
manner, upon so much of the action then applied for as is then 
permissible without regard to the previous adoption of a conditional 
fishery provided, however, that this paragraph shall apply only to 
construction or reconstruction for which a binding contract has been 
reduced to writing prior to the date upon which conditional fishery 
adoption occurred. Nevertheless, the conditions as set forth in 
paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.
    (d) Conditional fishery adoption shall have no effect whatsoever 
upon a

[[Page 291]]

Schedule B objective whose qualification for withdrawal (which may be in 
an amount equal to the total cost over time of a Schedule B objective, 
i.e., a series of withdrawals) has been, prior to the date of 
conditional fishery adoption, either consented to by the Secretary or 
requested in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. This 
extends to past, present, and future withdrawals in an amount 
representing up to 100 percent of the cost of a Schedule B objective. 
Commencement of any project in these categories shall, however, be 
started not later than 6 months from the date of conditional fishery 
adoption and shall be completed within 24 months from the date of 
conditional fishery adoption, unless for good and sufficient cause shown 
the Secretary, at his discretion, consents to a longer period for either 
project commencement or completion. Consent to the qualification of 
withdrawal for any project in these categories not commenced or 
completed within the periods allowed shall be revoked at the end of the 
periods allowed.
    (e) Conditional fishery adoption shall have no effect whatsoever 
upon Schedule B objectives which will not result in significantly 
increasing harvesting capacity in a fishery adopted as a conditional 
fishery.
    (1) Construction of a new vessel (vessel ``Y'') for operation in an 
adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to significantly increase 
harvesting capacity in that fishery unless the party causing the ``Y'' 
vessel to be constructed causes (within 1 year after the delivery of 
vessel ``Y'') to be permanently removed from all fishing, or placed 
permanently in a fishery not then adopted as a conditional fishery, 
under such conditions as the Secretary may deem necessary or desirable, 
a vessel (vessel ``Z'') which has during the previous 18 months operated 
substantially in the same fishery as the ``Y'' vessel and which has a 
fishing capacity substantially equivalent to the ``Y'' vessel. Failure 
to remove a vessel could subject all withdrawals to be treated as 
nonqualified and may be cause for termination of the CCF. What 
constitutes substantially equivalent fishing capacity shall be a matter 
for the Secretary's discretion. Ordinarily, in exercising his discretion 
about what does or does not constitute substantially equivalent fishing 
capacity, the Secretary will take into consideration (i) the average 
size of vessels constructed for the adopted conditional fishery in 
question at the time vessel ``Z'' was constructed (or, if constructed 
for a different fishery, the average size of vessels in the adopted 
conditional fishery at the time vessel ``Z'' entered it), (ii) the 
average size of vessels constructed for the adopted conditional fishery 
at the time vessel ``Y'' was or will be constructed, and (iii) such 
other factors as the Secretary may deem material and equitable, 
including the length of time the party had owned or leased vessel ``Z'' 
and the length of time the vessel has operated in the conditional 
fishery. The Secretary will consider these factors, and exercise his 
discretion, in such a way as to encourage use of this program by 
established fishermen who have owned or leased for substantial periods 
vessels which need to be replaced, even though a ``Z'' vessel may have 
been constructed at a time which dictated a lesser fishing capacity than 
dictated for a ``Y'' vessel at the time of its construction.
    (2) Acquisition and/or reconstruction of a used vessel for operation 
in an adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to significantly 
increase harvesting capacity in that fishery unless the vessel to be 
acquired and/or reconstructed had during the previous 3 years operated 
substantially in the same fishery as the adopted conditional fishery in 
which it will operate after acquisition and/or reconstruction. If less 
than 3 years, then acquisition and/or reconstruction of a used vessel 
for operation in an adopted conditional fishery shall be deemed to 
significantly increase harvesting capacity in that fishery unless there 
occurs vessel removal or permanent placement elsewhere under the same 
conditions specified for construction in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) Construction of a new vessel or the acquisition and/or 
reconstruction of a used vessel for operation in an adopted conditional 
fishery shall not be deemed to significantly increase the harvesting 
capacity where the vessel

[[Page 292]]

constructed, acquired and/or reconstructed replaces another vessel which 
was lost or destroyed and which had, immediately prior to the loss or 
destruction, operated in the same fishery as the adopted conditional 
fishery, provided, however, that the fishing capacity of the replacement 
vessel has a fishing capacity substantially equivalent to the vessel 
lost or destroyed and that the construction, acquisition and/or 
reconstruction is completed within 2 years after the close of the 
taxable year in which the loss or destruction occurred. The Secretary 
may, at his discretion, and for good and sufficient cause shown, extend 
the replacement period, provided that the request for extension of time 
to replace is timely filed with the Secretary
    (f) Conditional fishery adoption shall have the following effect on 
all Schedule B objectives (whether for acquisition, construction, or 
reconstruction) which the Secretary deems to significantly increase 
harvesting capacity in that fishery, excluding those circumstances 
specifically exempted by paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section 
(which shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (e) 
of this section).
    (1) The Secretary may nevertheless consent to the qualification of 
withdrawal, but only up to an amount not exceeding the total of eligible 
ceilings actually deposited during tax years other than the taxable year 
in which conditional fishery adoption occurs plus a pro-rata portion of 
eligible ceilings generated in the tax year in which conditional fishery 
adoption occurs. Pro-ration shall be according to the number of months 
or any part thereof in a party's tax year which elapse before the 
adoption of the conditional fishery occurs. For example, if a party's 
tax year runs from January 1, 1974, to December 31, 1974, and 
conditional fishery adoption occurs on August 15, 1974, (i.e., during 
the 8th month of the party's tax year), then the pro-rata portion for 
that year is eight-twelfths of the total eligible ceilings generated 
during that year.
    (2) Qualified withdrawals in excess of the amount specified in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not, during the continuance of 
the adopted conditional fishery, be consented to. Parties at this point 
shall have the following option:
    (i) Make, with the Secretary's consent, a nonqualified withdrawal of 
the excess and discontinue the future deposit of eligible ceilings 
(which may effect termination of the Interim CCF Agreement).
    (ii) Reserve the excess, as well as the future deposit of eligible 
ceilings, for a Schedule B objective not then involving an adopted 
conditional fishery. If amendment of an Interim CCF Agreement is 
necessary in order to include a Schedule B objective not then involving 
an adopted conditional fishery, the party may, with the Secretary's 
consent, make the necessary amendment.
    (iii) Reserve the excess, as well as the future deposit of eligible 
ceilings, for a Schedule B objective involving a then adopted 
conditional fishery in anticipation that the then adopted conditional 
fishery will eventually be disadopted, in which case all deposits of 
eligible ceilings will once again be eligible for the Secretary's 
consent as qualified withdrawals. If the adoption of a conditional 
fishery continues for a substantial length of time and there is no 
forseeable prospect of disadoption, then the Secretary, in his 
discretion, may require paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section to 
be effected.
    (g) The Secretary shall neither enter into a new Interim CCF 
Agreement, nor permit amendment of an existing one, which involves a 
Schedule B objective in a then adopted conditional fishery unless 
paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this Sec. 259.32 applies or unless the 
Schedule B objective is expressly conditioned upon acquisition 
construction, or reconstruction of the type permitted under paragraph 
(e) of this Sec. 259.32. Such an express condition would not survive 
beyond the time at which conditional fishery status is removed.


<R05>
Sec. 259.33  Constructive deposits and withdrawals; ratification of withdrawals (as qualified) made without first having obtained Secretary's consent; first tax 
          year for which Interim CCF Agreement is effective.

    (a) Periods controlling permissibility. For the purpose of this 
Sec. 259.33, the period between the beginning and the end of a party's 
tax year is designated ``Period (aa)''; the period between the

[[Page 293]]

end of a party's tax year and the party's tax due date for that tax year 
is designated ``Period (bb)''; the period between the party's tax due 
date and the date on which ends the party's last extension (if any) of 
that tax due date is designated ``Period (cc)''.
    (b) Constructive deposits and withdrawals (before Interim CCF 
Agreement effectiveness date). Constructive deposits and withdrawals 
shall be permissible only during the Period (aa) during which a written 
application for an interim CCF Agreement is submitted to the Secretary 
and so much of the next succeeding Period (aa), if any, which occurs 
before the Secretary executes the Interim CCF Agreement previously 
applied for. All otherwise qualified expenditures of eligible ceilings 
during Period (aa) may be consented to by the Secretary as constructive 
deposits and withdrawals: Provided, The applicant's application for an 
Interim CCF Agreement and for consent to constructive deposit and 
withdrawal qualification (together with sufficient supporting data to 
enable the Secretary's execution or issuance of consent) is submitted to 
the Secretary either before the end of Period (bb) or, if extension was 
requested and received, before the end of Period (cc). If, however, the 
Secretary receives the completed application in proper form so close to 
the latest permissible period that the Interim CCF Agreement cannot be 
executed and/or the consent given before the end of Period (bb) or 
Period (cc), whichever applies, then the burden is entirely upon the 
applicant to negotiate with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for such 
relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax return, if 
appropriate). The Secretary willl nevertheless execute the Interim CCF 
Agreement and issue his consent however long past the applicant's Period 
(bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, the Secretary's administrative 
workload requires. Should IRS relief be, for any reason, unavailable, 
the Secretary shall regard the same as merely due to the applicant's 
having failed to apply in a more timely fashion.
    (c) Constructive deposits (after Interim CCF Agreement effectiveness 
date). The Secretary shall not permit constructive deposits or 
withdrawals after the effective date of an Interim CCF Agreement. 
Eligible ceilings must, after the effective date of an interim CCF 
Agreement, be physically deposited in money or kind in scheduled 
depositories before the last date eligible ceilings for any Period (aa) 
of any party become ineligible for deposit (the last date being Period 
(bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies).
    (d) Ratification of withdrawals (as qualified) made without first 
having obtained Secretary's consent. The Secretary may ratify as 
qualified any withdrawal made without first having obtained the 
Secretary's consent therefor, provided the withdrawal was such as would 
have resulted in the Secretary's consent had it been requested before 
withdrawal, and provided further that the party's request for consent 
(together with sufficient supporting data to enable issuance of the 
Secretary's consent) is submitted to the Secretary either before the end 
of Period (bb) or, if extension was requested and received, before the 
end of Period (cc).
    (1) If, however, the Secretary receives the request in proper form 
so close to the latest permissible period that the consent cannot be 
given before expiration of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever 
applies, then the burden is entirely upon the party to negotiate with 
IRS for such relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax 
return, if appropriate). The Secretary will nevertheless issue his 
consent however long past the party's Period (bb) or Period (cc), 
whichever applies, the Secretary's administrative workload requires. 
Should IRS relief be, for any reason, unavailable, the Secretary shall 
regard the same as merely due to the party's having failed to apply in a 
more timely fashion.
    (2) All parties shall be counseled that it is manifestly in their 
best interest to request the Secretary's consent 45 days in advance of 
the expected date of withdrawal. Withdrawals made without the 
Secretary's consent, in reliance on obtaining the Secretary's consent, 
are made purely at a party's own risk. Should any withdrawal made 
without the Secretary's consent prove, for any reason, to be one to 
which the Secretary will not or cannot consent by

[[Page 294]]

ratification, then the result will be either, or both, at the 
Secretary's discretion, an unqualified withdrawal or an involuntary 
termination of the Interim CCF Agreement.
    (3) Should the withdrawal made without having first obtained the 
Secretary's consent be made in pursuance of a project not then an 
eligible Schedule B objective, then the Secretary may entertain an 
application to amend the Interim CCF Agreement's Schedule B objectives 
as the prerequisite to consenting by ratification to the withdrawal, all 
under the same time constraints and conditions as otherwise specified 
herein.
    (4) Any withdrawals made, after the effective date of an Interim CCF 
Agreement, without the Secretary's consent are automatically non-
qualified withdrawals unless the Secretary subsequently consents to them 
by ratification as otherwise specified herein.
    (5) Redeposit of that portion of the ceiling withdrawn without the 
Secretary's consent, and for which such consent is not subsequently 
given (either by ratification or otherwise), shall not be permitted. If 
such a non-qualified withdrawal adversely affects the Interim CCF 
Agreement's general status in any wise deemed by the Secretary, at his 
discretion, to be significant and material, the Secretary may 
involuntarily terminate the Interim CCF Agreement.
    (e) First tax year for which Interim CCF Agreement is effective. An 
Agreement, to be effective for any party's Period (aa), must be executed 
and entered into by the party, and submitted to the Secretary, before 
the end of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, for such 
Period (aa). If executed and entered into by the party, and/or received 
by the Secretary, after the end of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever 
applies, then the Agreement will be first effective for the next 
succeeding Period (aa).
    (1) If, however, the Secretary receives an Agreement executed and 
entered into by the party in proper form so close to the latest 
permissible period that the Secretary cannot execute the Agreement 
before expiration of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, then 
the burden is entirely upon the party to negotiate with IRS for such 
relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax return, if 
appropriate). The Secretary will nevertheless execute the Agreement 
however long past the party's Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever 
applies, the Secretary's administrative workload requires. Should IRS 
relief be, for any reason, unavailable, the Secretary shall regard the 
same as merely due to the party's having failed to apply in a more 
timely manner.
    (2) All parties shall be counseled that it is manifestly in their 
best interest to enter into and execute an Agreement, and submit the 
same to the Secretary, at least 45 days in advance of the Period (bb) or 
Period (cc), whichever applies, for the Period (aa) for which the 
Agreement is first intended to be effective.


<R05>
Sec. 259.34  Minimum and maximum deposits; maximum time to deposit.

    (a) Minimum annual deposit. The minimum annual (based on each 
party's taxable year) deposit required by the Secretary in order to 
maintain an Interim CCF Agreement shall be an amount equal to 2 percent 
of the total anticipated cost of all Schedule B objectives unless such 2 
percent exceeds during any tax year 50 percent of a party's Schedule A 
taxable income, in which case the minimum deposit for that year shall be 
50 percent of the party's Schedule A taxable income.
    (1) Minimum annual deposit compliance shall be audited at the end of 
each party's taxable year unless any one or more of the Schedule B 
objectives is scheduled for commencement more than 3 taxable years in 
advance of the taxable year in which the agreement is effected, in which 
case minimum annual deposit compliance shall be audited at the end of 
each 3 year taxable period. In any taxable year, a Party may apply any 
eligible amount in excess of the 2 percent minimum annual deposit toward 
meeting the party's minimum annual deposit requirement in past or future 
years: Provided, however, At the end of each 3 year period, the 
aggregate amount in the fund must be in compliance with 2 percent 
minimum annual deposit rule (unless the

[[Page 295]]

50 percent of taxable income situation applies).
    (2) The Secretary may, at his discretion and for good and sufficient 
cause shown, consent to minimum annual deposits in any given tax year or 
combination of tax years in an amount lower than prescribed herein: 
Provided, The party demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction the 
availability of sufficient funds from any combination of sources to 
accomplish Schedule B objectives at the time they are scheduled for 
accomplishment.
    (b) Maximum deposits. Other than the maximum annual ceilings 
established by the Act, the Secretary shall not establish a maximum 
annual ceiling: Provided, however, That deposits can no longer be made 
once a party has deposited 100 percent of the anticipated cost of all 
Schedule B objectives, unless the Interim CCF Agreement is then amended 
to establish additional Schedule B objectives.
    (c) Maximum time to deposit. Ten years shall ordinarily be the 
maximum time the Secretary shall permit in which to accumulate deposits 
prior to commencement of any given Schedule B objective. A time longer 
than 10 years, either by original scheduling or by subsequent extension 
through amendment, may, however, be permitted at the Secretary's 
discretion and for good and sufficient cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 259.35  Annual deposit and withdrawal reports required.

    (a) The Secretary will require from each Interim CCF Agreement 
holder (Party) the following annual deposit and withdrawal reports. 
Failure to submit such reports may be cause for involuntary termination 
of CCF Agreements.
    (1) A preliminary deposit and withdrawal report at the end of each 
calendar year, which must be submitted not later than 45 days after the 
close of the calendar year. The report must give the amounts withdrawn 
from and deposited into the party's CCF during the subject year, and be 
in letter form showing the agreement holder's name, FVCCF identification 
number, and taxpayer identification number. Each report must bear 
certification that the deposit and withdrawal information given includes 
all deposit and withdrawal activity for the year and the account 
reported. Negative reports must be submitted in those cases where there 
is no deposit and/or withdrawal activity. If the party's tax year is the 
same as the calendar year, and if the final deposit and withdrawal 
report required under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is submitted 
before the due date for this preliminary report, then this report is not 
required.
    (2) A final deposit and withdrawal report at the end of the tax 
year, which shall be submitted not later than 30 days after expiration 
of the due date, with extensions (if any), for filing the party's 
Federal income tax return. The report must be made on a form prescribed 
by the Secretary using a separate form for each FVCCF depository. Each 
report must bear certification that the deposit and withdrawal 
information given includes all deposit and withdrawal activity for the 
year and account reported. Negative reports must be submitted in those 
cases where there is no deposit and/or withdrawal activity.
    (b) Failure to submit the required annual deposit and withdrawal 
reports shall be cause after due notice for either, or both, 
disqualification of withdrawals or involuntary termination of the 
Interim CCF Agreement, at the Secretary's discretion.
    (c) Additionally, the Secretary shall require from each Interim CCF 
Agreement holder, not later than 30 days after expiration of the party's 
tax due date, with extensions (if any), a copy of the party's Federal 
Income Tax Return filed with IRS for the preceding tax year. Failure to 
submit shall after due notice be cause for the same adverse action 
specified in the paragraph above.

[39 FR 33675, Sept. 19, 1974, as amended at 48 FR 57302, Dec. 29, 1983; 
53 FR 35203, Sept. 12, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 259.36  CCF accounts.

    (a) General: Each CCF account in each scheduled depository shall 
have an account number, which must be reflected on the reports required 
by Sec. 259.35. All CCF accounts shall be reserved only for CCF 
transactions. There shall be no intermingling of CCF

[[Page 296]]

and non-CCF transactions and there shall be no pooling of 2 or more CCF 
accounts without prior consent of the Secretary. Safe deposit boxes, 
safes, or the like shall not be eligible CCF depositories without the 
Secretary's consent and then only under such conditions as the 
Secretary, in his discretion, prescribes.
    (b) Assignment: The use of Fund assets for transactions in the 
nature of a countervailing balance, compensating balance, pledge, 
assignment, or similar security arrangement shall constitute a material 
breach of the Agreement unless prior written consent of the Secretary is 
obtained.
    (c) Depositories: (1) Section 607(c) of the Act provides that 
amounts in a CCF must be kept in the depository or depositories 
specified in the Agreements and be subject to such trustee or other 
fiduciary requirements as the Secretary may specify.
    (2) Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement, the party may 
select the type or types of accounts in which the assets of the Fund may 
be deposited.
    (3) Non-cash deposits or investments of the Fund should be placed in 
control of a trustee under the following conditions:
    (i) The trustee should be specified in the Agreement;
    (ii) The trust instrument should provide that all investment 
restrictions stated in section 607(c) of the Act will be observed;
    (iii) The trust instrument should provide that the trustee will give 
consideration to the party's withdrawal requirements under the Agreement 
when investing the Fund;
    (iv) The trustee must agree to be bound by all rules and regulations 
which have been or will be promulgated governing the investment or 
management of the Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 259.37  Conditional consents to withdrawal qualification.

    The Secretary may conditionally consent to the qualification of 
withdrawal, such consent being conditional upon the timely submission to 
the Secretary of such further proofs, assurances, and advices as the 
Secretary, in his discretion, may require. Failure of a party to comply 
with the conditions of such a consent within a reasonable time and after 
due notice shall, at the Secretary's discretion, be cause for either, or 
both, nonqualification of withdrawal or involuntary Interim CCF 
Agreement termination.


<R05>
Sec. 259.38  Miscellaneous.

    (a) Wherever the Secretary prescribes time constraints herein for 
the submission of any CCF transactions, the postmark date shall control 
if mailed or, if personally delivered, the actual date of submission. 
All required materials may be submitted to any Financial Assistance 
Division office of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
    (b) All CCF information received by the Secretary shall be held 
strictly confidential, except that it may be published or disclosed in 
statistical form provided such publication does not disclose, directly 
or indirectly, the identity of any fundholder.
    (c) While recognizing that precise regulations are necessary in 
order to treat similarly situated parties similarly, the Secretary also 
realizes that precision in regulations can often cause inequitable 
effects to result from unavoidable, unintended, or minor discrepancies 
between the regulations and the circumstances they attempt to govern. 
The Secretary will, consequently, at his discretion, as a matter of 
privilege and not as a matter of right, attempt to afford relief to 
parties where literal application of the purely procedural, as opposed 
to substantive, aspects of these regulations would otherwise work an 
inequitable hardship. This privilege will be sparingly granted and no 
party should before the fact attempt to act in reliance on its being 
granted after the fact.
    (d) These Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are applicable absolutely to 
all Interim CCF Agreements first entered into (or the amendment of all 
then existing Interim CCF Agreements, which amendment is first entered 
into) on or after the date these Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are 
adopted. These Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are applicable to all Interim 
CCF Agreements entered into before the date these Secs. 259.30 through 
259.38 are adopted, with the following exceptions only:

[[Page 297]]

    (1) The vessel age limitations imposed by Sec. 259.31 shall not 
apply to already scheduled Schedule B objectives.
    (2) The minimum deposits imposed by Sec. 259.34 shall not apply to 
any party's tax year before that party's tax year next following the one 
in which these Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are adopted.
    (e) These Secs. 259.30 through 259.38 are specifically incorporated 
in all past, present, and future Interim CCF Agreements by reference 
thereto made in Whereas Clause number 2 of all such Interim CCF 
Agreements.

by an authorized employee of the Department. An inspector shall perform 
his duties pursuant to the regulations in this part as directed by the 
Director.

<R05>
Sec. 260.50  Suspension or revocation of license of licensed sampler or licensed inspector.

    Pending final action by the Secretary, the Director may, whenever he 
deems such action necessary, suspend the license of any licensed 
sampler, or licensed inspector, issued pursuant to the regulations in 
this part, by giving notice of such suspension to the respective 
licensee, accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor. Within 7 
days after the receipt of the aforesaid notice and statement of reasons 
by such licensee, he may file an appeal, in writing, with the Secretary 
supported by any argument or evidence that he may wish to offer as to 
why his license should not be suspended or revoked. After the expiration 
of the aforesaid 7 day period and consideration of such argument and 
evidence, the Secretary shall take such action as he deems appropriate 
with respect to such suspension or revocation.


<R05>
Sec. 260.51  Surrender of license.

    Upon termination of his services as a licensed sampler or licensed 
inspector, or suspension or revocation of his license, such licensee 
shall surrender his license immediately to the office of inspection 
serving the area in which he is located. These same provisions shall 
apply in a case of an expired license.

                                Sampling


<R05>
Sec. 260.57  How samples are drawn by inspectors or licensed samplers.

    An inspector or a licensed sampler shall select samples, upon 
request, from designated lots of processed products which are so placed 
as to permit thorough and proper sampling in accordance with the 
regulations in this part. Such person shall, unless otherwise directed 
by the Secretary, select sample units of such products at random, and 
from various locations in each lot in such manner and number, not 
inconsistent with the regulations in this part, as to secure a 
representative sample of the lot. Samples drawn for inspection shall be 
furnished by the applicant at no cost to the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 260.58  Accessibility for sampling.

    Each applicant shall cause the processed products for which 
inspection is requested to be made accessible for proper sampling. 
Failure to make any lot accessible for proper sampling shall be 
sufficient cause for postponing inspection service until such time as 
such lot is made accessible for proper sampling.


<R05>
Sec. 260.59  How officially drawn samples are to be identified.

    Officially drawn samples shall be marked by the inspector or 
licensed sampler so such samples can be properly identified for 
inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 260.60  How samples are to be shipped.

    Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, samples which are to be 
shipped to any office of inspection shall be forwarded to the office of 
inspection serving the area in which the processed prodcuts from which 
the samples were drawn is located. Such samples shall be shipped in a 
manner to avoid, if possible, any material change in the quality or 
condition of the sample of the processed product. All transportation 
charges in connection with such shipments of samples shall be at the 
expense of the applicant and wherever practicable, such charges shall be 
prepaid by him.


<R05>
Sec. 260.61  Sampling plans and procedures for determining lot compliance.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided for in this section in connection 
with in-plant inspection and unless otherwise approved by the Secretary, 
samples shall be selected from each lot in the exact number of sample 
units indicated for the lot size in the applicable single sampling plan 
or, at the discretion of the inspection service, any comparable multiple 
sampling plan: Provided, That at the discretion of the inspection 
service the number of sample units selected may be increased to the 
exact number of sample units indicated for any one of the larger sample 
sizes provided for in the appropriate plans.
    (b) Under the single sampling plans with respect to any specified 
requirement:

[[Page 308]]

    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirements) in the sample does not exceed the acceptance 
number prescribed for the sample size the lot meets the requirement;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample exceeds the acceptance number 
prescribed for the sample size the lot fails the requirement.
    (c) Under the multiple sampling plans inspection commences with the 
smallest sample size indicated under the appropriate plan and with 
respect to any specified requirement:
    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample being considered does not exceed the 
acceptance number prescribed for that sample size the lot meets the 
requirement;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample being considered equals or exceeds 
the rejection number prescribed for that sample size the lot fails the 
requirement; or
    (3) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the sample being considered falls between the 
acceptance and rejection numbers of the plan, additional sample units 
are added to the sample so that the sample thus cumulated equals the 
next larger cumulative sample size in the plan. It may then be 
determined that the lot meets or fails the specific requirement by 
considering the cumulative sample and applying the procedures outlined 
in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section or by considering 
successively larger samples cumulated in the same manner until the lot 
meets or fails the specific requirement.
    (d) If in the conduct of any type of in-plant inspection the sample 
is examined before the lot size is known and the number of sample units 
exceeds the prescribed sample size for such lot but does not equal any 
of the prescribed larger sample sizes the lot may be deemed to meet or 
fail a specific requirement in accordance with the following procedure:
    (1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample does not exceed the 
acceptance number of the next smaller sample size the lot meets the 
requirements;
    (2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample equals the acceptance 
number prescribed for the next larger sample size additional sample 
units shall be selected to increase the sample to the next larger 
prescribed sample size;
    (3) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the 
specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample exceeds the acceptance 
number prescribed for the next larger sample size the lot fails the 
requirement.
    (e) In the event that the lot compliance determination provisions of 
a standard or specification are based on the number of specified 
deviations instead of deviants the procedures set forth in this section 
may be applied by substituting the word ``deviation'' for the word 
``deviant'' wherever it appears.
    (f) Sampling plans referred to in this section are those contained 
in Tables I, II, III, IV, V, and VI which follow or any other plans 
which are applicable. For processed products not included in these 
tables, the minimum sample size shall be the exact number of sample 
units prescribed in the table, container group, and lot size that, as 
determined by the inspector, most closely resembles the product, type, 
container size and amount of product to be samples.

hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall determine, based upon evidence of 
record, whether the temporary suspension shall be continued or 
terminated. A temporary suspension shall be terminated by the Hearing 
Examiner if he determines that the acts or activities, which were the 
bases for the suspension, did not occur or will not cause serious and 
irreparable injury to the inspection program and services provided under 
the regulations of this subchapter. This determination of the Hearing 
Examiner on the continuation or termination of the temporary suspension 
shall be final and there shall be no appeal of this determination. The 
initial decision by

of this section or the temporary suspension is terminated by the Hearing 
Examiner.
    (4) When a debarment hearing has been instituted against any person 
not under suspension, the Director may, in accordance with the

the suspension will remain in effect until a final decision on the 
debarment is rendered in accordance with the regulations of this section

Sec. 260.103  Operations and operating procedures shall be in accordance with an effective sanitation program.

    (a) All operators in the receiving transporting, holdings, 
segregating, preparing, processing, packaging, and storing of processed 
products and ingredients, used as aforesaid, shall be strictly in accord 
with clean and sanitary methods and shall be conducted as rapidly as 
possible and at temperatures that will inhibit and retard the growth of 
bacterial and other micro-organisms and prevent any deterioration or 
contamination of such processed products or ingredients thereof. 
Mechanical adjustments or practices which may cause contamination of 
foods by oil, dust, paint, scale, fumes, grinding materials, decomposed 
food, filth, chemicals, or other foreign materials shall not be 
conducted during any manufacturing or processing operation.
    (b) All processed products, raw materials, ingredients, and 
components thereof shall be subject to inspection during each 
manufacturing or processing operation. To assure a safe, wholesome 
finished product, changes in processing methods and procedures as may be 
required by the Director shall be effectuated as soon as practicable. 
All processed products which are not manufactured or prepared in 
accordance with the requirements contained in Sec. 260.96 to 
Sec. 260.104 or are unwholesome or otherwise not fit for human food 
shall be removed and segregated prior to any further processing 
operation.
    (c) Official establishments operating under Federal inspection 
should have an effective quality control program as appropriate for the 
nature of the products and processing operations.
    (d) All ingredients used in the manufacture or processing of any 
processed product shall be wholesome and fit for human food.
    (e) The methods and procedures employed in the receiving, 
segregating, handling, transporting, and processing of ingredients in 
official estab lishment(s) shall be adequate to result in a satisfactory 
processed product. Such methods and procedures include, but are not 
limited to, the following requirements:
    (1) Containers, utensils, pans, and buckets used for the storage or 
transporting of partially processed food ingredients shall not be nested 
unless rewashed and sanitized before each use;
    (2) Containers which are used for holding partially processed food 
ingredients shall not be stacked in such manner as to permit 
contamination of the partially processed food ingredients;
    (3) Packages or containers for processed products shall be clean 
when being filled with such products; and all reasonable precautions 
shall be taken to avoid soiling or contaminating the surface of any 
package or container liner which is, or will be, in direct contact with

used until the discrepancy has been resolved, the equipment reinspected 
and approved by the inspector and the ``RETAINED'' identification 
removed by the inspector.
    (2) Lot(s) of processed products that may be considered to be 
mislabeled and/or unwholesome by reason of contaminants or which may 
otherwise be in such condition as to require further evaluation or 
testing to determine that

[[Page 328]]

the product properly labeled and/or wholesome will be identified by the 
inspector in an appropriate and conspicuous manner with the word 
``RETAINED.'' Such lot(s) of product shall be held for reinspection or 
testing. Final disposition of the lot(s) shall be determined by NMFS and 
the removal of the ``RETAINED'' identification shall be performed by the 
inspector.

<R05>
Sec. 260.104  Personnel.

    The establishment management shall be responsible for taking all 
precautions to assure the following:
    (a) Disease control. No person affected by disease in a communicable 
form, or while a carrier of such disease, or while affected with boils, 
sores, infected wounds, or other abnormal sources of microbiological 
contamination, shall work in a food plant in any capacity in which there 
is a reasonable possibility of food ingredients becoming contaminated by 
such person, or of disease being transmitted by such person to other 
individuals.
    (b) Cleanliness. All persons, while working in direct contact with 
food preparation, food ingredients, or surfaces coming into contact 
therewith shall:
    (1) Wear clean outer garments, maintain a high degree of personal 
cleanliness, and conform to hygenic practices while on duty, to the 
extent necessary to prevent contamination of food products.
    (2) Wash and sanitize their hands thoroughly to prevent 
contamination by undesirable microorganisms before starting work, after 
each absence from the work station, and at any other time when the hands 
may have become soiled or contaminated.
    (3) Remove all insecure jewelry and, when food is being manipulated 
by hand, remove from hands any jewelry that cannot be adequately 
sanitized.
    (4) If gloves are used in food handling, maintain them in an intact, 
clean, and sanitary condition. Such gloves shall be of an impermeable 
material except where their usage would be inappropriate or incompatible 
with the work involved.
    (5) Wear hair nets, caps, masks, or other effective hair restraints. 
Other persons that may incidentally enter the processing areas shall 
comply with this requirement.
    (6) Not store clothing or other personal belongings, eat food, drink 
beverages, chew gum, or use tobacco in any form in areas where food or 
food ingredients are exposed or in areas used for washing equipment or 
utensils.
    (7) Take any other necessary precautions to prevent contamination of 
foods with microorganisms or foreign substances including, but not 
limited to perspiration, hair, cosmetics, tobacco, chemicals, and 
medicants.
    (c) Education and training. Personnel responsible for identifying 
sanitation failures or food contamination should have a background of 
education or experience, or a combination thereof, to provide a level of 
competency necessary for production of clean wholesome food. Food 
handlers and supervisors should receive appropriate training in proper 
food-handling techniques and food-protection principles and should be 
cognizant of the danger of poor personal hygiene and unsanitary 
practices, and other vectors of contamination.

Sec. 261.101  Standard description.

    A U.S. Standard for Grades authorized under this part is a standard 
for a fish or fishery product that has been developed and adopted by the 
voluntary seafood inspection program pursuant to the Agricultural 
Marketing

[[Page 329]]

Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.) and other authorities delegated to 
the U.S. Department of Commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 261.102  Publication and removal of U.S. Grade Standards.

    (a) The voluntary U.S. Standards for Grades adopted pursuant to this 
part shall be issued as Program policies and contained within the NMFS 
Fishery Products Inspection Manual. Compliance with voluntary standards 
issued as Program policies within the manual shall satisfy the 
requirements of this part. Compliance with a voluntary standard issued 
as a Program policy does not relieve any party from the responsibility 
to comply with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act; or other Federal laws and regulations.
    (b) Notification of an application for a new grade standard shall be 
published in the Federal Register. If adopted, the grade standard shall 
be issued as a Program policy and contained in the NMFS Fishery Products 
Inspection Manual.
    (c) Recision and revision of a U.S. Standard for Grades will be made 
a Program policy amendment and contained in the NMFS Fishery Products 
Inspection Manual.
    (d) The NMFS Fishery Products Inspection Manual is available to

<R05>
Sec. 261.103  Basis for determination of a U.S. Standard for Grades.

    (a) To address the inherently distinct and dissimilar attributes 
found in the fishery product groups, each standard for grades should 
have a different scope and product description, product forms, sample 
sizes, definition of defects, etc. The Secretary will make the final 
determination regarding the content of a U.S. Standard for Grades.
    (b) A proposal for a new or revised U.S. grade standard may include 
the following:
    (1) Scope and product description, which describes the products that 
are eligible for grading using the standard (e.g., fish portion, fish 
fillet).
    (2) Product forms, which describe the types, styles and market forms 
covered by the standard (e.g., skin-off, tail-on, headless).
    (3) Grade and inspection marks, which describe the grades and 
inspection mark criteria for each grade category (e.g., Grade A [le] 15 
points).
    (4) Grade determination, which describes the means by which the 
grade is determined (i.e., the factors rated by score points and those 
that are not). Standards may contain defect grouping limiting rules that 
contain additional provisions that must be met.
    (5) Sampling, which describes the method of sampling and sample unit 
sizes (e.g., 10 portions, 8 ounces, etc.).
    (6) Procedures that describe the process used to determine the 
product grade (e.g., label declarations, sensory evaluation).
    (7) Definitions of defects, which outline the defects associated 
with the products covered by the standard, defines them, and describes 
the method of counting or measuring the defects. This section may 
provide associated defect points or reference a defect table (e.g., 
bruises, blood spots, bones, black spots, coating defects, 1-inch 
squares, percent by weight, ratios).
    (8) Defect point assessment, which describes how to assess points 
and provides any special guidance that may be necessary to the 
particular standard (e.g., defect points for certain categories are 
added together and divided by the weight of the sample unit; the number 
of instances are counted to determine if it is slight, moderate, or 
excessive defect).
    (9) Tolerances for lot certification, which provide the sections 
from Title 50 CFR that regulate lot certification.
    (10) Hygiene, which specifies the sections of applicable Federal 
regulations regulating the safe, wholesome production of food for human 
consumption.
    (11) Methods of analysis, which describe the methods of analysis 
that will be used in the evaluation of the products covered by the 
standard for grades (e.g., net weight, deglazing, debreading).
    (12) Defect table, which is the table of defects and associated 
points to be assessed for each defect.

right of way, or other OCS oil and gas exploration, development, or 
production activity; or
    (2) Is otherwise associated (as determined by the Chief, Financial 
Services Division) with OCS oil and gas activities, such as, for 
example, expired lease areas, relinquished rights-of-way or easements, 
and areas used extensively by surface vessels supporting OCS oil and gas 
activities (areas landward of the OCS are included when such areas meet 
this criterion).

Sec. 296.3  Fishermen's contingency fund.

    (a) General. There is established in the Treasury of the United 
States the Fishermen's Contingency Fund. The Fund is available without 
fiscal year limitation as a revolving fund to carry out the purposes of 
title IV of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978, as 
amended.
    (b) Payments into the fund. Each Holder of an exploration permit, 
lease, easement, or rights-of-way for the construction of a pipeline, or 
a prelease exploration drilling permit issued or maintained under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, in effect on or after June 30, 1982, 
shall pay assessments to the Fund. All pipeline right-of-way and 
easements are to be included for assessment except those constructed and 
operated lines within the confines of a single lease or group of 
contiguous leases under unitized operation or single operator. Payments 
will not be required for geological or geophysical permits, other than 
prelease exploratory drilling permits issued under section 11 of the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1340).
    (1) Assessments to maintain the fund. When the total amount in the 
Fund is less than the Chief, FSD, determines is needed to pay Fund 
claims and expenses, the Chief, FSD, will notify the Secretary of the 
Interior that additional assessments are needed.
    (2) Billing and collections. The Secretary of the Interior will 
calculate the amounts to be paid by each Holder and shall notify each 
Holder of the dollar amount and the time and place for all payments. 
Each assessment shall be paid to the Secretary of the Interior no later 
than 45 days after the Secretary of the Interior sends notice of the 
assessment.
    (3) Annual assessment limits. No Holder shall be required to pay in 
excess of $5,000 for any lease, permit, easement or right-of-way in any 
calendar year.
    (c) Moneys recovered through subrogation. Any moneys recovered by 
the Secretary through the subrogation of a claimant's rights shall be 
deposited into the Fund.
    (d) Investments of the fund. Excess sums in the Fund will be 
invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States. Revenue 
from such investments shall be deposited in the Fund.
    (e) Litigation. The Fund may sue and be sued in its own name.


<R05>
Sec. 296.4  Claims eligible for compensation.

    (a) Claimants. Damage or loss eligible for Fund compensation must be 
suffered by a commercial fisherman.
    (b) Damage or loss of fishing gear. Damage or loss is eligible for 
Fund

[[Page 332]]

compensation if it was caused by materials, equipment, tools, 
containers, or other items associated with OCS oil and gas exploration, 
development, or production activities. Damage or loss may be eligible 
for compensation even though it did not occur in OCS waters if the item 
causing the damage or loss was associated with oil and gas exploration, 
development, or production activities in OCS waters.
    (c) Exceptions. Damage or loss is not eligible for Fund 
compensation:
    (1) If the damage or loss was caused by the negligence or fault of 
the claimant;
    (2) If the damage or loss occurred prior to September 18, 1978;
    (3) To the extent that damage or loss exceeds the replacement value 
of the fishing gear involved;
    (4) For any portion of the damage or loss which can be compensated 
by insurance;
    (5) If the claim is not filed within 90 calendar days of the date 
the claimant or the claimant's agent first became aware of the damage or 
loss (or such longer period as the Secretary may allow under unusual and 
extenuating circumstances); or
    (6) If the damage or loss was caused by an obstruction unrelated to 
OCS oil and gas exploration, development, or production activities.

[47 FR 49600, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 50 FR 13796, Apr. 8, 1985; 61 
FR 6322, Feb. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 296.5  Instructions for filing claims.

    (a) Fifteen-day report required to gain presumption of causation--
(1) General. Damages or losses are presumed to be qualified for 
compensation if certain requirements are satisfied. One requirement is 
that a report must be made to NMFS within fifteen (15) days after the 
date on which the vessel first returns to a port after discovering the 
damage or loss. Filing of a fifteen-day report must be followed up by 
filing a detailed claim.
    (2) When and how to file a fifteen-day report. To qualify for the 
presumption of causation, a fifteen-day report must be made to NMFS 
within fifteen days after the date on which the vessel first returns to 
a port after discovering the damage or loss. Satisfaction of the 
fifteen-day requirement is determined by the postmark, if the report is 
mailed; by the date of a call, if the report is telephoned or 
radiotelephoned; or, by the date of appearance, if the report is made in 
person. The fifteen-day report must be made to the Chief, Financial 
Services Division, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West 
Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910; telephone: (301) 713-2396.
    (3) Contents of fifteen-day report. Each fifteen-day report must 
include the following information:
    (i) The claimant's name and address;
    (ii) The name of the commercial fishing vessel involved;
    (iii) The location of the obstruction which caused the damage or 
loss;
    (iv) A description of the nature of the damage or loss;
    (v) The date such damage or loss was discovered;
    (vi) If the fifteen-day report is made after the vessel returns to 
port, the date on which the vessel first returned to port after 
discovering the damage.
    (b) Form of claim. Claims must be in writing. Claims may be 
submitted on NOAA form 88-164. This form may be obtained from any NMFS 
regional office or from the Chief, FSD. Although claimants are not 
required to use this claim form, it will probably be to their benefit to 
do so.
    (c) Who must file and when and where to file claims. All claimants 
(including those who filed 15-day reports to gain the presumption of 
causation) must submit a claim application to the Chief, Financial 
Services Division, within 90 calendar days of the date the claimant or 
the claimant's agent first became aware of the damage or loss. The 
Chief, FSD, may allow a longer period for filing claims if, in his 
discretion, unusual and extenuating circumstances justify a longer 
period. The term ``filed'' means delivered in person, or mailed (as 
determined by the date of the postmark) to the Chief, Financial Services 
Division, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1825 Connecticut Avenue, 
NW., Washington, DC 20235. The Chief, FSD, suggests that mailed claims 
be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, so 
the claimant will have a record that

[[Page 333]]

the claim was received by the Chief, FSD.
    (d) Aggregating claims. If more than one commercial fisherman 
suffers loss or damage from the same incident (for example, when several 
members of the crew lost income due to loss of fishing time), all claims 
should be submitted on their behalf by the owner or operator of the 
commercial fishing vessel involved.
    (e) Contents of claim. Each claim must be signed by the claimant and 
must accurately and completely provide the following information:
    (1) The name, mailing address, telephone number, citizenship, and 
occupational status (for example, vessel owner, operator, or crew 
member) of each claimant;
    (2) The name and Coast Guard documentation number or State 
registration number of the commercial fishing vessel involved in the 
damage or loss;
    (3) The home port, type, and size of the vessel involved in the 
casualty;
    (4) A full statement of the circumstances of the damage or loss 
including:
    (i) The date when the casualty was first discovered by the claimant,
    (ii) The water depth (if known) and visibility at the time and 
location where the casualty occurred,
    (iii) The direction, speed, and activities of the claimant's vessel 
immediately before, during, and after the casualty (including a full 
description of both the deployment of any fishing gear which is the 
subject of the claim and all attempts at retrieval of the gear),
    (iv) The names and addresses of all witnesses to the casualty,
    (v) The location where the casualty occurred in Loran C coordinates 
or the next most accurate method of position fixing available to the 
claimant,
    (vi) A description of the item or obstruction (if sighted or 
recovered) which caused the casualty, and whether or not any surface 
markers were attached to or near the obstruction. Submit any available 
photographs of the item or obstruction. State reasons for believing the 
obstruction is associated with OCS oil and gas activities.
    (5) The amount claimed for property damage or loss and a full 
statement of the type and extent of damage or loss including:
    (i) An inventory of all components of fishing gear damaged or lost,
    (ii) The date, place, and cost of acquisition of all fishing gear 
damaged or lost and proof of its purchase (sales receipts, affidavits, 
or other evidence),
    (iii) One estimate from a commercial fishing gear repair or supply 
company of the present replacement or repair (whichever applies) cost of 
the damaged or lost fishing gear. If the gear will be repaired by the 
claimant himself, a detailed estimate by the claimant identifying the 
repair cost.
    (6) The amount claimed for economic loss and the basis for that 
amount with supporting documentation, as follows:
    (i) Trip tickets for the three vessel trips immediately before the 
trip during which the casualty was discovered and for the vessel trip 
immediately following the trip during which the casualty occurred.
    (ii) A statement of the amount of time involved on each of the 
vessel trips above (or if the casualty involves fixed gear, a statement 
of the number of gear units deployed on each of these trips).
    (iii) A statement of the amount of time lost from fishing because of 
the damage or loss and a full explanation of why this time period is 
reasonable.
    (iv) Documentation of the date replacement gear was ordered and 
received or the date gear repair began and ended. This documentation may 
consist of purchase orders, bills of lading, or statements from sellers 
or repairers.
    (7) The amount claimed for other consequential loss or costs 
(including fees for claim preparation, etc.) with suitable documentation 
of the amounts claimed (such as invoices, receipts, etc.).

Sec. 296.6  NMFS processing of claims.

    (a) Action by NMFS. Upon receipt of a claim, the Chief, FSD, will:
    (1) Send an abstract of the claim to the Secretary of the Interior;
    (2) Send the reported location of any obstruction which was not 
recovered

[[Page 334]]

and retained to the National Ocean Survey, which will inform the Defense 
Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center.
    (b) Actions by the Interior Department. Upon receipt of an abstract 
of a claim, the Interior Department will immediately:
    (1) Plot the casualty site, and advise NMFS whether the site is in 
an area affected by OCS activities;
    (2) make reasonable efforts to notify all persons known to have 
engaged in activities associated with OCS energy activity in the 
vicinity where the damage or loss occurred.
    (c) Responses to notice of claim. (1) Each person notified by the 
Interior Department will, within thirty days after receipt of the 
notice, advise the Chief, FSD, and the Interior Department whether he 
admits or denies responsibility for the damages claimed.
    (2) Each person notified by the Interior Department who fails to 
give timely and proper advice of admission or denial of responsibility 
shall be presumed to deny responsibility for the damages claimed.
    (3) If any person admits responsibility, the Chief, FSD, will 
initiate action to recover from that party any sums paid or to be paid 
for the claimed damages.
    (4) Any person referred to in this section, including lessees or 
permittees or their contractors or subcontractors, may submit evidence 
about any claim to the Chief, FSD.
    (d) Failure to meet filing requirements. The Chief, FSD, may reject 
any claim that does not meet the filing requirements. The Chief, FSD, 
will give a claimant whose claim is rejected written notice of the 
reasons for rejection within 30 days after the date on which the claim 
was filed. If the claimant does not refile an acceptable claim within 30 
days after the date of this written notice, the claimant is not eligible 
for Fund compensation unless there are extenuating circumstances.
    (e) Proceedings--(1) Location. Any required proceeding will be 
conducted within such United States judicial district as may be mutually 
agreeable to the claimant and the Assistant Administrator, NMFS, or his 
designee, or if no agreement can be reached, within the United States 
judicial district in which the claimant's home port is located.
    (2) Powers. For purposes of any proceeding, the Assistant 
Administrator, NMFS, or his designee, shall have the power to administer 
oaths and subpoena witnesses and the production of books, records, and 
other evidence relative to the issues involved.
    (3) Amendments to claims. A claimant may amend the claim at any time 
before the Chief, FSD, issues an initial determination.
    (4) Criminal penalty for fraudulent claims. Any person who files a 
fraudulent claim is subject to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. sections 287 
and 1001, each of which, upon conviction, imposes a penalty of not more

<R05>
Sec. 296.7  Burden of proof and presumption of causation.

    (a) Burden of proof. The claimant has the burden to establish, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, all facts necessary to qualify his claim, 
including:
    (1) The identity or nature of the item which caused the damage or 
loss; and
    (2) That the item is associated with oil and gas exploration, 
development, or production activities on the Outer Continental Shelf.
    (b) Presumption of causation. Notwithstanding the above, damages or 
losses are presumed to be caused by items associated with oil and gas 
exploration, development, or production activities on the OCS if the 
claimant establishes that:
    (1) The claimant's commercial fishing vessel was being used for 
commercial fishing and was located in an area affected by OCS oil and 
gas exploration, development, or production activities;
    (2) A report on the location of the obstruction which caused such 
damage or loss, and the nature of such damage or loss, was made within 
fifteen days after the date on which the vessel first returned to a port 
after discovering such damage;
    (3) There was no record on the most recent nautical charts issued by 
the

[[Page 335]]

National Ocean Survey, NOAA, or in any weekly Notice to Mariners issued 
by the Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center, in effect 
at least 15 days before the date the damage or loss occurred, then an 
obstruction existed in the immediate vicinity where the damage or loss 
occurred. In the case of damages caused by a pipeline, the presumption 
will be available regardless of whether the pipeline was recorded on 
charts or in the Notice to Mariners; and
    (4) There was no proper surface marker or lighted buoy attached, or 
closely anchored, to such obstruction.
    (c) Geographic exclusion from presumption of causation. Damage or 
loss occurring within a one-quarter mile radius of obstructions recorded 
on charts or in a Notice to Mariners, or properly marked, is presumed to 
involve the recorded or marked obstruction.


<R05>
Sec. 296.8  Amount of award.

    (a) Actual damages. The award for damaged fishing gear will be the 
lesser of the gear's repair cost or replacement cost. The award for lost 
fishing gear will be the gear's replacement cost.
    (b) Consequential damages. An award may also include compensation 
for any damage or loss (except personal injury) that is incurred as a 
consequence of the fishing gear damage or loss.
    (c) Resulting economic loss. An award may also include 50 percent of 
the resulting economic loss from damage to or loss of fishing vessels 
and gear.
    (d) Attorney, CPA, consultant fees. An award may also include 
compensation for reasonable fees paid by the claimant to an attorney, 
CPA, or other consultant for the preparation or prosecution of a claim.
    (e) Negligence of claimant. (1) An award will be reduced to the 
extent that the loss or damage was caused by the negligence or fault of 
the claimant. (For example, a claimant who sustained $10,000 in damages 
and whose negligence or fault was found to be responsible for 40% of the 
damage would receive $6,000 in compensation. If the same claimant were 
responsible for 99% of the negligence or fault that caused the damage, 
the claimant would receive $100 in compensation).
    (2) Negligence of the owner or operator of the fishing vessel or 
gear will reduce crewmember awards to the same extent that it reduces an 
award to the vessel's owner or operator.
    (f) Insurance proceeds. An award will be reduced by the amount the 
claimant has, or reasonably would have, received under a commercial 
policy of full hull and machinery and protection and indemnity 
insurance, whether or not such insurance was in effect at the time the 
casualty occurred.

    (b) If the claim is approved, the amount of compensation and the 
basis on which the amount was determined.


<R05>
Sec. 296.10  Agency review.

    (a) Within 30 days after the Chief, FDS, issues an initial 
determination, the claimant, or any other interested person who 
submitted evidence relating to the initial determination, may ask the 
Assistant Administrator, NMFS, or his designee, for a review of the 
initial determination.
    (b) The petitioner may submit written or oral evidence within 30 
days of filing the petition for review.


<R05>
Sec. 296.11  Final determination.

    (a) If a petition for review of an initial determination is filed 
within 30 days after the date the Chief, FSD, issues an initial 
determination, the Assistant Administrator, NMFS, or his designee will 
conduct a review of the initial determination, and will issue a final 
determination no later than 60 days after receipt of the request for 
review of the initial determination.
    (b) If a petition for review of an initial determination is not 
filed within 30 days after the day on which the Chief, FSD, issues an 
initial determination, the initial determination will become a final 
determination.

[[Page 336]]


<R05>
Sec. 296.12  Payment of costs.

    (a) By person denying responsibility for damage. Any person who is 
notified by the Interior Department and fails to respond or denies 
responsibility for the damages claimed will pay the costs of the 
proceedings if such person is subsequently found to be responsible for 
the damage claimed.
    (b) By the claimant. Any claimant who files a claim will pay the 
cost of the proceedings if such person is subsequently found to be 
responsible for the damage claimed.
    (c) By person denying responsibility for damage and the claimant. If 
more than one party is found to have responsibility for the damage 
claimed, then the cost of the proceedings will be apportioned between 
them.


<R05>
Sec. 296.13  Payment of award for claim.

    (a) Upon an initial determination, the Chief, Financial Services 
Division, shall immediately disburse the claim awarded if the claimant 
signed as part of his/her application a statement agreeing to repay all 
or any part of the award if the award should for any reason be 
subsequently reduced.
    (b) [Reserved]

[61 FR 6322, Feb. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 296.14  Subrogation.

    (a) The claim application will contain a subrogation statement 
signed by the claimant as a condition of payment of the claim which:
    (1) Assigns to the Fund the claimant's rights against third parties; 
and
    (2) Provides that the claimant will assist the Fund in any 
reasonable way to pursue those rights.
    (b) Collection of subrogated rights. If a reasonable chance of 
successful collection exists, NMFS will refer any subrogated rights to 
the Justice Department for collection.

the Fund.

[47 FR 49600, Nov. 1, 1982, as amended at 61 FR 6323, Feb. 20, 1996]

determination may, no later than 30 days after the determination, seek 
judicial review of the determination in the United States District Court

concerned or, if no agreement can be reached, in the United States 
District Court for the judicial district in which the claimant's home 
port is located.

    (g) Fail to comply immediately with any of the enforcement and 
boarding procedures specified in this part.
    (h) Refuse to allow an authorized officer to board a fishing vessel,

<R05>
Sec. 300.5  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) Compliance. The operator of, or any other person aboard, any 
fishing vessel subject to this part must immediately comply with 
instructions and signals issued by an authorized officer or CCAMLR 
inspector to stop the vessel, and with instructions to facilitate safe 
boarding and inspection of the vessel, its gear, equipment, fishing 
record (where applicable), and catch for purposes of enforcing this 
part.
    (b) Communications. (1) Upon being approached by a USCG vessel or 
aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized officer or 
CCAMLR inspector aboard, the operator of a fishing vessel must be alert 
for communications conveying enforcement instructions.
    (2) VHF-FM radiotelephone is the preferred method of communicating 
between vessels. If the size of the vessel and the wind, sea, and 
visibility conditions allow, a loudhailer may be used instead of the 
radio. Hand signals, placards, high frequency radiotelephone, voice, 
flags, whistle or horn may be employed by an authorized officer or 
CCAMLR inspector, and message blocks may be dropped from an aircraft.
    (3) If other communications are not practicable, visual signals may 
be

[[Page 343]]

transmitted by flashing light directed at the vessel signaled. USCG 
units will normally use the flashing light signal ``L'' which, in the 
International Code of Signals, means ``you should stop your vessel 
instantly.''
    (4) Failure of a vessel's operator promptly to stop the vessel when 
directed to do so by an authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector, or by an 
enforcement vessel or aircraft, using loudhailer, radiotelephone, 
flashing light, flags, whistle, horn or other means constitutes prima 
facie evidence of the offense of refusal to allow an authorized officer 
or CCAMLR inspector to board.
    (5) A person aboard a vessel who does not understand a signal from 
an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain clarification by 
loudhailer or radiotelephone must consider the signal to be a command to 
stop the vessel immediately.
    (c) Boarding. The operator of a vessel directed to stop must:
    (1) Monitor Channel 16, VHF-FM, if so equipped.
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or, if appropriate and/or directed 
to do so by the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector, maneuver in such 
a way as to allow the safe boarding of the vessel by the authorized 
officer or CCAMLR inspector and the boarding party.
    (3) Except for those vessels with a freeboard of 4 ft (1.25 m) or 
less, provide a safe ladder, if needed, for the authorized officer or 
CCAMLR inspector and boarding party to come aboard.
    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector, provide a manrope or safety 
line, and illumination for the ladder.
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to facilitate boarding and 
to ensure the safety of the authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector and 
the boarding party.
    (d) Signals. The following signals, extracted from the International 
Code of Signals, may be sent by flashing light by an enforcement unit 
when conditions do not allow communications by loudhailer or 
radiotelephone. Knowledge of these signals by vessel operators is not 
required. However, knowledge of these signals and appropriate action by 
a vessel operator may preclude the necessity of sending the signal ``L'' 
and the necessity for the vessel to stop instantly.
    (1) ``AA'' repeated (.- .-) is the call to an unknown station. The 
operator of the signaled vessel should respond by identifying the vessel 
by radiotelephone or by illuminating the vessel's identification.
    (2) ``RY-CY'' (.-. -.-- -.-. -.--) means ``you should proceed at 
slow speed, a boat is coming to you.'' This signal is normally employed 
when conditions allow an enforcement boarding without the necessity of 
the vessel being boarded coming to a complete stop, or, in some cases, 
without retrieval of fishing gear that may be in the water.
    (3) ``SQ3'' (... --.- ...--) means ``you should stop or heave to; I 
am going to board you.''

    Authority: 16 U.S.C. 5501 et seq.


<R05>
Sec. 300.10  Purpose.

    This subpart implements the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995 
(Act), which requires the Secretary to license U.S. vessels fishing on 
the high seas.


<R05>
Sec. 300.11  Definitions.

    In addition to the terms defined in section 300.2 and those in the 
Act and the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International 
Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High 
Seas, adopted by the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations on November 24, 1993 (Agreement), the terms used 
in this subpart have the following meanings. If a term is defined 
differently in Sec. 300.2, the Act, or the Agreement, the definition in 
this section shall apply.
    High seas means the waters beyond the territorial sea or exclusive 
economic zone (or the equivalent) of any Nation, to the extent that such 
territorial sea or exclusive economic zone (or the equivalent) is 
recognized by the United States.
    High seas fishing vessel means any vessel of the United States used 
or intended for use on the high seas for the

[[Page 344]]

purpose of the commercial exploitation of living marine resources as a 
harvesting vessel, mothership, or any other support vessel directly 
engaged in a fishing operation.
    International conservation and management measures means measures to 
conserve or manage one or more species of living marine resources that 
are adopted and applied in accordance with the relevant rules of 
international law, as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on 
the Law of the Sea, and that are recognized by the United States.
    Regional Administrator means any one of the Directors of the five 
NMFS regional offices, defined under Sec. 300.2, serving as the issuing 
office.


<R05>
Sec. 300.12  Issuing offices.

    Any Regional Administrator may issue permits required under this 
subpart. While applicants for permits may submit an application to any 
Regional Administrator, applicants are encouraged to submit their 
applications (with envelopes marked ``Attn: HSFCA Permits'') to the 
Regional Administrator with whom they normally interact on fisheries 
matters.


<R05>
Sec. 300.13  Vessel permits.

    (a) Eligibility. (1) Any high seas fishing vessel of the United 
States is eligible to receive a permit under this subpart, unless the 
vessel was previously authorized to be used for fishing on the high seas 
by a foreign nation, and --
    (i) The foreign nation suspended such authorization, because the 
vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and 
management measures, and the suspension has not expired; or
    (ii) The foreign nation, within the 3 years preceding application 
for a permit under this section, withdrew such authorization, because 
the vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation 
and management measures.
    (2) The restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section do not apply if ownership of the vessel has changed since the 
vessel undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and 
management measures, and the new owner has provided sufficient evidence 
to the Regional Administrator demonstrating that the owner and operator 
at the time the vessel undermined the effectiveness of such measures has 
no further legal, beneficial, or financial interest in, or control of, 
the vessel.
    (3) The restrictions in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section do not apply if it is determined by the Regional Administrator 
that issuing a permit would not subvert the purposes of the Agreement.
    (b) Application forms. The owner or operator of a high seas fishing 
vessel may apply for a permit under this subpart by completing an 
application form. Applicants may obtain an application form from a 
Regional Administrator.
    (c) Application information. An applicant must submit a complete and 
accurate permit application, signed by the owner or operator, to the 
appropriate Regional Administrator.
    (d) Fees. NMFS will charge a fee to recover the administrative 
expenses of permit issuance. The amount of the fee will be determined in 
accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available 
from a Regional Administrator, for determining administrative costs of 
each special product or service. The fee is specified with the 
application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application. 
Failure to pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit. Payment by 
a commercial instrument later determined to be insufficiently funded 
will invalidate any permit.
    (e) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 
904, the Regional Administrator will issue a permit, which will include 
appropriate conditions or restrictions, within 30 days of receipt of a 
completed application and payment of the appropriate fee.
    (2) The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of any 
deficiency in the application.
    (f) Validity. Permits issued under this subpart are valid for 5 
years from the date of issuance. Renewal of a permit prior to its 
expiration is the responsibility of the permit holder. For a permit to 
remain valid to its expiration date, the vessel's USCG documentation

[[Page 345]]

or state registration must be kept current. A permit issued under this 
subpart is void when the name of the owner or vessel changes, or in the 
event the vessel is no longer eligible for U.S. documentation, such 
documentation is revoked or denied, or the vessel is removed from such 
documentation.
    (g) Change in application information. Any changes in vessel 
documentation status or other permit application information must be 
reported to the Regional Administrator in writing within 15 days of such 
changes.
    (h) Transfer. A permit issued under this subpart is not transferable 
or assignable to another vessel or owner; it is valid only for the 
vessel and owner to which it is issued.
    (i) Display. A valid permit, or a copy thereof, issued under this 
subpart must be on board the vessel while operating on the high seas and 
available for inspection by an authorized officer. Faxed copies of 
permits are acceptable.

expenses of permit issuance. The amount of the fee is calculated, at 
least annually, in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance 
Handbook, available from NMFS, for determining administrative costs of 
each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and 
is specified on each application form. The appropriate fee must 
accompany each application. Failure to pay the fee will preclude 
issuance of the permit. Payment by a commercial

[[Page 349]]

instrument later determined to be insufficiently funded shall invalidate 
any permit.
    (k) Change in application information. Within 15 days after any 
change in the information contained in an application submitted under 
this section, the dealer issued a permit must report the change to NMFS 
in writing. The permit is void if any change in information is not 
reported within 15 days.

soon as the turtle comes out of the water and shall not resume until the 
turtle has been disentangled and released;
    (iii) If, in spite of the measures taken under paragraphs (e)(3)(i) 
and (ii) of this section, a turtle is accidentally brought onboard the 
vessel alive and active, the vessel's engine shall be disengaged and the 
turtle shall be released as quickly as practicable;
    (iv) If a turtle brought on board under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of 
this section is alive but comatose or inactive, the resuscitation 
procedures described in Sec.  223.206(d)(1)(i)(B) of this title shall be 
used before release of the turtle.

Sec. 300.62  Annual management measures.

    Annual management measures may be added and modified through 
adoption by the Commission and publication in the Federal Register by 
the Assistant Administrator, with immediate regulatory effect. Such 
measures may include, inter alia, provisions governing: Licensing of 
vessels, inseason actions, regulatory areas, fishing periods, closed 
periods, closed areas, catch limits (quotas), fishing period limits, 
size limits, careful release of halibut, vessel clearances, logs, 
receipt and possession of halibut, fishing gear, retention of tagged 
halibut, supervision of unloading and weighing, and sport fishing for 
halibut. The Assistant Administrator will publish the Commission's 
regulations setting forth annual management measures in the Federal 
Register by March 15 each year. Annual management measures may be 
adjusted inseason by the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 300.63  Catch sharing plans, local area management plans, and domestic management measures.

    Catch sharing plans (CSP) and local area management plans (LAMP) may 
be developed by the appropriate regional fishery management council, and 
approved by NMFS, for portions of the fishery. Any approved CSP or LAMP 
may be obtained from the Administrator, Northwest Region, or the 
Administrator, Alaska Region.
    (a) The catch sharing plan for area 2A provides a framework that 
shall be applied to the annual Area 2A total allowable catch (TAC) 
adopted by the Commission, and shall be implemented through domestic and 
Commission regulations, which will be published in the Federal Register 
each year before March 15. The Area 2A CSP allocates halibut among the 
treaty Indian fishery, segments of the non-Indian commercial fishery, 
and segments of the recreational fishery.
    (1) Each year, before January 1, NMFS will publish a proposal to 
govern the recreational fishery under the CSP for the following year and 
will seek public comment. The comment period will extend until after the 
Commission's annual meeting, so the public will have the opportunity to 
consider the final area 2A total allowable catch (TAC) before submitting 
comments. After the Commission's annual meeting and review of public 
comments, NMFS will publish in the Federal Register the final rule 
governing sport fishing in area 2A. Annual management measures may be 
adjusted inseason by NMFS.
    (2) A portion of the commercial TAC is allocated as incidental catch 
in the salmon troll fishery in Area 2A. Each year the landing 
restrictions necessary to keep the fishery within its allocation will be 
recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council at its spring 
meetings, and will be published in the Federal Register along with the 
annual salmon management measures.
    (3) A portion of the Area 2A Washington recreational TAC is 
allocated as incidental catch in the primary directed longline sablefish 
fishery north of 46[deg]53[min]18[sec] N. lat, (Pt. Chehalis, WA), which 
is regulated under 50 CFR

[[Page 358]]

660.323(a)(2). This fishing opportunity is only available in years in 
which the Area 2A TAC is greater than 900,000 lb (408.2 mt,) provided 
that a minimum of 10,000 lb (4.5 mt) is available above a Washington 
recreational TAC of 214,100 lb (97.1 mt). Each year that this harvest is 
available, the landing restrictions necessary to keep this fishery 
within its allocation will be recommended by the Pacific Fishery 
Management Council at its spring meetings, and will be published in the 
Federal Register. These restrictions will be designed to ensure the 
halibut harvest is incidental to the sablefish harvest and will be based 
on the amounts of halibut and sablefish available to this fishery, and 
other pertinent factors. The restrictions may include catch or landing 
ratios, landing limits, or other means to control the rate of halibut 
landings.
    (i) In years when this incidental harvest of halibut in the directed 
sablefish fishery north of 46[deg]53[min]18[sec] N. lat. is allowed, it 
is allowed only for vessels using longline gear that are registered to 
groundfish limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements and that 
possess the appropriate incidental halibut harvest license issued by the 
Commission.
    (ii) It is unlawful for any person to possess or land halibut south 
of 46[deg]53[min]18[sec] N. lat that were taken and retained north of 
46[deg]53[min]18[sec] N. lat. as incidental catch authorized by this 
section in the directed longline sablefish fishery.
    (4) The commercial longline fishery in area 2A is governed by the 
annual management measures published pursuant to Secs. 300.62 and 
300.63.
    (5) The treaty Indian fishery is governed by Sec. 300.64 and tribal 
regulations. The annual quota for the fishery will be announced with the 
Commission regulations under Sec. 300.62
    (b) The catch sharing plan for area 4 allocates the annual TAC among 
Areas 4C, 4D, and 4E, and will be implemented by the Commission in 
annual management measures published pursuant to Sec. 300.62.
    (c) (Applicable through December 31, 1999). A person may retain 
halibut taken with setline gear in Area 4E that are smaller than the 
size limit specified in the annual management measures published 
pursuant to Sec. 300.62, provided that no person may sell or barter such 
halibut.
    (d) The LAMP for Sitka Sound provides guidelines for participation 
in the halibut fishery in Sitka Sound.

Sec. 300.108  Vessel and gear identification.

    (a) Vessel identification. (1) The operator of each harvesting 
vessel assigned an IRCS must display that call sign amidships on both 
the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, so that it is 
visible from an enforcement or inspection vessel, and on an appropriate 
weather deck so that it is visible from the air.
    (2) The operator of each harvesting vessel not assigned an IRCS, 
such as a small trawler associated with a mothership or one of a pair of 
trawlers, must display the IRCS of the associated vessel, followed by a 
numerical suffix specific for the non-assigned vessel.
    (3) The vessel identification must be in a color in contrast to the 
background and must be permanently affixed to the harvesting vessel in 
block roman alphabet letters and arabic numerals at least 1 m in height 
for harvesting vessels over 20 m in length, and at least 0.5 m in height 
for all other harvesting vessels.
    (b) Navigational lights and shapes. Each harvesting vessel must 
display the lights and shapes prescribed by the International 
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (TIAS 8587, and 1981 
amendment TIAS 10672), for the activity in which the harvesting vessel 
is engaged (as described at 33 CFR part 81).
    (c) Gear identification. (1) The operator of each harvesting vessel 
must ensure that all deployed fishing gear that

[[Page 374]]

is not physically and continuously attached to a harvesting vessel is 
clearly marked at the surface with a buoy displaying the vessel 
identification of the harvesting vessel (see paragraph (a) of this 
section) to which the gear belongs, a light visible for 2 miles at night 
in good visibility, and a radio buoy. Trawl codends passed from one 
vessel to another are considered continuously attached gear and do not 
have to be marked.
    (2) The operator of each harvesting vessel must ensure that deployed 
longlines, strings of traps or pots, and gillnets are marked at the 
surface at each terminal end with a buoy displaying the vessel 
identification of the harvesting vessel to which the gear belongs (see 
paragraph (a) of this section), a light visible for 2 miles at night in 
good visibility, and a radio buoy.
    (3) Unmarked or incorrectly identified fishing gear may be 
considered abandoned and may be disposed of in accordance with 
applicable Federal regulations by any authorized officer or CCAMLR 
inspector.
    (d) Maintenance. The operator of each harvesting vessel must:
    (1) Keep the vessel and gear identification clearly legible and in 
good repair.
    (2) Ensure that nothing on the harvesting vessel obstructs the view 
of the markings from an enforcement or inspection vessel or aircraft.
    (3) Ensure that the proper navigational lights and shapes are 
displayed for the harvesting vessel's activity and are properly 
functioning.


<R05>
Sec. 300.109  Gear disposal.

    (a) The operator of a harvesting vessel may not dump overboard, 
jettison or otherwise discard any article or substance that may 
interfere with other fishing vessels or gear, or that may catch fish or 
cause damage to any marine resource, including marine mammals and birds, 
except in cases of emergency involving the safety of the ship or crew, 
or as specifically authorized by communication from the appropriate USCG 
commander or authorized officer. These articles and substances include, 
but are not limited to, fishing gear, net scraps, bale straps, plastic 
bags, oil drums, petroleum containers, oil, toxic chemicals or any 
manmade items retrieved in a harvesting vessel's gear.
    (b) The operator of a harvesting vessel may not abandon fishing gear 
in Convention waters.
    (c) The operator of a harvesting vessel must provide a copy of the 
CCAMLR information brochure ``Marine Debris--A Potential Threat to 
Antarctic Marine Mammals'' to each member of the crew of the harvesting 
vessel and must display copies of the CCAMLR placard ``Avoidance of 
Incidental Mortality of Antarctic Marine Mammals'' in the wheelhouse and 
crew quarters of the harvesting vessels. Copies of the brochure and 
placard will be provided to each holder of a harvesting permit by NMFS 
when issuing the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 300.110  Mesh size.

    (a) The use of pelagic and bottom trawls having the mesh size in any 
part of a trawl less than indicated is prohibited for any directed 
fishing for the following Antarctic finfishes:
    (1) Notothenia rossii and Dissostichus eleginoides--120 mm.
    (2) Champsocephalus gunnari--90 mm.
    (3) Gobionotothen gibberifrons, Notothenia kempi and Lepidorhirus 
squamifrons--80 mm.
    (b) Any means or device that would reduce the size or obstruct the 
opening of the meshes is prohibited.
    (c) The following procedure will be used for determining compliance 
with mesh size requirements.
    (1) Description of gauges. (i) Gauges for determining mesh sizes 
will be 2 mm thick, flat, of durable material and capable of retaining 
their shape. They may have either a series of parallel-edged sides 
connected by intermediate tapering edges with a taper of one to eight on 
each side, or only tapering edges with the taper defined above. They 
will have a hole at the narrowest extremity.
    (ii) Each gauge will be inscribed on its face with the width in 
millimeters both on the parallel-sided section, if any, and on the 
tapering section. In the case of the latter, the width will be inscribed 
every 1 mm interval, but the

[[Page 375]]

indication of the width may appear at regular intervals other than 1 mm.
    (2) Use of the gauge. (i) The net will be stretched in the direction 
of the long diagonal of the meshes.
    (ii) A gauge as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will 
be inserted by its narrowest extremity into the mesh opening in a 
direction perpendicular to the plane of the net.
    (iii) The gauge may be inserted into the mesh opening either with a 
manual force or using a weight or dynamometer, until it is stopped at 
the tapering edges by the resistance of the mesh.
    (3) Selection of meshes to be measured. (i) Meshes to be measured 
will form a series of 20 consecutive meshes chosen in the direction of 
the long axis of the net, except that the meshes to be measured need not 
be consecutive if the application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this 
section prevents it.
    (ii) Meshes less than 50 cm from lacings, ropes, or codline will not 
be measured. This distance will be measured perpendicular to the 
lacings, ropes or codline with the net stretched in the direction of 
that measurement. No mesh will be measured which has been mended or 
broken or has attachments to the net fixed at that mesh.
    (iii) Nets will be measured only when wet and unfrozen.
    (4) The measurement of each mesh will be the width of the gauge at 
the point where the gauge is stopped, when using this gauge in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (5) Determination of the mesh size of the net will be the 
arithmetical mean in millimeters of the measurements of the total number 
of meshes selected and measured as provided for in paragraphs (c) (3) 
and (4) of this section, the arithmetical mean being rounded up to the 
next millimeter.
    (6) Inspection procedure. (i) One series of 20 meshes, selected in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be measured by 
inserting the gauge manually without using a weight or dynamometer. The 
mesh size of the net will then be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If the calculation of the mesh size 
shows that the mesh size does not appear to comply with the rules in 
force, then two additional series of 20 meshes selected in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be measured. The mesh size 
will then be recalculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section, taking into account the 60 meshes already measured; this 
recalculation will be the mesh size of the net.
    (ii) If the captain of the vessel contests the mesh size determined 
in accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, such measurement 
will not be considered for the determination of the mesh size and the 
net will be remeasured.
    (A) A weight or dynamometer attached to the gauge will be used for 
remeasurement. The choice of weight or dynamometer is at the discretion 
of the inspectors. The weight will be fixed to the hole in the narrowest 
extremity of the gauge using a hook. The dynamometer may either be fixed 
to the hole in the narrowest extremity of the gauge or be applied at the 
largest extremity of the gauge.
    (B) The accuracy of the weight or dynamometer must be certified by 
the appropriate national authority.
    (C) For nets of a mesh size of 35 mm or less as determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, a force of 19.61 
newtons (equivalent to a mass of 2 kg) will be applied, and for other 
nets, a force of 49.03 newtons (equivalent to a mass of 5 kg).
    (D) For the purposes of determining the mesh size in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section, when using a weight or dynamometer, 
one series of 20 meshes only will be measured.


<R05>
Sec. 300.111  Framework for annual management measures.

    (a) Introduction. New management measures may be added and others 
modified through publication of a regulatory action in the Federal 
Register. The following framework process authorizes the implementation 
of measures that may affect the operation of the commercial or 
exploratory fisheries, gear, area restrictions, or changes in catch and/
or effort.
    (b) Preliminary notice. The Secretary of State shall publish 
preliminary notice in the Federal Register of the management measures 
adopted by the parties to the Convention.

[[Page 376]]

    (c) Procedure. At its annual meeting, usually in October or 
November, the Commission may recommend new measures and that established 
measures be modified, removed, or re-instituted. After public notice of 
those recommendations by the Secretary of State and opportunity for 
public comment, and after considering the impact of instituting the 
measures and any public comment received by the Secretary of State, the 
Assistant Administrator may implement the management measures by notice 
in the Federal Register, with immediate force and effect. The 
notification in the Federal Register will summarize new management 
measures, and respond to any public comments received by the Secretary 
of State on the preliminary notice.
    (d) Types of management measures to be frameworked. Management 
measures that may be implemented by regulatory notice rather than by 
codified regulation are those that generally will not remain in effect 
for more than 12 months and include catch restrictions, time and area 
closures, and gear restrictions.


<R05>
Sec. 300.112  Harvesting permits.

    (a) General. (1) Every vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States that attempts to reduce or reduces any AMLR to possession 
must have a harvesting permit authorizing the attempt or reduction, 
unless the attempt or reduction occurs during recreational fishing or is 
covered by an individual permit. Boats launched from a vessel issued a 
harvesting permit do not require a separate permit, but are covered by 
the permit issued the launching vessel. Any enforcement action that 
results from the activities of a launched boat will be taken against the 
launching vessel.
    (2) Permits issued under this section do not authorize vessels or 
persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to harass, 
capture, harm, kill, harvest, or import marine mammals. No marine 
mammals may be taken in the course of commercial fishing operations 
unless the taking is allowed under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/
or the Endangered Species Act pursuant to an exemption or permit granted 
by the appropriate agency.
    (b) Responsibility of owners and operators. (1) The owners and 
operators of each harvesting vessel are jointly and severally 
responsible for compliance with the Act, this subpart, and any permit 
issued under the Act and this subpart.
    (2) The owners and operators of each such vessel are responsible for 
the acts of their employees and agents constituting violations, 
regardless of whether the specific acts were authorized or forbidden by 
the owners or operators, and regardless of knowledge concerning their 
occurrence.
    (3) The owner of such vessel must report any sale, change in 
ownership, or other disposition of the vessel to the Assistant 
Administrator within 15 days of the occurrence.
    (c) Application. Application forms for harvesting permits are 
available from the Assistant Administrator (Attn: CCAMLR permits). A 
separate fully completed and accurate application must be submitted for 
each vessel for which a harvesting permit is requested at least 90 days 
before the date anticipated for the beginning of harvesting.
    (d) Issuance. The Assistant Administrator may issue a harvesting 
permit to a vessel if the Assistant Administrator determines that the 
harvesting described in the application will meet the requirements of 
the Act and will not:
    (1) Decrease the size of any harvested population to levels below 
those that ensure its stable recruitment. For this purpose, the 
Convention recommends that its size not be allowed to fall below a level 
close to that which ensures the greatest net annual increment.
    (2) Upset the ecological relationships between harvested, dependent, 
and related populations of AMLRs and the restoration of depleted 
populations to levels that will ensure stable recruitment.
    (3) Cause changes or increase the risk of changes in the marine 
ecosystem that are not potentially reversible over 2 or 3 decades, 
taking into account the state of available knowledge of the direct and 
indirect impact of harvesting, the effect of the introduction of alien

[[Page 377]]

species, the effects of associated activities on the marine ecosystem 
and of the effects of environmental changes, with the aim of making 
possible the sustained conservation of AMLRs.
    (4) Violate the management measures issued pursuant to Sec. 300.111 
of this subpart.
    (5) Violate any other conservation measures in force with respect to 
the United States under the Convention or the Act.
    (e) Duration. A harvesting permit is valid from its date of issuance 
to its date of expiration unless it is revoked or suspended.
    (f) Transfer. Permits are not transferable or assignable. A permit 
is valid only for the vessel to which it is issued.
    (g) Display. Each harvesting vessel when engaged in harvesting must 
either have on board an up-to-date copy of its harvesting permit or a 
fully completed and up-to-date harvesting vessel certificate and the 
vessel operator must produce it for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector. In order for the certificate to 
be considered complete, the vessel owner or operator must enter on it 
the name and IRCS of the vessel issued the harvesting permit, the number 
of the harvesting permit and its date of issuance and expiration, the 
harvesting authorized by the permit, and all conditions and restrictions 
contained in the permit. Blank certificates are available from the 
Assistant Administrator.
    (h) Changes in information submitted by permit applicants or 
holders--(1) Changes in pending applications. Applicants for a 
harvesting permit must report to the Assistant Administrator in writing 
any change in the information contained in the application. The 
processing period for the application will be extended as necessary to 
review the change.
    (2) Changes occurring after permit issuance--(i) Changes other than 
in the manner and amount of harvesting. The owner or operator of a 
vessel that has been issued a harvesting permit must report to the 
Assistant Administrator in writing any change in previously submitted 
information other than a proposed change in the location, manner, or 
amount of harvesting within 15 days of the change. Based on such 
reported information, the Assistant Administrator may revise the permit 
effective upon notification to the permit holder. As soon as possible, 
the vessel owner or operator must revise any harvesting vessel 
certificate evidencing the permit, accordingly.
    (ii) Requested changes in the location, manner, or amount of 
harvesting. Any changes in the manner or amount of harvesting must be 
proposed in writing to the Assistant Administrator and may not be 
undertaken unless authorized by the Assistant Administrator through a 
permit revision or issuance of a new permit. If a requested change in 
the location, manner, or amount of harvesting could significantly affect 
the status of any Antarctic marine living resource, the Assistant 
Administrator will treat the requested change as an application for a 
new permit and so notify the holder.
    (i) Additional conditions and restrictions. The Assistant 
Administrator may revise the harvesting permit, effective upon 
notification to the permit holder, to impose additional conditions and 
restrictions on the harvesting vessel as necessary to achieve the 
purposes of the Convention or the Act. The permit holder must, as soon 
as possible, direct the vessel operator to revise the harvesting vessel 
certificate, if any, accordingly.
    (j) Revision, suspension, or revocation for violations. A harvesting 
permit may be revised, suspended, or revoked if the harvesting vessel is 
involved in the commission of any violation of its permit, the Act, or 
this subpart. Failure to report a change in the information contained in 
an application within 15 days of the change is a violation of this 
subpart and voids the application or permit, as applicable. If a change 
in vessel ownership is not reported, the violation is chargeable to the 
previous owner. Title 15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under 
this subpart.
    (k) Transshipment vessels. Any U.S. flagged vessel that receives or 
attempts to receive Dissostichus species from a harvesting vessel at 
sea, regardless of whether such transshipment occurs in waters under the 
jurisdiction of CCAMLR, must obtain from NMFS a

[[Page 378]]

harvesting permit authorizing transshipment. Transshipment vessels must 
comply with the permitting provisions of this section with respect to 
harvesting vessels.

Sec. 300.113  Dealer permits.

    (a) General. (1) A dealer must obtain an AMLRs dealer permit from 
NMFS. Only those specific activities stipulated by the permit are 
authorized for the permit holder.
    (2) An AMLR may be imported into the United States if its harvest 
has been authorized by a U.S.-issued individual permit or a harvesting 
permit issued under Sec. 300.112 (a)(1) or its importation has been 
authorized by a NMFS-issued dealer permit issued under paragraph (a) of 
this section. AMLR's may not be released for entry into the United 
States unless accompanied by the harvesting permit, the individual 
permit, a NMFS-issued dealer permit, or a copy thereof.
    (3) In addition to any applicable catch documentation required under 
Sec. 300.107 (c)(1), the dealer is required to complete and return to 
NMFS, no later than 24 hours after the date of the importation, an 
import ticket reporting the importation. In no event may a marine mammal 
be imported into the United States unless authorized and accompanied by 
an import permit issued under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or 
the Endangered Species Act.
    (4) A dealer permit issued under this section does not authorize the 
harvest or transshipment of any AMLR by or to a vessel of the United 
States.
    (b) Application. Application forms for AMLR dealer permits are 
available from NMFS. A complete and accurate application must be 
submitted for each permit at least 30 days before the anticipated date 
of the first receipt, importation, or re-export.
    (c) Issuance. NMFS may issue a dealer permit if it determines that 
the activity proposed by the dealer meets the requirements of the Act 
and that the resources were not or will not be harvested in violation of 
any conservation measure in force with respect to the United States or 
in violation of any regulation in this subpart.
    (d) Duration. A permit issued under this section is valid from its 
date of issuance to its date of expiration unless it is revoked or 
suspended.
    (e) Transfer. A permit issued under this section is not transferable 
or assignable.
    (f) Changes in information-(1) Pending applications. Applicants for 
permits under this section must report in writing to NMFS any change in 
the information submitted in their permit applications. The processing 
period for the application will be extended as necessary to review and 
consider the change.
    (2) Issued permits. Any entity issued a permit under this section 
must report in writing to NMFS any changes in previously submitted 
information. Any changes that would not result in a change in the 
receipt or importation authorized by the permit must be reported on the 
import ticket required to be submitted to NMFS no later than 24 hours 
after the date of receipt or importation. Any changes that would result 
in a change in the receipt or importation authorized by the permit, 
i.e., harvesting vessel or country of origin, type and quantity of the 
resource to be received or imported, and Convention statistical subarea 
from which the resource was harvested must be proposed in writing to 
NMFS and may not be undertaken unless authorized by NMFS through 
issuance of a revised or new permit.
    (g) Revision, suspension, or revocation. A permit issued under this 
section may be revised, suspended, or revoked, based upon a violation of 
the permit, the Act, or this subpart. Failure to report a change in the 
information contained in a permit application voids the application or 
permit, as applicable. Title 15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions 
under this subpart.

Sec. 300.116  Facilitation of enforcement and inspection.

    In addition to the facilitation of enforcement provisions of 
Sec. 300.5, the following requirements apply to this subpart.
    (a) Access and records. (1) The owners and operator of each 
harvesting vessel

[[Page 380]]

must provide authorized officers and CCAMLR inspectors access to all 
spaces where work is conducted or business papers and records are 
prepared or stored, including but not limited to personal quarters and 
areas within personal quarters. If inspection of a particular area would 
interfere with specific on-going scientific research, and if the 
operator of the harvesting vessel makes such assertion and produces an 
individual permit that covers that specific research, the authorized

    (a) Application for annual permits. U.S. vessel owners and operators 
must have a valid permit issued by the Russian Federation obtained 
pursuant to a complete application submitted through NMFS before fishing 
in the Russian EZ or for Russian fishery resources. Application forms 
and copies of applicable laws and regulations of the Russian Federation 
may be obtained from NMFS Headquarters.
    (b) Other application information. Applications for motherships, 
processing or transport vessels must identify the type of fishing gear 
to be employed or the fishing quotas if the vessel has received or is 
requesting a quota. To facilitate processing, NMFS requests that permit 
applications for more than 10 vessels be grouped by type and fishing 
area, and provide the name, address, telephone, and FAX number(s) of an 
individual who will be the official point of contact for an application.

[[Page 390]]

    (c) Review of Applications. NMFS will review each application, and, 
if it is complete, forward it to the Department of State for submission 
to the competent authorities of the Russian Federation. NMFS will notify 
the permit applicant when the permit is submitted to the Russian 
Federation. NMFS will return incomplete applications to the applicant.
    (d) Direct Communication. U.S. applicants may communicate directly 
with the Russian Federation with regard to the status of their 
applications or permits and are encouraged to do so. Owners and 
operators should make direct contact and work with Russian industry and 
government authorities.

Sec. 300.153  Permit issuance.

    (a) Acceptance. Once the Department of State has accepted the 
conditions and restrictions proposed by the Russian Federation and all 
fees have been paid, the competent authorities of the Russian Federation 
will approve the application. The Russian Federation will issue a permit 
to the vessel owner for each fishing vessel for which it has approved an 
application. That vessel will thereupon be authorized by the Russian 
Federation to fish in accordance with the Agreement and the terms and 
conditions set forth in the permit. The vessel owner is prohibited from 
transferring the permit to any other vessel or person. Any such 
transfer, or the sale or other transfer of the vessel, will immediately 
invalidate the permit. The vessel owner must notify NMFS of any change 
in the permit application information submitted to NMFS Headquarters 
under Sec. 300.152 within 7 calendar days of the change.
    (b) Copies. The vessel owner and operator must mail a copy of each 
permit and any conditions and restrictions issued for that vessel by the 
Russian Federation within 7 calendar days of its receipt to NMFS 
Headquarters.

(a) of this section.
    (3) The U.S. Department of State has notified the competent 
authorities of the Russian Federation that it has accepted the 
conditions and restrictions as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The permit will be rendered invalid by: The transfer or sale of 
the permit specified in paragraph (a) of this section; the failure to 
submit to NMFS any changes in permit application information as required 
by paragraph (a) of this section; failure to submit to NMFS any permit 
copy required by paragraph (b) of this section or any other information 
or report required by any other provision of this subpart; or the 
failure to pay required permit fees.
    (d) Russian-imposed sanctions. (1) The Russian Federation will 
impose appropriate fines, penalties, or forfeitures in accordance with 
its laws, for violations of its relevant laws or regulations.
    (2) In the case of arrest and seizure of a U.S. vessel by Russian 
authorities, notification will be given promptly through diplomatic 
channels informing the United States of the facts and actions taken.
    (3) The Russian Federation will release U.S. vessels and their crews 
promptly, subject to the posting of reasonable bond or other security.

container, only the outermost container must be marked in accordance 
with this section, provided, that for live fish or wildlife that are 
packed in subcontainers within a larger packing container, if the 
subcontainers are numbered or labeled, the packing list, invoice, bill 
of lading, or other similar document, must reflect that number or label.
    (4) A conveyance (truck, plane, boat, etc.) is not considered a 
container for purposes of requiring specific marking of the conveyance 
itself, provided that:
    (i) The fish or wildlife within the conveyance is carried loosely or 
is readily identifiable, and is accompanied by the document required by 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; or
    (ii) The fish or wildlife is otherwise packaged and marked in

<R05>
Sec. 402.01  Scope.

    (a) This part interprets and implements sections 7(a)-(d) [16 U.S.C. 
1536(a)-(d)] of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended 
(``Act''). Section 7(a) grants authority to and imposes requirements 
upon Federal agencies regarding endangered or threatened species of 
fish, wildlife, or plants (``listed species'') and habitat of such 
species that has been designated as critical (``critical habitat''). 
Section 7(a)(1) of the Act directs Federal agencies, in consultation 
with and with the assistance of the Secretary of the Interior or of 
Commerce, as appropriate, to utilize their authorities to further the 
purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs for listed 
species. Such affirmative conservation programs must comply with 
applicable permit requirements (50 CFR parts 17, 220, 222, and 227) for 
listed species and should be coordinated with the appropriate Secretary. 
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires every Federal agency, in 
consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, to insure 
that any action it authorizes, funds, or carries out, in the United 
States or upon the high seas, is not likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of any listed species or results in the destruction or adverse 
modification of critical habitat. Section 7(a)(3) of the Act authorizes 
a prospective permit or license applicant to request the issuing Federal 
agency to enter into early consultation with the Service on a proposed 
action to determine whether such action is likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or 
adverse modification of critical habitat. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act 
requires Federal agencies to confer with the Secretary on any action 
that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species 
or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed 
critical habitat. Section 7(b) of the Act requires the Secretary, after 
the conclusion of early or formal consultation, to issue a written 
statement setting forth the Secretary's opinion detailing how the agency 
action affects

[[Page 401]]

listed species or critical habitat Biological assessments are required 
under section 7(c) of the Act if listed species or critical habitat may 
be present in the area affected by any major construction activity as 
defined in Sec. 404.02. Section 7(d) of the Act prohibits Federal 
agencies and applicants from making any irreversible or irretrievable 
commitment of resources which has the effect of foreclosing the 
formulation or implementation of reasonable and prudent alternatives 
which would avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species 
or resulting in the destruction or adverse modification of critical 
habitat. Section 7(e)-(o)(1) of the Act provide procedures for granting 
exemptions from the requirements of section 7(a)(2). Regulations 
governing the submission of exemption applications are found at 50 CFR 
part 451, and regulations governing the exemption process are found at 
50 CFR parts 450, 452, and 453.
    (b) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS) share responsibilities for administering the 
Act. The Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants are 
found in 50 CFR 17.11 and 17.12 and the designated critical habitats are 
found in 50 CFR 17.95 and 17.96 and 50 CFR part 226. Endangered or 
threatened species under the jurisdiction of the NMFS are located in 50 
CFR 222.23(a) and 227.4. If the subject species is cited in 50 CFR 
222.23(a) or 227.4, the Federal agency shall contact the NMFS. For all 
other listed species the Federal Agency shall contact the FWS.


<R05>
Sec. 402.02  Definitions.

    Act means the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.
    Action means all activities or programs of any kind authorized, 
funded, or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the 
United States or upon the high seas. Examples include, but are not 
limited to:
    (a) actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat;
    (b) the promulgation of regulations;
    (c) the granting of licenses, contracts, leases, easements, rights-
of-way, permits, or grants-in-aid; or
    (d) actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the 
land, water, or air.
    Action area means all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by 
the Federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in the 
action.
    Applicant refers to any person, as defined in section 3(13) of the 
Act, who requires formal approval or authorization from a Federal agency 
as a prerequisite to conducting the action.
    Biological assessment refers to the information prepared by or under 
the direction of the Federal agency concerning listed and proposed 
species and designated and proposed critical habitat that may be present 
in the action area and the evaluation potential effects of the action on 
such species and habitat.
    Biological opinion is the document that states the opinion of the 
Service as to whether or not the Federal action is likely to jeopardize 
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction 
or adverse modification of critical habitat.
    Conference is a process which involves informal discussions between 
a Federal agency and the Service under section 7(a)(4) of the Act 
regarding the impact of an action on proposed species or proposed 
critical habitat and recommendations to minimize or avoid the adverse 
effects.
    Conservation recommendations are suggestions of the Service 
regarding discretionary measures to minimize or avoid adverse effects of 
a proposed action on listed species or critical habitat or regarding the 
development of information.
    Critical habitat refers to an area designated as critical habitat 
listed in 50 CFR parts 17 or 226.
    Cumulative effects are those effects of future State or private 
activities, not involving Federal activities, that are reasonably 
certain to occur within the action area of the Federal action subject to 
consultation.
    Designated non-Federal representative refers to a person designated 
by the Federal agency as its representative to conduct informal 
consultation and/or to prepare any biological assessment.
    Destruction or adverse modification means a direct or indirect 
alteration

[[Page 402]]

that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the 
survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but 
are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those 
physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the 
habitat to be critical.
    Director refers to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or his authorized 
representative; or the Fish and Wildlife Service regional director, or 
his authorized representative, for the region where the action would be 
carried out.
    Early consultation is a process requested by a Federal agency on 
behalf of a prospective applicant under section 7(a)(3) of the Act.
    Effects of the action refers to the direct and indirect effects of 
an action on the species or critical habitat, together with the effects 
of other activities that are interrelated or interdependent with that 
action, that will be added to the environmental baseline. The 
environmental baseline includes the past and present impacts of all 
Federal, State, or private actions and other human activities in the 
action area, the anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal projects in 
the action area that have already undergone formal or early section 7 
consultation, and the impact of State or private actions which are 
contemporaneous with the consultation in process. Indirect effects are 
those that are caused by the proposed action and are later in time, but 
still are reasonably certain to occur. Interrelated actions are those 
that are part of a larger action and depend on the larger action for 
their justification. Interdependent actions are those that have no 
independent utility apart from the action under consideration.
    Formal consultation is a process between the Service and the Federal 
agency that commences with the Federal agency's written request for 
consultation under section 7(a)(2) of the Act and concludes with the 
Service's issuance of the biological opinion under section 7(b)(3) of 
the Act.
    Incidental take refers to takings that result from, but are not the 
purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity conducted by the 
Federal agency or applicant.
    Informal consultation is an optional process that includes all 
discussions, correspondence, etc., between the Service and the Federal 
agency or the designated non-Federal representative prior to formal 
consultation, if required.
    Jeopardize the continued existence of means to engage in an action 
that reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce 
appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed 
species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or 
distribution of that species.
    Listed species means any species of fish, wildlife, or plant which 
has been determined to be endangered or threatened under section 4 of 
the Act. Listed species are found in 50 CFR 17.11-17.12.
    Major construction activity is a construction project (or other 
undertaking having similar physical impacts) which is a major Federal 
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment as 
referred to in the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 
4332(2)(C)].
    Preliminary biological opinion refers to an opinion issued as a 
result of early consultation.
    Proposed critical habitat means habitat proposed in the Federal 
Register to be designated or revised as critical habitat under section 4 
of the Act for any listed or proposed species.
    Proposed species means any species of fish, wildlife, or plant that 
is proposed in the Federal Register to be listed under section 4 of the 
Act.
    Reasonable and prudent alternatives refer to alternative actions 
identified during formal consultation that can be implemented in a 
manner consistent with the intended purpose of the action, that can be 
implemented consistent with the scope of the Federal agency's legal 
authority and jurisdiction, that is economically and technologically 
feasible, and that the Director believes would avoid the likelihood of 
jeopardizing the continued existence of listed species or resulting in 
the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
    Reasonable and prudent measures refer to those actions the Director 
believes

[[Page 403]]

necessary or appropriate to minimize the impacts, i.e., amount or 
extent, of incidental take.
    Recovery means improvement in the status of listed species to the 
point at which listing is no longer appropriate under the criteria set 
out in section 4(a)(1) of the Act.
    Service means the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National 
Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 402.03  Applicability.

    Section 7 and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in 
which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control.


<R05>
Sec. 402.04  Counterpart regulations.

    The consultation procedures set forth in this part may be superseded 
for a particular Federal agency by joint counterpart regulations among 
that agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. Such counterpart regulations shall be published in 
the Federal Register in proposed form and shall be subject to public 
comment for at least 60 days before final rules are published.


<R05>
Sec. 402.05  Emergencies.

    (a) Where emergency circumstances mandate the need to consult in an 
expedited manner, consultation may be conducted informally through 
alternative procedures that the Director determines to be consistent 
with the requirements of sections 7(a)-(d) of the Act. This provision 
applies to situations involving acts of God, disasters, casualties, 
national defense or security emergencies, etc.
    (b) Formal consultation shall be initiated as soon as practicable 
after the emergency is under control. The Federal agency shall submit 
information on the nature of the emergency action(s), the justification 
for the expedited consultation, and the impacts to endangered or 
threatened species and their habitats. The Service will evaluate such 
information and issue a biological opinion including the information and 
recommendations given during the emergency consultation.


<R05>
Sec. 402.06  Coordination with other environmental reviews.

    (a) Consultation, conference, and biological assessment procedures 
under section 7 may be consolidated with interagency cooperation 
procedures required by other statutes, such as the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., implemented at 
40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) or the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) 
(16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.). Satisfying the requirements of these other 
statutes, however, does not in itself relieve a Federal agency of its 
obligations to comply with the procedures set forth in this part or the 
substantive requirements of section 7. The Service will attempt to 
provide a coordinated review and analysis of all environmental 
requirements.
    (b) Where the consultation or conference has been consolidated with 
the interagency cooperation procedures required by other statutes such 
as NEPA or FWCA, the results should be included in the documents 
required by those statutes.


<R05>
Sec. 402.07  Designation of lead agency.

    When a particular action involves more than one Federal agency, the 
consultation and conference responsibilities may be fulfilled through a 
lead agency. Factors relevant in determining an appropriate lead agency 
include the time sequence in which the agencies would become involved, 
the magnitude of their respective involvement, and their relative 
expertise with respect to the environmental effects of the action. The 
Director shall be notified of the designation in writing by the lead 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 402.08  Designation of non-Federal representative.

    A Federal agency may designate a non-Federal representative to 
conduct informal consultation or prepare a biological assessment by 
giving written notice to the Director of such designation. If a permit 
or license applicant is involved and is not the designated non-Federal 
representative, then the applicant and Federal agency must agree on the 
choice of the designated non-Federal representative. If a biological 
assessment is prepared by the designated

[[Page 404]]

non-Federal representative, the Federal agency shall furnish guidance 
and supervision and shall independently review and evaluate the scope 
and contents of the biological assessment. The ultimate responsibility 
for compliance with section 7 remains with the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 402.09  Irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources.

    After initiation or reinitiation of consultation required under 
section 7(a)(2) of the Act, the Federal agency and any applicant shall 
make no irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources with 
respect to the agency action which has the effect of foreclosing the 
formulation or implementation of any reasonable and prudent alternatives 
which would avoid violating section 7(a)(2). This prohibition is in 
force during the consultation process and continues until the 
requirements of section 7(a)(2) are satisfied. This provision does not 
apply to the conference requirement for proposed species or proposed 
critical habitat under section 7(a)(4) of the Act.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Consultation Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 402.10  Conference on proposed species or proposed critical habitat.

    (a) Each Federal agency shall confer with the Service on any action 
which is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any proposed 
species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed 
critical habitat. The conference is designed to assist the Federal 
agency and any applicant in identifying and resolving potential 
conflicts at an early stage in the planning process.
    (b) The Federal agency shall initiate the conference with the 
Director. The Service may request a conference if, after a review of 
available information, it determines that a conference is required for a 
particular action.
    (c) A conference between a Federal agency and the Service shall 
consist of informal discussions concerning an action that is likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of the proposed species or result in 
the destruction or adverse modification of the proposed critical habitat 
at issue. Applicants may be involved in these informal discussions to 
the greatest extent practicable. During the conference, the Service will 
make advisory recommendations, if any, on ways to minimize or avoid 
adverse effects. If the proposed species is subsequently listed or the 
proposed critical habitat is designated prior to completion of the 
action, the Federal agency must review the action to determine whether 
formal consultation is required.
    (d) If requested by the Federal agency and deemed appropriate by the 
Service, the conference may be conducted in accordance with the 
procedures for formal consultation in Sec. 402.14. An opinion issued at 
the conclusion of the conference may be adopted as the biological 
opinion when the species is listed or critical habitat is designated, 
but only if no significant new information is developed (including that 
developed during the rulemaking process on the proposed listing or 
critical habitat designation) and no significant changes to the Federal 
action are made that would alter the content of the opinion. An 
incidental take statement provided with a conference opinion does not 
become effective unless the Service adopts the opinion once the listing 
is final.
    (e) The conclusions reached during a conference and any 
recommendations shall be documented by the Service and provided to the 
Federal agency and to any applicant. The style and magnitude of this 
document will vary with the complexity of the conference. If formal 
consultation also is required for a particular action, then the Service 
will provide the results of the conference with the biological opinion.


<R05>
Sec. 402.11  Early consultation.

    (a) Purpose. Early consultation is designed to reduce the likelihood 
of conflicts between listed species or critical habitat and proposed 
actions and occurs prior to the filing of an application for a Federal 
permit or license. Although early consultation is conducted between the 
Service and the Federal agency, the prospective applicant should be 
involved throughout the consultation process.
    (b) Request by prospective applicant. If a prospective applicant has 
reason to

[[Page 405]]

believe that the prospective action may affect listed species or 
critical habitat, it may request the Federal agency to enter into early 
consultation with the Service. The prospective applicant must certify in 
writing to the Federal agency that (1) it has a definitive proposal 
outlining the action and its effects and (2) it intends to implement its 
proposal, if authorized.
    (c) Initiation of early consultation. If the Federal agency receives 
the prospective applicant's certification in paragraph (b) of this 
section, then the Federal agency shall initiate early consultation with 
the Service. This request shall be in writing and contain the 
information outlined in Sec. 402.14(c) and, if the action is a major 
construction activity, the biological assessment as outlined in 
Sec. 402.12.
    (d) Procedures and responsibilities. The procedures and 
responsibilities for early consultation are the same as outlined in 
Sec. 402.14(c)-(j) for formal consultation, except that all references 
to the ``applicant'' shall be treated as the ``prospective applicant'' 
and all references to the ``biological opinion'' or the ``opinion'' 
shall be treated as the ``preliminary biological opinion'' for the 
purpose of this section.
    (e) Preliminary biological opinion. The contents and conclusions of 
a preliminary biological opinion are the same as for a biological 
opinion issued after formal consultation except that the incidental take 
statement provided with a preliminary biological opinion does not 
constitute authority to take listed species.
    (f) Confirmation of preliminary biological opinion as final 
biological opinion. A preliminary biological opinion may be confirmed as 
a biological opinion issued after formal consultation if the Service 
reviews the proposed action and finds that there have been no 
significant changes in the action as planned or in the information used 
during the early consultation. A written request for confirmation of the 
preliminary biological opinion should be submitted after the prospective 
applicant applies to the Federal agency for a permit or license but 
prior to the issuance of such permit or license. Within 45 days of 
receipt of the Federal agency's request, the Service shall either:
    (1) Confirm that the preliminary biological opinion stands as a 
final biological opinion; or
    (2) If the findings noted above cannot be made, request that the 
Federal agency initiate formal consultation.


<R05>
Sec. 402.12  Biological assessments.

    (a) Purpose. A biological assessment shall evaluate the potential 
effects of the action on listed and proposed species and designated and 
proposed critical habitat and determine whether any such species or 
habitat are likely to be adversely affected by the action and is used in 
determining whether formal consultation or a conference is necessary.
    (b) Preparation requirement. (1) The procedures of this section are 
required for Federal actions that are ``major construction activities''; 
provided that a contract for construction was not entered into or actual 
construction was not begun on or before November 10, 1978. Any person, 
including those who may wish to apply for an exemption from section 
7(a)(2) of the Act, may prepare a biological assessment under the 
supervision of the Federal agency and in cooperation with the Service 
consistent with the procedures and requirements of this section. An 
exemption from the requirements of section 7(a)(2) is not permanent 
unless a biological assessment has been prepared.
    (2) The biological assessment shall be completed before any contract 
for construction is entered into and before construction is begun.
    (c) Request for information. The Federal agency or the designated 
non-Federal representative shall convey to the Director either (1) a 
written request for a list of any listed or proposed species or 
designated or proposed critical habitat that may be present in the 
action area; or (2) a written notification of the species and critical 
habitat that are being included in the biological assessment.
    (d) Director's response. Within 30 days of receipt of the 
notification of, or the request for, a species list, the Director shall 
either concur with or revise the list or, in those cases where no list 
has

[[Page 406]]

been provided, advise the Federal agency or the designated non-Federal 
representative in writing whether, based on the best scientific and 
commercial data available, any listed or proposed species or designated 
or proposed critical habitat may be present in the action area. In 
addition to listed and proposed species, the Director will provide a 
list of candidate species that may be present in the action area. 
Candidate species refers to any species being considered by the Service 
for listing as endangered or threatened species but not yet the subject 
of a proposed rule. Although candidate species have no legal status and 
are accorded no protection under the Act, their inclusion will alert the 
Federal agency of potential proposals or listings.
    (1) If the Director advises that no listed species or critical 
habitat may be present, the Federal agency need not prepare a biological 
assessment and further consultation is not required. If only proposed 
species or proposed critical habitat may be present in the action area, 
then the Federal agency must confer with the Service if required under 
Sec. 402.10, but preparation of a biological assessment is not required 
unless the proposed listing and/or designation becomes final.
    (2) If a listed species or critical habitat may be present in the 
action area, the Director will provide a species list or concur with the 
species list provided. The Director also will provide available 
information (or references thereto) regarding these species and critical 
habitat, and may recommend discretionary studies or surveys that may 
provide a better information base for the preparation of an assessment. 
Any recommendation for studies or surveys is not to be construed as the 
Service's opinion that the Federal agency has failed to satisfy the 
information standard of section 7(a)(2) of the Act.
    (e) Verification of current accuracy of species list. If the Federal 
agency or the designated non-Federal representative does not begin 
preparation of the biological assessment within 90 days of receipt of 
(or concurrence with) the species list, the Federal agency or the 
designated non-Federal representative must verify (formally or 
informally) with the Service the current accuracy of the species list at 
the time the preparation of the assessment is begun.
    (f) Contents. The contents of a biological assessment are at the 
discretion of the Federal agency and will depend on the nature of the 
Federal action. The following may be considered for inclusion:
    (1) The results of an on-site inspection of the area affected by the 
action to determine if listed or proposed species are present or occur 
seasonally.
    (2) The views of recognized experts on the species at issue.
    (3) A review of the literature and other information.
    (4) An analysis of the effects of the action on the species and 
habitat, including consideration of cumulative effects, and the results 
of any related studies.
    (5) An analysis of alternate actions considered by the Federal 
agency for the proposed action.
    (g) Incorporation by reference. If a proposed action requiring the 
preparation of a biological assessment is identical, or very similar, to 
a previous action for which a biological assessment was prepared, the 
Federal agency may fulfill the biological assessment requirement for the 
proposed action by incorporating by reference the earlier biological 
assessment, plus any supporting data from other documents that are 
pertinent to the consultation, into a written certification that:
    (1) The proposed action involves similar impacts to the same species 
in the same geographic area;
    (2) No new species have been listed or proposed or no new critical 
habitat designated or proposed for the action area; and
    (3) The biological assessment has been supplemented with any 
relevant changes in information.
    (h) Permit requirements. If conducting a biological assessment will 
involve the taking of a listed species, a permit under section 10 of the 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1539) and part 17 of this title (with respect to species 
under the jurisdiction of the FWS) or parts 220, 222, and 227 of this 
title (with respect to species under the jurisdiction of the NMFS) is 
required.

[[Page 407]]

    (i) Completion time. The Federal agency or the designated non- 
Federal representative shall complete the biological assessment within 
180 days after its initiation (receipt of or concurrence with the 
species list) unless a different period of time is agreed to by the 
Director and the Federal agency. If a permit or license applicant is 
involved, the 180-day period may not be extended unless the agency 
provides the applicant, before the close of the 180-day period, with a 
written statement setting forth the estimated length of the proposed 
extension and the reasons why such an extension is necessary.
    (j) Submission of biological assessment. The Federal agency shall 
submit the completed biological assessment to the Director for review. 
The Director will respond in writing within 30 days as to whether or not 
he concurs with the findings of the biological assessment. At the option 
of the Federal agency, formal consultation may be initiated under 
Sec. 402.14(c) concurrently with the submission of the assessment.
    (k) Use of the biological assessment. (1) The Federal agency shall 
use the biological assessment in determining whether formal consultation 
or a conference is required under Sec. 402.14 or Sec. 402.10, 
respectively. If the biological assessment indicates that there are no 
listed species or critical habitat present that are likely to be 
adversely affected by the action and the Director concurs as specified 
in paragraph (j) of this section, then formal consultation is not 
required. If the biological assessment indicates that the action is not 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species or 
result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical 
habitat, and the Director concurs, then a conference is not required.
    (2) The Director may use the results of the biological assessment in 
(i) determining whether to request the Federal agency to initiate formal 
consultation or a conference, (ii) formulating a biological opinion, or 
(iii) formulating a preliminary biological opinion.


<R05>
Sec. 402.13  Informal consultation.

    (a) Informal consultation is an optional process that includes all 
discussions, correspondence, etc., between the Service and the Federal 
agency or the designated non-Federal representative, designed to assist 
the Federal agency in determining whether formal consultation or a 
conference is required. If during informal consultation it is determined 
by the Federal agency, with the written concurrence of the Service, that 
the action is not likely to adversely affect listed species or critical 
habitat, the consultation process is terminated, and no further action 
is necessary.
    (b) During informal consultation, the Service may suggest 
modifications to the action that the Federal agency and any applicant 
could implement to avoid the likelihood of adverse effects to listed 
species or critical habitat.


<R05>
Sec. 402.14  Formal consultation.

    (a) Requirement for formal consultation. Each Federal agency shall 
review its actions at the earliest possible time to determine whether 
any action may affect listed species or critical habitat. If such a 
determination is made, formal consultation is required, except as noted 
in paragraph (b) of this section. The Director may request a Federal 
agency to enter into consultation if he identifies any action of that 
agency that may affect listed species or critical habitat and for which 
there has been no consultation. When such a request is made, the 
Director shall forward to the Federal agency a written explanation of 
the basis for the request.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) A Federal agency need not initiate formal 
consultation if, as a result of the preparation of a biological 
assessment under Sec. 402.12 or as a result of informal consultation 
with the Service under Sec. 402.13, the Federal agency determines, with 
the written concurrence of the Director, that the proposed action is not 
likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat.
    (2) A Federal agency need not initiate formal consultation if a 
preliminary biological opinion, issued after early consultation under 
Sec. 402.11, is confirmed as the final biological opinion.

[[Page 408]]

    (c) Initiation of formal consultation. A written request to initiate 
formal consultation shall be submitted to the Director and shall 
include:
    (1) A description of the action to be considered;
    (2) A description of the specific area that may be affected by the 
action;
    (3) A description of any listed species or critical habitat that may 
be affected by the action;
    (4) A description of the manner in which the action may affect any 
listed species or critical habitat and an analysis of any cumulative 
effects;
    (5) Relevant reports, including any environmental impact statement, 
environmental assessment, or biological assessment prepared; and
    (6) Any other relevant available information on the action, the 
affected listed species, or critical habitat.

Formal consultation shall not be initiated by the Federal agency until 
any required biological assessment has been completed and submitted to 
the Director in accordance with Sec. 402.12. Any request for formal 
consultation may encompass, subject to the approval of the Director, a 
number of similar individual actions within a given geographical area or 
a segment of a comprehensive plan. This does not relieve the Federal 
agency of the requirements for considering the effects of the action as 
a whole.
    (d) Responsibility to provide best scientific and commercial data 
available. The Federal agency requesting formal consultation shall 
provide the Service with the best scientific and commercial data 
available or which can be obtained during the consultation for an 
adequate review of the effects that an action may have upon listed 
species or critical habitat. This information may include the results of 
studies or surveys conducted by the Federal agency or the designated 
non-Federal representative. The Federal agency shall provide any 
applicant with the opportunity to submit information for consideration 
during the consultation.
    (e) Duration and extension of formal consultation. Formal 
consultation concludes within 90 days after its initiation unless 
extended as provided below. If an applicant is not involved, the Service 
and the Federal agency may mutually agree to extend the consultation for 
a specific time period. If an applicant is involved, the Service and the 
Federal agency may mutually agree to extend the consultation provided 
that the Service submits to the applicant, before the close of the 90 
days, a written statement setting forth:
    (1) The reasons why a longer period is required,
    (2) The information that is required to complete the consultation, 
and
    (3) The estimated date on which the consultation will be completed.

A consultation involving an applicant cannot be extended for more than 
60 days without the consent of the applicant. Within 45 days after 
concluding formal consultation, the Service shall deliver a biological 
opinion to the Federal agency and any applicant.
    (f) Additional data. When the Service determines that additional 
data would provide a better information base from which to formulate a 
biological opinion, the Director may request an extension of formal 
consultation and request that the Federal agency obtain additional data 
to determine how or to what extent the action may affect listed species 
or critical habitat. If formal consultation is extended by mutual 
agreement according to Sec. 402.14(e), the Federal agency shall obtain, 
to the extent practicable, that data which can be developed within the 
scope of the extension. The responsibility for conducting and funding 
any studies belongs to the Federal agency and the applicant, not the 
Service. The Service's request for additional data is not to be 
construed as the Service's opinion that the Federal agency has failed to 
satisfy the information standard of section 7(a)(2) of the Act. If no 
extension of formal consultation is agreed to, the Director will issue a 
biological opinion using the best scientific and commercial data 
available.
    (g) Service responsibilities. Service responsibilities during formal 
consultation are as follows:
    (1) Review all relevant information provided by the Federal agency 
or otherwise available. Such review may include an on-site inspection of 
the action area with representatives of the Federal agency and the 
applicant.

[[Page 409]]

    (2) Evaluate the current status of the listed species or critical 
habitat.
    (3) Evaluate the effects of the action and cumulative effects on the 
listed species or critical habitat.
    (4) Formulate its biological opinion as to whether the action, taken 
together with cumulative effects, is likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse 
modification of critical habitat.
    (5) Discuss with the Federal agency and any applicant the Service's 
review and evaluation conducted under paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of 
this section, the basis for any finding in the biological opinion, and 
the availability of reasonable and prudent alternatives (if a jeopardy 
opinion is to be issued) that the agency and the applicant can take to 
avoid violation of section 7(a)(2). The Service will utilize the 
expertise of the Federal agency and any applicant in identifying these 
alternatives. If requested, the Service shall make available to the 
Federal agency the draft biological opinion for the purpose of analyzing 
the reasonable and prudent alternatives. The 45-day period in which the 
biological opinion must be delivered will not be suspended unless the 
Federal agency secures the written consent of the applicant to an 
extension to a specific date. The applicant may request a copy of the 
draft opinion from the Federal agency. All comments on the draft 
biological opinion must be submitted to the Service through the Federal 
agency, although the applicant may send a copy of its comments directly 
to the Service. The Service will not issue its biological opinion prior 
to the 45-day or extended deadline while the draft is under review by 
the Federal agency. However, if the Federal agency submits comments to 
the Service regarding the draft biological opinion within 10 days of the 
deadline for issuing the opinion, the Service is entitled to an 
automatic 10-day extension on the deadline.
    (6) Formulate discretionary conservation recommendations, if any, 
which will assist the Federal agency in reducing or eliminating the 
impacts that its proposed action may have on listed species or critical 
habitat.
    (7) Formulate a statement concerning incidental take, if such take 
may occur.
    (8) In formulating its biological opinion, any reasonable and 
prudent alternatives, and any reasonable and prudent measures, the 
Service will use the best scientific and commercial data available and 
will give appropriate consideration to any beneficial actions taken by 
the Federal agency or applicant, including any actions taken prior to 
the initiation of consultation.
    (h) Biological opinions. The biological opinion shall include:
    (1) A summary of the information on which the opinion is based;
    (2) A detailed discussion of the effects of the action on listed 
species or critical habitat; and
    (3) The Service's opinion on whether the action is likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat (a ``jeopardy 
biological opinion''); or, the action is not likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or 
adverse modification of critical habitat (a ``no jeopardy'' biological 
opinion). A ``jeopardy'' biological opinion shall include reasonable and 
prudent alternatives, if any. If the Service is unable to develop such 
alternatives, it will indicate that to the best of its knowledge there 
are no reasonable and prudent alternatives.
    (i) Incidental take. (1) In those cases where the Service concludes 
that an action (or the implementation of any reasonable and prudent 
alternatives) and the resultant incidental take of listed species will 
not violate section 7(a)(2), and, in the case of marine mammals, where 
the taking is authorized pursuant to section 101(a)(5) of the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the Service will provide with the 
biological opinion a statement concerning incidental take that:
    (i) Specifies the impact, i.e., the amount or extent, of such 
incidental taking on the species;
    (ii) Specifies those reasonable and prudent measures that the 
Director considers necessary or appropriate to minimize such impact;

[[Page 410]]

    (iii) In the case of marine mammals, specifies those measures that 
are necessary to comply with section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act of 1972 and applicable regulations with regard to such 
taking;
    (iv) Sets forth the terms and conditions (including, but not limited 
to, reporting requirements) that must be complied with by the Federal 
agency or any applicant to implement the measures specified under 
paragraphs (i)(1)(ii) and (i)(1)(iii) of this section; and
    (v) Specifies the procedures to be used to handle or dispose of any 
individuals of a species actually taken.
    (2) Reasonable and prudent measures, along with the terms and 
conditions that implement them, cannot alter the basic design, location, 
scope, duration, or timing of the action and may involve only minor 
changes.
    (3) In order to monitor the impacts of incidental take, the Federal 
agency or any applicant must report the progress of the action and its 
impact on the species to the Service as specified in the incidental take 
statement. The reporting requirements will be established in accordance 
with 50 CFR 13.45 and 18.27 for FWS and 50 CFR 220.45 and 228.5 for 
NMFS.
    (4) If during the course of the action the amount or extent of 
incidental taking, as specified under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this 
Section, is exceeded, the Federal agency must reinitiate consultation 
immediately.
    (5) Any taking which is subject to a statement as specified in 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section and which is in compliance with the 
terms and conditions of that statement is not a prohibited taking under 
the Act, and no other authorization or permit under the Act is required.
    (j) Conservation recommendations. The Service may provide with the 
biological opinion a statement containing discretionary conservation 
recommendations. Conservation recommendations are advisory and are not 
intended to carry any binding legal force.
    (k) Incremental steps. When the action is authorized by a statute 
that allows the agency to take incremental steps toward the completion 
of the action, the Service shall, if requested by the Federal agency, 
issue a biological opinion on the incremental step being considered, 
including its views on the entire action. Upon the issuance of such a 
biological opinion, the Federal agency may proceed with or authorize the 
incremental steps of the action if:
    (1) The biological opinion does not conclude that the incremental 
step would violate section 7(a)(2);
    (2) The Federal agency continues consultation with respect to the 
entire action and obtains biological opinions, as required, for each 
incremental step;
    (3) The Federal agency fulfills its continuing obligation to obtain 
sufficient data upon which to base the final biological opinion on the 
entire action;
    (4) The incremental step does not violate section 7(d) of the Act 
concerning irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources; and
    (5) There is a reasonable likelihood that the entire action will not 
violate section 7(a)(2) of the Act.
    (l) Termination of consultation. (1) Formal consultation is 
terminated with the issuance of the biological opinion.
    (2) If during any stage of consultation a Federal agency determines 
that its proposed action is not likely to occur, the consultation may be 
terminated by written notice to the Service.
    (3) If during any stage of consultation a Federal agency determines, 
with the concurrence of the Director, that its proposed action is not 
likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat, the 
consultation is terminated.

authorized by law and:
    (a) If the amount or extent of taking specified in the incidental 
take statement is exceeded;
    (b) If new information reveals effects of the action that may affect 
listed species or critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not 
previously considered;
    (c) If the identified action is subsequently modified in a manner 
that causes an effect to the listed species or critical habitat that was 
not considered in the biological opinion; or
    (d) If a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that 
may be affected by the identified action.

<R05>
Sec. 403.01  Purpose and scope of regulations.

    The regulations contained in this part implement section 109 of the 
Act which, upon a finding by the Secretary of compliance with certain 
requirements, provides for the transfer of marine mammal management 
authority to the states.
    (a) The regulations of this part apply the procedures for the 
transfer of marine mammal management authority to a state, the form and 
minimum requirements of a state application for the transfer of 
management authority, the relationship between Federal and state 
wildlife agencies both prior and subsequent to the transfer of 
management authority, and the revocation and return of management 
authority to the Federal Government.
    (b) Nothing in this part shall prevent:
    (1) The taking of a marine mammal by or on behalf of a Federal, 
state or local government official, in accordance with Sec. 18.22 or 
Sec. 216.22 of this Title and section 109(h) of the Act, or (2) the 
adoption or enforcement of any state law or regulation relating to any 
marine mammal taken before December 21, 1972.
    (c) The information collection requirements contained in 
Secs. 403.03, 403.06, and 403.07 of this part do not require approval by 
the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
because there are fewer than 10 respondents annually.


<R05>
Sec. 403.02  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    (a) The term species includes any population stock.
    (b) Optimum Sustainable Population or OSP means a population size 
which falls within a range from the population level of a given species 
or stock which is the largest supportable within the ecosystem to the 
population level that results in maximum net productivity. Maximum net 
productivity is the greatest net annual increment in population numbers 
or biomass resulting from additions to the population due to 
reproduction and/or growth less losses due to natural mortality.
    (c) State management program means existing and proposed state 
statutes,

[[Page 412]]

regulations, policies and other authorities which form the framework for 
the conservation of a species of marine mammals.
    (d) State regulation means the whole or part of a state agency 
statement of general or particular applicability and future effect 
designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or 
describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of a 
state agency and which is duly promulgated in accordance with 
established procedure.
    (e) The Act means the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972, 
16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq., as amended by Pub. L. 97-58.
    (f) The Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior or the 
Secretary of Commerce, depending on the species involved. Under section 
3(11) of the Act, the Secretary of Commerce has jurisdiction over 
members of the order Cetacea and members, other than walruses, of the 
order Pinnipedia; the Secretary of the Interior has jurdisdiction over 
all other mammals. These secretarial authorities have been delegated to 
the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service, 
respectively.
    (g) The Service or Services means the Fish and Wildlife Service 
(FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), as appropriate 
depending on the species involved. Any determination or finding required 
by this part to be made by the ``Service'' must be made by the Director 
of the FWS or by the Assistant Administrator of the NMFS, or their 
delegees, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 403.03  Review and approval of State request for management authority.

    (a) Any state may request the transfer of management authority for a 
species of marine mammals by submitting a written request to the 
Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service (``Director'') for species of 
marine mammals under the jurisdiction of the FWS, or to the Assistant 
Administrator for Fisheries of the National Marine Fisheries Service 
(``Assistant Administrator'') for species of marine mammals under the 
jurisdiction of the NMFS. The request must include:
    (1) Copies of existing and proposed statutes, regulations, policies 
and other authorities of state law which comprise those aspects of the 
state management program outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, and, 
in the case of Alaska, paragraphs (d) (1) through (3) of this section;
    (2) A narrative discussion of the statutes, regulations, policies 
and other authorities which comprise those aspects of the state 
management program outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, and, in 
the case of Alaska, paragraph (d) of this section, which explains the 
program in terms of the requirements of the Act and the regulations of 
this part; and
    (3) Supplementary information as required by paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (b) A request for transfer of marine mammal management authority 
will not be approved unless it contains the following:
    (1) The scientific and common names and estimated range of the 
species of marine mammals subject to the state management program.
    (2) Provisions of state law concerning the take of marine mammals 
that--
    (i) Require that the taking of marine mammals be humane as defined 
by section 3(4) of the Act;
    (ii) Do not permit the taking of marine mammals until the following 
have occurred:
    (A) The state, pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 403.04 of this 
part, has determined that the species is at its Optimum Sustainable 
Population (OSP) and determined the maximum number of animals that may 
be taken without reducing the species below its OSP, and, in the case of 
Alaska, when a species is below OSP, the maximum numbers that can be 
taken for subsistence uses while allowing the species to increase toward 
its OSP;
    (B) The determination as to OSP and maximum take are final and 
implemented under state law; and
    (C) A cooperative allocation agreement, if required under 
Sec. 403.05(a) of this part, is implemented;
    (iii) Do not permit take in excess of the maximum number of animals 
that may be taken as determined pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part; 
provided that for

[[Page 413]]

Alaska, subsistence take may be allowed in accordance with paragraph (d) 
of this section, and if the species is below OSP, any level of take 
allowed for subsistence use shall permit the species to increase toward 
OSP;
    (iv) Do not permit take that is for scientific research or public 
display purposes except such take by or on behalf of the state, or 
pursuant to a Federal permit issued under Sec. 18.31 or Sec. 216.31 of 
this title; and
    (v) Regulate the incidental taking of the species in a manner 
consistent with section 101(a) (2), (4) and (5) of the Act.
    (3) Provisions for annually acquiring and evaluating data and other 
new evidence relating to OSP of the species and the maximum allowable 
take, and if warranted on the basis of such evaluation, for requiring 
reevaluations of OSP and maximum allowable take determinations pursuant 
to Sec. 403.04.
    (4) Procedures for the resolution of differences between the state 
and the appropriate Service that might arise during the development of a 
cooperative allocation agreement pursuant to Sec. 403.05(a) of this 
part.
    (5) Procedures for the submission of an annual report meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 403.06(b) of this part to the appropriate Service 
regarding the administration of the state management program during the 
reporting period.
    (6) A description of--
    (i) The organization of state offices involved in the administration 
and enforcement of the state management program;
    (ii) Any permit system relating to the marine mammals, the laws that 
apply to such permits, and the procedures to be used in granting or 
withholding such permits;
    (iii) State laws relating to judicial review of administrative 
decisions as they relate to the state management program;
    (iv) State laws relating to administrative rulemaking as they relate 
to the state management program;
    (c) In addition to the aspects of the state management program 
required to be submitted by paragraph (b) of this section, the state 
shall submit information, in summary form, relating to:
    (1) The anticipated staffing and funding of state offices involved 
in the administration and enforcement of the state management program;
    (2) Anticipated research and enforcement activities relating to 
conservation of the species for which management authority is sought; 
and
    (3) Such other materials and information as the Service may request 
or which the state may deem necessary or advisable to demonstrate the 
compatibility of the state management program with the policy and 
purposes of the Act and the rules and regulations issued under the Act.
    (d) In addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section, a request for the transfer of marine mammal 
management authority by the State of Alaska must contain the following 
concerning subsistence use of the species--
    (1) A statute and regulations concerning the take of marine mammals 
that ensure that
    (i) The taking of marine mammals species for subsistence uses will 
be the priority consumptive uses of the species;
    (ii) If restrictions on subsistence uses of the species are 
required, such restrictions shall be based upon the customary and direct 
dependence upon the species as the mainstay of livelihood, local 
residency, and the availability of alternative resources; and
    (iii) The taking of marine mammal species for subsistence uses is 
accomplished in a non-wasteful manner;
    (2) Statutes or regulations that ensure that the appropriate state 
agency will--
    (i) Authorize nonsubsistence consumptive uses of a marine mammal 
species only if such uses will have no significant adverse impact on 
subsistence uses of the species;
    (ii) Regulate nonsubsistence consumptive uses in a manner which, to 
the maximum extent practicable, provides economic opportunities, 
including, but not limited to, licensing of marine mammal hunting guides 
and the assignment of guiding areas, for residents of rural coastal 
villages of Alaska who engage in subsistence uses of the species; and
    (iii) Make written findings supporting the authorizations and 
regulations described in this paragraph based

[[Page 414]]

solely on the administrative record before the agency;
    (3) A narrative discussion of the statutes or regulations required 
under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and any additional policies or 
procedures concerning the regulation of nonsubsistence consumptive uses 
of marine mammals. This discussion must explain how the State's program 
satisfies the requirements of section 109(f) of the Act, namely that the 
regulation of nonsubsistence consumptive uses of marine mammals 
provides, to the maximum extent praticable, economic opportunities for 
the residents of rural coastal villages of Alaska who engage in 
subsistence uses of the species.
    (e) To assist states in preparing the state management program for 
submission, the Service will also, at the written request of any state, 
make a preliminary review of any aspects of the state management 
program. This review will be advisory in nature and shall not be binding 
upon the Services. Notwithstanding preliminary review by the Service, 
once any proposed aspect of the state management program has been 
prepared and submitted in final form, it shall be subject to final 
review and approval under paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section.
    (f)(1) After receiving the state's request, for management 
authority, the Service shall make an initial determination on whether 
the state's management program meets the requirements of the Act and 
these regulations.
    (2) Within 45 days after receiving the state's request, unless the 
state and the Service agree to another time period, the Service shall 
publish a general notice of its initial determination in the Federal 
Register together with, in the case of a positive determination, the 
text of a proposed rule to transfer management authority to the state. 
The general notice shall contain a summary of the major components of 
the state's management program and shall indicate where the full text of 
the management program may be inspected or copied. The public shall be 
allowed to submit written comments and to request an informal public 
hearing on the Service's initial determination and the state's 
management program within 60 days of publication of the general notice.
    (g) If requested, the Service may conduct an informal public hearing 
after publishing 30 days' advance notice of the date, location, and time 
of such hearing in the Federal Register.
    (h) After considering all comments and other relevant information, 
the Service shall publish in the Federal Register its final 
determination on whether the state has developed and will implement a 
management program that meets the requirement of the Act and these 
regulations. In the case of a positive final determination, the Service 
shall publish with the notice a final regulation transferring management 
authority for the species to the state after the following requirements 
are satisfied:
    (1) The state's determinations pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part 
are final and implemented under state law;
    (2) Any cooperative allocation agreement required under 
Sec. 403.05(a) of this part is implemented; and
    (3) The state has enacted and submitted to the Service laws and 
policies that are substantially the same as those provided pursuant to 
Sec. 403.03(a) in proposed form in the state's management program.


<R05>
Sec. 403.04  Determinations and hearings under section 109(c) of the MMPA.

    (a) Introduction. In order to gain approval of its marine mammal 
management program the state must provide for a process, consistent with 
section 109(c) of the Act, to determine the optimum sustainable 
population of the species and the maximum number of animals that may be 
taken from populations it manages without reducing the species below 
OSP. The state process must be completed before the state may exercise 
any management authority over the subject marine mammals, and it must 
include the elements set forth below.
    (b) Basis, purpose, and scope. The process set forth in this section 
is applicable to and required for only the determination of the OSP of 
the species and maximum number that may be taken without reducing it 
below its OSP and, in the case of Alaska if the species is below OSP, 
the maximum

[[Page 415]]

number of animals that may be taken, if any, for subsistence uses 
without preventing the species from increasing toward its OSP. The state 
need not allow the maximum take, as determined in accordance with this 
process, that is biologically permissible. The state may change 
regulations establishing bag limits, quotas, seasons, areas, manner of 
take, etc. within the maximum biologically permissible take pursuant to 
its other rulemaking criteria, authority, and procedures. Compliance 
with the process set forth in this section would not be required again 
unless the state proposes to modify its determinations of the status of 
the species with respect to its OSP or the maximum permissible take from 
that species.
    (c) Initial determination by the State. The state agency with 
responsibility for managing the species in the event management 
authority is transferred to the state shall make initial determinations 
on the basis of the best scientific evidence available of:
    (1) Whether or not it is at its OSP; (2) if so, the maximum number 
of that species that nay be taken without reducing it below its OSP; and 
(3) if not, in the case of Alaska, the maximum number of animals that 
may be taken, if any, for subsistence uses without preventing the 
species from increasing toward its OSP.
    (d) Notice and review of initial determinations and request for 
hearing. The state agency shall provide notice of its initial 
determinations to the Service and the public and shall provide access to 
or copies of the documentation supporting its determinations to the 
Service and the public. The state agency shall indicate, in the notice 
of its initial determinations, the location(s) and hours during which 
such documentation may be inspected, and the costs, if any of copies of 
such documentation. The state agency shall also indicate in the notice 
that any interested person may request a hearing regarding the initial 
determinations, and the state shall provide a reasonable time, not less 
than 30 days, for making the request, taking into account the time 
required to advise the public of the initial determinations and to make 
the supporting documentation readily available to interested persons for 
their consideration. If a request for a hearing is not made within the 
prescribed time period, the initial determinations shall be treated as 
final.
    (e) Notice of hearing. If a request for a hearing is made within the 
prescribed time period by any interested person, the state agency shall 
provide notice of the hearing to the Service and the public not less 
than 30 days in advance of the scheduled date(s) of the hearing(s). The 
notice shall include the date(s), location(s), and purpose of the 
hearing, a recitation of the initial determinations, the name(s) of the 
person(s) who will preside at the hearing, and the manner and date by 
which interested persons must notify the state agency or presiding 
officer(s) of their desire to participate in the hearing. The state 
shall also make available and distribute upon request a list of 
witnesses and description of the documentation and other evidence that 
will be relied upon by the state's witnesses in support of its initial 
determinations sufficiently in advance of the hearing date so as to 
allow interested persons to prepare questions and supporting or rebuttal 
testimony for the hearing.
    (f) Conduct of the hearing. (1) The hearing shall be publicly 
conducted and reported verbatim by an official reporter.
    (2) The state shall sponsor all written documentation in support of 
its determinations with witnesses who are able, by virtue of training 
and experience, to respond fully to cross-examination regarding the 
facts and conclusions contained therein provided that, except by 
agreement of the parties, the state agency may not call any witnesses or 
introduce any documentation into the record unless the advance notice 
requirements of paragraph (e) of this section are met with respect to 
such witnesses or documentation.
    (3) Any interested person who has notificed the state agency of his 
desire to participate in the hearing pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section may participate in the hearing by presenting oral or written 
testimony or cross-examining the witnesses or other parties with respect 
to matters relevant to the state's initial determinations, provided that 
any such written

[[Page 416]]

documentation must be sponsored by a witness who is able, by virtue of 
training and experience, to respond fully to cross-examination regarding 
the facts and conclusions contained therein.
    (4) The presiding officer(s) shall conduct the hearing in accordance 
with such other rules of evidence, criteria, and procedures as are 
necessary and appropriate for the expeditious and effective 
determination of the issues. The presiding officer(s) may provide for 
oral argument and/or written briefs at the end of the hearing.
    (5) Final determinations on the issues specified in paragraph (c) of 
this section must be supported by the best available scientific 
information so as to insure that any taking will be consistent with the 
maintenance of OSP.
    (g) Review of the hearing record and final determinations. (1) The 
state agency shall provide for either:
    (i) Review and evaluation of the hearing record by the presiding 
officer(s) and transmittal by the presiding officer(s) of recommended 
final determinations to the decision-maker(s) in the state agency; or
    (ii) Review and evaluation of the hearing record and final 
determinations by the state agency without benefit of any 
recommendations by the presiding officer(s). In any event, the final 
determinations by the state agency must be made solely on the basis of 
the record developed at the hearing. The state agency in making its 
final determinations, and/or presiding officer(s) in making his (their) 
recommended determinations, may not rely on oral or written evidence 
which was not presented at the hearing and made available to the parties 
for cross-examination and rebuttal testimony. Any such oral or written 
information transmitted to the presiding officer(s) or other members of 
the state agency responsible for the final determinations shall be 
treated as ex parte communications and may not be considered part of the 
record for decision.
    (2) The state agency shall make final determinations of the issues 
set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and shall include in its 
statement of final determinations a statement of findings and 
conclusions and the reasons or basis therefor.
    (3) The state agency shall advise the Service and the public of its 
final determinations and shall provide access to or copies of its 
decision document and Hearing Record.
    (h) Judicial review. The state agency's final determinations after a 
hearing must be supported by substantial evidence in the record of the 
hearing. Opportunity for judicial review of the state agency's final 
determinations must be available under state law. The scope of judicial 
review shall be equivalent to that provided for in 5 U.S.C. 706(2) (A) 
through (E).


<R05>
Sec. 403.05  State and Federal responsibilities after transfer of management authority.

    (a) After determinations required by section 403.04 of this part 
have been made in respect to a species whose range extends beyond the 
territorial waters of the state, the state shall not exercise management 
authority until a cooperative allocation agreement with the Secretary 
has been signed and the Service has transferred management authority 
pursuant to Sec. 403.03(h). The cooperative allocation agreement shall 
provide procedures for allocating, on a timely basis, the maximum amount 
of take as determined by the state pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part. 
Such allocation shall give first priority to incidental take within the 
zone described in section 3(14)(B) of the Act as provided for under 
section 101(a) of the Act, except that in the case of Alaska, first 
priority shall be given to subsistence use.
    (b) For those species to which paragraph (a) of this section 
applies, the state may request the Service to regulate the taking of the 
species within the zone described in section 3(14)(B) of the Act for 
subsistence uses and/or hunting in a manner consistent with the 
regulation by the state of such taking within the state. If such a 
request is made, the Service shall adopt and enforce within such zone, 
such of the state's regulatory provisions as the Service considers to be 
consistent with the administration within such zone of section 101(a) of 
the Act.
    (c) If management authority for a species has been transferred to a 
state pursuant to this subpart, the Service

[[Page 417]]

shall provide to the state an opportunity to review all requests for 
permits to remove live animals from habitat within the state for 
scientific research or public display purposes. If the state finds that 
issuance of the permit would not be consistent with its management 
program for the species:
    (1) The state shall so inform the Service, together with the reasons 
for such finding, within 30 days of its receipt of the application, and 
the Service shall not issue the permit; and
    (2) The Service shall provide to the permit applicant and the state 
an opportunity to adjust the permit application or otherwise reconcile 
it with the state management program for the species.
    (d) After management of a species has been transferred to the state, 
state and Federal authorities shall cooperate to the maximum extent 
practicable in conserving the species of marine mammals.


<R05>
Sec. 403.06  Monitoring and review of State management program.

    (a) The Service has responsibility to monitor and review 
implementation of all state management programs approved pursuant to 
this part.
    (b) In order to facilitate such review, each state to which 
management authority has been transferred shall submit an annual report, 
not later than 120 days after the close of such state's first full 
fiscal or calendar year following the effective date of the Service's 
approval of the State management program, and at the same time each 
following year, or at such other time as may be agreed upon. The repot 
shall contain the following information current for each reporting 
period:
    (1) Any changes in the state laws which comprise those aspects of 
the state management program submitted pursuant to Sec. 403.03(b), and, 
in the case of Alaska, Sec. 403.03(d), of this part;
    (2) Pertinent new data on the marine mammal species or the marine 
ecosystems in question including a summary of the status, trend and 
general health of the species;
    (3) A summary of available information relating to takings under the 
state management program;
    (4) A summary of state actions to protect species' habitat;
    (5) A summary of all state research activity on the species;
    (6) Any significant changes in the information provided with the 
original request for transfer of management authority;
    (7) A summary of enforcement activity;
    (8) A summary of budget and staffing levels for the marine mammal 
activities in the categories of research, management and enforcement;
    (9) Any other information which the Service may request, consistent 
with the Act as amended, or which the state deems necessary or advisable 
to facilitate review by the Service of state management of the species.
    (c) Each state having an approved management program shall file a 
report, in a timely manner, not to exceed 45 days from the occurrence of 
any of the following:
    (1) Any change in a relevant state law (amendments, repealers, or 
new legislation or regulations or judicial precedent) as submitted 
pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5), and in the case of Alaska, 
paragraph (d), of Sec. 403.03 of this part that may impair the State's 
ability to implement the program;
    (2) Any significant natural or manmade occurrence or any new 
scientific information that may warrant reconsideration of the 
determinations made pursuant to Sec. 403.04 of this part.
    (d) All components of the state request for transfer of management 
authority, as well as annual reports submitted under paragraph (b) of 
this section and any reports submitted under paragraph (c) of this 
section, shall be available for inspection and copying at the Office of 
the Chief, Division of Wildlife Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240, or, as 
appropriate, at the Office of Protected Species and Habitat 
Conservation, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 
20235, and at the appropriate Service's regional office.

<R05>
Sec. 403.07  Revocation and return of State management authority.

    (a) Revocation of management. The Service shall have responsibility 
to review management of a species transferred to a state under this part 
and to determine whether or not the implementation of the state 
management program continues to comply with the requirements of the Act, 
this part and the state's approved management program.
    (1) Upon receipt of any substantial factual information suggesting 
that the state management program is not being implemented or is being 
implemented in a manner inconsistent with the Act, this part, or the 
state's approved management program, the Service shall, as soon as 
practicable but not later than 30 days after receipt, determine whether 
or not the state continues to comply with the requirements of the Act, 
this part and the state's approved management program.
    (2) Whenever pursuant to a review as specified in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, the Service determines that any substantial aspect of 
the state management program is not in compliance with the requirements 
of the Act, this part or the state's approved management program, it 
shall provide written notice to the state of its intent to revoke 
management authority, together with a statement, in detail, of those 
actions or failures to act upon which such intent to revoke is based. 
The Service shall publish notice of such intent to revoke in the Federal 
Register and invite public comment thereon, and shall conduct an 
informal public hearing on the matter if requested by the state or if 
the Service otherwise determines it to be necessary. The Service shall 
provide to the state an opportunity for consultation between the Service 
and the state concerning such actions or failures and necessary remedial 
actions to be taken by the state.
    (3) If within 90 days after notice is provided under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, the state has not taken such remedial measures 
as are necessary, in the judgment of the Service, to bring the state 
management program into compliance with the provision of the Act, this 
part and the state's approved management program, the Service shall 
revoke the transfer of management authority by written notice to the 
state and publication in the Federal Register.
    (b) Voluntary return of management authority to the Service. (1) If 
a state desires to return management of a species of marine mammals to 
the Service, it shall provide the Service notice of intent to return 
management. The Service shall accept the return of management, and such 
return shall become effective, upon publication of a notice in the 
Federal Register to this effect no sooner than 30 days (except in an 
emergency as determined by the Service) nor longer than 60 days after 
the state has provided notice of its intent to return management or 
unless otherwise agreed upon.
    (2) If implementation of any aspect of the state management program 
is enjoined by court order, the state shall advise the Service of such 
injunction and its effect on the state management program. If the state 
determines that the effect of the injunction is to preclude effective 
conservation and management of the species under the terms of the state 
management program, it shall so notify the Service and such notification 
shall be treated as a notice of intent to return management as provided 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the state determines that the 
injunction does not preclude effective conservation and management of 
marine mammals under the terms of the state management program, it shall 
so notify the Service together with the basis for the state's 
determination and such notice shall be treated as a report submitted 
pursuant to the terms of Sec. 403.06(c)(1) of this part. In either case, 
the state shall provide notice to the Service as soon as practicable but 
not more than 30 days after issuance of the injunction. Management 
authority returned to the Service pursuant to this paragraph may be re-
transferred to the state, notwithstanding the requirements of 
Sec. 403.03, when, in the judgment of the Service, the cause for return 
of management authority to the Service has been alleviated in such a way 
as to allow effective conservation and management of the species 
consistent with

[[Page 419]]

the requirements of the Act and this part.
    (c) When revocation of a management authority pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section becomes final, or when a state returns management 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Service shall resume such 
management authority and provide for the conservation of the species 
within the state in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

of all methods and procedures that are necessary to bring any endangered 
or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided 
pursuant to the Act are no longer necessary. Such methods and procedures 
include, but are not limited to, all activities associated with 
scientific resources management such as research, census, law 
enforcement, habitat acquisition and maintenance, propagation, live 
trapping, and transplantation, and, in the extraordinary case where 
population pressures within a given ecosystem cannot be otherwise 
relieved, may include regulated taking.
    (d) Critical habitat means (1) the specific areas within the 
geographical area currently occupied by a species, at the time it is 
listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physical or 
biological features (i) essential to the conservation of the species and

[[Page 420]]

(ii) that may require special management considerations or protection, 
and (2) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a 
species at the time it is listed upon a determination by the Secretary 
that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.
    (e) Endangered species means a species that is in danger of 
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
    (f) List or lists means the Lists of Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife and Plants found at 50 CFR 17.11(h) or 17.12(h).

    (k) Species includes any species or subspecies of fish, wildlife, or 
plant, and any distinct population segment of any vertebrate species 
that interbreeds when mature. Excluded is any species of the Class 
Insecta determined by the Secretary to constitute a pest whose 
protection under the provisions of the Act would present an overwhelming 
and overriding risk to man.
    (l) State agency means any State agency, department, board, 
commission, or other governmental entity that is responsible for the 
management and conservation of fish, plant, or wildlife resources within 
a State.
    (m) Threatened species means any species that is likely to become an 
endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a 
significant portion of its range.
    (n) Wildlife or fish and wildlife means any member of the animal 
kingdom, including without limitation, any vertebrate, mollusk, 
crustacean, arthropod, or other invertebrate, and includes any part, 
product, egg, or offspring thereof, or the dead body or parts thereof.

                    Subpart B--Revision of the Lists


<R05>
Sec. 424.10  General.

    The Secretary may add a species to the lists or designate critical 
habitat, delete a species or critical habitat, change the listed status 
of a species, revise the boundary of an area designated as critical 
habitat, or adopt or modify special rules (see 50 CFR 17.40-17.48 and 
parts 222 and 227) applied to a threatened species only in accordance 
with the procedures of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 424.11  Factors for listing, delisting, or reclassifying species.

    (a) Any species or taxonomic group of species (e.g., genus, 
subgenus) as defined in Sec. 424.02(k) is eligible for listing under the 
Act. A taxon of higher rank than species may be listed only if all 
included species are individually found to be endangered or threatened. 
In determining whether a particular taxon or population is a species for 
the purposes of the Act, the Secretary shall rely on standard taxonomic 
distinctions and the biological expertise of the Department and the 
scientific community concerning the relevant taxonomic group.
    (b) The Secretary shall make any determination required by 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section solely on the basis of the best 
available scientific and commercial information regarding a species' 
status, without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such 
determination.
    (c) A species shall be listed or reclassified if the Secretary 
determines, on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data 
available after conducting a review of the species' status, that the 
species is endangered or threatened because of any one or a combination 
of the following factors:
    (1) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or 
curtailment of its habitat or range;
    (2) Over utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or 
educational purposes;

[[Page 421]]

    (3) Disease or predation;
    (4) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or
    (5) Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued 
existence.
    (d) The factors considered in delisting a species are those in 
paragraph (c) of this section as they relate to the definitions of 
endangered or threatened species. Such removal must be supported by the 
best scientific and commercial data available to the Secretary after 
conducting a review of the status of the species. A species may be 
delisted only if such data substantiate that it is neither endangered 
nor threatened for one or more of the following reasons:
    (1) Extinction. Unless all individuals of the listed species had 
been previously identified and located, and were later found to be 
extirpated from their previous range, a sufficient period of time must 
be allowed before delisting to indicate clearly that the species is 
extinct.
    (2) Recovery. The principal goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service is to return listed 
species to a point at which protection under the Act is no longer 
required. A species may be delisted on the basis of recovery only if the 
best scientific and commercial data available indicate that it is no 
longer endangered or threatened.
    (3) Original data for classification in error. Subsequent 
investigations may show that the best scientific or commercial data 
available when the species was listed, or the interpretation of such 
data, were in error.
    (e) The fact that a species of fish, wildlife, or plant is protected 
by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (see part 23 of this title 50) or a similar 
international agreement on such species, or has been identified as 
requiring protection from unrestricted commerce by any foreign nation, 
or to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so within the 
foreseeable future by any State agency or by any agency of a foreign 
nation that is responsible for the conservation of fish, wildlife, or 
plants, may constitute evidence that the species is endangered or 
threatened. The weight given such evidence will vary depending on the 
international agreement in question, the criteria pursuant to which the 
species is eligible for protection under such authorities, and the 
degree of protection afforded the species. The Secretary shall give 
consideration to any species protected under such an international 
agreement, or by any State or foreign nation, to determine whether the 
species is endangered or threatened.
    (f) The Secretary shall take into account, in making determinations 
under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, those efforts, if any, being 
made by any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a 
State or foreign nation, to protect such species, whether by predator 
control, protection of habitat and food supply, or other conservation 
practices, within any area under its jurisdiction, or on the high seas.

Sec. 424.12  Criteria for designating critical habitat.

    (a) Critical habitat shall be specified to the maximum extent 
prudent and determinable at the time a species is proposed for listing. 
If designation of critical habitat is not prudent or if critical habitat 
is not determinable, the reasons for not designating critical habitat 
will be stated in the publication of proposed and final rules listing a 
species. A final designation of critical habitat shall be made on the 
basis of the best scientific data available, after taking into 
consideration the probable economic and other impacts of making such a 
designation in accordance with Sec. 424.19.
    (1) A designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or 
both of the following situations exist:
    (i) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and 
identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the 
degree of such threat to the species, or
    (ii) Such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to 
the species.
    (2) Critical habitat is not determinable when one or both of the 
following situations exist:
    (i) Information sufficient to perform required analyses of the 
impacts of the designation is lacking, or

[[Page 422]]

    (ii) The biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well 
known to permit identification of an area as critical habitat.
    (b) In determining what areas are critical habitat, the Secretary 
shall consider those physical and biological features that are essential 
to the conservation of a given species and that may require special 
management considerations or protection. Such requirements include, but 
are not limited to the following:
    (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal 
behavior;
    (2) Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or 
physiological requirements;
    (3) Cover or shelter;
    (4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, 
germination, or seed dispersal; and generally;
    (5) Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are 
representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions 
of a species.

When considering the designation of critical habitat, the Secretary 
shall focus on the principal biological or physical constituent elements 
within the defined area that are essential to the conservation of the 
species. Known primary constituent elements shall be listed with the 
critical habitat description. Primary constituent elements may include, 
but are not limited to, the following: roost sites, nesting grounds, 
spawning sites, feeding sites, seasonal wetland or dryland, water 
quality or quantity, host species or plant pollinator, geological 
formation, vegetation type, tide, and specific soil types.
    (c) Each critical habitat will be defined by specific limits using 
reference points and lines as found on standard topographic maps of the 
area. Each area will be referenced to the State(s), county(ies), or 
other local governmental units within which all or part of the critical 
habitat is located. Unless otherwise indicated within the critical 
habitat descriptions, the names of the State(s) and county(ies) are 
provided for information only and do not constitute the boundaries of 
the area. Ephemeral reference points (e.g., trees, sand bars) shall not 
be used in defining critical habitat.
    (d) When several habitats, each satisfying the requirements for 
designation as critical habitat, are located in proximity to one 
another, an inclusive area may be designated as critical habitat.

    Example: Several dozen or more small ponds, lakes, and springs are 
found in a small local area. The entire area could be designated 
critical habitat if it were concluded that the upland areas were 
essential to the conservation of an aquatic species located in the ponds 
and lakes.

    (e) The Secretary shall designate as critical habitat areas outside 
the geographical area presently occupied by a species only when a 
designation limited to its present range would be inadequate to ensure 
the conservation of the species.
    (f) Critical habitat may be designated for those species listed as 
threatened or endangered but for which no critical habitat has been 
previously designated.
    (g) Existing critical habitat may be revised according to procedures 
in this section as new data become available to the Secretary.
    (h) Critical habitat shall not be designated within foreign 
countries or in other areas outside of United States jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 424.13  Sources of information and relevant data.

    When considering any revision of the lists, the Secretary shall 
consult as appropriate with affected States, interested persons and 
organizations, other affected Federal agencies, and, in cooperation with 
the Secretary of State, with the country or countries in which the 
species concerned are normally found or whose citizens harvest such 
species from the high seas. Data reviewed by the Secretary may include, 
but are not limited to scientific or commercial publications, 
administrative reports, maps or other graphic materials, information 
received from experts on the subject, and comments from interested 
parties.


<R05>
Sec. 424.14  Petitions.

    (a) General. Any interested person may submit a written petition to 
the Secretary requesting that one of the actions described in 
Sec. 424.10 be taken.

[[Page 423]]

Such a document must clearly identify itself as a petition and be dated. 
It must contain the name, signature, address, telephone number, if any, 
and the association, institution, or business affiliation, if any, of 
the petitioner. The Secretary shall acknowledge in writing receipt of 
such a petition within 30 days.
    (b) Petitions to list, delist, or reclassify species. (1) To the 
maximum extent practicable, within 90 days of receiving a petition to 
list, delist, or reclassify a species, the Secretary shall make a 
finding as to whether the petition presents substantial scientific or 
commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be 
warranted. For the purposes of this section, ``substantial information'' 
is that amount of information that would lead a reasonable person to 
believe that the measure proposed in the petition may be warranted. The 
Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register 
and so notify the petitioner.
    (2) In making a finding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary shall consider whether such petition--
    (i) Clearly indicates the administrative measure recommended and 
gives the scientific and any common name of the species involved;
    (ii) Contains detailed narrative justification for the recommended 
measure, describing, based on available information, past and present 
numbers and distribution of the species involved and any threats faced 
by the species;
    (iii) Provides information regarding the status of the species over 
all or a significant portion of its range; and
    (iv) Is accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation in the 
form of bibliographic references, reprints of pertinent publications, 
copies of reports or letters from authorities, and maps.

The petitioner may provide information that describes any recommended 
critical habitat as to boundaries and physical features, and indicates 
any benefits and/or adverse effects on the species that would result 
from such designation. Such information, however, will not be a basis 
for the determination of the substantiality of a petition.
    (3) Upon making a positive finding under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the Secretary shall commence a review of the status of the 
species concerned and shall make, within 12 months of receipt of such 
petition, one of the following findings:
    (i) The petitioned action is not warranted, in which case the 
Secretary shall promptly publish such finding in the Federal Register 
and so notify the petitioner.
    (ii) The petitioned action is warranted, in which case the Secretary 
shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a proposed regulation to 
implement the action pursuant to Sec. 424.16 of this part, or
    (iii) The petitioned action is warranted, but that--
    (A) The immediate proposal and timely promulgation of a regulation 
to implement the petitioned action is precluded because of other pending 
proposals to list, delist, or reclassify species, and
    (B) Expeditious progress is being made to list, delist, or 
reclassify qualified species,

in which case, such finding shall be promptly published in the Federal 
Register together with a description and evaluation of the reasons and 
data on which the finding is based.
    (4) If a finding is made under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section 
with regard to any petition, the Secretary shall, within 12 months of 
such finding, again make one of the findings described in paragraph 
(b)(3) with regard to such petition, but no further finding of 
substantial information will be required.
    (c) Petitions to revise critical habitat. (1) To the maximum extent 
practicable, within 90 days of receiving a petition to revise a critical 
habitat designation, the Secretary shall make a finding as to whether 
the petition presents substantial scienific information indicating that 
the revision may be warranted. The Secretary shall promptly publish such 
finding in the Federal Register and so notify the petitioner.
    (2) In making the finding required by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the

[[Page 424]]

Secretary shall consider whether a petition contains--
    (i) Information indicating that areas petitioned to be added to 
critical habitat contain physical and biological features essential to, 
and that may require special management to provide for, the conservation 
of the species involved; or
    (ii) Information indicating that areas designated as critical 
habitat do not contain resources essential to, or do not require special 
management to provide for, the conservation of the species involved.
    (3) Within 12 months after receiving a petition found under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section to present substantial information 
indicating that revision of a critical habitat may be warranted, the 
Secretary shall determine how he intends to proceed with the requested 
revision, and shall promptly publish notice of such intention in the 
Federal Register.
    (d) Petitions to designate critical habitat or adopt special rules. 
Upon receiving a petition to designate critical habitat or to adopt a 
special rule to provide for the conservation of a species, the Secretary 
shall promptly conduct a review in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) and applicable Departmental regulations, 
and take appropriate action.


<R05>
Sec. 424.15  Notices of review.

    (a) If the Secretary finds that one of the actions described in 
Sec. 424.10 may be warranted, but that the available evidence is not 
sufficiently definitive to justify proposing the action at that time, a 
notice of review may be published in the Federal Register. The notice 
will describe the measure under consideration, briefly explain the 
reasons for considering the action, and solicit comments and additional 
information on the action under consideration.
    (b) The Secretary from time to time also may publish notices of 
review containing the names of species that are considered to be 
candidates for listing under the Act and indicating whether sufficient 
scientific or commercial information is then available to warrant 
proposing to list such species, the names of species no longer being 
considered for listing, or the names of listed species being considered 
for delisting or reclassification. However, none of the substantive or 
procedural provisions of the Act apply to a species that is designated 
as a candidate for listing.
    (c) Such notices of review will invite comment from all interested 
parties regarding the status of the species named. At the time of 
publication of such a notice, notification in writing will be sent to 
State agencies in any affected States, known affected Federal agencies, 
and, to the greatest extent practicable, through the Secretary of State, 
to the governments of any foreign countries in which the subject species 
normally occur.


<R05>
Sec. 424.16  Proposed rules.

    (a) General. Based on the information received through Secs. 424.13, 
424.14, 424.15, and 424.21, or through other available avenues, the 
Secretary may propose revising the lists as described in Sec. 424.10.
    (b) Contents. A notice of a proposed rule to carry out one of the 
actions described in Sec. 424.10 shall contain the complete text of the 
proposed rule, a summary of the data on which the proposal is based 
(including, as appropriate, citation of pertinent information sources), 
and shall show the relationship of such data to the rule proposed. If 
such a rule designates or revises critical habitat, such summary shall, 
to the maximum extent practicable, include a brief description and 
evaluation of those activities (whether public or private) that, in the 
opinion of the Secretary, if undertaken, may adversely modify such 
habitat, or may be affected by such designation. Any proposed rule to 
designate or revise critical habitat shall contain a map of such 
habitat. Any such notice proposing the listing, delisting, or 
reclassification of a species or the designation or revision of critical 
habitat shall also include a summary of factors affecting the species 
and/or critical habitat.
    (c) Procedures--(1) Notifications. In the case of any proposed rule 
to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to designate or revise 
critical habitat, the Secretary shall--
    (i) Publish notice of the proposal in the Federal Register;

[[Page 425]]

    (ii) Give actual notice of the proposed regulation (including the 
complete text of the regulation) to the State agency in each State in 
which the species is believed to occur, and to each county or equivalent 
jurisdiction therein in which the species is believed to occur, and 
invite the comment of each such agency and jurisdiction;
    (iii) Give notice of the proposed regulation to any Federal 
agencies, local authorities, or private individuals or organizations 
known to be affected by the rule;
    (iv) Insofar as practical, and in cooperation with the Secretary of 
State, give notice of the proposed regulation to list, delist, or 
reclassify a species to each foreign nation in which the species is 
believed to occur or whose citizens harvest the species on the high 
seas, and invite the comment of such nation;
    (v) Give notice of the proposed regulation to such professional 
scientific organizations as the Secretary deems appropriate; and
    (vi) Publish a summary of the proposed regulation in a newspaper of 
general circulation in each area of the United States in which the 
species is believed to occur.
    (2) Period of public comments. At least 60 days shall be allowed for 
public comment following publication in the Federal Register of a rule 
proposing the listing, delisting, or reclassification of a species, or 
the designation or revision of critical habitat. All other proposed 
rules shall be subject to a comment period of at least 30 days following 
publication in the Federal Register. The Secretary may extend or reopen 
the period for public comment on a proposed rule upon a finding that 
there is good cause to do so. A notice of any such extension or 
reopening shall be published in the Federal Register, and shall specify 
the basis for so doing.
    (3) Public hearings. The Secretary shall promptly hold at least one 
public hearing if any person so requests within 45 days of publication 
of a proposed regulation to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to 
designate or revise critical habitat. Notice of the location and time of 
any such hearing shall be published in the Federal Register not less 
than 15 days before the hearing is held.


<R05>
Sec. 424.17  Time limits and required actions.

    (a) General. (1) Within 1 year of the publication of a rule 
proposing to determine whether a species is an endangered or threatened 
species, or to designate or revise critical habitat, the Secretary shall 
publish one of the following in the Federal Register:
    (i) A final rule to implement such determination or revision,
    (ii) A finding that such revision should not be made,
    (iii) A notice withdrawing the proposed rule upon a finding that 
available evidence does not justify the action proposed by the rule, or
    (iv) A notice extending such 1-year period by an additional period 
of not more than 6 months because there is substantial disagreement 
among scientists knowledgeable about the species concerned regarding the 
sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to the 
determination or revision concerned.
    (2) If an extension is made under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this 
section, the Secretary shall, within the extended period, take one of 
the actions described in paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section.
    (3) If a proposed rule is withdrawn under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of 
this section, the notice of withdrawal shall set forth the basis upon 
which the proposed rule has been found not to be supported by available 
evidence. The Secretary shall not again propose a rule withdrawn under 
such provision except on the basis of sufficient new information that 
warrants a reproposal.
    (b) Critical habitat designations. A final rule designating critical 
habitat of an endangered or a threatened species shall to the extent 
permissible under Sec. 424.12 be published concurrently with the final 
rule listing such species, unless the Secretary deems that--
    (1) It is essential to the conservation of such species that it be 
listed promptly; or
    (2) Critical habitat of such species is not then determinable,

[[Page 426]]


in which case, the Secretary, with respect to the proposed regulation to 
designate such habitat, may extend the 1-year period specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section by not more than one additional year. Not 
later than the close of such additional year the Secretary must publish 
a final regulation, based on such data as may be available at that time, 
designating, to the maximum extent prudent, such habitat.


<R05>
Sec. 424.18  Final rules--general.

    (a) Contents. A final rule promulgated to carry out the purposes of 
the Act will be published in the Federal Register. This publication will 
contain the complete text of the rule, a summary of the comments and 
recommendations received in response to the proposal (including 
applicable public hearings), summaries of the data on which the rule is 
based and the relationship of such data to the final rule, and a 
description of any conservation measures available under the rule. 
Publication of a final rule to list, delist, or reclassify a species or 
designate or revise critical habitat shall also provide a summary of 
factors affecting the species. A rule designating or revising critical 
habitat will also contain a description of the boundaries and a map of 
such habitat and will, to the maximum extent practicable, be accompanied 
by a brief description and evaluation of those activities (whether 
public or private) that might occur in the area and which, in the 
opinion of the Secretary, may adversly modify such habitat or be 
affected by such designation.
    (b) Effective date. A final rule shall take effect--
    (1) Not less than 30 days after it is published in the Federal 
Register, except as otherwise provided for good cause found and 
published with the rule; and
    (2) Not less than 90 days after (i) publication in the Federal 
Register of the proposed rule, and (ii) actual notification of any 
affected State agencies and counties or equivalent jurisdictions in 
accordance with Sec. 424.16(c)(1)(ii).
    (c) Disagreement with State agency. If a State agency, given notice 
of a proposed rule in accordance with Sec. 424.16(c)(1)(ii), submits 
comments disagreeing in whole or in part with a proposed rule, and the 
Secretary issues a final rule that is in conflict with such comments, or 
if the Secretary fails to adopt a regulation for which a State agency 
has made a petition in accordance with Sec. 424.14, the Secretary shall 
provide such agency with a written justification for the failure to 
adopt a rule consistent with the agency's comments or petition.


<R05>
Sec. 424.19  Final rules--impact analysis of critical habitat.

    The Secretary shall identify any significant activities that would 
either affect an area considered for designation as critical habitat or 
be likely to be affected by the designation, and shall, after proposing 
designation of such an area, consider the probable economic and other 
impacts of the designation upon proposed or ongoing activities. The 
Secretary may exclude any portion of such an area from the critical 
habitat if the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of 
specifying the area as part of the critical habitat. The Secretary shall 
not exclude any such area if, based on the best scientific and 
commercial data available, he determines that the failure to designate 
that area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the 
species concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 424.20  Emergency rules.

    (a) Sections 424.16, 424.17, 424.18, and 424.19 notwithstanding, the 
Secretary may at any time issue a regulation implementing any action 
described in Sec. 424.10 in regard to any emergency posing a significant 
risk to the well-being of a species of fish, wildlife, or plant. Such 
rules shall, at the discretion of the Secretary, take effect immediately 
on publication in the Federal Register. In the case of any such action 
that applies to a resident species, the Secretary shall give actual 
notice of such regulation to the State agency in each State in which 
such species is believed to occur. Publication in the Federal Register 
of such an emergency rule shall provide detailed reasons why the rule is 
necessary. An emergency rule shall cease to have force and effect after 
240 days unless the procedures described in Secs. 424.16,

[[Page 427]]

424.17, 424.18, and 424.19 (as appropriate) have been complied with 
during that period.
    (b) If at any time after issuing an emergency rule, the Secretary 
determines, on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data 
available, that substantial evidence does not then exist to warrant such 
rule, it shall be withdrawn.


<R05>
Sec. 424.21  Periodic review.

    At least once every 5 years, the Secretary shall conduct a review of 
each listed species to determine whether it should be delisted or 
reclassified. Each such determination shall be made in accordance with 
Secs. 424.11, 424.16, and 424.17 of this part, as appropriate. A notice 
announcing those species under active review will be published in the 
Federal Register. Notwithstanding this section's provisions, the 
Secretary may review the status of any species at any time based upon a 
petition (see Sec. 424.14) or upon other data available to the Service.

State in which an agency action will occur, if any, or (3) a permit or 
license applicant may apply to the Secretary for an exemption for an

    (a) Threshold determinations. Within 20 days after receiving an 
exemption application, or a longer time agreed upon between the 
exemption applicant and the Secretary, the Secretary shall conclude his 
review and determine:
    (1) Whether any required biological assessment was conducted;
    (2) To the extent determinable within the time period provided, 
whether the Federal agency and permit or license applicant, if any, have 
refrained from making any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of 
resources; and
    (3) Whether the Federal agency and permit or license applicant, if 
any, have carried out consultation responsibilities in good faith and 
have made a reasonable and responsible effort to develop and fairly 
consider modifications or reasonable and prudent alternatives to the 
proposed action which would not violate section 7(a)(2) of the Act.
    (b) Burden of proof. The exemption applicant has the burden of 
proving that the requirements of Sec. 452.03(a) have been met.

any threshold determination, the Secretary shall deny the application 
and notify the exemption applicant in writing of his finding and grounds 
therefor. The exemption process shall terminate when the applicant

each of the threshold determinations, he shall notify the exemption 
applicant in writing that the application qualifies for consideration by 
the Endangered Species Committee.
    (e) Secretary of State opinion. The Secretary shall terminate the 
exemption process immediately if the Secretary of State, pursuant to his

any, set forth the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding and show 
that the petitioner's participation would assist in the determination of 
the issues in question.
    (2) The Administrative Law Judge shall grant leave to intervene if 
he determines that an intervenor's participation would contribute to the 
fair determination of issues. In making this determination, the 
Administrative Law Judge may consider whether an intervenor represents a

    Definitions applicable to this part are contained in 50 CFR 450.01.


<R05>
Sec. 453.03  Committee review and final determinations.

    (a) Final determinations. Within 30 days of receiving the 
Secretary's report and record, the Committee shall grant an exemption 
from the requirements of section 7(a)(2) of the Act for an agency action 
if, by a vote in which at least five of its members concur:
    (1) It determines that based on the report to the Secretary, the 
record of the hearing held under Sec. 452.05, and on such other 
testimony or evidence as it may receive:
    (i) There are no reasonable and prudent alternatives to the proposed 
action;
    (ii) The benefits of such action clearly outweigh the benefits of 
alternative courses of action consistent with conserving the species or 
its critical habitat, and such action is in the public interest;
    (iii) The action is of regional or national significance; and
    (iv) Neither the Federal agency concerned nor the exemption 
applicant made any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources 
prohibited by section 7(d) of the Act; and,
    (2) It establishes such reasonable mitigation and enhancement 
measures, including, but not limited to, live propagation, 
transplantation, and habitat acquisition and improvement, as are 
necessary and appropriate to minimize the adverse effects of the 
proposed action upon the endangered species, threatened species, or 
critical habitat concerned. Any required mitigation and enhancement 
measures shall be carried out and paid for by the exemption applicant.
    (b) Decision and order. The Committee's final determinations shall 
be documented in a written decision. If the Committee determines that an 
exemption should be granted, the Committee shall issue an order granting 
the exemption and specifying required mitigation and enhancement 
measures. The Committee shall publish its decision and order in the 
Federal Register as soon as practicable.
    (c) Permanent exemptions. Under section 7(h)(2) of the Act, an 
exemption granted by the Committee shall constitute a permanent 
exemption with respect to all endangered or threatened species for the 
purposes of completing such agency action--
    (1) Regardless of whether the species was identified in the 
biological assessment, and
    (2) Only if a biological assessment has been conducted under section 
7(c) of the Act with respect to such agency action. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, an exemption shall not be permanent if--
    (i) The Secretary finds, based on the best scientific and commercial 
data available, that such exemption would result in the extinction of a 
species that was not the subject of consultation under section 7(a)(2) 
of the Act or was not identified in any biological assessment conducted 
under section 7(c) of the Act, and
    (ii) The Committee determines within 60 days after the date of the 
Secretary's finding that the exemption should not be permanent.

If the Secretary makes a finding that the exemption would result in the 
extinction of a species, as specified above, the Committee shall meet 
with respect to the matter within 30 days after the date of the finding. 
During the 60 day period following the Secretary's determination, the 
holder of the exemption shall refrain from any action which would result 
in extinction of the species.
    (d) Finding by the Secretary of Defense. If the Secretary of Defense 
finds in writing that an exemption for the agency action is necessary 
for reasons of national security, the Committee shall grant the 
exemption notwithstanding any other provision in this part.

Sec. 501.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of these rules is to fulfill the 
responsibilities of the Marine Mammal Commission (the ``Commission'') 
under section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) (the 
``Act'') by establishing procedures whereby an individual will be 
notified if any system of records maintained by the Commission contains 
a record pertaining to him or her; by defining the times and places at 
which records will be made available and the identification requirements 
which must be met by any individual requesting access to them; by 
establishing procedures for disclosure to an individual, on request, of 
any record pertaining to him or her; and by establishing procedures for 
processing, reviewing, and making a final determination on requests of 
individuals to correct or amend a record pertaining to him or her, 
including a provision for administrative appeal of initial adverse 
determinations on such requests. These rules are promulgated with 
particular attention to the purposes and goals of the Act, and in 
accordance therewith provide for relative ease of access to records 
pertaining to an individual, and for maintenance by the Commission of 
only those records which are current, accurate, necessary, relevant and 
complete with respect to the purposes for which they were collected.
    (b) Scope. These rules apply only to ``record'' contained in 
``systems of records,'' defined by the Act as follows:

    The term ``record'' means any item, collection, or grouping of 
information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, 
including, but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, 
medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains 
his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying 
particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print 
or a photograph;
    The term ``system of records'' means of group of any record under 
the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the 
name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other 
identifying particular assigned to the individual.


Notices with respect to the systems maintained by the Commission have 
been published in the Federal Register, as required by the Act. These 
rules pertain only to the systems of records disclosed in such notices, 
and to any systems that may become the subject of a notice at any time 
in the future.
    (c) Nothing in these rules shall be construed as pertaining to 
requests made under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 501.2  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this part:
    (1) The term Act means the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (2) The term Commission means the Marine Mammal Commission.
    (3) The term Director means the Executive Director of the Marine 
Mammal Commission.
    (4) The term Privacy Officer means an individual designated by the 
Director to receive all requests regarding the existence of records, 
requests for access and requests for correction or amendment; to review 
and make initial determinations regarding all such requests; and to 
provide assistance to any individual wishing to exercise his or her 
rights under the Act.
    (b) Other terms shall be used in this part in accordance with the 
definitions contained in section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 
552a(a).

[[Page 440]]


<R05>
Sec. 501.3  Procedure for responding to requests regarding the existence of records pertaining to an individual.

    Any individual may submit a request to be notified whether a system 
of records, with respect to which the Commission has published a notice 
in the Federal Register, contains a record pertaining to him or her. 
Requests may be made in writing to the Privacy Officer or by appearing 
in person at the Commission offices located at 1625 I Street, NW., Room 
307, Washington, DC 20006 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. 
on any working day. Systems of records that are the subject of a request 
should be identified by reference to the system name designated in the 
Notice of Systems of Records published in the Federal Register. In the 
event a system name is not known to the individual, a general request 
will suffice if it indicates reasons for the belief that a record 
pertaining to the named individual is maintained by the Commission. 
Receipt of inquiries submitted by mail will be acknowledged within 10 
days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) unless a response can also be prepared and forwarded to the 
individual within that time.


<R05>
Sec. 501.4  Requests for access--times, places and requirements for identification of individuals.

    Requests for access to a system of records pertaining to any 
individual may be made by that individual by mail addressed to the 
Privacy Officer, or by submitting a written request in person at the 
Commission offices located at 1625 I Street, NW., Room 307, Washington, 
DC 20006, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on any working day. 
Assistance in gaining access under this section, securing an amendment 
or correction under Sec. 501.6, or preparing an appeal under 
Secs. 501.5(d) and 501.8 shall be provided by the Privacy Officer on 
request directed to the Commission office. An individual appearing in 
person at the Commission offices will be granted immediate access to any 
records to which that individual is entitled under the Act upon 
satisfactory proof of identity by means of a document bearing the 
individual's photograph or signature. For requests made by mail, 
identification of the individual shall be adequate if established by 
means of submitting a certificate of a notary public, or equivalent 
officer empowered to administer oaths, substantially in accord with the 
following:

    City of ------------ County of --------------: ss (Name of 
individual) who affixed (his) (her) signature below in my presence, came 
before me, a (Title), in the aforesaid County and State, this ------ day 
of ------, 19--, and established (his)(her) identity to my satisfaction.
    My Commission expires --------------.


The certificate shall not be required, however, for written requests 
pertaining to non-sensitive information or to information which would be 
required to be made available under the Freedom of Information Act. The 
Privacy Officer shall determine the adequacy of any proof of identity 
offered by an individual.

[41 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 501.5  Disclosure of requested information.

    (a) Upon request and satisfactory proof of identity, an individual 
appearing at the Commission offices shall be given immediate access to 
and permission to review any record, contained in a system of records, 
pertaining to him or her, shall be allowed to have a person of his/her 
choosing accompany him/her, and shall be given a copy of all or any 
portion of the record. The individual to which access is granted shall 
be required to sign a written statement authorizing the presence of the 
person who accompanies him or her, and authorizing discussion of his or 
her record in the presence of the accompanying person.
    (b) Requests made by mail to the Privacy Officer at the Commission 
offices will be acknowledged within 10 days from date of receipt 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). This 
acknowledgement shall advise the individual whether access to the record 
will be granted and, if access is granted, copies of such records shall 
be enclosed.
    (c) If the Privacy Officer initially determines to deny access to 
all or any portion of a record, notice of denial

[[Page 441]]

shall be given to the individual in writing, within 30 days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after acknowledgement is given, and 
shall include the following:
    (1) The precise record to which access is being denied;
    (2) The reason for denial, including a citation to the appropriate 
provisions of the Act and of these Rules;
    (3) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Director;
    (4) A statement of what steps must be taken to perfect an appeal to 
the Director; and,
    (5) A statement that the individual has a right to judicial review 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1) of any final denial issued by the Director.
    (d) Administrative appeal of an initial denial, in whole or in part, 
of any request for access to a record, shall be available. An individual 
may appeal by submitting to the Director a written request for 
reconsideration stating therein specific reasons for reversal which 
address directly the reasons for denial stated in the initial notice of 
denial. If access is denied on appeal, a final notice of denial shall be 
sent to the individual within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and 
holidays), and shall state with particularity the grounds for rejecting 
all reasons for reversal submitted by the individual. The denial shall 
then be deemed final for purposes of obtaining judicial review.

[40 FR 49276, Oct. 21, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 501.6  Requests for correction or amendment of a record.

    (a) Any individual may request the correction or amendment of a 
record pertaining to him or her in writing addressed to the Privacy 
Officer at the Commission offices. Verification of identity required for 
such requests shall be the same as that specified in Sec. 501.4 of this 
part with respect to requests for access. Records sought to be amended 
must be identified with as much specificity as is practicable under the 
circumstances of the request, and at a minimum, should refer to the 
system name designated in the Notice of System Records published in the 
Federal Register, the type of record in which the information thought to 
be improperly maintained or incorrect is contained, and the precise 
information that is the subject of the request (for example, system 
name, description of record, paragraph, sentence, line, words). 
Assistance in identifying a record, and in otherwise preparing a 
request, may be obtained by contacting the Privacy Officer at the 
Commission offices.
    (b) A request should, in addition to identifying the individual and 
the record sought to be amended or corrected, include:
    (1) The specific wording or other information to be deleted, if any;
    (2) The specific wording or other information to be inserted, if 
any, and the exact place in the record at which it is to be inserted, 
and,
    (3) A statement of the basis for the requested amendment or 
correction (e.g. that the record is inaccurate, unnecessary, irrelevant, 
untimely, or incomplete), together with supporting documents, if any, 
which substantiate the statement.


<R05>
Sec. 501.7  Agency review of requests for amendment or correction of a record.

    (a) Where possible, each request for amendment or correction shall 
be reviewed, and a determination on the request made, by the Privacy 
Officer within 10 days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and 
holidays). Requests shall be acknowledged within that period where 
insufficient information has been provided to enable action to be taken. 
An acknowledgement shall inform the individual making the request of the 
estimated time within which a disposition of the request is expected to 
be made, and shall prescribe such further information as may be 
necessary to process the request. The request shall be granted, or an 
initial decision to deny shall be made, within ten days of receipt of 
all information specified in the acknowledgement (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays and holidays).
    (b) Within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after 
arriving at a decision on a request, the Privacy Officer shall either:

[[Page 442]]

    (1) Make the requested amendment or correction, in whole or in part, 
and advise the individual in writing of such action; or,
    (2) Advise the individual in writing that the request has been 
initially denied, in whole or in part, stating, with respect to those 
portions denied;
    (i) The date of the denial;
    (ii) The reasons for the denial, including a citation to an 
appropriate section of the Act and these Rules; and,
    (iii) The right of the individual to prosecute an appeal and to 
obtain judicial review should a final denial result from the appeal.
    (c) In reviewing a request for amendment or correction of a record, 
the Privacy Officer shall consider the following criteria:
    (1) The sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the individual;
    (2) The factual accuracy of the information sought to be amended or 
corrected;
    (3) The relevance and necessity of the information sought to be 
amended or corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was 
collected;
    (4) The timeliness and currency of the information sought to be 
amended or corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was 
collected;
    (5) The completeness of the information sought to be amended or 
corrected in terms of the purposes for which it was collected;
    (6) The degree of possibility that denial of the request could 
unfairly result in determinations adverse to the individual;
    (7) The character of the record sought to be corrected or amended; 
and,
    (8) The propriety and feasibility of complying with the specific 
means of correction or amendment requested by the individual. If an 
amendment or correction is otherwise permissible under the Act and other 
relevant statutes, a request shall be denied only if the individual has 
failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the propriety 
of the amendment or correction in light of these criteria.

[40 FR 49276, Oct. 21, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 501.8  Appeal of initial denial of a request for amendment or correction.

    (a) The initial denial of a request for amendment or correction may 
be appealed by submitting to the Director the following appeal papers:
    (1) A copy of the original request for amendment or correction;
    (2) A copy of the initial denial; and
    (3) A precise statement of the reasons for the individual's belief 
that the denial is in error, referring specifically to the criteria 
contained in Sec. 501.7(c)(1) through (8).

The appeal must be signed by the individual. While these papers normally 
will constitute the entire Record on Appeal, the Director may add 
additional information, from sources other than the individual, where 
necessary to facilitate a final determination. Any such additional 
information added to the record shall promptly be disclosed to the 
individual to the greatest extent possible, and an opportunity for 
comment thereon shall be afforded prior to the final determination. 
Appeals should be submitted to the Director within 90 days after the 
date of the initial denial.
    (b) The Director shall issue a final determination on appeal within 
thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) 
from the date on which a completed Record on Appeal (including any 
additional information deemed necessary) is received. Review, and final 
determination by the Director, shall be based upon the criteria 
specified in Sec. 501.7(c)(1) through (8).
    (c) If the appeal is resolved favorably to the individual, the final 
determination shall specify the amendments or corrections to be made. 
Copies of the final determination shall be transmitted promptly to the 
individual and to the Privacy Officer. The Privacy Officer shall make 
the requested amendment or correction and advise the individual in 
writing of such action.
    (d) If the appeal is denied, the final determination shall state, 
with particularity, the reasons for denial, including a citation to an 
appropriate section of the Act and of these Rules. The final 
determination shall be forwarded promptly to the individual, together 
with a notice which shall inform

[[Page 443]]

the individual of his or her right to submit to the Privacy Officer, for 
inclusion in the record, a concise statement of grounds for disagreement 
with the final determination. Receipt of any such statement shall be 
acknowledged by the Privacy Officer, and all subsequent and prior users 
of the record shall be provided copies of the statement. The notice 
shall also inform the individual of his or her right, under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g)(1), to obtain judicial review of the final determination.

[40 FR 49276, Oct. 21, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 5, Jan. 2, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 501.9  Fees.

    A fee of $0.10 shall be charged for each copy of each page of a 
record made, by photocopy or similar process, at the request of an 
individual. No fee shall be charged for copies made at the initiative of 
the Commission incident to granting access to a record. A total copying 
fee of $2.00 or less may be waived by the Privacy Officer, but fees for 
all requests made contemporaneously by an individual shall be aggregated 
to determine the total fee.

Sec. 520.3  Definitions.

    As used in these regulations:
    (a) The term Commission means the Marine Mammal Commission;
    (b) The term Director means the Executive Director of the Marine 
Mammal Commission;
    (c) The term exempt materials means those materials described in 
Sec. 520.2(b);
    (d) The term non-exempt materials refers to all materials described 
in Sec. 520.2(a), but not included in Sec. 520.2(b); and
    (e) The term General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Marine 
Mammal Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 520.4  Availability of materials.

    (a) All non-exempt materials shall be available for inspection 
during normal business hours at the Commission offices, 1625 I Street, 
NW., Room 307, Washington, DC. Space shall be made available at that 
location for the use of any person who is granted permission to inspect 
such materials.
    (b) Requests to inspect, and obtain copies of, any material 
maintained by the Commission may be made in person at the Commission 
offices, or submitted in writing to the Executive Director, Marine 
Mammal Commission, 1625 I St., NW., Room 307, Washington, DC 20006. Each 
request should include a reasonable description of the material being 
sought, and should contain sufficient detail to facilitate retrieval of 
the material without undue delay. The Commission staff shall assist to 
the extent practicable in identifying material that is imprecisely 
described by the person requesting such material.
    (c) An initial determination whether, and to what extent, to grant 
each request shall be made by the General Counsel or his delegate within 
10 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after 
receipt of that request. The person making the request shall be notified 
immediately of the determination made. In making such determinations, it 
shall first be considered whether the material requested is of a type 
described in Sec. 520.2(a); if it is, the request shall be granted 
unless the material is exempted by Sec. 520.2(b). If the material 
requested is not of a type described in Sec. 520.2(a), or is the subject 
of one or more exemptions, the request shall be denied.
    (d) If a determination is made to grant a request, the relevant 
material shall promptly be made available for inspection at the 
Commission offices. Copies of the material disclosed shall be furnished 
within a reasonable time after payment of the fee specified in 
Sec. 520.7. Copies of less than 10 pages of material requested in person 
ordinarily will be furnished immediately following the determination to 
grant the request and payment of the fee. Larger numbers of copies may 
be furnished at the earliest convenience of the Commission staff, but 
must be furnished within a reasonable time following payment of the fee.
    (e) Whenever required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy, the General Counsel or his delegate shall determine 
that identifying details shall be deleted from an opinion, statement of 
policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction to which access 
is granted or of which copies are furnished. Where portions of the 
requested material are exempt under Sec. 520.2(b), and are reasonably 
segregable from the remainder of the material, those portions shall be 
excised from the material disclosed. Whenever details are deleted or 
portions are excised and not disclosed, the notification shall include 
the information specified in Sec. 520.4(f).
    (f) If a determination is made to deny a request, the notification 
shall include a statement of the reasons for such action, shall set 
forth the name and position of the person responsible for the denial, 
and shall advise the requester of the right, and the procedures required 
under Sec. 520.5, to appeal the denial to the Director.

a request for access to and copies of material may be made by submission 
of a written request for reconsideration. Such requests must state 
specific reasons for reconsideration that address directly the grounds 
upon which the denial was based. Requests should be addressed to the 
Director at the Commission offices.
    (b) The Director shall make a determination with respect to any 
appeal within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) after receipt of the request for reconsideration. The person 
making such a request shall immediately be notified by mail of the 
determination.
    (c) If the initial denial is reversed by the Director, any material 
with which the reversal is concerned shall be made available for 
inspection, and copies shall be furnished, in accordance with 
Sec. 520.4(d).
    (d) If the denial is upheld, in whole or in part, the Director shall 
include in the notification a statement of the requester's right of 
judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4), and the names and positions of 
the persons responsible for the denial.


<R05>
Sec. 520.6  Extensions of time.

    (a) Whenever unusual circumstances exist, as set forth in 
Sec. 520.6(b), the times within which determinations must be made by the 
General Counsel on requests for access (10 working days), and by the 
Director on requests for reconsideration (20 working days), may be 
extended by written notice to the requester. The notice shall set forth 
the reasons for such extension, and the date on which a determination is 
expected to be made. The maximum extension of time allowed under this 
section shall be 10 working days, but shall be utilized only to the 
extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular 
request.
    (b) As used in this section, ``unusual circumstances'' shall mean:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
Commission offices;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are the subject 
of a single request; or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.


<R05>
Sec. 520.7  Fees.

    (a) The following standard charges for document search and 
duplication, based on the direct costs of such services, must be paid 
before access to, or copies of material will be granted under these 
regulations:
    (1) Search: $4.00 per person-hour for clerical time; $8.00 per 
person-hour for professional or supervisory time;
    (2) Duplication: $0.10 per page of photocopied material.
    (b) The Commission shall furnish without charge, or at a reduced 
charge, copies of any material disclosed pursuant to these regulations, 
whenever the General Counsel or the Director determines that waiver or 
reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the 
information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general 
public.

<R05>
Sec. 530.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish procedures which supplement 
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations and provide for 
the implementation of those provisions

[[Page 448]]

identified in Sec. 1507.3(b) of the regulations which are applicable to 
the activities of the Commission in light of its statutory functions and 
responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 530.2  Ensuring that environmental documents are actually considered in agency decision-making.

    Section 1505.1 of the NEPA regulations contains requirements to 
ensure adequate consideration of environmental documents in agency 
decision-making. To implement these requirements, Commission officials 
shall:
    (a) Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating 
proposals for agency actions;
    (b) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments, and 
responses accompany the proposal through existing agency review 
processes;
    (c) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of 
alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when 
evaluating any proposal for action by the Commission which is likely to 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment; and
    (d) Where an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been prepared, 
consider the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIS when evaluating 
the proposal which is the subject of the EIS. All Commission officials 
directly involved in developing, evaluating, and/or reaching decisions 
on proposed actions shall consider relevant environmental documents and 
comply with the applicable provisions of the NEPA process.


<R05>
Sec. 530.3  Typical classes of action.

    Section 1507.3(b)(2), in conjunction with Sec. 1508.4, requires 
agencies to identify typical classes of action that warrant similar 
treatment under NEPA with respect to the preparation of EIS's or 
environmental assessments. As a general matter, the Commission's 
activities do not include actions for which EIS's or environmental 
assessments are required. Its activities involve:
    (a) Consultation with and recommendations to other Federal agencies 
for actions relating to marine mammal protection and conservation for 
which an EIS or environmental assessment is either not required by the 
NEPA regulations or for which an EIS or environmental assessment is 
prepared by another Federal agency; and
    (b) Research contracts relating to policy issues, biological-
ecological data needed to make sound management decisions, and better 
methods for collecting and analyzing data. These activities are not, by 
themselves, major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of 
the human environment and the Commission's activities are therefore 
categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare an EIS or 
environmental assessment except for proposals for legislation which are 
initiated by the Commission, for which the Commission shall develop 
environmental assessments or EIS's, as appropriate, in accordance with 
the NEPA regulations. The Commission shall independently determine 
whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required where:
    (1) A proposal for agency action is not covered by one of the 
typical classes of action above; or
    (2) For actions which are covered, the presence of extraordinary 
circumstances indicates that some other level of environmental review 
may be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 530.4  Environmental information.

    Interested persons may contact the Office of the General Counsel for 
information regarding the Commission's compliance with NEPA.

540.3 Procedures.

    Authority: Executive Order 12356.


<R05>
Sec. 540.1  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Marine Mammal Commission to act in 
accordance with Executive Order 12356 in matters relating to national 
security information.

[44 FR 55381, Sept. 26, 1979]

[[Page 449]]


<R05>
Sec. 540.2  Program.

    The Executive Director is designated as the Commission's official 
responsible for implementation and oversight of information security 
programs and procedures. He acts as the recipient of questions, 
suggestions, and complaints regarding all elements of this program, and 
is solely responsible for changes to it and for insuring that it is at 
all times consistent with Executive Order 12356. The Executive Director 
also serves as the Commission's official contact for requests for 
declassification of materials submitted under the provisions of 
Executive Order 12356, regardless of the point of origin of such 
requests. He is responsible for assuring that requests submitted under 
the Freedom of Information Act are handled in accordance with that Act 
and that declassification requests submitted under the provisions of 
Executive Order 12356 are acted upon within 60 days of receipt.

[44 FR 55381, Sept. 26, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 540.3  Procedures.

    (a) Mandatory declassification review. All requests for mandatory 
review shall be handled by the Executive Director or his designee. Under 
no circumstances shall the Exective Director refuse to confirm the 
existence or non-existence of a document requested under the Freedom of 
Information Act or the mandatory review provisions of Executive Order 
12356, unless the fact of its existence or non-existence would itself be 
classified under Executive Order 12356. Requests for declassification 
shall be acted upon promptly providing that the request reasonably 
describes the information which is the subject of the request for 
declassification. In light of the fact that the Commission does not have 
original classification authority and national security information in 
its custody has been classified by another Federal agency, the Executive 
Director will refer all requests for national security information in 
its custody to the Federal agency that classified it or, if the agency 
that classified it has either ceased to exist or transferred the 
information in conjunction with a transfer of functions, to the 
appropriate federal agency exercising original classification authority 
with respect to the same subject, for review and disposition in 
accordance with Executive Order 12356 and that agency's regulations and 
guidelines.
    (b) Exceptional cases. When an employee or contractor of the 
Commission originates information that is believed to require 
classification, the Executive Director shall ensure that it is protected 
in accordance with Executive Order 12356 and shall promptly transmit it 
under appropriate safeguards to the agency with appropriate subject 
matter jurisdiction and classification authority for review and action 
in accordance with the Order and that agency's regulations and 
guidelines.
    (c) Derivative classification. Derivative classification markings 
shall be applied to information that is in substance the same as 
information that is already classified, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12356, Section 2-1, unless it is determined through inquiries made 
to the originators of the classified information or other appropriate 
persons that the paraphrasing, restating, or summarizing of the 
classified information obviates the need for its classification, in 
which case the information shall be issued as unclassified or shall be 
marked appropriately. After verifying the current level of 
classification so far as practicable, paper copies of such derivatively 
classified information shall be marked so as to indicate:
    (1) The source of the original classification;
    (2) The identity of the Commission employee originating the 
derivatively classified document;
    (3) The dates or events for declassification or review for 
declassification indicated on the classified source material; and
    (4) Any additional authorized markings appearing on the source 
material.
    (d) Handling. All classified documents shall be delivered to the 
Executive Director or his designee immediately upon receipt. All 
potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of the names of 
such designees and updated information as necessary. In the event that 
the Executive Director or his designee is not available to receive

[[Page 450]]

such documents, they shall be turned over to the Administrative Officer 
and secured, unopened, in the combination safe located in the Commission 
offices until the Executive Director or his designee is available. Under 
no circumstances shall classified materials that cannot be delivered to 
the Executive Director or his designee be stored other than in the 
designated safe.
    (e) Reproduction. Reproduction of classified material shall take 
place only in accordance with Executive Order 12356, its implementing 
directives, and any limitations imposed by the originator. Should copies 
be made, they are subject to the same controls as the original document. 
Records showing the number and distribution of copies shall be 
maintained, where required by the Executive Order, by the Administrative 
Officer and the log stored with the original documents. These measures 
shall not restrict reproduction for the purposes of mandatory review.
    (f) Storage. All classified documents shall be stored in the 
combination safe located in the Commission's offices. The combination 
shall be changed as required by ISOO Directive No. 1, dated June 23, 
1982. The combination shall be known only to the Executive Director and 
his designees with the appropriate security clearance.
    (g) Employee education. All employees who have been granted a 
security clearance and who have occasion to handle classified materials 
shall be advised of handling, reproduction, and storage procedures and 
shall be required to review Executive Order 12356 and appropriate ISOO 
directives. This shall be effected by a memorandum to all affected 
employees at the time these procedures are implemented. New employees 
will be instructed in procedures as they enter employment with the 
Commission.
    (h) Agency terminology. The use of the terms Top Secret, Secret, and 
Confidential shall be limited to materials classified for national 
security purposes.

    No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be 
subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity 
conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures 
of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or 
activities.


<R05>
Secs. 550.141-550.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 550.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 550.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 550.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 550.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section

[[Page 454]]

through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to 
accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, 
delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of 
existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of 
accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its 
programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped 
persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in 
existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving 
compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to 
existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent 
compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing 
among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, 
the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and 
activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated 
setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that 
where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.

<R05>
Sec. 550.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 550.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons

[[Page 455]]

with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the 
existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 550.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.

Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily

pertaining to such meeting or portions

[[Page 458]]

thereof may be withheld from the public, only if the Commission

such information, is likely to:
    (1) Disclose matters that are (i) specifically authorized under

interest of national defense or foreign policy and (ii) in fact properly 
classified pursuant to that Executive order;
    (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Commission;
    (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552),

    (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or
    (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Disclose the trade secrets and commercial or financial 
information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Involve either accusing any person of a crime or formally 
censuring any person;
    (6) Disclose information of a personal nature, if disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (7) Disclose either investigatory records compiled for law 
enforcement purposes or information which if written would be contained 
in such records, but only to the extent that the production of the 
records or information would:
    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to either a fair trial or an 
impartial ajudication,
    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
    (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source or sources and, 
in the case of a record compiled either by a criminal law enforcement 
authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency 
conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, 
confidential information furnished only by the confidential source or 
sources,
    (v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
    (vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel;

likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed action of 
the Commission. This exception shall not apply in any instance where the 
Commission has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of 
the proposed action or where the Commission is required by law to make 
such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final action on 
the proposal; or
    (10) Specifically concern the issuance of a subpoena by the 
Commission, or the participation of the Commission in a civil action or 
proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or

Commission of a particular case of formal adjudication pursuant to the 
procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the 
record after opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) Before a meeting or portions thereof may be closed to public 
observation, the Commission shall determine, notwithstanding the 
exemptions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, whether or not 
the public interest requires that the meeting or portions thereof be 
open. The Commission may open a meeting or portions thereof that could 
be closed under paragraph (a) of this section if the Commission finds it 
to be in the public interest to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 560.6  Procedures for closing meetings.

    (a) A meeting or portions thereof may be closed and information 
pertaining to such meeting or portions thereof may be withheld under 
Sec. 560.5 of this part only when a majority of the members of the 
Commission vote to take such action.

[[Page 459]]

    (b) A separate vote of the members of the Commission shall be taken 
with respect to each meeting or portion thereof proposed to be closed 
and with respect to information which is proposed to be withheld. A 
single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings or 
portions thereof which are proposed to be closed, so long as each 
meeting or portion thereof in such series involves the same particular 
matter and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the 
initial meeting in such series. The vote of each participating 
Commission member shall be recorded, and no proxies shall be allowed.
    (c) A person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion 
of a meeting may request in writing that the Commission close that 
portion of the meeting for any of the reasons referred to in

Commissioner, a recorded vote shall be taken whether to close such 
meeting or a portion thereof.
    (d) Before the Commission may hold a meeting that is closed, in 
whole or part, a certification shall be obtained from the General

exemptive provision from Sec. 560.5(a) of this part.
    (e) Within one day of a vote taken pursuant to this section, the 
Commission shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote 
reflecting the vote of each Commissioner.
    (f) In the case of the closure of a meeting or portions thereof, the 
Commission shall make publicly available within one day of the vote on 
such action a full written explanation of the reasons for the closing 
together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and 
their affiliation.


<R05>

to the public pursuant to Sec. 560.5(a) (8) or (10) of this part, the 
Commission shall maintain a complete transcript, an electronic 
recording, or a set of minutes of the proceedings. If minutes are 
maintained, they shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed 
and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken and
