                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

from a scientific research vessel. Scientific research activity 
includes, but is not limited to, sampling, collecting, observing, or 
surveying the fish or fishery resources within the EEZ, at sea, on board 
scientific research vessels, to increase scientific knowledge of the 
fishery resources or their environment, or to test a hypothesis as part 
of a planned, directed investigation or study conducted according to

include the collection and retention of fish outside the scope of the 
applicable research plan, or the testing of fishing gear. Data 
collection designed to capture and land quantities of fish or 
invertebrates for product development, market research, and/or public 
display are not scientific research activities and must be permitted 
under exempted fishing procedures. For foreign vessels, such data 
collection activities are considered scientific research if they are 
carried out in full cooperation with the United States.

international accreditation body), international treaty organization, or 
scientific institution. In order for a vessel that is owned or chartered 
and controlled by a foreign government to meet this definition, the 
vessel must have scientific research as its exclusive mission during the 
scientific cruise in question and the vessel operations must be 
conducted in accordance with a scientific research plan.

procedures as required under section 302(f)(6) of the Magnuson Act.
    Stock assessment means the process of collecting and analyzing 
biological and statistical information to determine the changes in the 
abundance of fishery stocks in response to fishing, and, to the extent 
possible, to predict future trends of stock abundance. Stock assessments 
are based on resource surveys; knowledge of the habitat requirements, 
life history, and behavior of the species; the use of environmental 
indices to determine impacts on stocks; and catch statistics. Stock 
assessments are used as a basis to ``assess and specify the present and 
probable future condition of a fishery'' (as is required by the Magnuson 
Act), and are summarized in the Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation 
or similar document.
    Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) means a document or 
set of documents that provides Councils with a summary of the most 
recent biological condition of species in an FMU, and the social and 
economic condition of the recreational and commercial fishing industries 
and the fish processing industries. It summarizes, on a periodic basis, 
the best available scientific information concerning the past, present, 
and possible future condition of the stocks and fisheries being managed 
under Federal regulation.

participation in local, state, or national organizations, or performing 
other activities specifically related to the education or protection of 
consumers of marine resources; and
    (6) Teaching, journalism, writing, consulting, legal practice, or 
researching matters related to fisheries, fishery management, and marine 
resource conservation.
    (d) To assist in identifying necessary qualifications, each nominee 
must furnish to the appropriate Governor's office a current resume, or 
equivalent, describing career history--with particular attention to 
experience related to the above criteria. Nominees may provide such 
information in any format they wish. Career and educational history 
information sent to the Governors should also be sent to the NMFS Office 
of Fisheries Conservation and Management.
    (e) The Secretary will review each list submitted by a Governor to 
ascertain if the individuals on the list are qualified for the vacancy 
on the basis of the criteria prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section. If the Secretary determines that any nominee is not qualified, 
the Secretary will notify the appropriate Governor of that 
determination. The Governor shall then submit a revised list or resubmit 
the original list with an additional explanation of the qualifications 
of the nominee in question. The Secretary reserves the right to 
determine whether nominees are qualified.
    (f) There are two categories of seats to which voting members are 
appointed: ``obligatory'' and ``at-large.''
    (1) Each constituent state is entitled to one seat on the Council on 
which it is a member, except that Alaska is entitled to five seats and 
Washington is entitled to two seats on the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council. When the term of a state's obligatory member is 
expiring, or that seat becomes vacant before the expiration of its term, 
the Governor of that state must submit the names of at least three 
qualified individuals to fill that seat. In order to fill a state's 
obligatory seat, the Secretary may select from any of the nominees for 
such obligatory seat and from the nominees for any at-large seat 
submitted by the Governor of that state. If a Governor fails to provide 
a list of at least three qualified nominees for a seat obligated to that 
Governor's state, then the state's obligatory seat will remain vacant 
until three qualified nominees are submitted by the Governor and acted 
upon by the Secretary.

[[Page 15]]

    (2) Prior to submitting nominees for appointment to a Council, a 
constituent state Governor must determine if each of his or her nominees 
is a resident of that constituent state. A State Governor may not 
nominate a non-resident of that state for appointment to a Council seat 
obligated to that state. If, at any time during a term, an appointee to 
an obligatory seat changes residency to another state that is not a 
constituent state of that Council, the member may no longer vote as a 
representative of that state and must resign from that obligated seat. 
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a state resident is an individual 
who maintains his/her principal residence within that constituent state 
and, if applicable, pays income taxes to that state and/or to another 
appropriate jurisdiction within that state.
    (g) When the term of an at-large member is expiring, or that seat 
becomes vacant before the expiration of a term, the Governors of all 
constituent states of that Council must each submit the names of at 
least three qualified individuals to fill that seat.
    (1) In order to fill an at-large seat, the Secretary may select a 
nominee for that seat submitted by any Governor of a constituent state. 
When the terms of both an obligatory member and an at-large member 
expire concurrently, the Governor of the state holding the expiring 
obligatory seat may indicate that the nominees who were not selected for 
appointment to the obligatory seat may be considered for appointment to 
an at-large seat, provided that the resulting total number of nominees 
submitted by that Governor for the expiring at-large seat is no fewer 
than three.
    (2) If a Governor fails to submit a list of three qualified nominees 
for an available at-large seat within the time allotted, then a new at-
large member will be appointed from lists of qualified nominees 
submitted by Governors of other constituent states.
    (3) If a Governor chooses to submit nominations for one or more 
vacant at-large seats on a Council, he or she must submit lists that 
contain at least three different nominees for each vacant seat. In 
making selections to each of the available at-large seats, the Secretary 
will consider all names submitted by the constituent state governors.
    (4) In filling expiring at-large seats, the Secretary will consider 
only complete slates of nominees submitted by the Governors of the 
Council's constituent states. If nominations are requested to fill more 
than one at-large seat and a Governor elects to nominate a total of four 
candidates, (i.e., a slate of three candidates for one seat and one for 
the other(s)), the set of three candidates will be considered only for 
the first seat, but the two candidates who were not selected will not be 
considered for the other(s). In this case, the only candidates 
considered for the other seat(s) would be derived from the slates 
offered by the Governors of the other states that included three 
different qualified candidates (i.e., candidates who were not considered 
for one of the other seats).
    (5) Governors may nominate residents of another constituent state of 
a Council for appointment to an at-large seat on that Council.
    (6) The Secretary must, to the extent practicable, ensure a fair and 
balanced apportionment, on a rotating or other basis, of the active 
participants (or their representatives) in the commercial and 
recreational fisheries in the Council's area of authority. Further, the 
Secretary must take action to ensure, to the extent practicable, that 
those persons dependent for their livelihood upon the fisheries in the 
Council's area of authority are fairly represented as voting members.


<R05>
Sec. 600.220  Oath of office.

    Each member appointed to a Council must take an oath of office.


<R05>
Sec. 600.225  Rules of conduct.

    (a) Council members, as Federal office holders, and Council 
employees are subject to most Federal criminal statutes covering 
bribery, conflict-of-interest, disclosure of confidential information, 
and lobbying with appropriated funds.
    (b) The Councils are responsible for maintaining high standards of 
ethical conduct among themselves, their staffs, and their advisory 
groups. In addition to abiding by the applicable Federal conflict of 
interest statutes, both

[[Page 16]]

members and employees of the Councils must comply with the following 
standards of conduct:
    (1) No employee of a Council may use his or her official authority 
or influence derived from his or her position with the Council for the 
purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election to or 
a nomination for any national, state, county, or municipal elective 
office.
    (2) No employee of a Council may be deprived of employment, 
position, work, compensation, or benefit provided for or made possible 
by the Magnuson Act on account of any political activity or lack of such 
activity in support of or in opposition to any candidate or any 
political party in any national, state, county, or municipal election, 
or on account of his or her political affiliation.
    (3) No Council member or employee may pay, offer, promise, solicit, 
or receive from any person, firm, or corporation a contribution of money 
or anything of value in consideration of either support or the use of 
influence or the promise of support or influence in obtaining for any 
person any appointive office, place, or employment under the Council.
    (4) No employee of a Council may have a direct or indirect financial 
interest that conflicts with the fair and impartial conduct of his or 
her Council duties. However, an Executive Director may retain a 
financial interest in harvesting, processing or marketing activities, 
and participate in matters of general public concern on the Council that 
might affect that interest, if that interest has been disclosed in a 
report filed under Sec. 600.235.
    (5) No Council member, employee of a Council, or member of a Council 
advisory group may use or allow the use, for other than official 
purposes, of information obtained through or in connection with his or 
her Council employment that has not been made available to the general 
public.
    (6) No Council member or employee of the Council may engage in 
criminal, infamous, dishonest, notoriously immoral, or disgraceful 
conduct.
    (7) No Council member or employee of the Council may use Council 
property on other than official business. Such property must be 
protected and preserved from improper or deleterious operation or use.
    (8) No Council member may participate--
    (i) Personally and substantially as a member through decision, 
approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, 
investigation, or otherwise in a particular matter primarily of 
individual concern, such as a contract, in which he or she has a 
financial interest; or
    (ii) In any matter of general public concern that is likely to have 
a direct and predictable effect on a member's financial interest, unless 
that interest is in harvesting, processing, or marketing activities and 
has been disclosed in a report filed under Sec. 600.235. For purposes of 
this section, the member's financial interest includes that of the 
member's spouse; minor child; partner; organization in which the member 
is serving as officer, director, trustee, partner or employee; or any 
person or organization with whom the member is negotiating or has any 
arrangement concerning prospective employment.


<R05>
Sec. 600.230  Removal.

    The Secretary may remove for cause any Secretarially appointed 
member of a Council in accordance with section 302(b)(5) of the Magnuson 
Act, wherein the Council concerned first recommends removal of that 
member by not less than two-thirds of the voting members. A 
recommendation of a Council to remove a member must be made in writing 
to the Secretary and accompanied by a statement of the reasons upon 
which the recommendation is based.


<R05>
Sec. 600.235  Financial disclosure.

    (a) The Magnuson Act requires the disclosure by each Council 
nominee, voting member appointed to the Council by the Secretary, and 
Executive Director, of any financial interest of the reporting 
individual in any harvesting, processing, or marketing activity that is 
being, or will be, undertaken within any fishery under the authority of 
the individual's Council, and of any such financial interest of the 
reporting individual's spouse, minor child, partner, or any organization 
(other than the

[[Page 17]]

Council) in which that individual is serving as an officer, director, 
trustee, partner, or employee. The information required to be reported 
must be disclosed on NOAA Form 88-195, ``Statement of Financial 
Interests for Use by Voting Members, Nominees, and Executive Directors 
of Regional Fishery Management Councils'' (Financial Interest Form), or 
such other form as the Secretary may prescribe. The report must be filed 
by each nominee for Secretarial appointment with the Assistant 
Administrator by April 15 or, if nominated after March 15, 1 month after 
nomination by the Governor. A seated voting member appointed by the 
Secretary, or an Executive Director, must file a Financial Interest Form 
within 45 days of taking office; must update his or her statement within 
30 days of acquiring any such financial interest, or of substantially 
changing a financial interest; and must update his/her statement 
annually and file that update by February 1 of each year with the 
Executive Director of the appropriate Council, and concurrently provide 
copies of such documents to the NMFS Regional Director for the 
geographic area concerned. The completed Financial Interest Forms will 
be kept on file, and made available for public inspection at reasonable 
hours at the Council offices. In addition, the statements will be made 
available at each public Council meeting or hearing.
    (b) The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208 do not apply to an individual 
who has filed a financial report under this section regarding an 
interest that has been reported.
    (c) By February 1 of each year, Councils must forward copies of the 
completed disclosure from each current Council member and Executive 
Director to the Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and 
Management, NMFS. Councils must also include any updates in disclosures, 
as well as revisions required for changes of interests.
    (d) Councils must retain the disclosure forms for each member for at 
least 5 years after the expiration of that member's last term.


<R05>
Sec. 600.240  Security assurances.

    (a) DOC/OS will issue security assurances to Council nominees and 
members following completion of background checks. Security assurances 
will be valid for 5 years from the date of issuance. A security 
assurance will not entitle the member to access classified data. In 
instances in which Council members may need to discuss, at closed 
meetings, materials classified for national security purposes, the 
agency or individual (e.g., DOS, USCG) providing such classified 
information will be responsible for ensuring that Council members and 
other attendees have the appropriate security clearances.
    (b) Each nominee to a Council is required to complete a 
Certification of Status form (``form''). All nominees must certify, 
pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, whether they 
serve as an agent of a foreign principal. Each nominee must certify, 
date, sign, and return the form with his or her completed nomination 
kit. Nominees will not be considered for appointment to a Council if 
they have not filed this form. Any nominee who currently is an agent of 
a foreign principal will not be eligible for appointment to a Council, 
and therefore should not be nominated by a Governor for appointment.


<R05>
Sec. 600.245  Council member compensation.

    (a) The obligatory and at-large voting members of each Council 
appointed under section 302(b)(1)(C) of the Magnuson Act who are not 
employed by the Federal Government or any state or local government 
(i.e., any member who does not receive compensation from any such 
government for the period when performing duties as a Council member) 
shall receive compensation at 1.2 times the daily rate for a GS-15 (Step 
1) of the General Schedule (without locality pay) when engaged in actual 
performance of duties as assigned by the Chair of the Council. Actual 
performance of duties, for the purposes of compensation, may include 
travel time.
    (b) All voting Council members whose eligibility for compensation 
has been established in accordance with NOAA guidelines will be paid 
through the cooperative agreement as a direct

[[Page 18]]

line item on a contractual basis without deductions being made for 
Social Security or Federal and state income taxes. A report of 
compensation will be furnished each year by the member's Council to the 
proper Regional Program Officer, as required by the Internal Revenue 
Service. Such compensation may be paid on a full day's basis, whether in 
excess of 8 hours a day or less than 8 hours a day. The time is 
compensable where the individual member is required to expend a 
significant private effort that substantially disrupts the daily routine 
to the extent that a work day is lost to the member. ``Homework'' time 
in preparation for formal Council meetings is not compensable.
    (c) Non-government Council members receive compensation for:
    (1) Days spent in actual attendance at a meeting of the Council or 
jointly with another Council.
    (2) Travel on the day preceding or following a scheduled meeting 
that precluded the member from conducting his normal business on the day 
in question.
    (3) Meetings of standing committees of the Council if approved in 
advance by the Chair.
    (4) Individual member meeting with scientific and technical 
advisors, when approved in advance by the Chair and a substantial 
portion of any day is spent at the meeting.
    (5) Conducting or attending hearings, when authorized in advance by 
the Chair.
    (6) Other meetings involving Council business when approved in 
advance by the Chair.
    (d) The Executive Director of each Council must submit to the 
appropriate Regional Office annually a report, approved by the Council 
Chair, of Council member compensation authorized. This report shall 
identify, for each member, amount paid, dates, and location and purpose 
of meetings attended.


<R04>
                      Subpart D--National Standards


<R05>
Sec. 600.305  General.

    (a) Purpose. (1) This subpart establishes guidelines, based on the 
national standards, to assist in the development and review of FMPs, 
amendments, and regulations prepared by the Councils and the Secretary.
    (2) In developing FMPs, the Councils have the initial authority to 
ascertain factual circumstances, to establish management objectives, and 
to propose management measures that will achieve the objectives. The 
Secretary will determine whether the proposed management objectives and 
measures are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of 
the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary has an 
obligation under section 301(b) of the Magnuson Act to inform the 
Councils of the Secretary's interpretation of the national standards so 
that they will have an understanding of the basis on which FMPs will be 
reviewed.
    (3) The national standards are statutory principles that must be 
followed in any FMP. The guidelines summarize Secretarial 
interpretations that have been, and will be, applied under these 
principles. The guidelines are intended as aids to decisionmaking; FMPs 
formulated according to the guidelines will have a better chance for 
expeditious Secretarial review, approval, and implementation. FMPs that 
are in substantial compliance with the guidelines, the Magnuson Act, and 
other applicable law must be approved.
    (b) Fishery management objectives. (1) Each FMP, whether prepared by 
a Council or by the Secretary, should identify what the FMP is designed 
to accomplish (i.e., the management objectives to be attained in 
regulating the fishery under consideration). In establishing objectives, 
Councils balance biological constraints with human needs, reconcile 
present and future costs and benefits, and integrate the diversity of 
public and private interests. If objectives are in conflict, priorities 
should be established among them.
    (2) How objectives are defined is important to the management 
process. Objectives should address the problems of a particular fishery. 
The objectives should be clearly stated, practicably attainable, framed 
in terms of definable events and measurable benefits, and based upon a 
comprehensive rather than a fragmentary approach to the

[[Page 19]]

problems addressed. An FMP should make a clear distinction between 
objectives and the management measures chosen to achieve them. The 
objectives of each FMP provide the context within which the Secretary 
will judge the consistency of an FMP's conservation and management 
measures with the national standards.
    (c) Word usage. The word usage refers to all regulations in this 
subpart.
    (1) Must is used, instead of ``shall'', to denote an obligation to 
act; it is used primarily when referring to requirements of the Magnuson 
Act, the logical extension thereof, or of other applicable law.
    (2) Shall is used only when quoting statutory language directly, to 
avoid confusion with the future tense.
    (3) Should is used to indicate that an action or consideration is 
strongly recommended to fulfill the Secretary's interpretation of the 
Magnuson Act, and is a factor reviewers will look for in evaluating a 
SOPP or FMP.
    (4) May is used in a permissive sense.
    (5) May not is proscriptive; it has the same force as ``must not.''
    (6) Will is used descriptively, as distinguished from denoting an 
obligation to act or the future tense.
    (7) Could is used when giving examples, in a hypothetical, 
permissive sense.
    (8) Can is used to mean ``is able to,'' as distinguished from 
``may.''
    (9) Examples are given by way of illustration and further 
explanation. They are not inclusive lists; they do not limit options.
    (10) Analysis, as a paragraph heading, signals more detailed 
guidance as to the type of discussion and examination an FMP should 
contain to demonstrate compliance with the standard in question.
    (11) Determine is used when referring to OY.
    (12) Adjust is used when establishing a deviation from MSY for 
biological reasons, such as in establishing ABC, TAC, or EY.
    (13) Modify is used when the deviation from MSY is for the purpose 
of determining OY, in accord with relevant economic, social, or 
ecological factors.


<R05>
Sec. 600.310  National Standard 1--Optimum Yield.

    (a) Standard 1. Conservation and management measures shall prevent 
overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the OY from each 
fishery for the U.S. fishing industry.
    (b) General. The determination of OY is a decisional mechanism for 
resolving the Magnuson Act's multiple purposes and policies, for 
implementing an FMP's objectives, and for balancing the various 
interests that comprise the national welfare. OY is based on MSY, or on 
MSY as it may be adjusted under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The 
most important limitation on the specification of OY is that the choice 
of OY--and the conservation and management measures proposed to achieve 
it--must prevent overfishing.
    (c) Overfishing. (1) Overfishing is a level or rate of fishing 
mortality that jeopardizes the long-term capacity of a stock or stock 
complex to produce MSY on a continuing basis. Each FMP must specify, to 
the maximum extent possible, an objective and measurable definition of 
overfishing for each stock or stock complex covered by that FMP, and 
provide an analysis of how the definition was determined and how it 
relates to reproductive potential.
    (2) The definition of overfishing for a stock or stock complex may 
be developed or expressed in terms of a minimum level of spawning 
biomass (``threshold''); maximum level or rate of fishing mortality; or 
formula, model, or other measurable standard designed to ensure the 
maintenance of the stock's productive capacity. Overfishing must be 
defined in a way to enable the Council and the Secretary to monitor and 
evaluate the condition of the stock or stock complex relative to the 
definition.
    (3) Different fishing patterns can produce a variety of effects on 
local and areawide abundance, availability, size, and age composition of 
a stock. Some of these fishing patterns have been called ``growth,'' 
``localized,'' or ``pulse'' overfishing; however, these patterns are not 
necessarily overfishing under the national standard 1 definition, which 
focuses on recruitment and long-term reproductive capacity. (Also see 
paragraph (c)(6)(v)).

[[Page 20]]

    (4) Overfishing definitions must be based on the best scientific 
information available. Councils must build into the definition 
appropriate consideration of risk, taking into account uncertainties in 
estimating domestic harvest, stock conditions, or the effects of 
environmental factors (also see Sec. 600.335). In cases where scientific 
data are severely limited, the Councils' informed judgment must be used, 
and effort should be directed to identifying and gathering the needed 
data.
    (5) Secretarial approval or disapproval of the overfishing 
definition will be based on consideration of whether the proposal:
    (i) Has sufficient scientific merit.
    (ii) Is likely to result in effective Council action to prevent the 
stock from closely approaching or reaching an overfished status.
    (iii) Provides a basis for objective measurement of the status of 
the stock against the definition.
    (iv) Is operationally feasible.
    (6) In addition to a specific definition of overfishing for each 
stock or stock complex, an FMP must contain management measures 
necessary to prevent overfishing.
    (i) If overfishing is defined in terms of a threshold biomass level, 
the Council must ensure that fishing effort does not cause spawning 
biomass to fall and remain below that threshold.
    (ii) If overfishing is defined in terms of a maximum fishing 
mortality rate, the Council must ensure that fishing effort on that 
stock does not cause the maximum rate to be exceeded.
    (iii) If data indicate that an overfished condition exists, a 
program must be established for rebuilding the stock over a period of 
time specified by the Council and acceptable to the Secretary.
    (iv) If data indicate that a stock or stock complex is approaching 
an overfished condition, the Council should identify actions or 
combination of actions to be undertaken in response.
    (v) Depending on the objectives of a particular FMP and the specific 
definition of overfishing established for the stock or stock complex 
under management, a Council may recommend measures to prevent or permit 
pulse, localized, or growth overfishing.
    (7) Significant adverse alterations in environment/habitat 
conditions increase the possibility that fishing effort will contribute 
to a stock collapse. Care should be taken to identify the cause of any 
downward trends in spawning stock sizes or average annual recruitment.
    (i) Whether these trends are caused by environmental changes or by 
fishing effort, the only direct control provided by the Magnuson Act is 
to reduce fishing mortality.
    (ii) Unless the Council asserts, as supported by appropriate 
evidence, that reduced fishing effort would not alleviate the problem, 
the FMP must include measures to reduce fishing mortality, regardless of 
the cause of the low population level.
    (iii) If manmade environmental changes are contributing to the 
downward trends, in addition to controlling effort, Councils should 
recommend restoration of habitat and other ameliorative programs, to the 
extent possible, and consider whether to take action under section 
302(i) of the Magnuson Act.
    (8) There are certain limited exceptions to the requirement to 
prevent overfishing. Harvesting the major component of a mixed fishery 
at its optimum level may result in the overfishing of a minor (smaller 
or less valuable) stock component in the fishery. A Council may decide 
to permit this type of overfishing if it is demonstrated by analysis 
(paragraph (f)(5) of this section) that it will result in net benefits 
to the Nation, and if the Council's action will not cause any stock to 
require protection under the ESA.
    (9) All FMPs should contain a definition of overfishing for the 
stock or stock complex managed under the affected FMP.
    (d) MSY. (1) MSY is the largest average annual catch or yield that 
can be taken over a significant period of time from each stock under 
prevailing ecological and environmental conditions.
    (2) MSY may be presented as a range of values. One MSY may be 
specified for a related group of species in a mixed-species fishery. 
Since MSY is a long-term average, it need not be specified annually, but 
must be based on the best scientific information available.

[[Page 21]]

    (3) MSY may be only the starting point in providing a realistic 
biological description of allowable fishery removals. MSY may need to be 
adjusted because of environmental factors, stock peculiarities, or other 
biological variables, prior to the determination of OY. An example of 
such an adjustment is determination of ABC.
    (e) ABC. (1) ABC is a preliminary description of the acceptable 
harvest (or range of harvests) for a given stock or stock complex. Its 
derivation focuses on the status and dynamics of the stock, 
environmental conditions, other ecological factors, and prevailing 
technological characteristics of the fishery.
    (2) When ABC is used, its specification constitutes the first step 
in deriving OY from MSY. Unless the best scientific information 
available indicates otherwise (see Sec. 600.315, ABC should be no higher 
than the product of the stock's natural mortality rate and the biomass 
of the exploitable stock. If a threshold has been specified for the 
stock, ABC must equal zero when the stock is at or below that threshold 
(also see paragraph (c)(2) of this section). ABC may be expressed in 
numeric or nonnumeric terms.
    (f) OY--(1) Definition. The term ``optimum'' with respect to the 
yield from a fishery, means the amount of fish that will provide the 
greatest overall benefit to the Nation, with particular reference to 
food production and recreational opportunities; and that is prescribed 
as such on the basis of the MSY from each fishery, as modified by any 
relevant economic, social, or ecological factors (section 3(21)(b) of 
the Magnuson Act).
    (2) Values in determination. In determining the greatest benefit to 
the Nation, two values that should be weighed are food production and 
recreational opportunities (section 3(21)(a) of the Magnuson Act). They 
should receive serious attention as measures of benefit when considering 
the economic, ecological, or social factors used in modifying MSY to 
obtain OY.
    (i) Food production encompasses the goals of providing seafood to 
consumers, maintaining an economically viable fishery, and utilizing the 
capacity of U.S. fishery resources to meet nutritional needs.
    (ii) Recreational opportunities includes recognition of the 
importance of the quality of the recreational fishing experience, and of 
the contribution of recreational fishing to the national, regional, and 
local economies and food supplies.
    (3) Factors relevant to OY. The Magnuson Act's definition of OY 
identifies three categories of factors to be used in modifying MSY to 
arrive at OY: Economic, social, and ecological (section 3(21)(b) of the 
Magnuson Act). Not every factor will be relevant in every fishery. For 
some fisheries, insufficient information may be available with respect 
to some factors to provide a basis for corresponding modifications to 
MSY.
    (i) Economic factors. Examples are promotion of domestic fishing, 
development of unutilized or underutilized fisheries, satisfaction of 
consumer and recreational needs, and encouragement of domestic and 
export markets for U.S.-harvested fish. Some other factors that may be 
considered are the value of fisheries, the level of capitalization, 
operating costs of vessels, alternate employment opportunities, and 
economies of coastal areas.
    (ii) Social factors. Examples are enjoyment gained from recreational 
fishing, avoidance of gear conflicts and resulting disputes, 
preservation of a way of life for fishermen and their families, and 
dependence of local communities on a fishery. Among other factors that 
may be considered are the cultural place of subsistence fishing, 
obligations under Indian treaties, and worldwide nutritional needs.
    (iii) Ecological factors. Examples are the vulnerability of 
incidental or unregulated species in a mixed-species fishery, predator-
prey or competitive interactions, and dependence of marine mammals and 
birds or endangered species on a stock of fish. Equally important are 
environmental conditions that stress marine organisms, such as natural 
and manmade changes in wetlands or nursery grounds, and effects of 
pollutants on habitat and stocks.
    (4) Specification. (i) The amount of fish that constitutes the OY 
need not be expressed in terms of numbers or weight of fish. The 
economic, social, or ecological modifications to MSY may

[[Page 22]]

be expressed by describing fish having common characteristics, the 
harvest of which provides the greatest overall benefit to the Nation. 
For instance, OY may be expressed as a formula that converts periodic 
stock assessments into quotas or guideline harvest levels for 
recreational, commercial, and other fishing. OY may be defined in terms 
of an annual harvest of fish or shellfish having a minimum weight, 
length, or other measurement. OY may also be expressed as an amount of 
fish taken only in certain areas, or in certain seasons, or with 
particular gear, or by a specified amount of fishing effort. In the case 
of a mixed-species fishery, the incidental-species OY may be a function 
of the directed catch, or absorbed into an OY for related species.
    (ii) If a numerical OY is chosen, a range or average may be 
specified.
    (iii) In a fishery where there is a significant discard component, 
the OY may either include or exclude discards, consistent with the other 
yield determinations.
    (iv) The OY specification can be converted into an annual numerical 
estimate to establish any TALFF and to analyze impacts of the management 
regime. There should be a mechanism in an FMP for periodic reassessment 
of the OY specification, so that it is responsive to changing 
circumstances in the fishery.
    (v) The determination of OY requires a specification of MSY. 
However, even where sufficient scientific data as to the biological 
characteristics of the stock do not exist, or the period of exploitation 
or investigation has not been long enough for adequate understanding of 
stock dynamics, or where frequent large-scale fluctuations in stock size 
make this concept of limited value, the OY should be based on the best 
scientific information available.
    (5) Analysis. An FMP must contain an analysis of how its OY 
specification was determined (section 303(a)(3) of the Magnuson Act). It 
should relate the explanation of overfishing in paragraph (c) of this 
section to conditions in the particular fishery, and explain how its 
choice of OY and conservation and management measures will prevent 
overfishing in that fishery. If overfishing is permitted under paragraph 
(c)(8) of this section, the analysis must contain a justification in 
terms of overall benefits and an assessment of the risk of the species 
or stock component reaching a threatened or endangered status. A Council 
must identify those economic, social, and ecological factors relevant to 
management of a particular fishery, then evaluate them to arrive at the 
modification (if any) of MSY. The choice of a particular OY must be 
carefully defined and documented to show that the OY selected will 
produce the greatest benefit to the Nation.
    (g) OY as a target. (1) The specification of OY in an FMP is not 
automatically a quota or ceiling, although quotas may be derived from 
the OY, where appropriate. OY is a target or goal; an FMP must contain 
conservation and management measures, and provisions for information 
collection, that are designed to achieve OY. These measures should allow 
for practical and effective implementation and enforcement of the 
management regime, so that the harvest is allowed to reach, but not to 
exceed OY by a substantial amount. The Secretary has an obligation to 
implement and enforce the FMP so that OY is achieved. If management 
measures prove unenforceable--or too restrictive, or not rigorous enough 
to realize OY--they should be modified; an alternative is to reexamine 
the adequacy of the OY specification.
    (2) Exceeding OY does not necessarily constitute overfishing, 
although they might coincide. Even if no overfishing resulted, continual 
harvest at a level above a fixed-value OY would violate National 
Standard 1, because OY was exceeded (not achieved) on a continuing 
basis.
    (3) Part of the OY may be held as a reserve to allow for 
uncertainties in estimates of stock size and of DAH or to solve 
operational problems in achieving (but not exceeding) OY. If an OY 
reserve is established, an adequate mechanism should be included in the 
FMP to permit timely release of the reserve to domestic or foreign 
fishermen, if necessary.
    (h) OY and foreign fishing. Section 201(d) of the Magnuson Act 
provides that fishing by foreign nations is limited to that portion of 
the OY that will

[[Page 23]]

not be harvested by vessels of the United States.
    (1) DAH. Councils must consider the capacity of, and the extent to 
which, U.S. vessels will harvest the OY on an annual basis. Estimating 
the amount that U.S. fishing vessels will actually harvest is required 
to determine the surplus.
    (2) DAP. Each FMP must identify the capacity of U.S. processors. It 
must also identify the amount of DAP, which is the sum of two estimates:
    (i) The amount of U.S. harvest that domestic processors will 
process. This estimate may be based on historical performance and on 
surveys of the expressed intention of manufacturers to process, 
supported by evidence of contracts, plant expansion, or other relevant 
information.
    (ii) The amount of fish that will be harvested by domestic vessels, 
but not processed (e.g., marketed as fresh whole fish, used for private 
consumption, or used for bait).
    (iii) JVP. When DAH exceeds DAP, the surplus is available for JVP. 
JVP is derived from DAH.

Sec. 600.315  National Standard 2--Scientific Information.

    (a) Standard 2. Conservation and management measures shall be based 
upon the best scientific information available.
    (b) FMP development. The fact that scientific information concerning 
a fishery is incomplete does not prevent the preparation and 
implementation of an FMP (see related Secs. 600.320(d)(2) and 
600.340(b).
    (1) Scientific information includes, but is not limited to, 
information of a biological, ecological, economic, or social nature. 
Successful fishery management depends, in part, on the timely 
availability, quality, and quantity of scientific information, as well 
as on the thorough analysis of this information, and the extent to which 
the information is applied. If there are conflicting facts or opinions 
relevant to a particular point, a Council may choose among them, but 
should justify the choice.
    (2) FMPs must take into account the best scientific information 
available at the time of preparation. Between the initial drafting of an 
FMP and its submission for final review, new information often becomes 
available. This new information should be incorporated into the final 
FMP where practicable; but it is unnecessary to start the FMP process 
over again, unless the information indicates that drastic changes have 
occurred in the fishery that might require revision of the management 
objectives or measures.
    (c) FMP implementation. (1) An FMP must specify whatever information 
fishermen and processors will be required or requested to submit to the 
Secretary. Information about harvest within state boundaries, as well as 
in the EEZ, may be collected if it is needed for proper implementation 
of the FMP and cannot be obtained otherwise. The FMP should explain the 
practical utility of the information specified in monitoring the 
fishery, in facilitating inseason management decisions, and in judging 
the performance of the management regime; it should also consider the 
effort, cost, or social impact of obtaining it.
    (2) An FMP should identify scientific information needed from other 
sources to improve understanding and management of the resource and the 
fishery.
    (3) The information submitted by various data suppliers about the 
stocks(s) throughout its range or about the fishery should be comparable 
and compatible, to the maximum extent possible.
    (d) FMP amendment. FMPs should be amended on a timely basis, as new 
information indicates the necessity for change in objectives or 
management measures.
    (e) SAFE Report. (1) The SAFE report is a document or set of 
documents that provides Councils with a summary of the most recent 
biological condition of species in the FMU, and the social and economic 
condition of the recreational and commercial fishing interests and the 
fish processing industries. It summarizes, on a periodic basis, the best 
available scientific information concerning the past, present, and 
possible future condition of the stocks and fisheries being managed 
under Federal regulation.
    (i) The Secretary has the responsibility to assure that a SAFE 
report or

[[Page 24]]

similar document is prepared, reviewed annually, and changed as 
necessary for each FMP. The Secretary or Councils may utilize any 
combination of talent from Council, state, Federal, university, or other 
sources to acquire and analyze data and produce the SAFE report.
    (ii) The SAFE report provides information to the Councils for 
determining annual harvest levels from each stock, documenting 
significant trends or changes in the resource and fishery over time, and 
assessing the relative success of existing state and Federal fishery 
management programs. In addition, the SAFE report may be used to update 
or expand previous environmental and regulatory impact documents, and 
ecosystem and habitat descriptions.
    (iii) Each SAFE report must be scientifically based, and cite data 
sources and interpretations.
    (2) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to base 
harvest specifications.
    (3) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to assess 
the social and economic condition of the persons and businesses that 
rely on the use of fish resources, including fish processing industries.
    (4) Each SAFE report may contain additional economic, social, and 
ecological information pertinent to the success of management or the 
achievement of objectives of each FMP.


<R05>
Sec. 600.320  National Standard 3--Management Units.

    (a) Standard 3. To the extent practicable, an individual stock of 
fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelated 
stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.
    (b) General. The purpose of this standard is to induce a 
comprehensive approach to fishery management. The geographic scope of 
the fishery, for planning purposes, should cover the entire range of the 
stocks(s) of fish, and not be overly constrained by political 
boundaries. Wherever practicable, an FMP should seek to manage 
interrelated stocks of fish.
    (c) Unity of management. Cooperation and understanding among 
entities concerned with the fishery (e.g., Councils, states, Federal 
Government, international commissions, foreign nations) are vital to 
effective management. Where management of a fishery involves multiple 
jurisdictions, coordination among the several entities should be sought 
in the development of an FMP. Where a range overlaps Council areas, one 
FMP to cover the entire range is preferred. The Secretary designates 
which Council(s) will prepare the FMP, under section 304(f) of the 
Magnuson Act.
    (d) Management unit. The term ``management unit'' means a fishery or 
that portion of a fishery identified in an FMP as relevant to the FMP's 
management objectives.
    (1) Basis. The choice of a management unit depends on the focus of 
the FMP's objectives, and may be organized around biological, 
geographic, economic, technical, social, or ecological perspectives. For 
example:
    (i) Biological--could be based on a stock(s) throughout its range.
    (ii) Geographic--could be an area.
    (iii) Economic--could be based on a fishery supplying specific 
product forms.
    (iv) Technical--could be based on a fishery utilizing a specific 
gear type or similar fishing practices.
    (v) Social--could be based on fishermen as the unifying element, 
such as when the fishermen pursue different species in a regular pattern 
throughout the year.
    (vi) Ecological--could be based on species that are associated in 
the ecosystem or are dependent on a particular habitat.
    (2) Conservation and management measures. FMPs should include 
conservation and management measures for that part of the management 
unit within U.S. waters, although the Secretary can ordinarily implement 
them only within the EEZ. The measures need not be identical for each 
geographic area within the management unit, if the FMP justifies the 
differences. A management unit may contain, in addition to regulated 
species, stocks of fish for which there is not enough information 
available to specify MSY and OY or to establish management measures, so

[[Page 25]]

that data on these species may be collected under the FMP.
    (e) Analysis. To document that an FMP is as comprehensive as 
practicable, it should include discussions of the following:
    (1) The range and distribution of the stocks, as well as the 
patterns of fishing effort and harvest.
    (2) Alternative management units and reasons for selecting a 
particular one. A less-than-comprehensive management unit may be 
justified if, for example, complementary management exits or is planned 
for a separate geographic area or for a distinct use of the stocks, or 
if the unmanaged portion of the resource is immaterial to proper 
management.
    (3) Management activities and habitat programs of adjacent states 
and their effects on the FMP's objectives and management measures. Where 
state action is necessary to implement measures within state waters to 
achieve FMP objectives, the FMP should identify what state action is 
necessary, discuss the consequences of state inaction or contrary 
action, and make appropriate recommendations. The FMP should also 
discuss the impact that Federal regulations will have on state 
management activities.
    (4) Management activities of other countries having an impact on the 
fishery, and how the FMP's management measures are designed to take into 
account these impacts. International boundaries may be dealt with in 
several ways. For example:
    (i) By limiting the management unit's scope to that portion of the 
stock found in U.S. waters;
    (ii) By estimating MSY for the entire stock and then basing the 
determination of OY for the U.S. fishery on the portion of the stock 
within U.S. waters; or
    (iii) By referring to treaties or cooperative agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 600.325  National Standard 4--Allocations.

    (a) Standard 4. Conservation and management measures shall not 
discriminate between residents of different states. If it becomes 
necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various U.S. 
fishermen, such allocation shall be:
    (1) Fair and equitable to all such fishermen.
    (2) Reasonably calculated to promote conservation.
    (3) Carried out in such manner that no particular individual, 
corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such 
privileges.
    (b) Discrimination among residents of different states. An FMP may 
not differentiate among U.S. citizens, nationals, resident aliens, or 
corporations on the basis of their state of residence. An FMP may not 
incorporate or rely on a state statute or regulation that discriminates 
against residents of another state. Conservation and management measures 
that have different effects on persons in various geographic locations 
are permissible if they satisfy the other guidelines under Standard 4. 
Examples of these precepts are:
    (1) An FMP that restricted fishing in the EEZ to those holding a 
permit from state X would violate Standard 4 if state X issued permits 
only to its own citizens.
    (2) An FMP that closed a spawning ground might disadvantage 
fishermen living in the state closest to it, because they would have to 
travel farther to an open area, but the closure could be justified under 
Standard 4 as a conservation measure with no discriminatory intent.
    (c) Allocation of fishing privileges. An FMP may contain management 
measures that allocate fishing privileges if such measures are necessary 
or helpful in furthering legitimate objectives or in achieving the OY, 
and if the measures conform with paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through 
(c)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (1) Definition. An ``allocation'' or ``assignment'' of fishing 
privileges is a direct and deliberate distribution of the opportunity to 
participate in a fishery among identifiable, discrete user groups or 
individuals. Any management measure (or lack of management) has 
incidental allocative effects, but only those measures that result in 
direct distributions of fishing privileges will be judged against the 
allocation requirements of Standard 4. Adoption of an FMP that merely 
perpetuates existing fishing practices may result in

[[Page 26]]

an allocation, if those practices directly distribute the opportunity to 
participate in the fishery. Allocations of fishing privileges include, 
for example, per-vessel catch limits, quotas by vessel class and gear 
type, different quotas or fishing seasons for recreational and 
commercial fishermen, assignment of ocean areas to different gear users, 
and limitation of permits to a certain number of vessels or fishermen.
    (2) Analysis of allocations. Each FMP should contain a description 
and analysis of the allocations existing in the fishery and of those 
made in the FMP. The effects of eliminating an existing allocation 
system should be examined. Allocation schemes considered, but rejected 
by the Council, should be included in the discussion. The analysis 
should relate the recommended allocations to the FMP's objectives and OY 
specification, and discuss the factors listed in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section.
    (3) Factors in making allocations. An allocation of fishing 
privileges must be fair and equitable, must be reasonably calculated to 
promote conservation, and must avoid excessive shares. These tests are 
explained in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section:
    (i) Fairness and equity. (A) An allocation of fishing privileges 
should be rationally connected to the achievement of OY or with the 
furtherance of a legitimate FMP objective. Inherent in an allocation is 
the advantaging of one group to the detriment of another. The motive for 
making a particular allocation should be justified in terms of the 
objectives of the FMP; otherwise, the disadvantaged user groups or 
individuals would suffer without cause. For instance, an FMP objective 
to preserve the economic status quo cannot be achieved by excluding a 
group of long-time participants in the fishery. On the other hand, there 
is a rational connection between an objective of harvesting shrimp at 
their maximum size and closing a nursery area to trawling.
    (B) An allocation of fishing privileges may impose a hardship on one 
group if it is outweighed by the total benefits received by another 
group or groups. An allocation need not preserve the status quo in the 
fishery to qualify as ``fair and equitable,'' if a restructuring of 
fishing privileges would maximize overall benefits. The Council should 
make an initial estimate of the relative benefits and hardships imposed 
by the allocation, and compare its consequences with those of 
alternative allocation schemes, including the status quo. Where 
relevant, judicial guidance and government policy concerning the rights 
of treaty Indians and aboriginal Americans must be considered in 
determining whether an allocation is fair and equitable.
    (ii) Promotion of conservation. Numerous methods of allocating 
fishing privileges are considered ``conservation and management'' 
measures under section 303 of the Magnuson Act. An allocation scheme may 
promote conservation by encouraging a rational, more easily managed use 
of the resource. Or, it may promote conservation (in the sense of wise 
use) by optimizing the yield, in terms of size, value, market mix, 
price, or economic or social benefit of the product.
    (iii) Avoidance of excessive shares. An allocation scheme must be 
designed to deter any person or other entity from acquiring an excessive 
share of fishing privileges, and to avoid creating conditions fostering 
inordinate control, by buyers or sellers, that would not otherwise 
exist.
    (iv) Other factors. In designing an allocation scheme, a Council 
should consider other factors relevant to the FMP's objectives. Examples 
are economic and social consequences of the scheme, food production, 
consumer interest, dependence on the fishery by present participants and 
coastal communities, efficiency of various types of gear used in the 
fishery, transferability of effort to and impact on other fisheries, 
opportunity for new participants to enter the fishery, and enhancement 
of opportunities for recreational fishing.


<R05>
Sec. 600.330  National Standard 5--Efficiency.

    (a) Standard 5. Conservation and management measures shall, where 
practicable, promote efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources; 
except

[[Page 27]]

that no such measure shall have economic allocation as its sole purpose.
    (b) Efficiency in the utilization of resources--(1) General. The 
term ``utilization'' encompasses harvesting, processing, and marketing, 
since management decisions affect all three sectors of the industry. The 
goal of promoting efficient utilization of fishery resources may 
conflict with other legitimate social or biological objectives of 
fishery management. In encouraging efficient utilization of fishery 
resources, this standard highlights one way that a fishery can 
contribute to the Nation's benefit with the least cost to society: Given 
a set of objectives for the fishery, an FMP should contain management 
measures that result in as efficient a fishery as is practicable or 
desirable.
    (2) Efficiency. In theory, an efficient fishery would harvest the OY 
with the minimum use of economic inputs such as labor, capital, 
interest, and fuel. Efficiency in terms of aggregate costs then becomes 
a conservation objective, where ``conservation'' constitutes wise use of 
all resources involved in the fishery, not just fish stocks.
    (i) In an FMP, management measures may be proposed that allocate 
fish among different groups of individuals or establish a system of 
property rights. Alternative measures examined in searching for an 
efficient outcome will result in different distributions of gains and 
burdens among identifiable user groups. An FMP should demonstrate that 
management measures aimed at efficiency do not simply redistribute gains 
and burdens without an increase in efficiency.
    (ii) Management regimes that allow a fishery to operate at the 
lowest possible cost (e.g., fishing effort, administration, and 
enforcement) for a particular level of catch and initial stock size are 
considered efficient. Restrictive measures that unnecessarily raise any 
of those costs move the regime toward inefficiency. Unless the use of 
inefficient techniques or the creation of redundant fishing capacity 
contributes to the attainment of other social or biological objectives, 
an FMP may not contain management measures that impede the use of cost-
effective techniques of harvesting, processing, or marketing, and should 
avoid creating strong incentives for excessive investment in private 
sector fishing capital and labor.
    (c) Limited access. A ``system for limiting access,'' which is an 
optional measure under section 303(b) of the Magnuson Act, is a type of 
allocation of fishing privileges that may be used to promote economic 
efficiency or conservation. For example, limited access may be used to 
combat overfishing, overcrowding, or overcapitalization in a fishery to 
achieve OY. In an unutilized or underutilized fishery, it may be used to 
reduce the chance that these conditions will adversely affect the 
fishery in the future, or to provide adequate economic return to 
pioneers in a new fishery. In some cases, limited entry is a useful 
ingredient of a conservation scheme, because it facilitates application 
and enforcement of other management measures.
    (1) Definition. Limited access (or limited entry) is a management 
technique that attempts to limit units of effort in a fishery, usually 
for the purpose of reducing economic waste, improving net economic 
return to the fishermen, or capturing economic rent for the benefit of 
the taxpayer or the consumer. Common forms of limited access are 
licensing of vessels, gear, or fishermen to reduce the number of units 
of effort, and dividing the total allowable catch into fishermen's 
quotas (a stock-certificate system). Two forms (i.e., Federal fees for 
licenses or permits in excess of administrative costs, and taxation) are 
not permitted under the Magnuson Act.
    (2) Factors to consider. The Magnuson Act ties the use of limited 
access to the achievement of OY. An FMP that proposes a limited access 
system must consider the factors listed in section 303(b)(6) of the 
Magnuson Act and in Sec. 600.325(c)(3). In addition, it should consider 
the criteria for qualifying for a permit, the nature of the interest 
created, whether to make the permit transferable, and the Magnuson Act's 
limitation on returning economic rent to the public under section 
304(d)(1). The FMP should also discuss the costs of achieving an 
appropriate distribution of fishing privileges.

[[Page 28]]

    (d) Analysis. An FMP should discuss the extent to which 
overcapitalization, congestion, economic waste, and inefficient 
techniques in the fishery reduce the net benefits derived from the 
management unit and prevent the attainment and appropriate allocation of 
OY. It should also explain, in terms of the FMP's objectives, any 
restriction placed on the use of efficient techniques of harvesting, 
processing, or marketing. If, during FMP development, the Council 
considered imposing a limited-entry system, the FMP should analyze the 
Council's decision to recommend or reject limited access as a technique 
to achieve efficient utilization of the resources of the fishing 
industry.
    (e) Economic allocation. This standard prohibits only those measures 
that distribute fishery resources among fishermen on the basis of 
economic factors alone, and that have economic allocation as their only 
purpose. Where conservation and management measures are recommended that 
would change the economic structure of the industry or the economic 
conditions under which the industry operates, the need for such measures 
must be justified in light of the biological, ecological, and social 
objectives of the FMP, as well as the economic objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 600.335  National Standard 6--Variations and Contingencies.

    (a) Standard 6. Conservation and management measures shall take into 
account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, 
fishery resources, and catches.
    (b) Conservation and management. Each fishery exhibits unique 
uncertainties. The phrase ``conservation and management'' implies the 
wise use of fishery resources through a management regime that includes 
some protection against these uncertainties. The particular regime 
chosen must be flexible enough to allow timely response to resource, 
industry, and other national and regional needs. Continual data 
acquisition and analysis will help the development of management 
measures to compensate for variations and to reduce the need for 
substantial buffers. Flexibility in the management regime and the 
regulatory process will aid in responding to contingencies.
    (c) Variations. (1) In fishery management terms, variations arise 
from biological, social, and economic occurrences, as well as from 
fishing practices. Biological uncertainties and lack of knowledge can 
hamper attempts to estimate stock size and strength, stock location in 
time and space, environmental/habitat changes, and ecological 
interactions. Economic uncertainty may involve changes in foreign or 
domestic market conditions, changes in operating costs, drifts toward 
overcapitalization, and economic perturbations caused by changed fishing 
patterns. Changes in fishing practices, such as the introduction of new 
gear, rapid increases or decreases in harvest effort, new fishing 
strategies, and the effects of new management techniques, may also 
create uncertainties. Social changes could involve increases or 
decreases in recreational fishing, or the movement of people into or out 
of fishing activities due to such factors as age or educational 
opportunities.
    (2) Every effort should be made to develop FMPs that discuss and 
take into account these vicissitudes. To the extent practicable, FMPs 
should provide a suitable buffer in favor of conservation. Allowances 
for uncertainties should be factored into the various elements of an 
FMP. Examples are:
    (i) Reduce OY. Lack of scientific knowledge about the condition of a 
stock(s) could be reason to reduce OY.
    (ii) Establish a reserve. Creation of a reserve may compensate for 
uncertainties in estimating domestic harvest, stock conditions, or 
environmental factors.
    (iii) Adjust management techniques. In the absence of adequate data 
to predict the effect of a new regime, and to avoid creating unwanted 
variations, a Council could guard against producing drastic changes in 
fishing patterns, allocations, or practices.
    (iv) Highlight habitat conditions. FMPs may address the impact of 
pollution and the effects of wetland and estuarine degradation on the 
stocks of fish; identify causes of pollution and habitat degradation and 
the authorities having jurisdiction to regulate or influence

[[Page 29]]

such activities; propose recommendations that the Secretary will convey 
to those authorities to alleviate such problems; and state the views of 
the Council on unresolved or anticipated issues.
    (d) Contingencies. Unpredictable events--such as unexpected resource 
surges or failures, fishing effort greater than anticipated, disruptive 
gear conflicts, climatic conditions, or environmental catastrophes--are 
best handled by establishing a flexible management regime that contains 
a range of management options through which it is possible to act 
quickly without amending the FMP or even its regulations.
    (1) The FMP should describe the management options and their 
consequences in the necessary detail to guide the Secretary in 
responding to changed circumstances, so that the Council preserves its 
role as policy-setter for the fishery. The description should enable the 
public to understand what may happen under the flexible regime, and to 
comment on the options.
    (2) FMPs should include criteria for the selection of management 
measures, directions for their application, and mechanisms for timely 
adjustment of management measures comprising the regime. For example, an 
FMP could include criteria that allow the Secretary to open and close 
seasons, close fishing grounds, or make other adjustments in management 
measures.
    (3) Amendment of a flexible FMP would be necessary when 
circumstances in the fishery change substantially, or when a Council 
adopts a different management philosophy and objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 600.340  National Standard 7--Costs and Benefits.

    (a) Standard 7. Conservation and management measures shall, where 
practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.
    (b) Necessity of Federal management--(1) General. The principle that 
not every fishery needs regulation is implicit in this standard. The 
Magnuson Act does not require Councils to prepare FMPs for each and 
every fishery--only for those where regulation would serve some useful 
purpose and where the present or future benefits of regulation would 
justify the costs. For example, the need to collect data about a fishery 
is not, by itself, adequate justification for preparation of an FMP, 
since there are less costly ways to gather the data (see 
Sec. 600.320(d)(2). In some cases, the FMP preparation process itself, 
even if it does not culminate in a document approved by the Secretary, 
can be useful in supplying a basis for management by one or more coastal 
states.
    (2) Criteria. In deciding whether a fishery needs management through 
regulations implementing an FMP, the following general factors should be 
considered, among others:
    (i) The importance of the fishery to the Nation and to the regional 
economy.
    (ii) The condition of the stock or stocks of fish and whether an FMP 
can improve or maintain that condition.
    (iii) The extent to which the fishery could be or is already 
adequately managed by states, by state/Federal programs, by Federal 
regulations pursuant to FMPs or international commissions, or by 
industry self-regulation, consistent with the policies and standards of 
the Magnuson Act.
    (iv) The need to resolve competing interests and conflicts among 
user groups and whether an FMP can further that resolution.
    (v) The economic condition of a fishery and whether an FMP can 
produce more efficient utilization.
    (vi) The needs of a developing fishery, and whether an FMP can 
foster orderly growth.
    (vii) The costs associated with an FMP, balanced against the 
benefits (see paragraph (d) of this section as a guide).
    (c) Alternative management measures. Management measures should not 
impose unnecessary burdens on the economy, on individuals, on private or 
public organizations, or on Federal, state, or local governments. 
Factors such as fuel costs, enforcement costs, or the burdens of 
collecting data may well suggest a preferred alternative.
    (d) Analysis. The supporting analyses for FMPs should demonstrate 
that the benefits of fishery regulation are real and substantial 
relative to the added

[[Page 30]]

research, administrative, and enforcement costs, as well as costs to the 
industry of compliance. In determining the benefits and costs of 
management measures, each management strategy considered and its impacts 
on different user groups in the fishery should be evaluated. This 
requirement need not produce an elaborate, formalistic cost/benefit 
analysis. Rather, an evaluation of effects and costs, especially of 
differences among workable alternatives, including the status quo, is 
adequate. If quantitative estimates are not possible, qualitative 
estimates will suffice.
    (1) Burdens. Management measures should be designed to give 
fishermen the greatest possible freedom of action in conducting business 
and pursuing recreational opportunities that are consistent with 
ensuring wise use of the resources and reducing conflict in the fishery. 
The type and level of burden placed on user groups by the regulations 
need to be identified. Such an examination should include, for example: 
Capital outlays; operating and maintenance costs; reporting costs; 
administrative, enforcement, and information costs; and prices to 
consumers. Management measures may shift costs from one level of 
government to another, from one part of the private sector to another, 
or from the government to the private sector. Redistribution of costs 
through regulations is likely to generate controversy. A discussion of 
these and any other burdens placed on the public through FMP regulations 
should be a part of the FMP's supporting analyses.
    (2) Gains. The relative distribution of gains may change as a result 
of instituting different sets of alternatives, as may the specific type 
of gain. The analysis of benefits should focus on the specific gains 
produced by each alternative set of management measures, including the 
status quo. The benefits to society that result from the alternative 
management measures should be identified, and the level of gain 
assessed.

<R05>
Sec. 600.415  Access to statistics.

    (a) General. In determining whether to grant a request for access to 
confidential data, the following information will be taken into 
consideration (also see Sec. 600.130):
    (1) The specific types of data required.
    (2) The relevance of the data to conservation and management issues.
    (3) The duration of time access will be required: continuous, 
infrequent, or one-time.
    (4) An explanation of why the availability of aggregate or non-
confidential summaries of data from other sources would not satisfy the 
requested needs.
    (b) Federal employees. Statistics submitted as a requirement of an 
FMP and that reveal the identity of the submitter will only be 
accessible to the following:
    (1) Personnel within NMFS responsible for the collection, 
processing, and storage of the statistics.
    (2) Federal employees who are responsible for FMP development, 
monitoring, and enforcement.
    (3) Personnel within NMFS performing research that requires 
confidential statistics.
    (4) Other NOAA personnel on a demonstrable need-to-know basis.
    (5) NOAA/NMFS contractors or grantees who require access to 
confidential statistics to perform functions authorized by a Federal 
contract or grant.
    (c) State personnel. Upon written request, confidential statistics 
will only be accessible if:
    (1) State employees demonstrate a need for confidential statistics 
for use in fishery conservation and management.
    (2) The state has entered into a written agreement between the 
Assistant Administrator and the head of the state's agency that manages 
marine and/or anadromous fisheries. The agreement shall contain a 
finding by the Assistant Administrator that the state has 
confidentiality protection authority comparable to the Magnuson Act and 
that the state will exercise this authority to limit subsequent access 
and use of the data to fishery management and monitoring purposes.
    (d) Councils. Upon written request by the Council Executive 
Director, access to confidential data will be granted to:
    (1) Council employees who are responsible for FMP development and 
monitoring.
    (2) A Council for use by the Council for conservation and management 
purposes, with the approval of the Assistant Administrator. In addition 
to the information described in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Assistant Administrator will consider the following in deciding whether 
to grant access:
    (i) The possibility that Council members might gain personal or 
competitive advantage from access to the data.
    (ii) The possibility that the suppliers of the data would be placed 
at a competitive disadvantage by public disclosure of the data at 
Council meetings or hearings.
    (3) A contractor of the Council for use in such analysis or studies 
necessary for conservation and management purposes, with approval of the 
Assistant Administrator and execution of an agreement with NMFS as 
described by NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 216-100.
    (e) Prohibitions. Persons having access to these data are prohibited 
from unauthorized use or disclosure and are subject to the provisions of 
18 U.S.C. 1905, 16 U.S.C. 1857, and NOAA/NMFS internal procedures, 
including NAO 216-100.


<R05>
Sec. 600.420  Control system.

    (a) The Assistant Administrator maintains a control system to 
protect the identity of submitters of statistics required by an FMP. The 
control system:
    (1) Identifies those persons who have access to the statistics.
    (2) Contains procedures to limit access to confidential data to 
authorized users.
    (3) Provides for safeguarding the data.
    (b) This system requires that all persons who have authorized access 
to the data be informed of the confidentiality of the data. These 
persons are required to sign a statement that they:
    (1) Have been informed that the data are confidential.

[[Page 32]]

    (2) Have reviewed and are familiar with the procedures to protect 
confidential statistics.


<R05>
Sec. 600.425  Release of statistics.

    (a) The Assistant Administrator will not release to the public any 
statistics required to be submitted under an FMP in a form that would 
identify the submitter, except as required by law.

<R04>
                       Subpart F--Foreign Fishing


<R05>
Sec. 600.501  Vessel permits.

    (a) General. (1) Each FFV fishing under the Magnuson Act must have 
on board a permit issued under this section, unless it is engaged only 
in recreational fishing.
    (2) Permits issued under this section do not authorize FFV's or 
persons to harass, capture, or kill marine mammals. No marine mammals 
may be taken in the course of fishing unless that vessel has on board a 
currently valid Authorization Certificate under the MMPA. Regulations 
governing the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing 
operations are contained in 50 CFR part 229 of this title.
    (b) Responsibility of owners and operators. The owners and operators 
of each FFV are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with 
the Magnuson Act, the applicable GIFA, this subpart, and any permit 
issued under the Magnuson Act and this subpart. The owners and operators 
of each FFV bear civil responsibility for the acts of their employees 
and agents constituting violations, regardless of whether the specific 
acts were authorized or even forbidden by the employer or principal, and 
regardless of knowledge concerning the occurrence.
    (c) Activity codes. Permits to fish under a GIFA may be issued by 
the Assistant Administrator for the activities described in this 
paragraph, but the permits may be modified by regulations of this 
subpart, and by the conditions and restrictions attached to the permit 
(see paragraphs (e)(1)(v) and (l) of this section). The Assistant 
Administrator may issue a permit, as appropriate, for one or more of the 
activity codes listed below. The activity codes are described as 
follows:
    (1) Activity Code 1. Catching, scouting, processing, transshipping, 
and supporting foreign vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or 
to be harvested by foreign vessels in the EEZ.
    (2) Activity Code 2. Processing, scouting, transshipping, and 
supporting foreign vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or to 
be harvested by foreign vessels in the EEZ.
    (3) Activity Code 3. Transshipping, scouting, and supporting foreign 
vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or to be harvested by 
foreign vessels in the EEZ.
    (4) Activity Code 4. Processing, scouting, transshipping, and 
supporting U.S. vessels delivering fish to foreign vessels. Activity is 
limited to the receipt of unprocessed fish harvested or to be harvested 
by U.S. vessels.
    (5) Activity Code 5. Transshipping, scouting, and supporting foreign 
vessels. Transshipment limited to fish received or to be received from 
foreign vessels processing fish from U.S. harvesting vessels.
    (6) Activity Code 6. Transshipping, scouting, and supporting U.S. 
vessels. Transshipment limited to U.S.-harvested fish processed on board 
U.S. vessels.
    (7) Activity Code 7. Processing, transshipping, and supporting 
foreign vessels. Activity limited to fish harvested or to be harvested 
by foreign vessels seaward of the EEZ.
    (8) Activity Code 8. Transshipping and supporting foreign vessels. 
Activity is limited to fish harvested or to be harvested seaward of the 
EEZ by foreign vessels or fish duly authorized for processing in the 
internal waters of one of the states.
    (9) Activity Code 9. Supporting U.S. fishing vessels and U.S. fish 
processing

[[Page 33]]

vessels and any foreign fishing vessels authorized under any activity 
code under paragraph (c) of this subpart.
    (d) Application. (1) Applications for FFV permits must be submitted 
by each foreign nation to the DOS. Application forms are available from 
OES/OMC, DOS, Washington, DC. The applicant should allow 90 days for 
review and comment by the public, involved governmental agencies, and 
appropriate Councils, and for processing before the anticipated date to 
begin fishing. The permit application fee must be paid at the time of 
application according to Sec. 600.518.
    (2) Applicants must provide complete and accurate information 
requested on the permit application form.
    (3) Applicants for FFV's that will support U.S. vessels in joint 
ventures (Activity Code 4) must provide the additional information 
specified by the permit application form.
    (4) Each foreign nation may substitute one FFV for another by 
submitting a new vessel information form and a short explanation of the 
reason for the substitution to the DOS. Each substitution is considered 
a new application and a new application fee must be paid. NMFS will 
promptly process an application for a vessel replacing a permitted FFV 
that is disabled or decommissioned, once the DOS has notified the 
appropriate Council(s) of the substituted application.
    (e) Issuance. (1) Permits may be issued to an FFV by the Assistant 
Administrator through the DOS after--
    (i) The Assistant Administrator determines that the fishing 
described in the application will meet the requirements of the Magnuson 
Act and approves the permit application.
    (ii) The foreign nation has paid the fees, including any surcharge 
fees and provided any assurances required by the Secretary in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 600.518.
    (iii) The foreign nation has appointed an agent.
    (iv) The foreign nation has identified a designated representative.
    (v) The general ``conditions and restrictions'' of receiving 
permits, as required by section 204(b)(7) of the Magnuson Act, and any 
``additional restrictions'' attached to the permit for the conservation 
and management of fishery resources or to prevent significant impairment 
of the national defense or security interests, have been accepted by the 
nation issuing the FFV's documents.
    (2) NMFS will distribute blank permit forms to the designated 
representative while the application is being processed. The designated 
representative must ensure that each FFV receives a permit form and must 
accurately transmit the permit form and the contents of the permit to 
the FFV when it is issued. NMFS may authorize the modification and use 
of the previous year's permit forms to be used on an interim basis in 
place of the current year's permit forms if the current forms were not 
made available to the designated representatives for timely 
distribution. The FFV owner or operator must accurately complete the 
permit form prior to fishing in the EEZ.
    (3) A completed permit form must contain--
    (i) The name and IRCS of the FFV and its permit number.
    (ii) The permitted fisheries and activity codes.
    (iii) The date of issuance and expiration date, if other than 
December 31.
    (iv) All conditions and restrictions, and any additional 
restrictions and technical modifications appended to the permit.
    (4) Permits are not issued for boats that are launched from larger 
vessels. Any enforcement action that results from the activities of a 
launched boat will be taken against the permitted vessel.
    (f) Duration. A permit is valid from its date of issuance to its 
date of expiration, unless it is revoked or suspended or the nation 
issuing the FFV's documents does not accept amendments to the permit 
made by the Assistant Administrator in accordance with the procedures of 
paragraph (l) of this section. The permit will be valid for no longer 
than the calendar year in which it was issued.
    (g) Transfer. Permits are not transferable or assignable. A permit 
is valid only for the FFV to which it is issued.
    (h) Display. Each FFV operator must have a properly completed permit 
form

[[Page 34]]

available on board the FFV when engaged in fishing activities and must 
produce it at the request of an authorized officer or observer.
    (i) Suspension and revocation. NMFS may apply sanctions to an FFV's 
permit by revoking, suspending, or imposing additional permit 
restrictions on the permit under 15 CFR part 904, if the vessel is 
involved in the commission of any violation of the Magnuson Act, the 
GIFA, or this subpart; if an agent and a designated representative are 
not maintained in the United States; if a civil penalty or criminal fine 
imposed under the Magnuson Act has become overdue; or as otherwise 
specified in the Magnuson Act.
    (j) Fees. Permit application fees are described in Sec. 600.518.
    (k) Change in application information. (1) The foreign nation must 
report, in writing, any change in the information supplied under 
paragraph (d) of this section to the Assistant Administrator within 15 
calendar days after the date of the change. Failure to report a change 
in the ownership from that described in the current application within 
the specified time frame voids the permit, and all penalties involved 
will accrue to the previous owner.
    (2) The Assistant Administrator may make technical modifications or 
changes in the permit application requested or reported by a Nation, 
such as a change in radio call sign, processing equipment, or tonnage, 
which will be effective immediately.
    (3) If, in the opinion of the Assistant Administrator, a permit 
change requested by a Nation could significantly affect the status of 
any fishery resource, such request will be processed as an application 
for a new permit under this section.
    (4) The Assistant Administrator will notify the designated 
representative of any revision that must be made on the permit form as 
the result of a permit change.
    (5) The vessel owner or operator must record the modification on the 
permit form.
    (l) Permit amendments. (1) The Assistant Administrator may amend a 
permit by adding ``additional restrictions'' for the conservation and 
management of fishery resources covered by the permit, or for the 
national defense or security if the Assistant Administrator determines 
that such interests would be significantly impaired without such 
restrictions. Compliance with the added additional restrictions is a 
condition of the permit. Violations of added additional restrictions 
will be treated as violations of this subpart.
    (2) The Assistant Administrator may make proposed additional 
restrictions effective immediately, if necessary, to prevent substantial 
harm to a fishery resource of the United States, to allow for the 
continuation of ongoing fishing operations, or to allow for fishing to 
begin at the normal time for opening of the fishery.
    (3) The Assistant Administrator will send proposed additional 
restrictions to each Nation whose vessels are affected (via the 
Secretary of State), to the appropriate Councils, and to the Commandant 
of the Coast Guard. NMFS will, at the same time, publish a document of 
any significant proposed additional restrictions in the Federal 
Register. The document will include a summary of the reasons underlying 
the proposal, and the reasons that any proposed additional restrictions 
are made effective immediately.
    (4) The Nation whose vessels are involved, the owners of the 
affected vessels, their representatives, the agencies specified in 
paragraph (l)(3) of this section, and the public may submit written 
comments on the proposed additional restrictions within 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (5) The Assistant Administrator will make a final decision regarding 
the proposed additional restrictions as soon as practicable after the 
end of the comment period. The Assistant Administrator will provide the 
final additional restrictions to the Nation whose vessels are affected 
(via the Secretary of State) according to the procedures of paragraph 
(e) of this section. The Assistant Administrator will include with the 
final additional restrictions to the Nation, a response to comments 
submitted.
    (6) Additional restrictions may be modified by following the 
procedures of paragraphs (l)(2) through (l)(5) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 600.502   Vessel reports.

    (a) The operator of each FFV must report the FFV's activities within 
the EEZ to the USCG and NMFS as specified in this section.
    (b) All reports required by this section must be in English and in 
the formats specified in the permit additions and restrictions. Reports 
must be delivered via private or commercial communications facilities, 
facsimile, or other electronic means acceptable to NMFS and the USCG, 
directly to the appropriate NMFS Region or Center and USCG commander. 
Weekly reports must also be delivered directly to the appropriate NMFS 
Region or Center (see tables 1 and 2 of this section). (The required 
reports may be delivered to the closest USCG communication station as 
indicated in table 3 of this section or other USCG communication station 
only if adequate private or commercial communications facilities have 
not been successfully contacted.) Radio reports must be made via 
radiotelegraphy, Telex, or facsimile where available. For the purposes 
of this section, a message is considered ``transmitted'' when its 
receipt is acknowledged by a communications facility and considered 
``delivered'' upon its receipt by the offices of the appropriate USCG 
commander, NMFS Regional Office, or NMFS Center identified in table 2 of 
this section. Reports required by this section may be submitted by the 
vessel's designated representative; however, the operator of the FFV is 
responsible for the correct and timely filing of all required reports.
    (c) Activity reports. The operator of each FFV must report the FFV's 
movements and activities before or upon the event, as specified in this 
paragraph (c). Appropriate forms, instructions, codes, and examples are 
contained in the conditions and restrictions of the FFV's permit. Each 
FFV report must contain the following information: The message 
identifier ``VESREP'' to indicate it is a vessel activity report, FFV 
name, international radio call sign IRCS, date (month and day based on 
GMT), time (hour and minute GMT), position (latitude and longitude to 
the nearest degree and minute) where required, area (by fishing area 
code) where required, the appropriate action code, confirmation codes 
where required, and the other information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(11) of this section.
    (1) ``BEGIN''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will actually ``BEGIN'' fishing in the EEZ and the 
species (by species code), product (by product code), and quantity of 
all fish and fish products (by product weight to the nearest hundredth 
of a metric ton) on board when entering the EEZ (action code ``BEGIN''). 
The message must be delivered at least 24 hours before the vessel begins 
to fish.
    (2) ``DEPART''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will ``DEPART'' the EEZ to embark or debark an 
observer, to visit a U.S. port, to conduct a joint venture in internal 
waters, or to otherwise temporarily leave an authorized fishing area, 
but not depart the seaward limit of the EEZ (action code ``DEPART''). 
The message must be transmitted before the FFV departs the present 
fishing area and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal.
    (3) ``RETURN''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will ``RETURN'' to the EEZ following a temporary 
departure, and the species (by species code), product (by product code), 
and quantity of all fish and fish products (by product weight to the 
nearest hundredth of a metric ton) on board that were received in a 
joint venture in internal waters (action code ``RETURN''). The message 
must be transmitted before returning to the EEZ and delivered within 24 
hours of its transmittal.
    (4) ``SHIFT''. Each operator must report each SHIFT in fishing area 
(as described for each fishery) by specifying the date, time, and 
position the FFV will start fishing, and the new area (action code 
``SHIFT''). The message must be transmitted before leaving the original 
area and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal. If a foreign 
vessel operates within 20 nautical miles (37.04 km) of a fishing area 
boundary, its operator may submit in one message the shift reports for 
all fishing area shifts occurring during 1 fishing day (0001-2400 GMT). 
This message must be

[[Page 36]]

transmitted prior to the last shift expected to be made in the day and 
delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal.
    (5) ``JV OPS''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area at which the FFV will ``START'' joint venture operations 
(action code ``START JV OPS'') or ``END'' joint venture operations 
(action code ``END JV OPS''). These reports must be made in addition to 
other activity reports made under this section. Each message must be 
transmitted before the event and delivered within 24 hours of its 
transmittal.
    (6) ``TRANSFER''. The operator of each FFV that anticipates a 
transshipping operation in which the FFV will receive fish or fisheries 
products must specify the date, time, position and area the FFV will 
conduct the ``TRANSFER'' and the name and IRCS of the other FFV or U.S. 
vessel involved (action code ``TRANSFER''). The report must include the 
permit activity code under which the transfer will be made. The message 
must be transmitted prior to the transfer and delivered within 24 hours 
of its transmittal. The movement of raw fish from a permitted foreign 
catching vessel or, under an Activity Code 4, from a U.S. fishing vessel 
to the reporting processing vessel and the return of nets or codends is 
not considered a transfer.
    (7) ``OFFLOADED''. Each operator must specify the date, time, 
position, and area the FFV ``OFFLOADED'' fish or fisheries products TO 
another FFV or a U.S. vessel in a transfer, the other FFV's or U.S. 
vessel's name, IRCS, Permit Activity Code under which the transfer was 
made, species (by species code) and quantity of fish and fisheries 
products (by product code and by product weight, to the nearest 
hundredth of a metric ton) offloaded (action code ``OFFLOADED TO''). The 
message must be transmitted within 12 hours after the transfer is 
completed and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal and before 
the FFV ceases fishing in the EEZ.
    (8) ``RECEIVED''. Each operator must specify the date, time, 
position and area the vessel ``RECEIVED'' fish or fisheries products 
FROM another FFV in a transfer, the other FFV's or U.S. vessel's name, 
IRCS, Permit Activity Code under which the receipt was made, species (by 
species code) and quantity of fish and fisheries products (by product 
code and by product weight, to the nearest hundredth of a metric ton) 
received (action code ``RECEIVED FROM''). The message must be 
transmitted within 12 hours after the transfer is completed and 
delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal and before the vessel 
ceases fishing in the EEZ.
    (9) ``CEASE''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will ``CEASE'' fishing in order to leave the EEZ 
(action code ``CEASE''). The message must be delivered at least 24 hours 
before the FFV's departure.
    (10) ``CHANGE''. Each operator must report any ``CHANGE'' TO the 
FFV's operations if the position or time of an event specified in an 
activity report will vary more than 5 nautical miles (9.26 km) or 4 
hours from that previously reported, by sending a revised message 
inserting the word ``CHANGE'' in front of the previous report, repeating 
the name, IRCS, date, and time of the previous report, adding the word 
``TO'' and the complete revised text of the new report (action code 
``CHANGE TO''). Changes to reports specifying an early beginning of 
fishing by an FFV or other changes to reports contained in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section must be transmitted and delivered 
as if the ``CHANGE'' report were the original message.
    (11) ``CANCEL''. Each operator wanting to ``CANCEL'' a previous 
report may do so by sending a revised message, and inserting the word 
``CANCEL'' in front of the previous report's vessel name, IRCS, date, 
time and action code canceled (action code ``CANCEL''). The message must 
be transmitted and delivered prior to the date and time of the event in 
the original message.
    (d) The operator of an FFV will be in violation of paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(9) of this section if the FFV does not pass within 5 
nautical miles (9.26 km) of the position given in the report within 4 
hours of the time given in the report.
    (e) The notices required by this section may be provided for 
individual or

[[Page 37]]

groups of FFV's (on a vessel-by-vessel basis) by authorized persons. An 
FFV operator may retransmit reports on the behalf of another FFV, if 
authorized by that FFV's operator. This does not relieve the individual 
vessel operator of the responsibility of filing required reports. In 
these cases, the message format should be modified so that each line of 
text under ``VESREP'' is a separate vessel report.
    (f) Weekly reports. (1) The operator of each FFV in the EEZ must 
submit appropriate weekly reports through the Nation's designated 
representative. The report must arrive at the address and time specified 
in paragraph (g) of this section. The reports may be sent by facsimile 
or Telex, but a completed copy of the report form must be mailed or hand 
delivered to confirm the Telex. Appropriate forms, instructions, codes, 
and examples are contained in the conditions and restrictions of the 
FFV's permit. Designated representatives may include more than one 
vessel report in a facsimile or Telex message, if the information is 
submitted on a vessel-by-vessel basis. Requests for corrections to 
previous reports must be submitted through the Nation's designated 
representative and mailed or hand-delivered, together with a written 
explanation of the reasons for the errors. The appropriate Regional or 
Science and Research Director may accept or reject any correction and 
initiate any appropriate civil penalty actions.
    (2) Weekly catch report (CATREP). The operator of each FFV must 
submit a weekly catch report stating any catch (Activity Code 1) in 
round weight of each species or species group allocated to that Nation 
by area and days fished in each area for the weekly period Sunday 
through Saturday, GMT, as modified by the fishery in which the FFV is 
engaged. Foreign vessels delivering unsorted, unprocessed fish to a 
processing vessel are not required to submit CATREP's, if that 
processing vessel (Activity Code 2) submits consolidated CATREP's for 
all fish received during each weekly period. No report is required for 
FFV's that do not catch or receive foreign-caught fish during the 
reporting period.
    (3) Weekly receipts report (RECREP). The operator of each FFV must 
submit a weekly report stating any receipts of U.S.-harvested fish in a 
joint venture (Activity Code 4) for the weekly period Sunday through 
Saturday, GMT, as modified by the fishery in which the FFV is engaged, 
for each fishing area, by authorized or prohibited species or species 
group; days fish received; round weight retained or returned to the U.S. 
fishing vessel; number of codends received; and number of vessels 
transferring codends. The report must also include the names of U.S. 
fishing vessels transferring codends during the week. No report is 
required for FFV's that do not receive any U.S.-harvested fish during 
the reporting period.
    (4) Marine mammal report (MAMREP). The operator of each FFV must 
submit a weekly report stating any incidental catch or receipt of marine 
mammals (Activity Codes 1 or 2 and/or 4), the geographical position 
caught, the condition of the animal, number caught (if more than one of 
the same species and condition), and nationality of the catching vessel 
for the period Sunday through Saturday, GMT, as modified by the fishery 
in which the vessel is engaged. Foreign catching vessels delivering 
unsorted, unprocessed fish to processing vessel are not required to 
submit MAMREP's, provided that the processing or factory vessel 
(Activity Code 2) submits consolidated MAMREP's for all fish received 
during each weekly period. FFV's receiving U.S.-harvested fish in a 
joint venture (Activity Code 4) must submit consolidated reports for 
U.S. vessels operating in the joint venture. No report is required for 
FFV's that do not catch or receive marine mammals during the reporting 
period.
    (g) Submission instructions for weekly reports. The designated 
representative for each FFV must submit weekly reports in the prescribed 
format to the appropriate Regional or Science and Research Director of 
NMFS by 1900 GMT on the Wednesday following the end of the reporting 
period. However, by agreement with the appropriate Director, the 
designated representative may submit weekly reports to some other 
facility of NMFS.

Sec. 600.503  Vessel and gear identification.

    (a) Vessel identification. (1) The operator of each FFV assigned an 
IRCS must display that call sign amidships on both the port and 
starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, so that it is visible from an 
enforcement vessel, and on an appropriate weather deck so it is visible 
from the air.
    (2) The operator of each FFV not assigned an IRCS, such as a small 
trawler associated with a mothership or one of a pair of trawlers, must 
display the IRCS of the associated vessel, followed by a numerical 
suffix. (For example, JCZM-1, JCZM-2, etc., would be displayed on small 
trawlers not assigned an IRCS operating with a mothership whose IRCS is 
JCZM; JANP-1 would be displayed by a pair trawler not assigned an IRCS 
operating with a trawler whose IRCS is JANP.)
    (3) The vessel identification must be in a color in contrast to the 
background and must be permanently affixed to the FFV in block Roman 
alphabet letters and Arabic numerals at least 1 m in height for FFV's 
over 20 m in length, and at least 0.5 m in height for all other FFV's.
    (b) Navigational lights and shapes. Each FFV must display the lights 
and shapes prescribed by the International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, 1972 (TIAS 8587, and 1981 amendment TIAS 10672), for 
the activity in which the FFV is engaged (as described at 33 CFR part 
81).
    (c) Gear identification. (1) The operator of each FFV must ensure 
that all deployed fishing gear that is not physically and continuously 
attached to an FFV:
    (i) Is clearly marked at the surface with a buoy displaying the 
vessel identification of the FFV (see paragraph (a) of this section) to 
which the gear belongs.
    (ii) Has attached a light visible for 2 nautical miles (3.70 km) at 
night in good visibility.
    (iii) Has a radio buoy.
    Trawl codends passed from one vessel to another are considered 
continuously attached gear and are not required to be marked.
    (2) The operator of each FFV must ensure that deployed longlines, 
strings of traps or pots, and gillnets are marked at the surface at each 
terminal end with: (see paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this 
section).
    (3) Additional requirements may be specified for the fishery in 
which the vessel is engaged.
    (4) Unmarked or incorrectly identified fishing gear may be 
considered abandoned and may be disposed of in accordance with 
applicable Federal regulations by any authorized officer.
    (d) Maintenance. The operator of each FFV must--
    (1) Keep the vessel and gear identification clearly legible and in 
good repair.
    (2) Ensure that nothing on the FFV obstructs the view of the 
markings from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (3) Ensure that the proper navigational lights and shapes are 
displayed for the FFV's activity and are properly functioning.


<R05>
Sec. 600.504  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) General. (1) The owner, operator, or any person aboard any FFV 
subject to this subpart must immediately comply with instructions and 
signals issued by an authorized officer to stop the FFV; to move the FFV 
to a specified location; and to facilitate safe boarding and inspection 
of the vessel, its gear, equipment, records, and fish and fish products 
on board for purposes of enforcing the Magnuson Act and this subpart.

[[Page 40]]

    (2) The operator of each FFV must provide vessel position or other 
information when requested by an authorized officer within the time 
specified in the request.
    (b) Communications equipment. (1) Each FFV must be equipped with a 
VHF-FM radiotelephone station located so that it may be operated from 
the wheelhouse. Each operator must maintain a continuous listening watch 
on channel 16 (156.8 mHz).
    (2) Each FFV must be equipped with a radiotelephone station capable 
of communicating via 2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephony and at least one set 
of working frequencies identified in table 3 to Sec. 600.502 appropriate 
to the fishery in which the FFV is operating. Each operator must monitor 
and be ready to communicate via 2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone each day 
from 0800 GMT to 0830 GMT and 2000 to 2030 GMT, and in preparation for 
boarding.
    (3) FFV's that are not equipped with processing facilities and that 
deliver all catches to a foreign processing vessel are exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) FFV's with no IRCS that do not catch fish and are used as 
auxiliary vessels to handle codends, nets, equipment, or passengers for 
a processing vessel are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (5) The appropriate Regional Director, with the agreement of the 
appropriate USCG commander, may, upon request by a foreign nation, 
accept alternatives to the radio requirements of this section to certain 
FFV's or types of FFV's operating in a fishery, provided they are 
adequate for the communications needs of the fishery.
    (c) Communications procedures. (1) Upon being approached by a USCG 
vessel or aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized 
officer aboard, the operator of any FFV subject to this subpart must be 
alert for communications conveying enforcement instructions. The 
enforcement unit may communicate by channel 16 VHF-FM radiotelephone, 
2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone, message block from an aircraft, flashing 
light or flag signals from the International Code of Signals, hand 
signal, placard, loudhailer, or other appropriate means. The following 
signals, extracted from the International Code of Signals, are among 
those that may be used.
    (i) ``AA, AA, AA, etc.'', which is the call for an unknown station. 
The signaled vessel should respond by identifying itself or by 
illuminating the vessel identification required by Sec. 600.505.
    (ii) ``RY-CY'', meaning ``You should proceed at slow speed, a boat 
is coming to you''.
    (iii) ``SQ3'', meaning ``You should stop or heave to; I am going to 
board you''.
    (iv) ``L'', meaning ``You should stop your vessel instantly.''
    (2) Failure of an FFV's operator to stop the vessel when directed to 
do so by an authorized officer using VHF-FM radiotelephone (channel 16), 
2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone (where required), message block from an 
aircraft, flashing light signal, flaghoist, or loudhailer constitutes a 
violation of this subpart.
    (3) The operator of or any person aboard an FFV who does not 
understand a signal from an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain 
clarification by radiotelephone or other means must consider the signal 
to be a command to stop the FFV instantly.
    (d) Boarding. The operator of an FFV signaled for boarding must--
    (1) Monitor 2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone and channel 16 (156.8 mHz) 
VHF-FM radiotelephone.
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or maneuver in such a way as to 
maintain the safety of the FFV and facilitate boarding by the authorized 
officer and the boarding party or an observer.
    (3) Provide the authorized officer, boarding party, or observer a 
safe pilot ladder. The operator must ensure the pilot ladder is securely 
attached to the FFV and meets the construction requirements of 
Regulation 17, Chapter V of the International Convention for the Safety 
of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974 (TIAS 9700 and 1978 Protocol, TIAS 10009), 
or a substantially equivalent national standard approved by letter from 
the Assistant Administrator, with agreement with the USCG. Safe pilot 
ladder standards are summarized below:

[[Page 41]]

    (i) The ladder must be of a single length of not more than 9 m (30 
ft), capable of reaching the water from the point of access to the FFV, 
accounting for all conditions of loading and trim of the FFV and for an 
adverse list of 15 deg.. Whenever the distance from sea level to the 
point of access to the ship is more than 9 m (30 ft), access must be by 
means of an accommodation ladder or other safe and convenient means.
    (ii) The steps of the pilot ladder must be--
    (A) Of hardwood, or other material of equivalent properties, made in 
one piece free of knots, having an efficient non-slip surface; the four 
lowest steps may be made of rubber of sufficient strength and stiffness 
or of other suitable material of equivalent characteristics.
    (B) Not less than 480 mm (19 inches) long, 115 mm (4.5 inches) wide, 
and 25 mm (1 inch) in depth, excluding any non-slip device.
    (C) Equally spaced not less than 300 millimeters (12 inches) nor 
more than 380 mm (15 inches) apart and secured in such a manner that 
they will remain horizontal.
    (iii) No pilot ladder may have more than two replacement steps that 
are secured in position by a method different from that used in the 
original construction of the ladder.
    (iv) The side ropes of the ladder must consist of two uncovered 
manila ropes not less than 60 mm (2.25 inches) in circumference on each 
side (or synthetic ropes of equivalent size and equivalent or greater 
strength). Each rope must be continuous, with no joints below the top 
step.
    (v) Battens made of hardwood, or other material of equivalent 
properties, in one piece and not less than 1.80 m (5 ft 10 inches) long 
must be provided at such intervals as will prevent the pilot ladder from 
twisting. The lowest batten must be on the fifth step from the bottom of 
the ladder and the interval between any batten and the next must not 
exceed nine steps.
    (vi) Where passage onto or off the ship is by means of a bulwark 
ladder, two handhold stanchions must be fitted at the point of boarding 
or leaving the FFV not less than 0.70 m (2 ft 3 inches) nor more than 
0.80 m (2 ft 7 inches) apart, not less than 40 mm (2.5 inches) in 
diameter, and must extend not less than 1.20 m (3 ft 11 inches) above 
the top of the bulwark.
    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer or observer, provide a manrope, safety line, and 
illumination for the ladder; and
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to ensure the safety of the

Sec. 600.506   Observers.

    (a) General. To carry out such scientific, compliance monitoring, 
and other functions as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
purposes of the Magnuson Act, the appropriate Regional or Science and 
Research Director (see table 2 to Sec. 600.502) may assign U.S. 
observers to FFV's. Except as provided for in section 201(i)(2) of the 
Magnuson Act, no FFV may conduct fishing operations within the EEZ 
unless a U.S. observer is aboard.
    (b) Effort plan. To ensure the availability of an observer as 
required by this section, the owners and operators of FFV's wanting to 
fish within the EEZ will submit to the appropriate Regional Director or 
Science and Research Director; and also to the Chief, Office of 
Enforcement, NMFS, Silver Spring, MD, a schedule of fishing effort 30 
days prior to the beginning of each quarter. A quarter is a time period 
of 3 consecutive months beginning January 1, April 1, July 1, and 
October 1 of each year. The schedule will contain the name and IRCS of 
each FFV intending to fish within the EEZ during the upcoming quarter, 
and each FFV's expected date of arrival and expected date of departure.
    (1) The appropriate Regional or Science and Research Director must 
be notified immediately of any substitution of vessels or any 
cancellation of plans to fish in the EEZ for FFV's listed in the effort 
plan required by this section.
    (2) If an arrival date of an FFV will vary more than 5 days from the 
date listed in the quarterly schedule, the appropriate Regional or 
Science and Research Director must be notified at least 10 days in 
advance of the rescheduled date of arrival. If the notice required by 
this paragraph (b)(2) is not given, the FFV may not engage in fishing 
until an observer is available and has been placed aboard the vessel or 
the requirement has been waived by the appropriate Regional or Science 
and Research Director.
    (c) Assistance to observers. To assist the observer in the 
accomplishment of his or her assigned duties, the owner and operator of 
an FFV to which an observer is assigned must--
    (1) Provide, at no cost to the observer or the United States, 
accommodations for the observer aboard the FFV that are equivalent to 
those provided to the officers of that vessel.

weigh, or store fish or fish products at any time.
    (6) Allow the observer to inspect and copy the FFV's daily log, 
communications log, transfer log, and any other log, document, notice, 
or record required by these regulations.
    (7) Provide the observer copies of any records required by these 
regulations upon demand.
    (8) Notify the observer at least 15 minutes before fish are brought 
on board or fish or fish products are transferred from the FFV to allow 
sampling the catch or observing the transfer, unless the observer 
specifically requests not to be notified.
    (9) Provide all other reasonable assistance to enable the observer 
to carry out his or her duties.
    (d) Health and safety standards. All foreign fishing vessels to 
which an observer is deployed must maintain, at all times that the 
vessel is in the EEZ, the following:
    (1) At least one working radar.
    (2) Functioning navigation lights as required by international law.
    (3) A watch on the bridge by appropriately trained and experienced

    (e) Observer transfers. (1) The operator of the FFV must ensure that 
transfers of observers at sea via small boat or raft are carried out 
during daylight hours as weather and sea conditions allow, and with the 
agreement of the observer involved. The FFV operator must provide the 
observer 3 hours advance notice of at-sea transfers, so that the 
observer may collect personal belongings, equipment, and scientific 
samples.
    (2) The FFV's involved must provide a safe pilot ladder and conduct 
the transfer according to the procedures of Sec. 600.504(d) to ensure 
the safety of the during the transfer.
    (3) An experienced crew member must assist the observer in the small 
boat or raft in which the transfer is made.
    (f) Supplementary observers. In the event funds are not available 
from Congressional appropriations of fees collected to assign an 
observer to a foreign fishing vessel, the appropriate Regional or 
Science and Research Director will assign a supplementary observer to 
that vessel. The costs of supplementary observers will be paid for

[[Page 45]]

by the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels as provided for 
in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (g) Supplementary observer authority and duties. (1) A supplementary 
observer aboard a foreign fishing vessel has the same authority and must 
be treated in all respects as an observer who is employed by NMFS, 
either directly or under contract.
    (2) The duties of supplementary observers and their deployment and 
work schedules will be specified by the appropriate Regional or Science 
and Research Director.
    (3) All data collected by supplementary observers will be under the 
exclusive control of the Assistant Administrator.
    (h) Supplementary observer payment--(1) Method of payment. The 
owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels must pay directly to the 
contractor the costs of supplementary observer coverage. Payment must be 
made to the contractor supplying supplementary observer coverage either 
by letter of credit or certified check drawn on a federally chartered 
bank in U.S. dollars, or other financial institution acceptable to the 
contractor. The letter of credit used to pay supplementary observer fees 
to contractors must be separate and distinct from the letter of credit 
required by Sec. 600.518(b)(2). Billing schedules will be specified by 
the terms of the contract between NOAA and the contractors. Billings for 
supplementary observer coverage will be approved by the appropriate 
Regional or Science and Research Director and then transmitted to the 
owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels by the appropriate 
designated representative. Each country will have only one designated 
representative to receive observer bills for all vessels of that 
country, except as provided for by the Assistant Administrator. All 
bills must be paid within 10 working days of the billing date. Failure 
to pay an observer bill will constitute grounds to revoke fishing 
permits. All fees collected under this section will be considered 
interim in nature and subject to reconciliation at the end of the fiscal 
year in accordance with paragraph (h)(4) of this section and 
Sec. 600.518(d).
    (2) Contractor costs. The costs charged for supplementary observer 
coverage to the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels may not 
exceed the costs charged to NMFS for the same or similar services, 
except that contractors may charge to the owners and operators of 
foreign fishing vessels an additional fee to cover the administrative 
costs of the program not ordinarily part of contract costs charged to 
NMFS. The costs charged foreign fishermen for supplementary observers 
may include, but are not limited to the following:
    (i) Salary and benefits, including overtime, for supplementary 
observers.
    (ii) The costs of post-certification training required by paragraph 
(j)(2) of this section.
    (iii) The costs of travel, transportation, and per diem associated 
with deploying supplementary observers to foreign fishing vessels 
including the cost of travel, transportation, and per diem from the 
supplementary observer's post of duty to the point of embarkation to the 
foreign fishing vessel, and then from the point of disembarkation to the 
post of duty from where the trip began. For the purposes of these 
regulations, the appropriate Regional or Science and Research Director 
will designate posts of duty for supplementary observers.
    (iv) The costs of travel, transportation, and per diem associated 
with the debriefing following deployment of a supplementary observer by 
NMFS officials.
    (v) The administrative and overhead costs incurred by the contractor 
and, if appropriate, a reasonable profit.
    (3) NMFS costs. The owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels 
must also pay to NMFS as part of the surcharge required by section 
201(i)(4) of the Magnuson Act, the following costs:
    (i) The costs of certifying applicants for the position of 
supplementary observer.
    (ii) The costs of any equipment, including safety equipment, 
sampling equipment, operations manuals, or other texts necessary to 
perform the duties of a supplementary observer. The equipment will be 
specified by the appropriate Regional or Science and

[[Page 46]]

Research Director according to the requirements of the fishery to which 
the supplementary observer will be deployed.
    (iii) The costs associated with communications with supplementary 
observers for transmission of data and routine messages.
    (iv) For the purposes of monitoring the supplementary observer 
program, the costs for the management and analysis of data.
    (v) The costs for data editing and entry.
    (vi) Any costs incurred by NMFS to train, deploy or debrief a 
supplementary observer.
    (vii) The cost for U.S. Customs inspection for supplementary 
observers disembarking after deployment.
    (4) Reconciliation. Fees collected by the contractor in excess of 
the actual costs of supplementary observer coverage will be refunded to 
the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels, or kept on deposit 
to defray the costs of future supplementary observer coverage. Refunds 
will be made within 60 days after final costs are determined and 
approved by NMFS.
    (i) Supplementary observer contractors--(1) Contractor eligibility. 
Supplementary observers will be obtained by NMFS from persons or firms 
having established contracts to provide NMFS with observers. In the 
event no such contract is in place, NMFS will use established, 
competitive contracting procedures to select persons or firms to provide 
supplementary observers. The services supplied by the supplementary 
observer contractors will be as described within the contract and as 
specified below.
    (2) Supplementary observer contractors must submit for the approval 
of the Assistant Administrator the following:
    (i) A copy of any contract, including all attachments, amendments, 
and enclosures thereto, between the contractor and the owners and 
operators of foreign fishing vessels for whom the contractor will 
provide supplementary observer services.
    (ii) All application information for persons whom the contractor 
desires to employ as certified supplementary observers.
    (iii) Billing schedules and billings to the owners and operators of 
foreign fishing vessels for further transmission to the designated 
representative of the appropriate foreign nation.
    (iv) All data on costs.
    (j) Supplementary observers--certification, training--(1) 
Certification. The appropriate Regional or Science and Research Director 
will certify persons as qualified for the position of supplementary 
observer once the following conditions are met:
    (i) The candidate is a citizen or national of the United States.
    (ii) The candidate has education or experience equivalent to the 
education or experience required of persons used as observers by NMFS as 
either Federal personnel or contract employees. The education and 
experience required for certification may vary according to the 
requirements of managing the foreign fishery in which the supplementary 
observer is to be deployed. Documentation of U.S. citizenship or 
nationality, and education or experience will be provided from personal 
qualification statements on file with NMFS contractors who provide 
supplementary observer services, and will not require the submission of 
additional information to NMFS.
    (2) Training. Prior to deployment to foreign fishing vessels, 
certified supplementary observers must also meet the following 
conditions:
    (i) Each certified supplementary observer must satisfactorily 
complete a course of training approved by the appropriate Regional or 
Science and Research Director as equivalent to that received by persons 
used as observers by NMFS as either Federal personnel or contract 
employees. The course of training may vary according to the foreign 
fishery in which the supplementary observer is to be deployed.
    (ii) Each certified supplementary observer must agree in writing to 
abide by standards of conduct as set forth in Department of Commerce 
Administrative Order 202-735 (as provided by the contractor).
    (k) Supplementary observer certification suspension or revocation. 
(1) Certification of a supplementary observer may be suspended or 
revoked by the

[[Page 47]]

Assistant Administrator under the following conditions:
    (i) A supplementary observer fails to perform the duties specified 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (ii) A supplementary observer fails to abide by the standards of 
conduct described by Department of Commerce Administrative Order 202-
735.
    (2) The suspension or revocation of the certification of a 
supplementary observer by the Assistant Administrator may be based on 
the following:
    (i) Boarding inspection reports by authorized officers of the USCG 
or NMFS, or other credible information, that indicate a supplementary 
observer has failed to abide by the established standards of conduct; or
    (ii) An analysis by NMFS of the data collected by a supplementary 
observer indicating improper or incorrect data collection or recording. 
The failure to properly collect or record data is sufficient to justify 
decertification of supplementary observers; no intent to defraud need be 
demonstrated.
    (3) The Assistant Administrator will notify the supplementary 
observer, in writing, of the Assistant Administrator's intent to suspend 
or revoke certification, and the reasons therefor, and provide the 
supplementary observer a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the 
Assistant Administrator determines that there are disputed questions of 
material fact, then the Assistant Administrator may in this respect 
appoint an examiner to make an informal fact-finding inquiry and prepare 
a report and recommendations.

for each authorized species or species group received and product 
produced, that information required in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
    (h) Daily log maintenance. The logs required by paragraphs (e) 
through (g) of this section must be maintained separately for each 
fishery (see table 2 to Sec. 600.502).
    (1) The effort section (all of ``SECTION ONE'') of the daily logs 
must be updated within 2 hours of the hauling or receipt time. The catch 
or receipt by trawl or set (``SECTION TWO'') must be entered within 12 
hours of the hauling or receipt time. The daily and cumulative total 
catch or receipts (``SECTION TWO'') and the production portion 
(``SECTION THREE'') of the log must be updated within 12 hours of the 
end of the day on which the catch was taken. The date of catch is the 
day and time (GMT) the gear is hauled.
    (2) Entries for total daily and cumulative catch or receipt weights 
(disposition ``C'' or ``M'') must be based on the most accurate method 
available to the vessel, either scale round weights or factory weights 
converted to round weights. Entries for daily and cumulative weights of 
discarded or returned fish (disposition ``D'' or ``R'') must be based on 
the most accurate method available to the vessel, either actual count, 
scale round weight, or estimated deck weights. Entries for product 
weights must be based on the number of production units (pans, boxes, 
blocks, trays, cans, or bags) and the average weight of the production 
unit, with reasonable allowances for water added. Allowances for water 
added cannot exceed 5 percent of the unit weight. Product weights cannot 
be based on the commercial or arbitrary wholesale weight of the product, 
but must be based on the total actual weight of the product as 
determined by representative samples.
    (3) The owner or operator must make all entries in indelible ink, 
with corrections to be accomplished by lining out and rewriting, rather 
than erasure.
    (i) Alternative log formats. As an alternative to the use of the 
specific formats provided, a Nation may submit a proposed log format for 
FFV's of that Nation for a general type of fishery operation in a 
fishery (i.e., joint venture operations) to the appropriate Regional 
Director and the USCG commander (see tables 1 and 2 to Sec. 600.502). 
With the agreement of the USCG commander, the Regional Director may 
authorize the use of that log format for vessels of the requesting 
Nation.


<R05>
Sec. 600.508  Fishing operations.

    (a) Catching. Each FFV authorized for activity code 1 may catch 
fish. An FFV may retain its catch of any species or species group for 
which there is an unfilled national allocation. All fish caught will be 
counted against the national allocation, even if the fish are discarded, 
unless exempted by the regulations of the fishery in which the FFV is 
engaged. Catching operations may be conducted as specified by the 
regulations of the fishery in which the FFV is engaged and as modified 
by the FFV's permit.
    (b) Scouting. Each FFV authorized for Activity Codes 1 through 6 may 
scout for fish. Scouting may be conducted only in the fisheries area 
authorized by the scouting vessel's permit and under such other 
circumstances as may be designated in this subpart or the permit.
    (c) Processing. Each FFV with Activity Code 1 or 2 may process fish. 
Processing may only be conducted whenever and wherever catching 
operations for FFV's of that Nation are permitted, whenever and wherever 
joint venture operations are authorized by an FFV's permit under 
Activity Code 4, and under such other circumstances as may be designated 
in this subpart or the permit.
    (d) Support. Each FFV with Activity Codes 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 may 
support other permitted FFV's. Each FFV with Activity Codes 4 or 6 may 
support U.S. vessels. Support operations may be conducted only in the 
fisheries areas authorized by the supporting vessel's permit, and under 
such other circumstances as may be designated in this subpart or the 
permit.
    (e) Joint ventures. Each FFV with Activity Code 4 in addition to 
Activity Codes 1 or 2 may also conduct operations with U.S. fishing 
vessels. These

[[Page 51]]

joint venture operations with U.S. fishing vessels may be conducted 
throughout the EEZ, and under such other circumstances as may be 
designated in these regulations or the permit. FFV's with activity code 
4 may continue operations assisting U.S. fishing vessels, despite 
closures under Sec. 600.511(a).
    (f) Each FFV authorized by the Governor of a state under section 
306(c) of the Magnuson Act may engage in processing and support of U.S. 
fishing vessels within the internal waters of that state in compliance 
with terms and conditions set by the authorizing Governor.


<R05>
Sec. 600.509  Prohibited species.

    (a) The owner or operator of each FFV must minimize its catch or 
receipt of prohibited species.
    (b) After allowing for sampling by an observer (if any), the owner 
or operator of each FFV must sort its catch of fish received as soon as 
possible and return all prohibited species and species parts to the sea 
immediately with a minimum of injury, regardless of condition, unless a 
different procedure is specified by the regulations for the fishery in 
which the FFV is engaged. All prohibited species must be recorded in the 
daily fishing log and other fishing logs as specified by the regulations 
for the fishery in which the FFV is engaged.
    (c) All species of fish that an FFV has not been specifically 
allocated or authorized under this subpart to retain, including fish 
caught or received in excess of any allocation or authorization, are 
prohibited species.
    (d) It is a rebuttable presumption that any prohibited species or 
species part found on board an FFV was caught and retained in violation 
of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 600.510  Gear avoidance and disposal.

    (a) Vessel and gear avoidance. (1) FFV's arriving on fishing grounds 
where fishing vessels are already fishing or have set their gear for 
that purpose must ascertain the position and extent of gear already 
placed in the sea and must not place themselves or their fishing gear so 
as to interfere with or obstruct fishing operations already in progress. 
Vessels using mobile gear must avoid fixed fishing gear.
    (2) The operator of each FFV must maintain on its bridge a current 
plot of broadcast fixed-gear locations for the area in which it is 
fishing, as required by the regulations for the fishery in which the FFV 
is engaged.
    (b) Gear conflicts. The operator of each FFV that is involved in a 
conflict or that retrieves the gear of another vessel must immediately 
notify the appropriate USCG commander identified in tables 1 and 2 to 
Sec. 600.502 and request disposal instructions. Each report must 
include:
    (1) The name of the reporting vessel.
    (2) A description of the incident and articles retrieved, including 
the amount, type of gear, condition, and identification markings.
    (3) The location of the incident.
    (4) The date and time of the incident.
    (c) Disposal of fishing gear and other articles. (1) The operator of 
an FFV in the EEZ may not dump overboard, jettison or otherwise discard 
any article or substance that may interfere with other fishing vessels 
or gear, or that may catch fish or cause damage to any marine resource, 
including marine mammals and birds, except in cases of emergency 
involving the safety of the ship or crew, or as specifically authorized 
by communication from the appropriate USCG commander or other authorized 
officer. These articles and substances include, but are not limited to, 
fishing gear, net scraps, bale straps, plastic bags, oil drums, 
petroleum containers, oil, toxic chemicals or any manmade items 
retrieved in an FFV's gear.
    (2) The operator of an FFV may not abandon fishing gear in the EEZ.
    (3) If these articles or substances are encountered, or in the event 
of accidental or emergency placement into the EEZ, the vessel operator 
must immediately report the incident to the appropriate USCG Commander 
indicated in tables 1 and 2 to Sec. 600.502, and give the information 
required in paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 600.511  Fishery closure procedures.

    (a) Activity Codes 1 and 2 for a fishery are automatically canceled 
in the following cases, unless otherwise specified by regulations 
specific to a fishery, when--

[[Page 52]]

    (1) The OY for any allocated species or species group has been 
reached in that fishery;
    (2) The TALFF or catch allowance for any allocated species or 
species group has been reached in that fishery;
    (3) The foreign nation's allocation for any allocated species or 
species group has been reached; or
    (4) The letter of credit required in Sec. 600.518(b)(2) is not 
established and maintained.
    (b) Activity Code 4 is automatically canceled when--
    (1) The OY for a species with a JVP amount is reached;
    (2) The JVP amount for a species or species group is reached; or
    (3) The letter of credit required in Sec. 600.518(b)(2) is not 
established and maintained.
    (c) Notification. (1) The Regional Director is authorized to close a 
fishery on behalf of NMFS. The Regional Director will notify each FFV's 
designated representative of closures.
    (2) If possible, notice will be given 48 hours before the closure. 
However, each Nation and the owners and operators of all FFV's of that 
Nation are responsible for ending fishing operations when an allocation 
is reached.
    (d) Catch reconciliation. Vessel activity reports, U.S. surveillance 
observations, observer reports, and foreign catch and effort reports 
will be used to make the determination listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section. If NMFS estimates of catch or other values made during 
the season differ from those reported by the foreign fleets, efforts may 
be initiated by the designated representative of each Nation to resolve 
such differences with NMFS. If, however, differences still persist after 
such efforts have been made, NMFS estimates will be the basis for 
decisions and will prevail.
    (e) Duration. Any closure under this section will remain in effect 
until an applicable new or increased allocation or JVP becomes available 
or the letter of credit required by Sec. 600.518(b)(2) is reestablished.


<R05>
Sec. 600.512  Scientific research.

    (a) Scientific research activity. Persons planning to conduct 
scientific research activities in the EEZ that may be confused with 
fishing are encouraged to submit to the appropriate Regional Director, 
Director, or designee, 60 days or as soon as practicable prior to its 
start, a scientific research plan for each scientific cruise. The 
Regional Director, Director, or designee will acknowledge notification 
of scientific research activity by issuing to the operator or master of 
that vessel, or to the sponsoring institution, a letter of 
acknowledgment. This letter of acknowledgment is separate and distinct 
from any permit required under any other applicable law. If the Regional 
Director, Director, or designee, after review of a research plan, 
determines that it does not constitute scientific research activity, but 
rather fishing, the Regional Director, Director, or designee will inform 
the applicant as soon as practicable and in writing. The Regional 
Director, Director, or designee may also make recommendations to revise 
the research plan to make the cruise acceptable as scientific research 
activity. In order to facilitate identification of activity as 
scientific research, persons conducting scientific research activities 
are advised to carry a copy of the scientific research plan and the 
letter of acknowledgment on board the scientific research vessel. 
Activities conducted in accordance with a scientific research plan 
acknowledged by such a letter are presumed to be scientific research 
activities. The presumption may be overcome by showing that an activity 
does not fit the definition of scientific research activity or is 
outside the scope of the scientific research plan.
    (b) Reports. Persons conducting scientific research are requested to 
submit a copy of any cruise report or other publication created as a 
result of the cruise, including the amount, composition, and disposition 
of their catch, to the appropriate Science and Research Director.


<R05>
Sec. 600.513  Recreational fishing.

    (a) Foreign vessels conducting recreational fishing must comply only 
with this section, and Secs. 600.10, 600.504(a)(1), and 600.505 (as 
applicable). Such vessels may conduct recreational fishing within the 
EEZ and within the

[[Page 53]]

boundaries of a state. Any fish caught may not be sold, bartered, or 
traded.
    (b) The owners or operator and any other person aboard any foreign 
vessel conducting recreational fishing must comply with any Federal laws 
or regulations applicable to the domestic fishery while in the EEZ, and 
any state laws or regulations applicable while in state waters.


<R05>
Sec. 600.514   Relation to other laws.

    (a) Persons affected by these regulations should be aware that other 
Federal and state statutes may apply to their activities.
    (b) Fishing vessel operators must exercise due care in the conduct 
of fishing activities near submarine cables. Damage to submarine cables 
resulting from intentional acts or from the failure to exercise due care 
in the conduct of fishing operations subjects the fishing vessel 
operator to enforcement action under the International Convention for 
the Protection of Submarine Cables, and to the criminal penalties 
prescribed by the Submarine Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 21) and other laws that 
implement that Convention. Fishing vessel operators also should be aware 
that the Submarine Cable Act prohibits fishing operations at a distance 
of less than 1 nautical mile (1.85 km) from a vessel engaged in laying 
or repairing a submarine cable; or at a distance of less than 0.25 
nautical mile (0.46 km) from a buoy or buoys intended to mark the 
position of a cable when being laid, or when out of order, or broken.


<R05>
Sec. 600.515   Interpretation of 16 U.S.C. 1857(4).

    Section 307(4) of the Magnuson Act prohibits any fishing vessel 
other than a vessel of the United States (foreign fishing vessel) from 
operating in the EEZ if all of the fishing gear on board the vessel is 
not stowed in compliance with that section ``unless such vessel is 
authorized to engage in fishing in the area in which the vessel is 
operating.'' If such a vessel has a permit authorization that is limited 
to fishing activities other than catching, taking or harvesting (such as 
support, scouting or processing activities), it must have all of its 
fishing gear stowed at all times while it is in the EEZ. If such a 
vessel has a permit authorization to engage in catching, taking or 
harvesting activities, but such authorization is limited to a specific 
area within the EEZ, and/or to a specific period of time, the vessel 
must have all of its fishing gear stowed while it is in the EEZ, except 
when it is in the specific area authorized, and/or during the specific 
period of time authorized.


<R05>
Sec. 600.516   Total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF).

    (a) The TALFF, if any, with respect to any fishery subject to the 
exclusive fishery management authority of the United States, is that 
portion of the OY of such fishery that will not be caught by vessels of 
the United States.
    (b) Each specification of OY and each assessment of the anticipated 
U.S. harvest will be reviewed during each fishing season. Adjustments to 
TALFF's will be made based on updated information relating to status of 
stocks, estimated and actual performance of domestic and foreign fleets, 
and other relevant factors.
    (c) Specifications of OY and the initial estimates of U.S. harvests 
and TALFF's at the beginning of the relevant fishing year will be 
published in the Federal Register. Adjustments to those numbers will be 
published in the Federal Register upon occasion or as directed by 
regulations implementing FMPs. For current apportionments, contact the 
appropriate Regional Director or the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 600.517   Allocations.

    The Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, 
determines the allocation among foreign nations of fish species and 
species groups. The Secretary of State officially notifies each foreign 
nation of its allocation. The burden of ascertaining and accurately 
transmitting current allocations and status of harvest of an applicable 
allocation to fishing vessels is upon the foreign nation and the owner 
or operator of the FFV.


<R05>
Sec. 600.518   Fee schedule for foreign fishing.

    (a) Permit application fees. Each vessel permit application 
submitted under Sec. 600.501 must be accompanied by a fee

[[Page 54]]

of $354 per vessel, plus the surcharge, if required under paragraph (e) 
of this section, rounded to the nearest dollar. At the time the 
application is submitted to the DOS, a check for the fees, drawn on a 
U.S. bank, made out to ``Department of Commerce, NOAA,'' must be sent to 
the Director. The permit fee payment must be accompanied by a list of 
the vessels for which the payment is made.
    (b) Poundage fees--(1) Rates. If a Nation chooses to accept an 
allocation, poundage fees must be paid at the rate specified in the 
following table, plus the surcharge required by paragraph (c) of this 
section.

                    Table--Species and Poundage Fees

  7. Squid, Illex............................................     103.98
  8. Squid, Loligo...........................................     245.73
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Method of payment of poundage fees, surcharges and observer 
fees. (i) If a Nation chooses to accept an allocation, a revolving 
letter of credit (L/C) must be established and maintained to cover the 
poundage fees for at least 25 percent of the previous year's total 
allocations at the rate in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or as 
determined by the Assistant Administrator, plus the surcharges and 
observer fees required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The L/
C must--
    (A) Be irrevocable.
    (B) Be with a bank subscribing to ICC Pub. 290.
    (C) Designate ``Department of Commerce, NOAA'' as beneficiary;
    (D) Allow partial withdrawals.
    (E) Be confirmed by a U.S. bank.
    (ii) The customer must pay all commissions, transmission, and 
service charges. No fishing will be allowed until the L/C is 
established, and authorized written notice of its issuance is provided 
to the Assistant Administrator.
    (3) Assessment of poundage fees. Poundage fees will be assessed 
quarterly for the actual catch during January through March, April 
through June, July through September, and October through December. The 
appropriate Regional Director will reconcile catch figures with each 
country following the procedures of Sec. 600.511(d). When the catch 
figures are agreed upon, NOAA will present a bill for collection as the 
documentary demand for payment to the confirming bank. If, after 45 days 
from the end of the quarter, catches have not been reconciled, the 
estimate of the Regional Director will stand and a bill will be issued 
for that amount. If necessary, the catch figures may be refined by the 
Regional Director during the next 60 days, and any modifications will be 
reflected in the next quarter's bill.
    (c) Surcharges. The owner or operator of each foreign vessel who 
accepts and pays permit application or poundage fees under paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section must also pay a surcharge. The Assistant 
Administrator may reduce or waive the surcharge if it is determined that 
the Fishing Vessel and Gear Damage Compensation Fund is capitalized 
sufficiently. The Assistant Administrator also may increase the 
surcharge during the year to a maximum level of 20 percent, if needed, 
to maintain capitalization of the fund. The Assistant Administrator has 
effectively waived the surcharge until further notice.
    (d) Observer fees. The Assistant Administrator will notify the 
owners or operators of FFV's of the estimated annual costs of placing 
observers aboard their vessels. The owners or operators of any such 
vessel must provide for repayment of those costs by including one-fourth 
of the estimated annual observer fee as determined by the Assistant 
Administrator in a L/C as prescribed in Sec. 600.518(b)(2). During the 
fiscal year, payment will be withdrawn from the L/C as required to cover 
anticipated observer coverage for the upcoming fishery. The Assistant 
Administrator will reconcile any differences between the estimated cost 
and actual costs of observer coverage within 90 days after the end of 
the fiscal year.
    (e) Financial assurances. (1) A foreign nation, or the owners and 
operators of certain vessels of that foreign nation,

[[Page 55]]

may be required by the Assistant Administrator to provide financial 
assurances. Such assurances may be required if--
    (i) Civil and criminal penalties assessed against fishing vessels of 
the Nation have not effectively deterred violations;
    (ii) Vessels of that Nation have engaged in fishing in the EEZ 
without proper authorization to conduct such activities;
    (iii) The Nation's vessel owners have refused to answer 
administrative charges or summons to appear in court; or
    (iv) Enforcement of Magnuson Act civil or criminal judgments in the 
courts of a foreign nation is unattainable.
    (2) The level of financial assurances will be guided by the level of 
penalties assessed and costs to the U.S. Government.


<R05>
Sec. 600.520  Northwest Atlantic Ocean fishery.

    (a) Purpose. Sections 600.520 and 600.525 regulate all foreign 
fishing conducted under a GIFA within the EEZ in the Atlantic Ocean 
north of 35 deg.00' N. lat.
    (b) Authorized fishery--(1) Allocations. Foreign vessels may engage 
in fishing only in accordance with applicable national allocations.
    (2) Time and area restrictions. (i) Fishing, including processing, 
scouting, and support of foreign or U.S. vessels, is prohibited south of 
35 deg.00' N. lat., and north and east of a line beginning at the shore 
at 44 deg.22' N. lat., 67 deg.52' W. long. and intersecting the boundary 
of the EEZ at 44 deg.11'12'' N. lat., 67 deg.16'46'' W. long.
    (ii) The Regional Director will consult with the Council prior to 
giving notice of any area or time restriction. NMFS will also consult 
with the USCG if the restriction is proposed to reduce gear conflicts. 
If NMFS determines after such consultation that the restriction appears 
to be appropriate, NMFS will publish the proposed restriction in the 
Federal Register, together with a summary of the information on which 
the restriction is based. Following a 30-day comment period, NMFS will 
publish a final action.
    (iii) The Regional Director may rescind any restriction if he/she 
determines that the basis for the restriction no longer exists.
    (iv) Any notice of restriction shall operate as a condition imposed 
on the permit issued to the foreign vessels involved in the fishery.
    (3) TALFF. The TALFFs for the fisheries of the Northwest Atlantic 
Ocean are published in the Federal Register. Current TALFFs are also 
available from the Regional Director.
    (4) Species definitions. The category ``other finfish'' used in 
TALFFs and in allocations includes all species except:
    (i) The other allocated species, namely: Short-finned squid, long-
finned squid, Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, river herring 
(includes alewife, blueback herring, and hickory shad), and butterfish.
    (ii) The prohibited species, namely: American plaice, American shad, 
Atlantic cod, Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic redfish, Atlantic salmon, all 
marlin, all spearfish, sailfish, swordfish, black sea bass, bluefish, 
croaker, haddock, ocean pout, pollock, red hake, scup, sea turtles, 
sharks (except dogfish), silver hake, spot, striped bass, summer 
flounder, tilefish, yellowtail flounder, weakfish, white hake, 
windowpane flounder, winter flounder, witch flounder, Continental Shelf 
fishery resources, and other invertebrates (except nonallocated squids).
    (5) Closures. The taking of any species for which a Nation has an 
allocation is permitted, provided that:
    (i) The vessels of the foreign nation have not caught the allocation 
of that Nation for any species or species group (e.g., ``other 
finfish''). When vessels of a foreign nation have caught an applicable 
allocation of any species, all further fishing other than scouting, 
processing, or support by vessels of that Nation must cease, even if 
other allocations have not been reached. Therefore, it is essential that 
foreign nations plan their fishing strategy to ensure that the reaching 
of an allocation for one species does not result in the premature 
closing of a Nation's fishery for other allocated species.
    (ii) The fishery has not been closed for other reasons under 
Sec. 600.511.

[[Page 56]]

    (6) Allocation utilization. Foreign fishing vessels may elect to 
retain or discard allocated species; however, the computation of 
allocation utilization and fee refunds will be based on the total 
quantity of that species that was caught. Prohibited species must always 
be returned to the sea as required under Sec. 600.509.
    (c) Fishing areas. For the purposes of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean 
fishery, fishing areas are that portion of the EEZ shown inside the 
boundaries of the ``three digit statistical areas'' described in Figure 
1 to this section.

Sec. 600.525  Atlantic herring fishery.

    (a) Initial specifications. The initial specifications of OY, DAH, 
DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserve (if any) have been established by the PMP 
for Atlantic herring approved on July 6, 1995. These annual 
specifications will remain in effect unless adjusted pursuant to the 
provisions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Procedures to adjust initial specifications. NMFS may adjust 
these initial specifications upward or downward to produce the greatest 
overall benefit to the United States at any time prior to or during the 
fishing years for which the initial specifications are set by publishing 
notification in the Federal Register with the reasons for such 
adjustments. Any notice of adjustment may provide for public comment. 
Adjustments to the initial specifications may take into account the 
following information:
    (1) The estimated domestic processing capacity and extent to which 
it will be used.;
    (2) Landings and catch statistics.;
    (3) Stock assessments.
    (4) Relevant scientific information.


<R04>
      Subpart G--Preemption of State Authority Under Section 306(b)


<R05>
Sec. 600.605  General policy.

    It is the policy of the Secretary that preemption proceedings will 
be conducted expeditiously. The administrative law judge and counsel or 
other representative for each party are encouraged to make every effort 
at each stage of the proceedings to avoid delay.


<R05>
Sec. 600.610  Factual findings for Federal preemption.

    (a) The two factual findings for Federal preemption of state 
management authority over a fishery are:
    (1) The fishing in a fishery that is covered by an FMP implemented 
under the Magnuson Act is engaged in predominately within the EEZ and 
beyond such zone.
    (2) A state has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, the 
results of which will substantially and adversely affect the carrying 
out of such FMP.
    (b) Whether fishing is engaged in ``predominately'' within or beyond 
the EEZ will be determined after consideration of relevant factors, 
including but not limited to, the catch (based on numbers, value, or 
weight of fish caught, or other relevant factors) or fishing effort 
during the appropriate period, and in light of historical patterns of 
the distribution of catch or fishing effort for such stock or stocks of 
fish.
     (c) Whether relevant effects are substantial will be determined 
after consideration of the magnitude of such actual or potential 
effects. Relevant to this determination are various factors, including 
but not limited to, the proportion of the fishery (stock or stocks of 
fish and fishing for such stocks) that is subject to the effects of a 
particular state's action or omission, the characteristics and status 
(including migratory patterns and biological condition) of the stock or 
stocks of fish in the fishery, and the similarity or dissimilarity 
between the goals, objectives, or policies of the state's action or 
omission and the management goals or objectives specified in the FMP for 
the fishery or between the state and Federal conservation and management 
measures of the fishery.


<R05>
Sec. 600.615  Commencement of proceedings.

    (a) Notice of proposed preemption. (1) If a proceeding under this 
part is deemed necessary, the Administrator must issue a notice of 
proposed preemption to the Attorney General of the State or States 
concerned. The notice will contain:
    (i) A recital of the legal authority and jurisdiction for 
instituting the proceeding.
    (ii) A concise statement of the Sec. 600.610 factual findings for 
Federal preemption upon which the notice is based.
    (iii) The time, place, and date of the hearing.
    (2) The notice of proposed preemption will also be published in the 
Federal Register. This notification may be combined with any notice of 
proposed rulemaking published under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

[[Page 59]]

    (b) Response. The state will have the opportunity to respond in 
writing to the notice of proposed preemption.
    (c) Amendment. The Administrator may, at any time prior to the 
Secretary's decision, withdraw the notice of proposed preemption. Upon 
motion of either party before the record is closed, the administrative 
law judge may amend the notice of proposed preemption.
    (d) Proposed regulations--(1) In general. If additional regulations 
are required to govern fishing within the boundaries of a state, the 
Administrator may publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register 
concurrently with issuing the notification indicated in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (2) Emergency actions. Nothing in this section will prevent the 
Secretary from taking emergency action under section 305(e) of the 
Magnuson Act.


<R05>
Sec. 600.620  Rules pertaining to the hearing.

    (a) The civil procedure rules of the NOAA currently set forth in 15 
CFR part 904, subpart C (or as subsequently amended), apply to the 
proceeding after its commencement by service of notice (pursuant to 
Sec. 600.615) and prior to the Secretary's decision (Sec. 600.625), 
except that the following sections will not apply:
    (1) 15 CFR 904.201 (Definitions);
    (2) 15 CFR 904.206(a)(1) (Duties and powers of Judge); and
    (3) 15 CFR 904.272 (Administrative review of decision).
    (b) Additional duties and powers of judge--(1) Time periods. The 
administrative law judge is authorized to modify all time periods 
pertaining to the course of the hearing (under Secs. 600.615 and 
600.620) to expedite the proceedings, upon application and appropriate 
showing of need or emergency circumstances by a party.
    (2) Intervention. Intervention by persons not parties is not 
allowed.


<R05>
Sec. 600.625  Secretary's decision.

    (a) The Secretary will, on the basis of the hearing, record the 
administrative law judge's recommended decision:
    (1) Accept or reject any of the findings or conclusions of the 
administrative law judge and decide whether the factual findings exist 
for Federal preemption of a state's authority within its boundaries 
(other than in its internal waters) with respect to the fishery in 
question;
    (2) Reserve decision on the merits or withdraw the notice of 
proposed preemption; or
    (3) Remand the case to the administrative law judge for further 
proceedings as may be appropriate, along with a statement of reasons for 
the remand.
    (b) Notification. (1) If the factual findings for Federal preemption 
are determined to exist, the Secretary will notify in writing the 
Attorney General of that state and the appropriate Council(s) of the 
preemption of that state's authority. The Secretary will also direct the 
Administrator to promulgate appropriate regulations proposed under 
Sec. 600.615(d) and otherwise to begin regulating the fishery within the 
state's boundaries (other than in its internal waters).
    (2) If the factual findings for Federal preemption are determined 
not to exist, the Secretary will notify, in writing, the Attorney 
General of the state and the appropriate Council(s) of that 
determination. The Secretary will also direct the Administrator to issue 
a notice withdrawing any regulations proposed under Sec. 600.615(d).


<R05>
Sec. 600.630  Application for reinstatement of state authority.

    (a) Application or notice. (1) At any time after the promulgation of 
regulations under Sec. 600.625(b)(1) to regulate a fishery within a 
state's boundaries, the affected state may apply to the Secretary for 
reinstatement of state authority. The Secretary may also serve upon such 
state a notice of intent to terminate such Federal regulation. A state's 
application must include a clear and concise statement of:
    (i) The action taken by the State to correct the action or omission 
found to have substantially and adversely affected the carrying out of 
the FMP; or
    (ii) Any changed circumstances that affect the relationship of the 
state's action or omission to take action to the carrying out of the FMP 
(including any amendment to such plan); and

[[Page 60]]

    (iii) Any laws, regulations, or other materials that the state 
believes support the application.
    (2) Any such application received by the Secretary or notice issued 
to the State will be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Informal response. The Secretary has sole discretion to accept 
or reject the application or response. If the Secretary accepts the 
application or rejects any responses and finds that the reasons for 
regulation of the fishery within the boundaries of the state no longer 
prevail, the Secretary will promptly terminate such regulation and 
publish in the Federal Register any regulatory amendments necessary to 
accomplish that end.
    (c) Hearing. The Secretary has sole discretion to direct the 
Administrator to schedule hearings for the receipt of evidence by an 
administrative law judge. Hearings before the administrative law judge 
to receive such evidence will be conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 600.620. Upon conclusion of such hearings, the administrative law 
judge will certify the record and a recommended decision to the 
Secretary. If the Secretary, upon consideration of the state's 
application or any response to the notice published under 
Sec. 600.630(a)(2), the hearing record, the recommended decision, and 
any other relevant materials finds that the reasons for regulation of 
the fishery within the boundaries of the state no longer prevail, the 
Secretary will promptly terminate such regulation and publish in the 
Federal Register any regulatory amendments necessary to accomplish that 
end.


<R04>
          Subpart H--General Provisions for Domestic Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 600.705  Relation to other laws.

    (a) General. Persons affected by these regulations should be aware 
that other Federal and state statutes and regulations may apply to their 
activities. Vessel operators may wish to refer to USCG regulations found 
in the Code of Federal Regulations title 33--Navigation and Navigable 
Waters and 46--Shipping; 15 CFR part 904, subpart D--Permit Sanctions 
and Denials; and title 43--Public Lands (in regard to marine 
sanctuaries).
    (b) State responsibilities. Certain responsibilities relating to 
data collection and enforcement may be performed by authorized state 
personnel under a state/Federal agreement for data collection and a 
tripartite agreement among the state, the USCG, and the Secretary for 
enforcement.
    (c) Submarine cables. Fishing vessel operators must exercise due 
care in the conduct of fishing activities near submarine cables. Damage 
to the submarine cables resulting from intentional acts or from the 
failure to exercise due care in the conduct of fishing operations 
subjects the fishing vessel operator to the criminal penalties 
prescribed by the Submarine Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 21) which implements 
the International Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables. 
Fishing vessel operators also should be aware that the Submarine Cable 
Act prohibits fishing operations at a distance of less than 1 nautical 
mile (1.85 km) from a vessel engaged in laying or repairing a submarine 
cable; or at a distance of less than 0.25 nautical mile (0.46 km) from a 
buoy or buoys intended to mark the position of a cable when being laid 
or when out of order or broken.
    (d) Marine mammals. Regulations governing exemption permits and the 
recordkeeping and reporting of the incidental take of marine mammals are 
set forth in part 229 of this title.
    (e) Halibut fishing. Fishing for halibut is governed by regulations 
of the International Pacific Halibut Commission set forth at part 300 of 
this title.
    (f) Marine sanctuaries. All fishing activity, regardless of species 
sought, is prohibited under 15 CFR part 924 in the U.S.S. Monitor Marine 
Sanctuary, which is located approximately 15 miles southwest of Cape 
Hatteras off the coast of North Carolina.


<R05>
Sec. 600.710  Permits.

    Regulations pertaining to permits required for certain fisheries are 
set forth in the parts of this chapter governing those fisheries.

[[Page 61]]


<R05>
Sec. 600.715  Recordkeeping and reporting.

    Regulations pertaining to records and reports required for certain 
fisheries are set forth in the parts of this chapter governing those 
fisheries.


<R05>
Sec. 600.720  Vessel and gear identification.

    Regulations pertaining to special vessel and gear markings required 
for certain fisheries are set forth in the parts of this chapter 
governing those fisheries.


<R05>
Sec. 600.725  General prohibitions.

    It is unlawful for any person to do any of the following:
    (a) Possess, have custody or control of, ship, transport, offer for 
sale, sell, purchase, land, import, or export, any fish or parts thereof 
taken or retained in violation of the Magnuson Act or any other statute 
administered by NOAA and/or any regulation or permit issued under the 
Magnuson Act.
    (b) Transfer or attempt to transfer, directly or indirectly, any 
U.S.-harvested fish to any foreign fishing vessel, while such vessel is 
in the EEZ, unless the foreign fishing vessel has been issued a permit 
under section 204 of the Magnuson Act, which authorizes the receipt by 
such vessel of U.S.- harvested fish.
    (c) Fail to comply immediately with enforcement and boarding 
procedures specified in Sec. 600.730.
    (d) Refuse to allow an authorized officer to board a fishing vessel 
or to enter areas of custody for purposes of conducting any search, 
inspection, or seizure in connection with the enforcement of the 
Magnuson Act or any other statute administered by NOAA.
    (e) Dispose of fish or parts thereof or other matter in any manner, 
after any communication or signal from an authorized officer, or after 
the approach by an authorized officer or an enforcement vessel or 
aircraft.
    (f) Assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, threaten, or 
interfere with any authorized officer in the conduct of any search, 
inspection, or seizure in connection with enforcement of the Magnuson 
Act or any other statute administered by NOAA.
    (g) Interfere with, delay, or prevent by any means, the apprehension 
of another person, knowing that such person has committed any act 
prohibited by the Magnuson Act or any other statute administered by 
NOAA.
    (h) Resist a lawful arrest for any act prohibited under the Magnuson 
Act or any other statute administered by NOAA.
    (i) Make any false statement, oral or written, to an authorized 
officer concerning the taking, catching, harvesting, landing, purchase, 
sale, offer of sale, possession, transport, import, export, or transfer 
of any fish, or attempts to do any of the above.
    (j) Interfere with, obstruct, delay, or prevent by any means an 
investigation, search, seizure, or disposition of seized property in 
connection with enforcement of the Magnuson Act or any other statute 
administered by NOAA.
    (k) Fish in violation of the terms or conditions of any permit or 
authorization issued under the Magnuson Act or any other statute 
administered by NOAA.
    (l) Fail to report catches as required while fishing pursuant to an 
exempted fishing permit.
    (m) On a scientific research vessel, engage in fishing other than 
recreational fishing authorized by applicable state or Federal 
regulations.
    (n) Trade, barter, or sell; or attempt to trade, barter, or sell 
fish possessed or retained while fishing pursuant to an authorization 
for an exempted educational activity.
    (o) Harass or sexually harass an authorized officer or an observer.
    (p) It is prohibited to violate any other provision of this part, 
the Magnuson Act or any other statute administered by NOAA, any notice 
issued under this part, or any other regulation promulgated under the 
Magnuson Act or any other statute administered by NOAA.


<R05>
Sec. 600.730  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) General. The operator of, or any other person aboard, any 
fishing vessel subject to parts 622 through 699 of this chapter must 
immediately comply with instructions and signals issued by an authorized 
officer to stop the vessel and with instructions to facilitate safe

[[Page 62]]

boarding and inspection of the vessel, its gear, equipment, fishing 
record (where applicable), and catch for purposes of enforcing the 
Magnuson Act or any other statute administered by NOAA and this chapter.
    (b) Communications. (1) Upon being approached by a USCG vessel or 
aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized officer aboard, 
the operator of a fishing vessel must be alert for communications 
conveying enforcement instructions.
    (2) VHF-FM radiotelephone is the preferred method for communicating 
between vessels. If the size of the vessel and the wind, sea, and 
visibility conditions allow, a loudhailer may be used instead of the 
radio. Hand signals, placards, high frequency radiotelephone, or voice 
may be employed by an authorized officer, and message blocks may be 
dropped from an aircraft.
    (3) If other communications are not practicable, visual signals may 
be transmitted by flashing light directed at the vessel signaled. USCG 
units will normally use the flashing light signal ``L'' as the signal to 
stop. In the International Code of Signals, ``L'' (.-..) means ``you 
should stop your vessel instantly.'' (Period (.) means a short flash of 
light; dash (-) means a long flash of light.)
    (4) Failure of a vessel's operator promptly to stop the vessel when 
directed to do so by an authorized officer using loudhailer, 
radiotelephone, flashing light signal, or other means constitutes prima 
facie evidence of the offense of refusal to permit an authorized officer 
to board.
    (5) The operator of a vessel who does not understand a signal from 
an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain clarification by 
loudhailer or radiotelephone must consider the signal to be a command to 
stop the vessel instantly.
    (c) Boarding. The operator of a vessel directed to stop must:
    (1) Guard Channel 16, VHF-FM, if so equipped.
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or maneuver in such a way as to 
allow the authorized officer and his/her party to come aboard.
    (3) Except for those vessels with a freeboard of 4 ft (1.2 m) or 
less, provide a safe ladder, if needed, for the authorized officer and 
his/her party to come aboard.
    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer or observer, provide a manrope or safety line, and 
illumination for the ladder.
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to facilitate boarding and 
to ensure the safety of the authorized officer and the boarding party.
    (d) Signals. The following signals, extracted from the International 
Code of Signals, may be sent by flashing light by an enforcement unit 
when conditions do not allow communications by loudhailer or 
radiotelephone. Knowledge of these signals by vessel operators is not 
required. However, knowledge of these signals and appropriate action by 
a vessel operator may preclude the necessity of sending the signal ``L'' 
and the necessity for the vessel to stop instantly. (Period (.) means a 
short flash of light; dash (-) means a long flash of light.)
    (1) ``AA'' repeated (.-.-) is the call to an unknown station. The 
operator of the signaled vessel should respond by identifying the vessel 
by radiotelephone or by illuminating the vessel's identification.
    (2) ``RY-CY'' (.-. -.-- -.-. -.--) means ``you should proceed at 
slow speed, a boat is coming to you.'' This signal is normally employed 
when conditions allow an enforcement boarding without the necessity of 
the vessel being boarded coming to a complete stop, or, in some cases, 
without retrieval of fishing gear which may be in the water.
    (3) ``SQ3'' (... --.- ...--) means ``you should stop or heave to; I 
am going to board you.''

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 37225, July 17, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 600.735  Penalties.

    Any person committing, or fishing vessel used in the commission of a 
violation of the Magnuson Act or any other statute administered by NOAA 
and/or any regulation issued under the Magnuson Act, is subject to the 
civil and criminal penalty provisions and civil forfeiture provisions of 
the Magnuson Act, to this section, to 15 CFR

[[Page 63]]

part 904 (Civil Procedures), and to other applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 600.740  Enforcement policy.

    (a) The Magnuson Act provides four basic enforcement remedies for 
violations, in ascending order of severity, as follows:
    (1) Issuance of a citation (a type of warning), usually at the scene 
of the offense (see 15 CFR part 904, subpart E).
    (2) Assessment by the Administrator of a civil money penalty.
    (3) For certain violations, judicial forfeiture action against the 
vessel and its catch.
    (4) Criminal prosecution of the owner or operator for some offenses. 
It shall be the policy of NMFS to enforce vigorously and equitably the 
provisions of the Magnuson Act by utilizing that form or combination of 
authorized remedies best suited in a particular case to this end.
    (b) Processing a case under one remedial form usually means that 
other remedies are inappropriate in that case. However, further 
investigation or later review may indicate the case to be either more or 
less serious than initially considered, or may otherwise reveal that the 
penalty first pursued is inadequate to serve the purposes of the 
Magnuson Act. Under such circumstances, the Agency may pursue other 
remedies either in lieu of or in addition to the action originally 
taken. Forfeiture of the illegal catch does not fall within this general 
rule and is considered in most cases as only the initial step in 
remedying a violation by removing the ill-gotten gains of the offense.
    (c) If a fishing vessel for which a permit has been issued under the 
Magnuson Act is used in the commission of an offense prohibited by 
section 307 of the Magnuson Act, NOAA may impose permit sanctions, 
whether or not civil or criminal action has been undertaken against the 
vessel or its owner or operator. In some cases, the Magnuson Act 
requires permit sanctions following the assessment of a civil penalty or 
the imposition of a criminal fine. In sum, the Magnuson Act treats 
sanctions against the fishing vessel permit to be the carrying out of a 
purpose separate from that accomplished by civil and criminal penalties 
against the vessel or its owner or operator.


<R05>
Sec. 600.745   Scientific research activity, exempted fishing, and exempted educational activity.

    (a) Scientific research activity. Nothing in this section is 
intended to inhibit or prevent any scientific research activity 
conducted by a scientific research vessel. Persons planning to conduct 
scientific research activities in the EEZ are encouraged to submit to 
the appropriate Regional Director, Director, or designee, 60 days or as 
soon as practicable prior to its start, a scientific research plan for 
each scientific cruise. The Regional Director, Director, or designee 
will acknowledge notification of scientific research activity by issuing 
to the operator or master of that vessel, or to the sponsoring 
institution, a letter of acknowledgment. This letter of acknowledgment 
is separate and distinct from any permit required by any other 
applicable law. If the Regional Director, Director, or designee, after 
review of a research plan, determines that it does not constitute 
scientific research but rather fishing, the Regional Director, Director, 
or designee will inform the applicant as soon as practicable and in 
writing. The Regional Director, Director, or designee may also make 
recommendations to revise the research plan to make the cruise 
acceptable as scientific research activity or recommend the applicant 
request an EFP. In order to facilitate identification of activity as 
scientific research, persons conducting scientific research activities 
are advised to carry a copy of the scientific research plan and the 
letter of acknowledgment on board the scientific research vessel. 
Activities conducted in accordance with a scientific research plan 
acknowledged by such a letter are presumed to be scientific research 
activity. The presumption may be overcome by showing that an activity 
does not fit the definition of scientific research activity or is 
outside the scope of the scientific research plan.
    (b) Exempted fishing.--(1) General. A NMFS Regional Director or 
Director may authorize, for limited testing,

[[Page 64]]

public display, data collection, exploratory, health and safety, 
environmental cleanup, and/or hazard removal purposes, the target or 
incidental harvest of species managed under an FMP or fishery 
regulations that would otherwise be prohibited. Exempted fishing may not 
be conducted unless authorized by an EFP issued by a Regional Director 
or Director in accordance with the criteria and procedures specified in 
this section. The Regional Director or Director may charge a fee to 
recover the administrative expenses of issuing an EFP. The amount of the 
fee will be calculated, at least annually, in accordance with procedures 
of the NOAA Handbook for determining administrative costs of each 
special product or service; the fee may not exceed such costs. Persons 
may contact the appropriate Regional Director or Director to find out 
the applicable fee.
    (2) Application. An applicant for an EFP shall submit a completed 
application package to the appropriate Regional Director or Director, as 
soon as practicable and at least 60 days before the desired effective 
date of the EFP. Submission of an EFP application less than 60 days 
before the desired effective date of the EFP may result in a delayed 
effective date because of review requirements. The application package 
must include payment of any required fee as specified by paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, and a written application that includes, but is 
not limited to, the following information:
    (i) The date of the application.
    (ii) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.
    (iii) A statement of the purposes and goals of the exempted fishery 
for which an EFP is needed, including justification for issuance of the 
EFP.
    (iv) For each vessel to be covered by the EFP, as soon as the 
information is available and before operations begin under the EFP:
    (A) A copy of the USCG documentation, state license, or registration 
of each vessel, or the information contained on the appropriate 
document.
    (B) The current name, address, and telephone number of the owner and 
master, if not included on the document provided for the vessel.
    (v) The species (target and incidental) expected to be harvested 
under the EFP, the amount(s) of such harvest necessary to conduct the 
exempted fishing, the arrangements for disposition of all regulated 
species harvested under the EFP, and any anticipated impacts on marine 
mammals or endangered species.
    (vi) For each vessel covered by the EFP, the approximate time(s) and 
place(s) fishing will take place, and the type, size, and amount of gear 
to be used.
    (vii) The signature of the applicant.
    (viii) The Regional Director or Director, as appropriate, may 
request from an applicant additional information necessary to make the 
determinations required under this section. An incomplete application or 
an application for which the appropriate fee has not been paid will not 
be considered until corrected in writing and the fee paid. An applicant 
for an EFP need not be the owner or operator of the vessel(s) for which 
the EFP is requested.
    (3) Issuance. (i) The Regional Director or Director, as appropriate, 
will review each application and will make a preliminary determination 
whether the application contains all of the required information and 
constitutes an activity appropriate for further consideration. If the 
Regional Director or Director finds that any application does not 
warrant further consideration, both the applicant and the affected 
Council(s) will be notified in writing of the reasons for the decision. 
If the Regional Director or Director determines that any application 
warrants further consideration, notification of receipt of the 
application will be published in the Federal Register with a brief 
description of the proposal, and the intent of NMFS to issue an EFP. 
Interested persons will be given a 15- to 45-day opportunity to comment 
and/or comments will be requested during public testimony at a Council 
meeting. The notification may establish a cut-off date for receipt of 
additional applications to participate in the same, or a similar, 
exempted fishing activity. The Regional Director or Director also will 
forward copies of the application to the Council(s), the USCG, and the 
appropriate fishery management agencies of

affected states, accompanied by the following information:
    (A) The effect of the proposed EFP on the target and incidental 
species, including the effect on any TAC.
    (B) A citation of the regulation or regulations that, without the 
EFP, would prohibit the proposed activity.
    (C) Biological information relevant to the proposal, including 
appropriate statements of environmental impacts, including impacts on 
marine mammals and threatened or endangered species.
    (ii) If the application is complete and warrants additional 
consultation, the Regional Director or Director may consult with the 
appropriate Council(s) concerning the permit application during the 
period in which comments have been requested. The Council(s) or the 
Director or Regional Director shall notify the applicant in advance of 
any meeting at which the application will be considered, and offer the 
applicant the opportunity to appear in support of the application.
    (iii) As soon as practicable after receiving responses from the 
agencies identified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and/or after 
the consultation, if any, described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section, the Regional Director or Director shall notify the applicant in 
writing of the decision to grant or deny the EFP, and, if denied, the 
reasons for the denial. Grounds for denial of an EFP include, but are 
not limited to, the following:
    (A) The applicant has failed to disclose material information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with his or her application; or
    (B) According to the best scientific information available, the 
harvest to be conducted under the permit would detrimentally affect the 
well-being of the stock of any regulated species of fish, marine mammal, 
or threatened or endangered species in a significant way; or
    (C) Issuance of the EFP would have economic allocation as its sole 
purpose; or
    (D) Activities to be conducted under the EFP would be inconsistent 
with the intent of this section, the management objectives of the FMP, 
or other applicable law; or
    (E) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit; or
    (F) The activity proposed under the EFP could create a significant 
enforcement problem.
    (iv) The decision of a Regional Director or Director to grant or 
deny an EFP is the final action of NMFS. If the permit, as granted, is 
significantly different from the original application, or is denied, 
NMFS may publish notification in the Federal Register describing the 
exempted fishing to be conducted under the EFP or the reasons for 
denial.
    (v) The Regional Director or Director may attach terms and 
conditions to the EFP consistent with the purpose of the exempted 
fishing, including, but not limited to:
    (A) The maximum amount of each regulated species that can be 
harvested and landed during the term of the EFP, including trip 
limitations, where appropriate.
    (B) The number, size(s), name(s), and identification number(s) of 
the vessel(s) authorized to conduct fishing activities under the EFP.
    (C) The time(s) and place(s) where exempted fishing may be 
conducted.
    (D) The type, size, and amount of gear that may be used by each 
vessel operated under the EFP.
    (E) The condition that observers, a vessel monitoring system, or 
other electronic equipment be carried on board vessels operated under an 
EFP, and any necessary conditions, such as predeployment notification 
requirements.
    (F) Reasonable data reporting requirements.
    (G) Other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance with 
the purposes of the EFP, consistent with the objectives of the FMP and 
other applicable law.
    (H) Provisions for public release of data obtained under the EFP 
that are consistent with NOAA confidentiality of statistics procedures 
at set out in subpart E. An applicant may be required to waive the right 
to confidentiality of information gathered while conducting exempted 
fishing as a condition of an EFP.

[[Page 66]]

    (4) Duration. Unless otherwise specified in the EFP or a superseding 
notice or regulation, an EFP is effective for no longer than 1 year, 
unless revoked, suspended, or modified. EFPs may be renewed following 
the application procedures in this section.
    (5) Alteration. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (6) Transfer. EFPs issued under this section are not transferable or 
assignable. An EFP is valid only for the vessel(s) for which it is 
issued.
    (7) Inspection. Any EFP issued under this section must be carried on 
board the vessel(s) for which it was issued. The EFP must be presented 
for inspection upon request of any authorized officer.
    (8) Sanctions. Failure of a permittee to comply with the terms and 
conditions of an EFP may be grounds for revocation, suspension, or 
modification of the EFP with respect to all persons and vessels 
conducting activities under the EFP. Any action taken to revoke, 
suspend, or modify an EFP for enforcement purposes will be governed by 
15 CFR part 904, subpart D.
    (c) Reports. (1) Persons conducting scientific research activity are 
requested to submit a copy of any cruise report or other publication 
created as a result of the cruise, including the amount, composition, 
and disposition of their catch, to the appropriate Science and Research 
Director.
    (2) Persons fishing under an EFP are required to report their 
catches to the appropriate Regional Director or Director, as specified 
in the EFP.
    (d) Exempted educational activities--(1) General. A NMFS Regional 
Director or Director may authorize, for educational purposes, the target 
or incidental harvest of species managed under an FMP or fishery 
regulations that would otherwise be prohibited. The decision of a 
Regional Director or Director to grant or deny an exempted educational 
activity authorization is the final action of NMFS. Exempted educational 
activities may not be conducted unless authorized in writing by a 
Regional Director or Director in accordance with the criteria and 
procedures specified in this section. Such authorization will be issued 
without charge.
    (2) Application. An applicant for an exempted educational activity 
authorization shall submit to the appropriate Regional Director or 
Director, at least 15 days before the desired effective date of the 
authorization, a written application that includes, but is not limited 
to, the following information:
    (i) The date of the application.
    (ii) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.
    (iii) A brief statement of the purposes and goals of the exempted 
educational activity for which authorization is requested, including a 
general description of the arrangements for disposition of all species 
collected.
    (iv) Evidence that the sponsoring institution is a valid educational 
institution, such as accreditation by a recognized national or 
international accreditation body.
    (v) The scope and duration of the activity.
    (vi) For each vessel to be covered by the authorization:
    (A) A copy of the U.S. Coast Guard documentation, state license, or 
registration of the vessel, or the information contained on the 
appropriate document.
    (B) The current name, address, and telephone number of the owner and 
master, if not included on the document provided for the vessel.
    (vii) The species and amounts expected to be caught during the 
exempted educational activity.
    (viii) For each vessel covered by the authorization, the approximate 
time(s) and place(s) fishing will take place, and the type, size, and 
amount of gear to be used.
    (ix) The signature of the applicant.
    (x) The Regional Director or Director may request from an applicant 
additional information necessary to make the determinations required 
under this section. An incomplete application will not be considered 
until corrected in writing.
    (3) Issuance. (i) The Regional Director or Director, as appropriate, 
will review each application and will make a determination whether the 
application contains all of the required information, is consistent with 
the goals, objectives,

[[Page 67]]

and requirements of the FMP or regulations and other applicable law, and 
constitutes a valid exempted educational activity. The applicant will be 
notified in writing of the decision within 5 working days of receipt of 
the application.
    (ii) The Regional Director or Director may attach terms and 
conditions to the authorization, consistent with the purpose of the 
exempted educational activity, including, but not limited to:
    (A) The maximum amount of each regulated species that may be 
harvested.
    (B) The time(s) and place(s) where the exempted educational activity 
may be conducted.
    (C) The type, size, and amount of gear that may be used by each 
vessel operated under the authorization.
    (D) Reasonable data reporting requirements.
    (E) Such other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance 
with the purposes of the authorization, consistent with the objectives 
of the FMP or regulations.
    (F) Provisions for public release of data obtained under the 
authorization, consistent with NOAA confidentiality of statistics 
procedures in subpart E. An applicant may be required to waive the right 
to confidentiality of information gathered while conducting exempted 
educational activities as a condition of the authorization.
    (iii) The authorization will specify the scope of the authorized 
activity and will include, at a minimum, the duration, vessel(s), 
species and gear involved in the activity, as well as any additional 
terms and conditions specified under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section.
    (4) Duration. Unless otherwise specified, authorization for an 
exempted educational activity is effective for no longer than 1 year, 
unless revoked, suspended, or modified. Authorizations may be renewed 
following the application procedures in this section.
    (5) Alteration. Any authorization that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (6) Transfer. Authorizations issued under this paragraph (d) are not 
transferable or assignable.
    (7) Inspection. Any authorization issued under this paragraph (d) 
must be carried on board the vessel(s) for which it was issued or be in 
possession of the applicant to which it was issued while the exempted 
educational activity is being conducted. The authorization must be 
presented for inspection upon request of any authorized officer. 
Activities that meet the definition of fishing, despite an educational 
purpose, are fishing. An authorization may allow covered fishing 
activities; however, fishing activities conducted outside the scope of 
an authorization for exempted educational activities are illegal.

Sec. 622.2  Definitions and acronyms.

    In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson Act and in 
Sec. 600.10 of this chapter, and the acronyms in Sec. 600.15 of this 
chapter, the terms and acronyms used in this part have the following 
meanings:
    Allowable chemical means a substance, generally used to immobilize 
marine life so that it can be captured alive, that, when introduced into 
the water, does not take Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral and is 
allowed by Florida for the harvest of tropical fish (e.g.,

[[Page 69]]

quinaldine, quinaldine compounds, or similar substances).
    Allowable octocoral means an erect, nonencrusting species of the 
subclass Octocorallia, except the seafans Gorgonia flabellum and G. 
ventalina, plus the attached substrate within 1 inch (2.54 cm) of an 
allowable octocoral.

    Note: An erect, nonencrusting species of the subclass Octocorallia, 
except the seafans Gorgonia flabellum and G. ventalina, with attached 
substrate exceeding 1 inch (2.54 cm) is considered to be live rock and 
not allowable octocoral.

    Aquacultured live rock means live rock that is harvested under a 
Federal aquacultured live rock permit, as required under 
Sec. 622.4(a)(3)(iii).
    Authorized statistical reporting agent means:
    (1) Any person so designated by the SRD; or
    (2) Any person so designated by the head of any Federal or State 
agency that has entered into an agreement with the Assistant 
Administrator to collect fishery data.
    Buoy gear means fishing gear consisting of a float and one or more 
weighted lines suspended therefrom, generally long enough to reach the 
bottom. A hook or hooks (usually 6 to 10) are on the lines at or near 
the end. The float and line(s) drift freely and are retrieved 
periodically to remove catch and rebait hooks.
    Carapace length means the straight-line distance from the orbital 
notch inside the orbital spine, in a line parallel to the lateral 
rostral sulcus, to the posterior margin of the cephalothorax. (See 
Figure 1 in Appendix C of this part.)
    Caribbean means the Caribbean Sea around Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.
    Caribbean coral reef resource means one or more of the species, or a 
part thereof, listed in Table 1 in Appendix A of this part, whether 
living or dead.
    Caribbean prohibited coral means, in the Caribbean; a gorgonian, 
that is, a Caribbean coral reef resource of the Class Anthozoa, Subclass 
Octocorallia, Order Gorgonacea; a live rock; or a stony coral, that is, 
a Caribbean coral reef resource of the Class Hydrozoa (fire corals and 
hydrocorals) or of the Class Anthozoa, Subclass Hexacorallia, Orders 
Scleractinia (stony corals) and Antipatharia (black corals); or a part 
thereof.
    Caribbean reef fish means one or more of the species, or a part 
thereof, listed in Table 2 in Appendix A of this part.
    Caribbean spiny lobster means the species Panulirus argus, or a part 
thereof.
    CFMC means the Caribbean Fishery Management Council.
    Charter vessel means a vessel less than 100 gross tons (90.8 mt) 
that meets the requirements of the USCG to carry six or fewer passengers 
for hire and that carries a passenger for hire at any time during the 
calendar year. A charter vessel with a commercial permit, as required 
under Sec. 622.4(a)(2), is considered to be operating as a charter 
vessel when it carries a passenger who pays a fee or when there are more 
than three persons aboard, including operator and crew.
    Coastal migratory pelagic fish means one or more of the following 
species, or a part thereof:
    (1) Bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix (Gulf of Mexico only).
    (2) Cero, Scomberomorus regalis.
    (3) Cobia, Rachycentron canadum.
    (4) Dolphin, Coryphaena hippurus
    (5) King mackerel, Scomberomorus cavalla.

<R05>
Sec. 622.4  Permits and fees.

    (a) Permits required. To conduct activities in fisheries governed in 
this part, valid Federal permits are required as follows:
    (1) Charter vessel/headboat permits. For a person aboard a vessel 
that is operating as a charter vessel or headboat to fish for or possess 
coastal migratory pelagic fish, Gulf reef fish, or South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper in or from the EEZ, a charter vessel/headboat permit for 
coastal migratory pelagic fish, Gulf reef fish, or South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper, respectively, must have been issued to the vessel and 
must be on board. A charter vessel or headboat may have both a charter 
vessel/headboat permit and a commercial vessel permit. However, when a 
vessel is operating as a charter vessel or

[[Page 73]]

headboat, a person aboard must adhere to the bag limits.
    (2) Commercial vessel permits and endorsements--(i) Fish traps in 
the Gulf. For a person to possess or use a fish trap in the EEZ in the 
Gulf of Mexico, a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish with a 
fish trap endorsement must have been issued to the vessel and must be on 
board. See paragraph (n) of this section regarding a moratorium on fish 
trap endorsements.
    (ii) Gillnets for king mackerel in the Florida west coast subzone. 
For a person aboard a vessel to use a run-around gillnet for king 
mackerel in the Florida west coast subzone (see 
Sec. 622.42(c)(1)(i)(A)(3)), a commercial vessel permit for king and 
Spanish mackerel with a gillnet endorsement must have been issued to the 
vessel and must be on board. See paragraph (o) of this section for 
restrictions on addition or deletion of a gillnet endorsement.
    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) King and Spanish mackerel. For a person aboard a vessel to be 
eligible for exemption from the bag limits and to fish under a quota for 
king or Spanish mackerel in or from the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South 
Atlantic EEZ, a commercial vessel permit for king and Spanish mackerel 
must have been issued to the vessel and must be on board. To obtain or 
renew a commercial vessel permit for king and Spanish mackerel, at least 
10 percent of the applicant's earned income must have been derived from 
commercial fishing, that is, sale of fish harvested from the applicant's 
vessels, during one of the 3 calendar years preceding the application.
    (v) Gulf reef fish. For a person aboard a vessel to be eligible for 
exemption from the bag limits, to fish under a quota, or to sell Gulf 
reef fish in or from the Gulf EEZ, a commercial vessel permit for Gulf 
reef fish must have been issued to the vessel and must be on board. To 
obtain or renew a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, more than 
50 percent of the applicant's earned income must have been derived from 
commercial fishing, that is, sale of fish harvested from the applicant's 
vessels, or from charter or headboat operations during either of the 2 
calendar years preceding the application. See paragraph (m) of this 
section regarding a moratorium on commercial vessel permits for Gulf 
reef fish and paragraph (m)(3) of this section for a limited exception 
to the earned income requirement for a permit.
    (vi) South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For a person aboard a vessel to 
be eligible for exemption from the bag limits for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, to engage in the 
directed fishery for tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ, to use a 
longline to fish for South Atlantic snapper-grouper in the South 
Atlantic EEZ, or to use a sea bass pot in the South Atlantic EEZ north 
of 28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, 
Cape Canaveral, FL), a commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper must have been issued to the vessel and must be on 
board. A vessel with longline gear and more than 200 lb (90.7 kilograms) 
of tilefish aboard is considered to be in the directed fishery for 
tilefish. It is a rebuttable presumption that a fishing vessel with more 
than 200 lb of tilefish aboard harvested such tilefish in the EEZ. To 
obtain or renew a commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper, more than 50 percent of the applicant's earned income must have 
been derived from commercial fishing, that is, sale of fish harvested 
from the applicant's vessels, or from charter or headboat operations; or 
gross sales of fish harvested from the owner's, operator's, 
corporation's, or partnership's vessels must have been greater than 
$20,000, during one of the 3 calendar years preceding the application.
    (vii) Wreckfish. For a person aboard a vessel to fish for wreckfish 
in the South Atlantic EEZ, possess wreckfish in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ, offload wreckfish from the South Atlantic EEZ, or sell 
wreckfish in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, a commercial vessel permit 
for wreckfish must have been issued to the vessel and must be on board. 
To obtain a commercial vessel permit for wreckfish, the applicant must 
be a wreckfish shareholder; and either the shareholder must be the 
vessel owner or the owner or operator must be an employee, contractor, 
or agent of the shareholder. (See Sec. 622.15

[[Page 74]]

for information on wreckfish shareholders.)
    (viii) South Atlantic rock shrimp. For a person aboard a vessel to 
fish for rock shrimp in the South Atlantic EEZ or possess rock shrimp in 
or from the South Atlantic EEZ, a commercial vessel permit for rock 
shrimp must be issued to the vessel and must be on board.
    (ix) Gulf red snapper. Effective through December 31, 1997, as a 
prerequisite for exemption from the trip limit for red snapper specified 
in Sec. 622.44(e)(1), a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish with 
a red snapper endorsement must have been issued to the vessel and must 
be on board.
    (3) Coral permits--(i) Allowable chemical. For an individual to take 
or possess fish or other marine organisms with an allowable chemical in 
a coral area, other than fish or other marine organisms that are landed 
in Florida, a Federal allowable chemical permit must have been issued to 
the individual. Such permit must be available when the permitted 
activity is being conducted and when such fish or other marine organisms 
are possessed, through landing ashore.
    (ii) Allowable octocoral. For an individual to take or possess 
allowable octocoral in the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ, other than 
allowable octocoral that is landed in Florida, a Federal allowable 
octocoral permit must have been issued to the individual. Such permit 
must be available for inspection when the permitted activity is being 
conducted and when allowable octocoral is possessed, through landing 
ashore.
    (iii) Aquacultured live rock. For a person to take or possess 
aquacultured live rock in the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ, a Federal 
aquacultured live rock permit must have been issued for the specific 
harvest site. Such permit, or a copy, must be on board a vessel 
depositing or possessing material on an aquacultured live rock site or 
harvesting or possessing live rock from an aquacultured live rock site.
    (iv) Prohibited coral. A Federal permit may be issued to take or 
possess Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral or Caribbean prohibited 
coral only as scientific research activity, exempted fishing, or 
exempted educational activity. See Sec. 600.745 of this chapter for the 
procedures and limitations for such activities and fishing.
    (v) Florida permits. Appropriate Florida permits and endorsements 
are required for the following activities, without regard to whether 
they involve activities in the EEZ or Florida's waters:
    (A) Landing in Florida fish or other marine organisms taken with an 
allowable chemical in a coral area.
    (B) Landing allowable octocoral in Florida.
    (C) Landing live rock in Florida.
    (vi) Wild live rock permits. A Federal permit is required for a 
vessel to take or possess wild live rock in or from the Gulf EEZ. To be 
eligible for a wild live rock vessel permit, the current owner of the 
vessel for which the permit is requested must have had the required 
Florida permit and endorsements for live rock on or before February 3, 
1994, and a record of landings of live rock on or before February 3, 
1994, as documented on trip tickets received by the Florida Department 
of Environmental Protection before March 15, 1994. For landings other 
than in Florida, equivalent state permits/endorsements, if required, and 
landing records may be substituted for the Florida permits/endorsements 
and trip tickets. An owner will not be issued permits in numbers 
exceeding the number of vessels for which the owning entity had the 
requisite reported landings. An owner of a permitted vessel may transfer 
the vessel permit to another vessel owned by the same person by 
returning the existing permit with an application for a vessel permit 
for the replacement vessel. No wild live rock vessel permits will be 
issued after the quota for wild live rock in the Gulf, as specified in 
Sec. 622.42(b)(2), is reached or after December 31, 1996.
    (4) Dealer permits.  For a dealer to receive Gulf reef fish, golden 
crab harvested from the South Atlantic EEZ, South Atlantic snapper-
grouper, rock shrimp harvested from the South Atlantic EEZ, or 
wreckfish, a dealer permit for Gulf reef fish, golden crab, South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper, rock shrimp, or wreckfish, respectively, must 
be issued to the dealer. To obtain

permit and a copy of a signed bill of sale or equivalent acquisition 
papers.
    (h) Renewal. Although a permit required by this section is issued on 
an annual basis, an application for permit renewal is required only 
every 2 years. In the interim years, a permit is renewed automatically 
(without application) for a vessel owner or dealer who has met the 
specific requirements for the requested permit, who has submitted all 
reports required under the Magnuson Act, and who is not subject to a 
permit sanction or denial under paragraph (j) of this section. An owner 
or dealer whose permit is expiring will be mailed a notification by the 
RD approximately 2 months prior to expiration of the current permit. 
That notification will advise the status of the renewal of the permit. 
That is, the notification will advise that the renewed permit will be 
issued without further action by the owner or dealer, that the permit is 
not eligible for automatic renewal, or that a new application is 
required. A notification that a permit is not eligible for automatic 
renewal will specify the reasons and will provide an

[[Page 77]]

opportunity for correction of any deficiencies. A notification that a 
new application is required will include a preprinted renewal 
application. An automatically renewed permit will be mailed by the RD 
approximately 1 month prior to expiration of the old permit. A vessel 
owner or dealer who does not receive a notification of status of renewal 
of a permit by 45 days prior to expiration of the current permit must 
contact the RD.
    (i) Display. A vessel permit or endorsement issued under this 
section must be carried on board the vessel. A dealer permit issued 
under this section, or a copy thereof, must be available on the dealer's 
premises. In addition, a copy of the dealer's permit must accompany each 
vehicle that is used to pick up from a fishing vessel reef fish 
harvested from the Gulf EEZ. The operator of a vessel must present the 
permit or endorsement for inspection upon the request of an authorized 
officer. A dealer or a vehicle operator must present the permit or a 
copy for inspection upon the request of an authorized officer.
    (j) Sanctions and denials. A permit or endorsement issued pursuant 
to this section may be revoked, suspended, or modified, and a permit or 
endorsement application may be denied, in accordance with the procedures 
governing enforcement-related permit sanctions and denials found at 
subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (k) Alteration. A permit that is altered, erased, or mutilated is 
invalid.
    (l) Replacement. A replacement permit or endorsement may be issued. 
An application for a replacement permit or endorsement will not be 
considered a new application. A fee, the amount of which is stated with 
the application form, must accompany each request for a replacement.
    (m) Moratorium on commercial vessel permits for Gulf reef fish. This 
paragraph (m) is effective through December 31, 2000.
    (1) Except for an application for renewal of an existing commercial 
vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, or as provided in paragraphs (m)(2) 
and (3) of this section, no applications for such commercial vessel 
permits will be accepted.
    (2) An owner of a permitted vessel may transfer the commercial 
vessel permit for Gulf reef fish to another vessel owned by the same 
entity by returning the existing permit to the RD with an application 
for a commercial vessel permit for the replacement vessel.
    (3) An owner whose earned income qualified for the commercial vessel 
permit for Gulf reef fish may transfer that permit to the owner of 
another vessel or to the new owner when he or she sells the permitted 
vessel. The owner of a vessel that is to receive the transferred permit 
must return the existing permit to the RD with an application for a 
commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish for his or her vessel. Such 
new owner may receive a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish for 
that vessel, and renew it for the first calendar year after obtaining 
it, without meeting the earned income requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(v) 
of this section. However, to renew the commercial vessel permit for the 
second calendar year after the transfer, the new owner must meet that 
earned income requirement not later than the first calendar year after 
the permit transfer takes place.
    (4) A commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish that is not 
renewed or that is revoked will not be reissued. A permit is considered 
to be not renewed when an application for renewal is not received by the 
RD within 1 year of the expiration date of the permit.
    (n) Moratorium on endorsements for fish traps in the Gulf. The 
provisions of this paragraph (n) are effective through February 7, 1997.
    (1) A fish trap endorsement will not be issued or renewed unless the 
current owner of the commercially permitted vessel for which the 
endorsement is requested has a record of landings of Gulf reef fish from 
fish traps in the Gulf EEZ during 1991 or 1992, as reported on fishing 
vessel logbooks received by the SRD on or before November 19, 1992. An 
owner will not be issued fish trap endorsements for vessels in numbers 
exceeding the number of vessels for which the owning entity had the 
requisite reported landings in 1991 or 1992.
    (2) An owner of a vessel with a fish trap endorsement may transfer 
the endorsement to another vessel owned by

[[Page 78]]

the same entity by returning the existing endorsement with an 
application for an endorsement for the replacement vessel.
    (3) A fish trap endorsement is not transferable upon change of 
ownership of a vessel with such endorsement, except as follows:
    (i) Such endorsement is transferable when the change of ownership of 
the permitted vessel is from one to another of the following: Husband, 
wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, mother, or father.
    (ii) In the event that a vessel with a fish trap endorsement has a 
change of ownership that is directly related to the disability or death 
of the owner, the RD may issue such endorsement, temporarily or 
permanently, with the commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish that 
is issued for the vessel under the new owner. Such new owner will be the 
person specified by the owner or his/her legal guardian, in the case of 
a disabled owner, or by the will or executor/administrator of the 
estate, in the case of a deceased owner. (Change of ownership of a 
vessel with a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish upon 
disability or death of an owner is considered a purchase of a permitted 
vessel and paragraph (m)(3) of this section applies regarding a 
commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish for the vessel under the new 
owner.)
    (4) A fish trap endorsement in effect on September 12, 1995, may be 
transferred to a vessel with a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef 
fish whose owner has a record of landings of reef fish from fish traps 
in the Gulf EEZ, as reported on fishing vessel logbooks received by the 
SRD from November 20, 1992, through February 6, 1994, and who was unable 
to obtain a fish trap endorsement for such vessel under paragraph (n)(1) 
of this section. The owner of a vessel that is to receive the 
transferred endorsement must return the currently endorsed commercial 
vessel permit for Gulf reef fish and the unendorsed permit to the RD 
with an application for a fish trap endorsement for his or her vessel. 
Revised commercial vessel permits will be returned to each owner.
    (5) If a fish trap endorsement is transferred under paragraph (n)(3) 
or (4) of this section, the owner of the vessel to which the endorsement 
is transferred may renew the endorsement without regard to the 
requirement of paragraph (n)(1) of this section regarding a record of 
landing of Gulf reef fish from fish traps.
    (6) A fish trap endorsement that is not renewed or that is revoked 
will not be reissued. Such endorsement is considered to be not renewed 
when an application for renewal is not received by the RD within 1 year 
of the expiration date of the permit.
    (o) Endorsements for the use of gillnets for king and Spanish 
mackerel in the Florida west coast subzone. Other paragraphs of this 
section notwithstanding--
    (1) An owner of a vessel that has a commercial vessel permit for 
king and Spanish mackerel may add or delete a gillnet endorsement on a 
permit by returning to the RD the vessel's existing permit with a 
written request for addition or deletion of the gillnet endorsement. 
Such request must be postmarked or hand delivered during June, each 
year.
    (2) A gillnet endorsement may not be added or deleted from July 1 
through May 31 each year, any renewal of the permit during that period 
notwithstanding. From July 1 through May 31, a permitted vessel that is 
sold, if permitted by the new owner for king and Spanish mackerel, will 
receive a permit with or without the gillnet endorsement as was the case 
for the vessel under the previous owner. From July 1 through May 31, the 
initial commercial vessel permit for king and Spanish mackerel issued 
for a vessel new to the fishery will be issued without a gillnet 
endorsement.
    (p) Gulf red snapper endorsements. This paragraph (p) is effective 
through December 31, 1997.
    (1) Based on documented historical red snapper landings from the 
Gulf of 5,000 lb (2,269 kg), round weight, or its equivalent in 
eviscerated weight, per year in 2 of the years 1990, 1991, and 1992, 
Gulf red snapper endorsements have been issued for vessels that have 
commercial permits for Gulf reef fish. In cases where a red snapper 
endorsement is issued based on the qualifications of an operator, the 
validity of

[[Page 79]]

that endorsement is conditioned on that named operator being aboard and 
in charge of the permitted vessel.
    (2) A Gulf red snapper endorsement is invalid upon sale of the 
vessel; however, an owner of a vessel with a red snapper endorsement may 
transfer the endorsement to another vessel owned by the same entity by 
returning the existing endorsement with an application for an 
endorsement for the replacement vessel.
    (3) Paragraph (p)(2) of this section notwithstanding--
    (i) In the event that a vessel with a Gulf red snapper endorsement 
has a change of ownership that is directly related to the disability or 
death of the owner, the RD may issue a red snapper endorsement, 
temporarily or permanently, with the commercial permit for Gulf reef 
fish that is issued for the vessel under the new owner. Such new owner 
will be the person specified by the owner or his/her legal guardian, in 
the case of a disabled owner, or by the will or executor/administrator 
of the estate, in the case of a deceased owner. (Change of ownership of 
a vessel with a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish upon 
disability or death of an owner is considered a purchase of a permitted 
vessel and paragraph (m)(3) of this section applies regarding a 
commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish for the vessel under the new 
owner.)
    (ii) In the event of the disability or death of an operator whose 
presence aboard a vessel is a condition for the validity of a Gulf red 
snapper endorsement, the RD may revise and reissue an endorsement, 
temporarily or permanently, to the permitted vessel. Such revised 
endorsement will contain the name of a substitute operator specified by 
the operator or his/her legal guardian, in the case of a disabled 
operator, or by the will or executor/administrator of the estate, in the 
case of a deceased operator. As was the case with the replaced 
endorsement, the presence of the substitute operator aboard and in 
charge of the vessel is a condition for the validity of the revised 
endorsement. Such revised endorsement will be reissued only with the 
concurrence of the vessel owner.

(19.8 m) long; at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) in height for vessels over 
25 ft (7.6 m) long; and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in height for vessels 
25 ft (7.6 m) long or less.
    (ii) Official number and color code. The following vessels must 
display their official number as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
this section and, in addition, must display their assigned color code: A 
vessel for which a fish trap endorsement has been issued, as required 
under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(i); a vessel for which a permit has been issued 
to fish with a sea bass pot, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vi); a 
vessel in the commercial Caribbean reef fish fishery fishing with traps; 
and a vessel in the Caribbean spiny lobster fishery. Color codes 
required for the Caribbean reef fish fishery and Caribbean spiny lobster 
fishery are assigned by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
whichever is applicable; color codes required in all other fisheries are 
assigned by the RD. The color code must be displayed--
    (A) On the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull and, 
for vessels over 25 ft (7.6 m) long, on an appropriate weather deck, so 
as to be clearly visible from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (B) In the form of a circle permanently affixed to or painted on the 
vessel.
    (C) At least 18 inches (45.7 cm) in diameter for vessels over 65 ft 
(19.8 m) long; at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) in diameter for vessels over 
25 ft (7.6 m) long; and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter for 
vessels 25 ft (7.6 m) long or less.
    (2) Duties of operator. The operator of a vessel specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section must keep the official number and the 
color code, if applicable, clearly legible and in good repair

[[Page 84]]

and must ensure that no part of the fishing vessel, its rigging, fishing 
gear, or any other material on board obstructs the view of the official 
number or the color code, if applicable, from an enforcement vessel or 
aircraft.
    (b) Gear identification--(1) Traps or pots--(i) Caribbean EEZ. A 
fish trap or spiny lobster trap used or possessed in the Caribbean EEZ 
must display the official number specified for the vessel by Puerto Rico 
or the U.S. Virgin Islands so as to be easily identified.
    (ii) Gulf and South Atlantic EEZ. A fish trap used or possessed in 
the Gulf EEZ and a sea bass pot used or possessed in the South Atlantic 
EEZ, or a fish trap or sea bass pot on board a vessel with a commercial 
permit for Gulf reef fish or South Atlantic snapper-grouper, must have a 
valid identification tag issued by the RD attached. A golden crab trap 
used or possessed in the South Atlantic EEZ or on board a vessel with a 
commercial permit for golden crab must have the commercial vessel permit 
number permanently affixed so as to be easily distinguished, located, 
and identified; an identification tag issued by the RD may be used for 
this purpose but is not required.
    (2) Buoys. A buoy must display the assigned number and color code so 
as to be easily distinguished, located, and identified as follows--
    (i) Caribbean EEZ. Each buoy must display the official number and 
color code specified for the vessel by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, whichever is applicable.
    (ii) Gulf and South Atlantic EEZ. Each buoy must display the number 
and color code assigned by the RD. In the Gulf EEZ, a buoy must be 
attached to each trap, or each end trap if traps are connected by a 
line. In the South Atlantic EEZ, buoys are not required to be used, but, 
if used, each buoy must display the number and color code. However, no 
color code is required on a buoy attached to a golden crab trap.
    (c) Presumption of ownership. A Caribbean spiny lobster trap, a fish 
trap, a golden crab trap, or a sea bass pot in the EEZ will be presumed 
to be the property of the most recently documented owner. This 
presumption will not apply with respect to such traps and pots that are 
lost or sold if the owner reports the loss or sale within 15 days to the 
RD.
    (d) Unmarked traps, pots, or buoys. An unmarked Caribbean spiny 
lobster trap, a fish trap, a golden crab trap, a sea bass pot, or a buoy 
deployed in the EEZ is illegal and may be disposed of in any appropriate 
manner by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer.

                      Subpart B--Effort Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 622.15  Wreckfish individual transferable quota (ITQ) system.

    The provisions of this section apply to wreckfish in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ.
    (a) Percentage shares. (1) In accordance with the procedure 
specified in the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery 
of the South Atlantic Region, percentage shares of the quota for 
wreckfish have been assigned. Each person has been notified by the RD of 
his or her percentage share and shareholder certificate number.
    (2) All or a portion of a person's percentage shares may be 
transferred to another person. Transfer of shares must be reported on a 
form available from the RD. The RD will confirm, in writing, each 
transfer of shares. The effective date of each transfer is the 
confirmation date provided by the RD. The confirmation date will 
normally be not later than 3 working days after receipt of a properly 
completed transfer form. A fee is charged for each transfer of shares. 
The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of 
the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the RD, for determining the 
administrative costs of each special product or service provided by NOAA 
to non-Federal recipients. The fee may not exceed such costs and is 
specified with each transfer form. The appropriate fee must accompany 
each transfer form.
    (b) Lists of wreckfish shareholders and permitted vessels. Annually, 
on or about March 1, the RD will provide each wreckfish shareholder with 
a list of all wreckfish shareholders and their percentage shares, 
reflecting share transactions on forms received through February 15. 
Annually by April 15, the RD will provide each dealer who holds a dealer 
permit for wreckfish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4), with a list of 
vessels for which wreckfish permits have been issued, as required under 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vii). Annually, by April 15, the RD will provide each 
wreckfish shareholder with a list of dealers who have been issued dealer 
permits for wreckfish. From April 16 through January 14, updated lists 
will be provided when required. Updated lists may be obtained at other 
times or by a person who is not a wreckfish shareholder or wreckfish 
dealer permit holder by written request to the RD.
    (c) ITQs. (1) Annually, as soon after March 1 as the TAC for 
wreckfish for the fishing year that commences April 16 is known, the RD 
will calculate each wreckfish shareholder's ITQ. Each ITQ is the product 
of the wreckfish TAC, in round weight, for the ensuing fishing year, the 
factor for converting round weight to eviscerated weight, and each 
wreckfish shareholder's percentage share, reflecting share transactions 
reported on forms received by the RD through February 15. Thus, the ITQs

[[Page 87]]

will be in terms of eviscerated weight of wreckfish.
    (2) The RD will provide each wreckfish shareholder with ITQ coupons 
in various denominations, the total of which equals his or her ITQ, and 
a copy of the calculations used in determining his or her ITQ. Each 
coupon will be coded to indicate the initial recipient.
    (3) An ITQ coupon may be transferred from one wreckfish shareholder 
to another by completing the sale endorsement thereon (that is, the 
signature and shareholder certificate number of the buyer). An ITQ 
coupon may be possessed only by the shareholder to whom it has been 
issued, or by the shareholder's employee, contractor, or agent, unless 
the ITQ coupon has been transferred to another shareholder. An ITQ 
coupon that has been transferred to another shareholder may be possessed 
only by the shareholder whose signature appears on the coupon as the 
buyer, or by the shareholder's employee, contractor, or agent, and with 
all required sale endorsements properly completed.
    (4) Wreckfish may not be possessed on board a fishing vessel--
    (i) In an amount exceeding the total of the ITQ coupons on board the 
vessel;
    (ii) That does not have on board a commercial vessel permit for 
wreckfish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vii); or
    (iii) That does not have on board logbook forms for that fishing 
trip, as required under Sec. 622.5(a)(1)(iv)(B).
    (5) Prior to termination of a trip, a signature and date signed must 
be affixed in ink to the ``Fisherman'' part of ITQ coupons in 
denominations equal to the eviscerated weight of the wreckfish on board. 
The ``Fisherman'' part of each such coupon must be separated from the 
coupon and submitted with the logbook forms required by 
Sec. 622.5(a)(1)(iv)(B) for that fishing trip.
    (6) The ``Fish House'' part of each such coupon must be given to the 
dealer to whom the wreckfish are transferred in amounts totaling the 
eviscerated weight of the wreckfish transferred to that dealer. A 
wreckfish may be transferred only to a dealer who holds a dealer permit 
for wreckfish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4).
    (7) A dealer may receive a wreckfish only from a vessel for which a 
commercial permit for wreckfish has been issued, as required under 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vii). A dealer must receive the ``Fish House'' part of 
ITQ coupons in amounts totaling the eviscerated weight of the wreckfish 
received; enter the permit number of the vessel from which the wreckfish 
were received, enter the date the wreckfish were received, enter the 
dealer's permit number, and sign each such ``Fish House'' part; and 
submit all such parts with the dealer reports required by 
Sec. 622.5(c)(5)(i).
    (8) An owner or operator of a vessel and a dealer must make 
available to an authorized officer all ITQ coupons in his or her 
possession upon request.
    (d) Wreckfish limitations. (1) A wreckfish taken in the South 
Atlantic EEZ may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where the 
transfer takes place; and a wreckfish may not be transferred in the 
South Atlantic EEZ.
    (2) A wreckfish possessed by a fisherman or dealer shoreward of the 
outer boundary of the South Atlantic EEZ or in a South Atlantic coastal 
state will be presumed to have been harvested from the South Atlantic 
EEZ unless accompanied by documentation that it was harvested from other 
than the South Atlantic EEZ.
    (3) A wreckfish may be offloaded from a fishing vessel only between 
8 a.m. and 5 p.m., local time.
    (4) If a wreckfish is to be offloaded at a location other than a 
fixed facility of a dealer who holds a dealer permit for wreckfish, as 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4), the wreckfish shareholder or the vessel 
operator must advise the NMFS, Office of Enforcement, Southeast Region, 
St. Petersburg, FL, by telephone (1-800-853-1964), of the location not 
less than 24 hours prior to offloading.


<R05>
Sec. 622.16  Red snapper individual transferable quota (ITQ) system.

    The ITQ system established by this section will remain in effect 
through March 31, 2000, during which time NMFS and the GMFMC will 
evaluate the effectiveness of the system. Based on the evaluation, the 
system may be modified, extended, or terminated.

[[Page 88]]

    (a) Percentage shares. (1) Initial percentage shares of the annual 
quota of red snapper are assigned to persons in accordance with the 
procedure specified in Amendment 8 to the Fishery Management Plan for 
the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) and in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. Each person is notified by the RD 
of his or her initial percentage shares. If additional shares become 
available to NMFS, such as by forfeiture pursuant to subpart F of 15 CFR 
part 904 for rule violations, such shares will be proportionately 
reissued to shareholders based on their shares as of November 1, after 
the additional shares become available. If NMFS is required to issue 
additional shares, such as may be required in the resolution of 
disputes, existing shares will be proportionately reduced. This 
reduction of shares will be based on shares as of November 1 after the 
required addition of shares.
    (2) All or a portion of a person's percentage shares may be 
transferred to another person who is a U.S. citizen or permanent 
resident alien. (See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for restrictions 
on the transfer of shares in the initial months under the ITQ system.) 
Transfer of shares must be reported on a form available from the RD. The 
RD will confirm, in writing, the registration of each transfer. The 
effective date of each transfer is the confirmation date provided by the 
RD. The confirmation of registration date will normally be not later 
than 3 working days after receipt of a properly completed transfer form. 
However, reports of share transfers received by the RD from November 1 
through December 31 will not be recorded or confirmed until after 
January 1. A fee is charged for each transfer of percentage shares. The 
amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of the 
NOAA Finance Handbook for determining the administrative costs of each 
special product or service provided by NOAA to non-Federal recipients. 
The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each transfer 
form. The appropriate fee must accompany each transfer form.
    (3) On or about January 1 each year, the RD will provide each red 
snapper shareholder with a list of all red snapper shareholders and 
their percentage shares, reflecting share transfers as indicated on 
properly completed transfer forms received through October 31. Updated 
lists may be obtained at other times, and by persons who are not red 
snapper shareholders, by written request to the RD.
    (b) ITQs. (1) Annually, as soon after November 15 as the following 
year's red snapper quota is established, the RD will calculate each red 
snapper shareholder's ITQ in terms of eviscerated weight. Each ITQ is 
the product of the red snapper quota, in round weight, for the ensuing 
fishing year, the factor for converting round weight to eviscerated 
weight, and each red snapper shareholder's percentage share, reflecting 
share transfers reported on forms received by the RD through October 31.
    (2) The RD will provide each red snapper shareholder with ITQ 
coupons in various denominations, the total of which equals his or her 
ITQ, and a copy of the calculations used in determining his or her ITQ. 
Each coupon will be coded to indicate the initial recipient.
    (3) An ITQ coupon may be transferred. If the transfer is by sale, 
the seller must enter the sale price on the coupon.
    (4) Except when the red snapper bag limit applies, red snapper in or 
from the EEZ or on board a vessel that has been issued a commercial 
permit for Gulf reef fish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(v), may 
not be possessed in an amount, in eviscerated weight, exceeding the 
total of ITQ coupons on board. (See Sec. 622.39(a) for applicability of 
the bag limit.)
    (5) Prior to termination of a trip, the operator's signature and the 
date signed must be written in ink on the ``Vessel'' part of ITQ coupons 
totaling at least the eviscerated weight of the red snapper on board. An 
owner or operator of a vessel must separate the ``Vessel'' part of each 
such coupon, enter thereon the permit number of the dealer to whom the 
red snapper are transferred, and submit the ``Vessel'' parts with the 
logbook forms for that fishing trip. An owner or operator of a vessel 
must make available to an authorized officer all ITQ coupons in his or 
her possession upon request.

[[Page 89]]

    (6) Red snapper harvested from the EEZ or possessed by a vessel with 
a commercial permit for Gulf reef fish, as required under 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(v), may be transferred only to a dealer with a Gulf 
reef fish permit, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4). The ``Fish House'' 
part of each ITQ coupon must be given to such dealer, or the agent or 
employee of such dealer, in amounts totaling at least the eviscerated 
weight of the red snapper transferred to that dealer.
    (7) A dealer with a Gulf reef fish permit may receive red snapper 
only from a vessel that has on board a commercial permit for Gulf reef 
fish. A dealer, or the agent or employee of a dealer, must receive the 
``Fish House'' part of ITQ coupons totaling at least the eviscerated 
weight of the red snapper received. Immediately upon receipt of red 
snapper, the dealer, or the agent or employee of the dealer, must enter 
the permit number of the vessel received from and date and sign each 
such ``Fish House'' part. The dealer must submit all such parts as 
required by paragraph (d)(6) of this section. A dealer, agent, or 
employee must make available to an authorized officer all ITQ coupons in 
his or her possession upon request.
    (c) Procedures for implementation--(1) Initial shareholders. The 
following persons are initial shareholders in the red snapper ITQ 
system:
    (i) Either the owner or operator of a vessel with a valid permit on 
August 29, 1995, provided such owner or operator had a landing of red 
snapper during the period 1990 through 1992. If the earned income of an 
operator was used to qualify for the permit that is valid on August 29, 
1995, such operator is the initial shareholder rather than the owner. In 
the case of an owner, the term ``person'' includes a corporation or 
other legal entity; and
    (ii) A historical captain. A historical captain means an operator 
who meets all of the following qualifications:
    (A) From November 6, 1989, through 1993, fished solely under verbal 
or written share agreements with an owner, and such agreements provided 
for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, who was paid 
from the share under his or her control.
    (B) Landed from that vessel at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of red 
snapper per year in 2 of the 3 years 1990, 1991, and 1992.
    (C) Derived more than 50 percent of his or her earned income from 
commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch, in each of the years 
1989 through 1993.
    (D) Landed red snapper prior to November 7, 1989.
    (2) Initial shares. (i) Initial shares are apportioned to initial 
shareholders based on each shareholder's average of the top 2 years' 
landings in 1990, 1991, and 1992. However, no person who is an initial 
shareholder under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will receive an 
initial percentage share that will amount to less than 100 lb (45.36 
kg), round weight, of red snapper (90 lb (41 kg), eviscerated weight).
    (ii) The percentage shares remaining after the minimum shares have 
been calculated under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section are 
apportioned based on each remaining shareholder's average of the top 2 
years' landings in 1990, 1991, and 1992. In a case where a landing is 
associated with an owner and a historical captain, such landing is 
apportioned between the owner and historical captain in accordance with 
the share agreement in effect at the time of the landing.
    (iii) The determinations of landings of red snapper during the 
period 1990 through 1992 and historical captain status are made in 
accordance with the data collected under Amendment 9 to the FMP. Those 
data identify each red snapper landing during the period 1990 through 
1992. Each landing is associated with an owner and, when an operator's 
earned income was used to qualify for the vessel permit at the time of 
the landing, with such operator. Where appropriate, a landing is also 
associated with a historical captain. However, a red snapper landings 
record during that period that is associated solely with an owner may be 
retained by that owner or transferred as follows:
    (A) An owner of a vessel with a valid commercial permit for Gulf 
reef fish on August 29, 1995, who transferred a vessel permit to another 
vessel owned by him or her will retain the red snapper landings record 
for the previous vessel.
    (B) An owner of a vessel with a valid commercial permit for Gulf 
reef fish on August 29, 1995, will retain the landings

[[Page 90]]

record of a permitted vessel if the vessel had a change of ownership to 
another entity without a substantive change in control of the vessel. It 
will be presumed that there was no substantive change in control of a 
vessel if a successor in interest received at least a 50 percent 
interest in the vessel as a result of the change of ownership whether 
the change of ownership was--
    (1) From a closely held corporation to its majority shareholder;
    (2) From an individual who became the majority shareholder of a 
closely held corporation receiving the vessel;
    (3) Between closely held corporations with a common majority 
shareholder; or
    (4) From one to another of the following: Husband, wife, son, 
daughter, brother, sister, mother, or father.
    (C) In other cases of transfer of a permit through change of 
ownership of a vessel, an owner of a vessel with a valid commercial 
permit for Gulf reef fish on August 29, 1995, will receive credit for 
the landings record of the vessel before his or her ownership only if 
there is a legally binding agreement for transfer of the landings 
record.
    (iv) Requests for transfers of landings records must be submitted to 
the RD and must be postmarked not later than December 14, 1995. The RD 
may require documentation supporting such request. After considering 
requests for transfers of landings records, the RD will advise each 
initial shareholder or applicant of his or her tentative allocation of 
shares.
    (3) Notification of status. The RD will advise each owner, operator, 
and historical captain for whom NMFS has a record of a red snapper 
landing during the period 1990 through 1992, including those who 
submitted such record under Amendment 9 to the FMP, of his or her 
tentative status as an initial shareholder and the tentative landings 
record that will be used to calculate his or her initial share.
    (4) Appeals. (i) A special advisory panel, appointed by the GMFMC to 
function as an appeals board, will consider written requests from 
persons who contest their tentative status as an initial shareholder, 
including historical captain status, or tentative landings record. In 
addition to considering written requests, the board may allow personal 
appearances by such persons before the board.
    (ii) The panel is only empowered to consider disputed calculations 
or determinations based on documentation submitted under Amendment 9 to 
the FMP regarding landings of red snapper during the period 1990 through 
1992, including transfers of such landings records, or regarding 
historical captain status. In addition, the panel may consider 
applications and documentation of landings not submitted under Amendment 
9 if, in the board's opinion, there is justification for the late 
application and documentation. The board is not empowered to consider an 
application from a person who believes he or she should be eligible 
because of hardship or other factors.
    (iii) A written request for consideration by the board must be 
submitted to the RD, postmarked not later than December 27, 1995, and 
must contain documentation supporting the allegations that form the 
basis for the request.
    (iv) The board will meet as necessary to consider each request that 
is submitted in a timely manner. Members of the appeals board will 
provide their individual recommendations for each appeal to the GMFMC, 
which will in turn submit its recommendation to the RD. The board and 
the GMFMC will recommend whether the eligibility criteria, specified in 
Amendment 8 to the FMP and paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, 
were correctly applied in each case, based solely on the available 
record including documentation submitted by the applicant. The GMFMC 
will also base its recommendation on the recommendations of the board. 
The RD will decide the appeal based on the above criteria and the 
available record, including documentation submitted by the applicant and 
the recommendation of the GMFMC. The RD will notify the appellant of his 
decision and the reason therefor, in writing, normally within 45 days of 
receiving the GMFMC's recommendation. The RD's decision will constitute 
the final administrative action by NMFS on an appeal.
    (v) Upon completion of the appeal process, the RD will issue share 
certificates to initial shareholders.

[[Page 91]]

    (5) Transfers of shares. The following restrictions apply to the 
transfer of shares:
    (i) The transfer of shares is prohibited through September 30, 1996.
    (ii) From October 1, 1996, through September 30, 1997, shares may be 
transferred only to other persons who are initial shareholders and are 
U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens.
    (d) Exceptions/additions to general measures. Other provisions of 
this part notwithstanding--
    (1) Management of the red snapper ITQ system extends to adjoining 
state waters in the manner stated in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of 
this section.
    (2) For a dealer to receive red snapper harvested from state waters 
adjoining the Gulf EEZ by or possessed on board a vessel with a 
commercial permit for Gulf reef fish, the dealer permit for Gulf reef 
fish specified in Sec. 622.4(a)(4) must have been issued to the dealer.
    (3) A copy of the dealer's permit must accompany each vehicle that 
is used to pick up from a fishing vessel red snapper from adjoining 
state waters harvested by or possessed on board a vessel with a 
commercial permit for Gulf reef fish.
    (4) As a condition of a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, 
without regard to where red snapper are harvested or possessed, a vessel 
with such permit must comply with the red snapper ITQ requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section; may not transfer or receive red snapper 
at sea; and must maintain red snapper with head and fins intact through 
landing, and the exceptions to that requirement contained in 
Sec. 622.38(d) do not apply to red snapper. Red snapper may be 
eviscerated, gilled, and scaled but must otherwise be maintained in a 
whole condition.
    (5) As a condition of a dealer permit for Gulf reef fish, as 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4) or under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, without regard to where red snapper are harvested or possessed, 
a permitted dealer must comply with the red snapper ITQ requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (6) In any month that a red snapper is received, a dealer must 
submit the report required under Sec. 622.5(c)(3)(ii). The ``Fish 
House'' parts of red snapper individual transferable coupons, received 
during the month in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must 
be submitted to the SRD with the report.
    (7) It is unlawful for a person to do any of the following:
    (i) Receive red snapper from a fishing vessel without a dealer 
permit for Gulf reef fish.
    (ii) Fail to carry a copy of the dealer's permit, as specified in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (iii) Fail to comply with a condition of a permit, as specified in 
paragraph (d)(4) or (d)(5) of this section.
    (iv) Fail to report red snapper received, as specified in paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section.

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 48415, Sept. 13, 1996, Sec. 622.16 was 
stayed indefinitely.


<R05>
Sec. 622.17  South Atlantic golden crab controlled access.

    (a) Applicability. For a person aboard a vessel to fish for golden 
crab in the South Atlantic EEZ, possess golden crab in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ, off-load golden crab from the South Atlantic EEZ, or sell 
golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, a commercial vessel 
permit for golden crab must be issued to the vessel and must be on 
board. It is a rebuttable presumption that a golden crab on board or 
off-loaded from a vessel in the South Atlantic was harvested from the 
South Atlantic EEZ.
    (b) Initial eligibility. A vessel is eligible for an initial 
commercial vessel permit for golden crab if the owner meets the 
documentation requirements described in paragraph (c) of this section 
substantiating his or her landings of golden crab harvested from the 
South Atlantic EEZ in quantities of at least 600 lb (272 kg) by April 7, 
1995, or at least 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) by September 1, 1995. Only the 
owner of a vessel at the time landings occurred may use those landings 
to meet the eligibility requirements described in this paragraph, except 
if that owner transferred the right to use those landings to a 
subsequent owner in writing as part of the vessel's sales agreement. If 
evidence of such agreement is provided to the RD, the subsequent owner 
may use those landings to meet the eligibility requirements instead of 
the owner of

[[Page 92]]

the vessel at the time the landings occurred.
    (c) Documentation of eligibility. The documentation requirements 
described in this paragraph are the only acceptable means for an owner 
to establish a vessel's eligibility for an initial permit. Failure to 
meet the documentation requirements, including submission of data as 
required, will result in failure to qualify for an initial commercial 
vessel permit. Acceptable sources of documentation include: Landings 
documented by the trip ticket systems of Florida or South Carolina as 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and data substantiating 
landings that occurred prior to establishment of the respective trip 
ticket systems or landings that occurred in North Carolina or Georgia as 
described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (1) Trip ticket data. NMFS has access to records of golden crab 
landings reported under the trip ticket systems in Florida and South 
Carolina. No further documentation or submission of these records is 
required if the applicant was the owner of the harvesting vessel at the 
time of the landings documented by these records. An applicant will be 
given printouts of trip ticket records for landings made when the 
applicant owned the harvesting vessel, and an applicant will have an 
opportunity to submit records of landings he or she believes should have 
been included on such printouts or to clarify allocation of landings 
shown on such printouts. Landings reported under these trip ticket 
systems and received by the respective states prior to December 31, 
1995, with such adjustments/clarifications for landings for which there 
is adequate documentation that they should have been included on the 
printouts, are conclusive as to landings in the respective states during 
the period that landing reports were required or voluntarily submitted 
by a vessel. For such time periods, landings data from other sources 
will not be considered for landings in these states.
    (2) Additional landings data. (i) An owner of a vessel that does not 
meet the criteria for initial eligibility for a commercial vessel permit 
based on landings documented by the trip ticket systems of Florida or 
South Carolina may submit documentation of required landings that either 
occurred prior to the implementation of the respective trip ticket 
systems or occurred in North Carolina or Georgia. Acceptable 
documentation of such landings consists of trip receipts or dealer 
records that definitively show the species known as golden crab; the 
vessel's name, official number, or other reference that clearly 
identifies the vessel; and dates and amounts of South Atlantic golden 
crab landings. In addition, a sworn affidavit may be submitted to 
document landings. A sworn affidavit is a notarized written statement 
wherein the individual signing the affidavit affirms under penalty of 
perjury that the information presented is accurate to the best of his or 
her knowledge, information, and belief.
    (ii) Documentation by a combination of trip receipts and dealer 
records is acceptable, but duplicate records for the same landings will 
not result in additional credit.
    (iii) Additional data submitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section must be attached to a Golden Crab Landings Data form, which is 
available from the RD.
    (3) Verification. Documentation of golden crab landings from the 
South Atlantic EEZ and other information submitted under this section 
are subject to verification by comparison with state, Federal, and other 
records and information. Submission of false documentation or 
information may disqualify a person from initial participation under the 
South Atlantic golden crab controlled access program.
    (d) Application procedure. Permit application forms are available 
from the RD. An application for an initial commercial vessel permit that 
is postmarked or hand-delivered after September 26, 1996, will not be 
accepted.
    (1) An application for a commercial vessel permit must be submitted 
and signed by the vessel owner (in the case of a corporate-owned vessel, 
an officer or shareholder who meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section; in the case of a partnership-owned vessel, a general 
partner who meets these requirements).
    (2) An owner must provide the following:

[[Page 93]]

    (i) A copy of the vessel's valid U.S. Coast Guard certificate of 
documentation or, if not documented, a copy of its valid state 
registration certificate.
    (ii) Vessel name and official number.
    (iii) Name, address, telephone number, and other identifying 
information of the vessel owner.
    (iv) Documentation of initial eligibility, as specified in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (v) The fishing zone in which the vessel will fish, as specified in 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (vi) Any other information concerning the vessel, gear 
characteristics, principal fisheries engaged in, or fishing areas, as 
specified on the application form.
    (vii) Any other information that may be necessary for the issuance 
or administration of the permit, as specified on the application form.
    (e) Issuance. (1) The RD will mail an initial commercial vessel 
permit to an applicant no later than October 28, 1996, if the 
application is complete and the eligibility requirements specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section are met.
    (2) Upon receipt of an incomplete application that is postmarked or 
hand-delivered on or before September 26, 1996, the RD will notify the 
applicant of the deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days of the date of the RD's notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (3) The RD will notify an applicant, in writing, no later than 
October 28, 1996, if the RD determines that the applicant fails to meet 
the eligibility requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) Appeals. (1) An appeal of the RD's decision regarding initial 
permit eligibility may be submitted to an ad hoc appeals committee 
appointed by the SAFMC.
    (2) The appeals committee is empowered only to deliberate whether 
the eligibility criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section were 
applied correctly to the appellant's application. In making that 
determination, the appeals committee members will consider only disputed 
calculations and determinations based on documentation provided as 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section, including transfers of 
landings records. The appeals committee is not empowered to consider 
whether a person should have been eligible for a commercial vessel 
permit because of hardship or other factors.
    (3) A written request for consideration of an appeal must be 
submitted within 30 days of the date of the RD's notification denying 
permit issuance and must provide written documentation supporting the 
basis for the appeal. Such a request must contain the appellant's 
acknowledgment that the confidentiality provisions of the Magnuson Act 
at 16 U.S.C. 1853(d) and subpart E of part 600 of this chapter are 
waived with respect to any information supplied by the RD to the SAFMC 
and its advisory bodies for purposes of receiving the recommendations of 
the appeals committee members on the appeal. An appellant may also make 
a personal appearance before the appeals committee.
    (4) The appeals committee will meet only once to consider appeals 
submitted within the time period specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section. Members of the appeals committee will provide their individual 
recommendations for each appeal to the RD. Members of the appeals 
committee may comment upon whether the eligibility criteria, specified 
in the FMP and in paragraph (b) of this section, were correctly applied 
in each case, based solely on the available record, including 
documentation submitted by the appellant. The RD will decide the appeal 
based on the initial eligibility criteria in paragraph (b) of this 
section and the available record, including documentation submitted by 
the appellant and the recommendations and comments from members of the 
appeals committee. The RD will notify the appellant of the decision and 
the reason therefore, in writing, normally within 30 days of receiving 
the recommendation from the appeals committee members. The RD's decision 
will constitute the final administrative action by NMFS on an appeal.
    (g) Display. A commercial vessel permit issued under this section 
must be carried on board the vessel. The operator of a vessel must 
present the permit

[[Page 94]]

for inspection upon the request of an authorized officer.
    (h) Fishing zones. (1) The South Atlantic EEZ is divided into three 
fishing zones for golden crab. A vessel owner must indicate on the 
initial application for a commercial vessel permit the zone in which the 
vessel will fish. A permitted vessel may fish for golden crab only in 
the zone shown on its permit. A vessel may possess golden crab only in 
that zone, except that other zones may be transited if the vessel 
notifies NMFS, Office of Enforcement, Southeast Region, St. Petersburg, 
FL, by telephone (813-570-5344) in advance and does not fish in an 
unpermitted zone. The designated fishing zones are as follows:
    (i) Northern zone--the South Atlantic EEZ north of 28 deg. N. lat.
    (ii) Middle zone--the South Atlantic EEZ from 25 deg. N. lat. to 
28 deg. N. lat.
    (iii) Southern zone--the South Atlantic EEZ south of 25 deg. N. lat.
    (2) An owner of a permitted vessel may have the zone specified on a 
permit changed only when the change is from the middle or southern zone 
to the northern zone. A request for such change must be submitted to the 
RD with the existing permit.
    (i) Transfer. (1) A valid golden crab permit may be transferred for 
use by another vessel by returning the existing permit(s) to the RD 
along with an application for a permit for the replacement vessel.
    (2) To obtain a commercial vessel permit via transfer, the owner of 
the replacement vessel must submit to the RD a valid permit for a vessel 
with a documented length overall, or permits for vessels with documented 
aggregate lengths overall, of at least 90 percent of the documented 
length overall of the replacement vessel.
    (j) Renewal. (1) In addition to the procedures and requirements of 
Sec. 622.4(h) for commercial vessel permit renewals, for a golden crab 
permit to be renewed, the SRD must have received reports for the 
permitted vessel, as required by Sec. 622.5(a)(1)(v), documenting that 
at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of golden crab were landed from the South 
Atlantic EEZ by the permitted vessel during at least one of the two 12-
month periods immediately prior to the expiration date of the vessel 
permit.
    (2) An existing permit for a vessel meeting the minimum golden crab 
landing requirement specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section may be 
renewed by following the procedure specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section. However, documentation of the vessel's initial eligibility need 
not be resubmitted.

[61 FR 43957, 43959, Aug. 27, 1996]

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 43959, Aug. 27, 1996, Sec. 622.17 was 
amended by adding paragraphs (a), (g), (i), and (j), effective Oct. 28, 
1996.


<R04>
                     Subpart C--Management Measures


<R05>
Sec. 622.30  Fishing years.

    The fishing year for species or species groups governed in this part 
is January 1 through December 31 except for the following:
    (a) Allowable octocoral--October 1 through September 30.
    (b) King and Spanish mackerel. The fishing year for the king and 
Spanish mackerel bag limits specified in Sec. 622.39(c)(1) is January 1 
through December 31. The following fishing years apply only for the king 
and Spanish mackerel quotas specified in Sec. 622.42(c):
    (1) Gulf migratory group king mackerel--July 1 through June 30.
    (2) All other migratory groups of king and Spanish mackerel--April 1 
through March 31.
    (c) Wreckfish--April 16 through April 15.


<R05>
Sec. 622.31  Prohibited gear and methods.

    In addition to the prohibited gear/methods specified in this 
section, see Secs. 622.33, 622.34, and 622.35 for seasonal/area 
prohibited gear/methods and Sec. 622.41 for species specific authorized 
and unauthorized gear/methods.
    (a) Explosives. An explosive (except an explosive in a powerhead) 
may not be used to fish in the Caribbean, Gulf, or South Atlantic EEZ. A 
vessel fishing in the EEZ for a species governed in this part, or a 
vessel for which a permit has been issued under Sec. 622.4, may not have 
on board any dynamite or similar explosive substance.

[[Page 95]]

    (b) Chemicals and plants. A toxic chemical may not be used or 
possessed in a coral area, and a chemical, plant, or plant-derived toxin 
may not be used to harvest a Caribbean coral reef resource in the 
Caribbean EEZ.
    (c) Fish traps. A fish trap may not be used in the South Atlantic 
EEZ. A fish trap deployed in the South Atlantic EEZ may be disposed of 
in any appropriate manner by the Assistant Administrator or an 
authorized officer.
    (d) Gillnets. A gillnet that has a float line that is more than 
1,000 yd (914 m) in length or a drift gillnet may not be used in the 
Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ to fish for king or Spanish 
mackerel; in the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ to fish for coastal 
migratory pelagic fish, other than bluefish; or in the Gulf EEZ to fish 
for bluefish. A vessel in, or having fished on a trip in, the Gulf, Mid-
Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ with such a gillnet or a drift gillnet 
on board may not have on board on that trip any of the indicated fish.
    (e) Longlines for wreckfish. A bottom longline may not be used to 
fish for wreckfish in the South Atlantic EEZ. A person aboard a vessel 
that has a longline on board may not retain a wreckfish in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ. For the purposes of this paragraph, a vessel is 
considered to have a longline on board when a power-operated longline 
hauler, a cable of diameter suitable for use in the longline fishery 
longer than 1.5 mi (2.4 km) on any reel, and gangions are on board. 
Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of a 
longline.
    (f) Poisons. (1) A poison, drug, or other chemical may not be used 
to fish for Caribbean reef fish in the Caribbean EEZ.
    (2) A poison may not be used to take Gulf reef fish in the Gulf EEZ.
    (3) A poison may not be used to fish for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper in the South Atlantic EEZ.
    (g) Power-assisted tools. A power-assisted tool may not be used in 
the Caribbean EEZ to take a Caribbean coral reef resource or in the Gulf 
or South Atlantic EEZ to take allowable octocoral, prohibited coral, or 
live rock.
    (h) Powerheads. A powerhead may not be used in the Caribbean EEZ to 
harvest Caribbean reef fish or in the EEZ off South Carolina to harvest 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper. The possession of a mutilated Caribbean 
reef fish in or from the Caribbean EEZ, or a mutilated South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper in or from the EEZ off South Carolina, and a powerhead 
is prima facie evidence that such fish was harvested by a powerhead.
    (i) Rebreathers and spearfishing gear. In the South Atlantic EEZ, a 
person using a rebreather may not harvest South Atlantic snapper-grouper 
with spearfishing gear. The possession of such snapper-grouper while in 
the water with a rebreather is prima facie evidence that such fish was 
harvested with spearfishing gear while using a rebreather.
    (j) Sea bass pots. A sea bass pot may not be used in the South 
Atlantic EEZ south of 28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle 
Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, FL). A sea bass pot deployed in the 
EEZ south of 28 deg.35.1' N. lat. may be disposed of in any appropriate 
manner by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer.
    (k) Spears and hooks. A spear, hook, or similar device may not be 
used in the Caribbean EEZ to harvest a Caribbean spiny lobster. The 
possession of a speared, pierced, or punctured Caribbean spiny lobster 
in or from the Caribbean EEZ is prima facie evidence of violation of 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 622.32  Prohibited and limited-harvest species.

    (a) General. The harvest and possession restrictions of this section 
apply without regard to whether the species is harvested by a vessel 
operating under a commercial vessel permit. The operator of a vessel 
that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for the limit applicable to that 
vessel.
    (b) Prohibited species. Prohibited species, by geographical area, 
are as follows:
    (1) Caribbean. (i) Caribbean prohibited coral may not be fished for 
or possessed in or from the Caribbean EEZ. The taking of Caribbean 
prohibited coral in the

[[Page 96]]

Caribbean EEZ is not considered unlawful possession provided it is 
returned immediately to the sea in the general area of fishing.
    (ii) Foureye, banded, and longsnout butterflyfish; jewfish; Nassau 
grouper; and seahorses may not be harvested or possessed in or from the 
Caribbean EEZ. Such fish caught in the Caribbean EEZ must be released 
immediately with a minimum of harm.
    (iii) Egg-bearing spiny lobster in the Caribbean EEZ must be 
returned to the water unharmed. An egg-bearing spiny lobster may be 
retained in a trap, provided the trap is returned immediately to the 
water. An egg-bearing spiny lobster may not be stripped, scraped, 
shaved, clipped, or in any other manner molested, in order to remove the 
eggs.
    (2) Gulf. (i) Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral taken as 
incidental catch in the Gulf EEZ must be returned immediately to the sea 
in the general area of fishing. In fisheries where the entire catch is 
landed unsorted, such as the scallop and groundfish fisheries, unsorted 
prohibited coral may be landed ashore; however, no person may sell or 
purchase such prohibited coral.
    (ii) Jewfish may not be harvested or possessed in or from the Gulf 
EEZ.
    (iii) Red drum may not be harvested or possessed in or from the Gulf 
EEZ. Red drum caught in the Gulf EEZ must be released immediately with a 
minimum of harm.
    (3) Mid-Atlantic. Red drum may not be harvested or possessed in or 
from the Mid-Atlantic EEZ south of a line extending in a direction of 
115 deg. from true north commencing at a point at 40 deg.29.6' N. lat., 
73 deg.54.1' W. long., such point being the intersection of the New 
Jersey/New York boundary with the 3- nm line denoting the seaward limit 
of state waters. Red drum caught in such portion of the Mid-Atlantic EEZ 
must be released immediately with a minimum of harm.
    (4) South Atlantic. (i) Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral 
taken as incidental catch in the South Atlantic EEZ must be returned 
immediately to the sea in the general area of fishing. In fisheries 
where the entire catch is landed unsorted, such as the scallop and 
groundfish fisheries, unsorted prohibited coral may be landed ashore; 
however, no person may sell or purchase such prohibited coral.
    (ii) Jewfish and Nassau grouper may not be harvested or possessed in 
or from the South Atlantic EEZ. Jewfish and Nassau grouper taken in the 
South Atlantic EEZ incidentally by hook-and-line must be released 
immediately by cutting the line without removing the fish from the 
water.
    (iii) Red drum may not be harvested or possessed in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ. Red drum caught in the South Atlantic EEZ must be 
released immediately with a minimum of harm.
    (iv) Wild live rock may not be harvested or possessed in the South 
Atlantic EEZ.
    (v) It is intended that no female golden crabs in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ be retained on board a vessel and that any female golden 
crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ be released in a manner that will 
ensure maximum probability of survival. However, to accommodate 
legitimate incidental catch and retention, the number of female golden 
crabs in or from the South Atlantic EEZ retained on board a vessel may 
not exceed 0.5 percent, by number, of all golden crabs on board. See 
Sec. 622.45(f)(1) regarding the prohibition of sale of female golden 
crabs.
    (vi) South Atlantic snapper-grouper may not be possessed in whole, 
gutted, or filleted form by a person aboard a vessel fishing for or 
possessing golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ or possessing a 
golden crab trap in the South Atlantic. Only the head, fins, and

\1\ On the seaward limit of Florida's waters.                           

    (g) Reef fish stressed area. The stressed area is that part of the 
Gulf EEZ shoreward of rhumb lines connecting, in

[[Page 99]]

order, the points listed in Table 2, and shown in Figures 3 and 4, in 
Appendix B of this part.
    (1) A powerhead may not be used in the stressed area to take Gulf 
reef fish. Possession of a powerhead and a mutilated Gulf reef fish in 
the stressed area or after having fished in the stressed area 
constitutes prima facie evidence that such reef fish was taken with a 
powerhead in the stressed area.
    (2) A roller trawl may not be used in the stressed area. Roller 
trawl means a trawl net equipped with a series of large, solid rollers 
separated by several smaller spacer rollers on a separate cable or line 
(sweep) connected to the footrope, which makes it possible to fish the 
gear over rough bottom, that is, in areas unsuitable for fishing 
conventional shrimp trawls. Rigid framed trawls adapted for shrimping 
over uneven bottom, in wide use along the west coast of Florida, and 
shrimp trawls with hollow plastic rollers for fishing on soft bottoms, 
are not considered roller trawls.
    (3) A fish trap may not be used in the stressed area. A fish trap 
used in the stressed area will be considered unclaimed or abandoned 
property and may be disposed of in any appropriate manner by the 
Assistant Administrator (including an authorized officer).
    (h) Texas closure. (1) From 30 minutes after sunset on May 15 to 30 
minutes after sunset on July 15, trawling, except trawling for royal red 
shrimp beyond the 100-fathom (183-m) depth contour, is prohibited in the

[61 FR 34934, July 3, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 48642, Sept. 16, 1996]

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 48642, Sept. 16, 1996, Sec. 622.34 was 
amended by adding paragraph (l), effective Oct. 16, 1996.


<R05>
Sec. 622.35  South Atlantic EEZ seasonal and/or area closures.

    (a) Allowable octocoral closed area. No person may harvest or 
possess allowable octocoral in the South Atlantic EEZ north of 
28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, 
Cape Canaveral, FL).
    (b) Longline closed areas. A longline may not be used to fish in the 
EEZ for South Atlantic snapper-grouper south of 27 deg.10' N. lat. (due 
east of the entrance to St. Lucie Inlet, FL); or north of 27 deg.10' N. 
lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 m), as shown 
on the latest edition of the largest scale NOAA chart of the location. A 
person aboard a vessel with a longline on board that fishes on a trip in 
the South Atlantic EEZ south of 27 deg.10' N. lat., or north of 
27 deg.10' N. lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 
m), is limited on that trip to the bag limit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper for which a bag limit is specified in Sec. 622.39(d)(1), and to 
zero for all other South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For the purpose of 
this paragraph, a vessel is considered to have a longline on board when 
a power-operated longline hauler, a cable or monofilament of diameter 
and length suitable for use in the longline fishery, and gangions are on 
board. Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of 
a longline.
    (c) Oculina Bank HAPC. The Oculina Bank HAPC is bounded on the north 
by 27 deg.53' N. lat., on the south by 27 deg.30' N. lat., on the east 
by 79 deg.56' W. long., and on the west by 80 deg.00' W. long. In the 
Oculina Bank HAPC:
    (1) Fishing with a bottom longline, bottom trawl, dredge, pot, or 
trap is prohibited.
    (2) A fishing vessel may not anchor, use an anchor and chain, or use 
a grapple and chain.
    (3) No fishing for South Atlantic snapper-grouper is allowed, and 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper may not be retained, in or from the HAPC. 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper taken incidentally in the HAPC by hook-
and-line gear must be released immediately by cutting the line without 
removing the fish from the water.
    (d) South Atlantic shrimp cold weather closure. (1) Pursuant to the 
procedures and criteria established in the FMP for the Shrimp Fishery of 
the South Atlantic Region, when Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, or 
South Carolina closes all or a portion of its waters of the South 
Atlantic to the harvest of brown, pink, and white shrimp, the Assistant 
Administrator may concurrently close the South Atlantic EEZ adjacent to 
the closed state waters by filing a notification of closure with the 
Office of the Federal Register. Closure of the adjacent EEZ will be 
effective until the ending date of the closure in state waters, but may 
be ended earlier based on the state's request. In the latter case, the 
Assistant Administrator will terminate a closure of the EEZ by filing a 
notification to that effect with the Office of the Federal Register.

[[Page 101]]

    (2) During a closure, as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section--
    (i) No person may trawl for brown shrimp, pink shrimp, or white 
shrimp in the closed portion of the EEZ (closed area); and no person may 
possess on board a fishing vessel brown shrimp, pink shrimp, or white 
shrimp in or from a closed area, except as authorized in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) No person aboard a vessel trawling in that part of a closed 
area that is within 25 nm of the baseline from which the territorial sea 
is measured may use or have on board a trawl net with a mesh size less 
than 4 inches (10.2 cm), as measured between the centers of opposite 
knots when pulled taut.
    (iii) Brown shrimp, pink shrimp, or white shrimp may be possessed on 
board a fishing vessel in a closed area, provided the vessel is in 
transit and all trawl nets with a mesh size less than 4 inches (10.2 
cm), as measured between the centers of opposite knots when pulled taut, 
are stowed below deck while transiting the closed area. For the purpose 
of this paragraph, a vessel is in transit when it is on a direct and 
continuous course through a closed area.

    (i) In SMZs specified in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through (xviii) and 
(e)(1) (xxii) through (xxix) of this section, the use of a gillnet or a 
trawl is prohibited; and fishing may be conducted only with hand-held 
hook-and-line gear (including a manual, electric, or hydraulic rod and 
reel) and spearfishing gear.
    (ii) In SMZs specified in paragraphs (e)(1) (xix) and (xx) of this 
section, a hydraulic or electric reel that is permanently affixed to the 
vessel is prohibited when fishing for South Atlantic snapper-grouper.
    (iii) In the SMZs specified in paragraphs (e)(1) (xix) and (xxi) of 
this section, the use of spearfishing gear is prohibited.
    (iv) In the SMZs specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (x) and 
(e)(1) (xxii) through (xxix) of this section, a powerhead may not be 
used to take South Atlantic snapper-grouper. Possession of a powerhead 
and a mutilated South Atlantic snapper-grouper in one of the specified 
SMZs, or after having fished in one of the SMZs, constitutes prima facie 
evidence that such fish was taken with a powerhead in the SMZ.
    (f) Golden crab trap closed areas. In the golden crab northern zone, 
a golden crab trap may not be deployed in waters less than 900 ft (274 
m) deep. In the golden crab middle and southern zones, a golden crab 
trap may not be deployed in waters less than 700 ft (213 m) deep. See 
Sec. 622.17(h) for specification of the golden crab zones.
    (g) Rock shrimp closed area. No person may trawl for rock shrimp in 
the area east of 80 deg.00' W. long. between 27 deg.30' N. lat. and 
28 deg.30' N. lat. shoreward of the 100-fathom (183-m) contour, as shown 
on the latest edition of NOAA chart 11460; and no person may possess 
rock

    The following limitations apply in the South Atlantic EEZ:
    (a) Greater amberjack spawning season. During April, each year, 
south of 28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly 
Building, Cape Canaveral, FL), the possession of greater amberjack in or 
from the EEZ on board a vessel that has a commercial permit for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper is limited to three per person during a single 
day, regardless of the number of trips or the duration of a trip.
    (b) Mutton snapper spawning season. During May and June, each year, 
the possession of mutton snapper in or from the EEZ on board a vessel 
that has a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper is 
limited to 10 per person during a single day, regardless of the number 
of trips or the duration of a trip.
    (c) Wreckfish spawning-season closure. From January 15 through April 
15, each year, no person may harvest or possess on a fishing vessel 
wreckfish in or from the EEZ; offload wreckfish from the EEZ; or sell or 
purchase wreckfish in or from the EEZ. The prohibition on sale or 
purchase of wreckfish does not apply to trade in wreckfish that were 
harvested, offloaded, and sold or purchased prior to January 15 and were 
held in cold storage by a dealer or processor.

<R05>
Sec. 622.38  Landing fish intact.

    The operator of a vessel that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for 
ensuring that fish on that vessel in the EEZ are maintained intact and, 
if taken from the EEZ, are maintained intact through offloading ashore, 
as specified in this section.
    (a) The following must be maintained with head and fins intact: A 
cobia in or from the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ; a king mackerel or 
Spanish mackerel in or from the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic 
EEZ; a South Atlantic snapper-grouper in or from the South Atlantic EEZ; 
a yellowtail snapper in or from the Caribbean EEZ; and, except as 
specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, a finfish in 
or from the Gulf EEZ. Such fish may be eviscerated, gilled, and scaled, 
but must otherwise be maintained in a whole condition.
    (b) A Caribbean spiny lobster in or from the Caribbean EEZ must be 
maintained with head and carapace intact.
    (c) Shark, swordfish, and tuna species are exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) In the Gulf EEZ:
    (1) Bait is exempt from the requirement to be maintained with head 
and fins intact.
    (i) For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(1), bait means--
    (A) Packaged, headless fish fillets that have the skin attached and 
are frozen or refrigerated;
    (B) Headless fish fillets that have the skin attached and are held 
in brine; or
    (C) Small pieces no larger than 3 in\3\ (7.6 cm\3\) or strips no 
larger than 3 inches by 9 inches (7.6 cm by 22.9 cm) that have the skin 
attached and are frozen, refrigerated, or held in brine.
    (ii) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section notwithstanding, a finfish 
or part thereof possessed in or landed from the Gulf EEZ that is 
subsequently sold or purchased as a finfish species, rather than as 
bait, is not bait.
    (2) Legal-sized finfish possessed for consumption at sea on the 
harvesting vessel are exempt from the requirement to have head and fins 
intact, provided--
    (i) Such finfish do not exceed any applicable bag limit;
    (ii) Such finfish do not exceed 1.5 lb (680 g) of finfish parts per 
person aboard; and
    (iii) The vessel is equipped to cook such finfish on board.
    (e) In the South Atlantic EEZ, a greater amberjack on or offloaded 
ashore from a vessel that has a permit specified in Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vi) 
may be deheaded and eviscerated, but must otherwise be maintained in a 
whole condition through offloading ashore.
    (f) A golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ must be 
maintained in whole condition through landing ashore. For the purposes 
of this paragraph, whole means a crab that is in its natural condition 
and that has not been gutted or separated into component pieces, e.g., 
clusters.

<R05>
Sec. 622.39  Bag and possession limits.

    (a) Applicability. (1) The bag and possession limits apply for 
species/species groups listed in this section in or from the EEZ. Bag 
limits apply to a person on a daily basis, regardless of the number of 
trips in a day. Possession limits apply to a person on a trip after the

[[Page 105]]

first 24 hours of that trip. The bag and possession limits apply to a 
person who fishes in the EEZ in any manner, except a person aboard a 
vessel in the EEZ that has on board the commercial vessel permit 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2) for the appropriate species/species 
group. However, see Sec. 622.32 for limitations on taking prohibited and 
limited-harvest species. The limitations in Sec. 622.32 apply without 
regard to whether the species is harvested by a vessel operating under a 
commercial vessel permit or by a person subject to the bag limits. The 
possession of a commercial vessel permit notwithstanding, the bag and 
possession limits apply when the vessel is operating as a charter vessel 
or headboat. A person who fishes in the EEZ may not combine a bag limit 
specified in this section with a bag or possession limit applicable to 
state waters. A species/species group subject to a bag limit specified 
in this section taken in the EEZ by a person subject to the bag limits 
may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where such transfer takes 
place, and such fish may not be transferred in the EEZ.
    (2) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section notwithstanding, bag and 
possession limits also apply for Gulf reef fish in or from the EEZ to a 
person aboard a vessel that has on board a commercial permit for Gulf 
reef fish--
    (i) When trawl gear or entangling net gear is on board. A vessel is 
considered to have trawl gear on board when trawl doors and a net are on 
board. Removal from the vessel of all trawl doors or all nets 
constitutes removal of trawl gear.
    (ii) When a longline or buoy gear is on board and the vessel is 
fishing or has fished on a trip in the reef fish longline and buoy gear 
restricted area specified in Sec. 622.34(c). A vessel is considered to 
have a longline on board when a power-operated longline hauler, a cable 
of diameter and length suitable for use in the longline fishery, and 
gangions are on board. Removal of any one of these three elements, in 
its entirety, constitutes removal of a longline.
    (iii) For a species/species group when its quota has been reached 
and closure has been effected.
    (b) Gulf reef fish--(1) Bag limits. (i) Greater amberjack--3.
    (ii) Groupers, combined, excluding jewfish--5.
    (iii) Red snapper--5.
    (iv) Snappers, combined, excluding red, lane, and vermilion 
snapper--10.
    (2) Possession limits. A person who is on a trip that spans more 
than 24 hours may possess no more than two daily bag limits, provided 
such trip is on a vessel that is operating as a charter vessel or 
headboat, the vessel has two licensed operators aboard, and each 
passenger is issued and has in possession a receipt issued on behalf of 
the vessel that verifies the length of the trip.
    (c) King and Spanish mackerel--(1) Bag limits. (i) Atlantic 
migratory group king mackerel--
    (A) Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic, other than off Florida--3.
    (B) Off Florida--2, which is the daily bag limit specified by 
Florida for its waters (Rule 46-12.004(1), Florida Administrative Code). 
If Florida changes its limit, the bag limit specified in this paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(B) will be changed to conform to Florida's limit, provided 
such limit does not exceed 5.
    (ii) Gulf migratory group king mackerel--2.
    (iii) Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel--10.
    (iv) Gulf migratory group Spanish mackerel--
    (A) Off Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--10.
    (B) Off Florida--10, which is the daily bag limit specified by 
Florida for its waters (Rule 46-23.005(1), Florida Administrative Code). 
If Florida changes its limit, the bag limit specified in this paragraph 
(c)(1)(iv)(B) will be changed to conform to Florida's limit, provided 
such limit does not exceed 10.
    (C) Off Texas--7, which is the daily bag limit specified by Texas 
for its waters (Rule 31-65.72(c)(4)(A), Texas Administrative Code). If 
Texas changes its limit, the bag limit specified in this paragraph 
(c)(1)(iv)(C) will be changed to conform to Texas' limit, provided such 
limit does not exceed 10.
    (2) Possession limits. A person who is on a trip that spans more 
than 24 hours may possess no more than two daily bag limits, provided 
such trip is on a

[[Page 106]]

vessel that is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, the vessel has 
two licensed operators aboard, and each passenger is issued and has in 
possession a receipt issued on behalf of the vessel that verifies the 
length of the trip.
    (d) South Atlantic snapper-grouper--(1) Bag limits. (i) Greater 
amberjack--3.
    (ii) Groupers, combined, excluding jewfish and Nassau grouper, and 
tilefishes--5.
    (iii) Hogfish in the South Atlantic off Florida--5.
    (iv) Snappers, combined, excluding cubera snapper measuring 30 
inches (76.2 cm), TL, or larger, in the South Atlantic off Florida, and 
excluding vermilion snapper--10, of which no more than 2 may be red 
snapper. (See Sec. 622.32(c)(2) for limitations on cubera snapper 
measuring 30 inches (76.2 cm), TL, or larger, in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ off Florida.)
    (v) Vermilion snapper--10.
    (2) Possession limits. Provided each passenger is issued and has in 
possession a receipt issued on behalf of the vessel that verifies the 
duration of the trip--
    (i) A person aboard a charter vessel or headboat on a trip that 
spans more than 24 hours may possess no more than two daily bag limits.
    (ii) A person aboard a headboat on a trip that spans more than 48 
hours and who can document that fishing was conducted on at least 3 days 
may possess no more than three daily bag limits.
    (3) Longline bag limits. Other provisions of this paragraph (d) 
notwithstanding, a person on a trip aboard a vessel for which the bag 
limits apply that has a longline on board is limited on that trip to the 
bag limit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper for which a bag limit is 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and to zero for all other 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For the purpose of this paragraph 
(d)(3), a vessel is considered to have a longline on board when a power-
operated longline hauler, a cable or monofilament of diameter and length 
suitable for use in the longline fishery, and gangions are on board. 
Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of a 
longline.


<R05>
Sec. 622.40  Limitations on traps and pots.

    (a) Tending--(1) Caribbean EEZ. A fish trap or Caribbean spiny 
lobster trap in the Caribbean EEZ may be pulled or tended only by a 
person (other than an authorized officer) aboard the fish trap or spiny 
lobster trap owner's vessel, or aboard another vessel if such vessel has 
on board written consent of the trap owner, or if the trap owner is 
aboard and has documentation verifying his identification number and 
color code. An owner's written consent must specify the time period such 
consent is effective and the trap owner's gear identification number and 
color code.
    (2) Gulf EEZ. A fish trap in the Gulf EEZ may be pulled or tended 
only by a person (other than an authorized officer) aboard the vessel 
with the fish trap endorsement to fish such trap or aboard another 
vessel if such vessel has on board written consent of the owner or 
operator of the vessel so endorsed. Such written consent is valid solely 
for the removal of fish traps from the EEZ, and harvest of fish 
incidental to such removal, when vessel or equipment breakdown prevents 
the vessel with the fish trap endorsement from retrieving its traps.
    (3) South Atlantic EEZ. A sea bass pot or golden crab trap in the 
South Atlantic EEZ may be pulled or tended only by a person (other than 
an authorized officer) aboard the vessel permitted to fish such pot or 
trap or aboard another vessel if such vessel has on board written 
consent of the owner or operator of the vessel so permitted. For golden 
crab only, a vessel with written consent on board must also possess a 
valid commercial vessel permit for golden crab.
    (b) Escape mechanisms--(1) Caribbean EEZ. (i) A fish trap used or 
possessed in the Caribbean EEZ must have a panel located on each of two 
sides of the trap, excluding the top, bottom, and side containing the 
trap entrance. The opening covered by a panel must measure not less than 
8 by 8 inches (20.3 by 20.3 cm). The mesh size of a panel may not be 
smaller than the mesh size of the trap. A panel must be attached to the 
trap with untreated jute twine with a diameter not exceeding \1/8\ inch 
(3.2 mm). An access door may serve as one of the panels, provided it is 
on an

[[Page 107]]

appropriate side, it is hinged only at its bottom, its only other 
fastening is untreated jute twine with a diameter not exceeding \1/8\ 
inch (3.2 mm), and such fastening is at the top of the door so that the 
door will fall open when such twine degrades. Jute twine used to secure 
a panel may not be wrapped or overlapped.
    (ii) A spiny lobster trap used or possessed in the Caribbean EEZ 
must contain on any vertical side or on the top a panel no smaller in 
diameter than the throat or entrance of the trap. The panel must be made 
of or attached to the trap by one of the following degradable materials:
    (A) Untreated fiber of biological origin with a diameter not 
exceeding \1/8\ inch (3.2 mm). This includes, but is not limited to tyre 
palm, hemp, jute, cotton, wool, or silk.
    (B) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire with a diameter not exceeding 
\1/16\ inch (1.6 mm), that is, 16 gauge wire.
    (2) Gulf EEZ. A fish trap used or possessed in the Gulf EEZ must 
have at least two escape windows on each of two sides, excluding the 
bottom (a total of four escape windows), that are 2 by 2 inches (5.1 by

door located opposite each side of the trap that has a funnel. The 
opening covered by each panel or access door must be 144 in<SUP>2 (929 
cm<SUP>2) or larger, with one dimension of the area equal to or larger 
than the largest interior axis of the trap's throat (funnel) with no 
other dimension less than 6 inches (15.2 cm). The hinges and fasteners 
of each panel or access door must be constructed of one of the following 
degradable materials:
    (i) Untreated jute string with a diameter not exceeding \3/16\ inch 
(4.8 mm) that is not wrapped or overlapped.
    (ii) Magnesium alloy, time float releases (pop-up devices) or 
similar magnesium alloy fasteners.
    (3) South Atlantic EEZ. (i) A sea bass pot that is used or possessed 
in the South Atlantic EEZ north of 28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the 
NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, FL) is required to have 
on at least one side, excluding top and bottom, a panel or door with an 
opening equal to or larger than the interior end of the trap's throat 
(funnel). The hinges and fasteners of each panel or door must be made of 
one of the following degradable materials:
    (A) Untreated hemp, jute, or cotton string with a diameter not 
exceeding \3/16\ inch (4.8 mm).
    (B) Magnesium alloy, timed float releases (pop-up devices) or 
similar magnesium alloy fasteners.
    (C) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire with a diameter not exceeding 
\1/16\ inch (1.6 mm), that is, 16 gauge wire.
    (ii) A golden crab trap that is used or possessed in the South 
Atlantic EEZ must have at least one escape gap or escape ring on each of 
two opposite vertical sides. The minimum allowable inside dimensions of 
an escape gap are 2.75 by 3.75 inches (7.0 by 9.5 cm); the minimum 
allowable inside diameter of an escape ring is 4.5 inches (11.4 cm). In 
addition to the escape gaps--
    (A) A golden crab trap constructed of webbing must have an opening 
(slit) at least 1 ft (30.5 cm) long that may be closed (relaced) only 
with untreated cotton string no larger than \3/16\ inch (0.48 cm) in 
diameter.
    (B) A golden crab trap constructed of material other than webbing 
must have an escape panel or door measuring at least 12 by 12 inches 
(30.5 by 30.5 cm), located on at least one side, excluding top and 
bottom. The hinges and fasteners of such door or panel must be made of 
either ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire no larger than 19 gauge (0.04 
inch (1.0 mm) in diameter) or untreated cotton string no larger than 3/
16 inch (4.8 mm) in diameter.
    (c) Construction requirements and mesh sizes--(1) Caribbean EEZ. A 
bare-wire fish trap used or possessed in the EEZ that has hexagonal mesh 
openings must have a minimum mesh size of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in the 
smallest dimension measured between centers of opposite strands. A bare-
wire fish trap used or possessed in the EEZ that has other than 
hexagonal mesh openings or a fish trap of other than bare wire, such as 
coated wire or plastic, used or possessed in the EEZ, must have a 
minimum mesh size of 2.0 inches (5.1 cm) in the smallest dimension 
measured between centers of opposite strands.
    (2) Gulf EEZ. A fish trap used or possessed in the Gulf EEZ must 
meet all of

[[Page 108]]

the following mesh size requirements (based on centerline measurements 
between opposite wires or netting strands):
    (i) A minimum of 2 in<SUP>2 (12.9 cm<SUP>2) opening for each mesh.
    (ii) One-inch (2.5-cm) minimum length for the shortest side.
    (iii) Minimum distance of 1 inch (2.5 cm) between parallel sides of 
rectangular openings, and 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) between parallel sides of 
square openings and of mesh openings with more than four sides.
    (iv) One and nine-tenths inches (4.8 cm) minimum distance for 
diagonal measures of mesh.
    (3) South Atlantic EEZ. (i) A sea bass pot used or possessed in the 
South Atlantic EEZ must have mesh sizes as follows (based on centerline 
measurements between opposite, parallel wires or netting strands):
    (A) Hexagonal mesh (chicken wire)--at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) 
between the wrapped sides;
    (B) Square mesh--at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) between sides; or
    (C) Rectangular mesh--at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the longer 
sides and 2 inches (5.1 cm) between the shorter sides.
    (ii) A golden crab trap deployed or possessed in the South Atlantic 
EEZ may not exceed 64 ft<SUP>3 (1.8 m<SUP>3) in volume in the northern 
zone or 48 ft<SUP>3 (1.4 m<SUP>3) in volume in the middle and southern 
zones. See Sec. 622.17(h) for specification of the golden crab zones.
    (d) Area-specific restrictions--(1) Gulf EEZ. In the Gulf EEZ, a 
fish trap may be pulled or tended only from official sunrise to official 
sunset. The operator of a vessel from which a fish trap is deployed in 
the Gulf EEZ must retrieve all the vessel's fish traps and return them 
to port on each trip. A fish trap that is not returned to port on a 
trip, and its attached line and buoy, may be disposed of in any 
appropriate manner by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized 
officer. The owner of such trap and/or the operator of the responsible 
vessel is subject to appropriate civil penalties. A buoy that floats on 
the surface must be attached to each fish trap, or to each end trap of 
traps that are connected by a line, used in the Gulf EEZ. The maximum 
allowable size for a fish trap fished in the Gulf EEZ shoreward of the 
50-fathom (91.4-m) isobath is 33 ft<SUP>3 (0.9 m<SUP>3) in volume. Fish 
trap volume is determined by measuring the external dimensions of the 
trap, and includes both the enclosed holding capacity of the trap and 
the volume of the funnel(s) within those dimensions. There is no size 
limitation for fish traps fished seaward of the 50-fathom (91.4-m) 
isobath. The maximum number of traps that may be assigned to, possessed, 
or fished in the Gulf EEZ by a vessel is 100.
    (2) South Atlantic EEZ. (i) In the South Atlantic EEZ, sea bass pots 
may not be used or possessed in multiple configurations, that is, two or 
more pots may not be attached one to another so that their overall 
dimensions exceed those allowed for an individual sea bass pot. This 
does not preclude connecting individual pots to a line, such as a 
``trawl'' or trot line.
    (ii) Rope is the only material allowed to be used for a mainline or 
buoy line attached to a golden crab trap, except that wire cable is 
allowed for these purposes through January 31, 1998.

Sec. 622.41  Species specific limitations.

    (a) Aquacultured live rock. In the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ:
    (1) Aquacultured live rock may be harvested only under a permit, as 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(3)(iii), and aquacultured live rock on a 
site may be harvested only by the person, or his or her employee, 
contractor, or agent, who has been issued the aquacultured live rock 
permit for the site. A person

[[Page 109]]

harvesting aquacultured live rock is exempt from the prohibition on 
taking prohibited coral for such prohibited coral as attaches to 
aquacultured live rock.
    (2) The following restrictions apply to individual aquaculture 
activities:
    (i) No aquaculture site may exceed 1 acre (0.4 ha) in size.
    (ii) Material deposited on the aquaculture site--
    (A) May not be placed over naturally occurring reef outcrops, 
limestone ledges, coral reefs, or vegetated areas.
    (B) Must be free of contaminants.
    (C) Must be nontoxic.
    (D) Must be placed on the site by hand or lowered completely to the 
bottom under restraint, that is, not allowed to fall freely.
    (E) Must be placed from a vessel that is anchored.
    (F) In the Gulf EEZ, must be distinguishable, geologically or 
otherwise (for example, be indelibly marked or tagged), from the 
naturally occurring substrate.
    (G) In the South Atlantic EEZ, must be geologically distinguishable 
from the naturally occurring substrate and, in addition, may be 
indelibly marked or tagged.
    (iii) A minimum setback of at least 50 ft (15.2 m) must be 
maintained from natural vegetated or hard bottom habitats.
    (3) Mechanically dredging or drilling, or otherwise disturbing, 
aquacultured live rock is prohibited, and aquacultured live rock may be 
harvested only by hand. In addition, the following activities are 
prohibited in the South Atlantic: Chipping of aquacultured live rock in 
the EEZ, possession of chipped aquacultured live rock in or from the 
EEZ, removal of allowable octocoral or prohibited coral from 
aquacultured live rock in or from the EEZ, and possession of prohibited 
coral not attached to aquacultured live rock or allowable octocoral, 
while aquacultured live rock is in possession. See the definition of 
``Allowable octocoral'' for clarification of the distinction between 
allowable octocoral and live rock. For the purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(3), chipping means breaking up reefs, ledges, or rocks into 
fragments, usually by means of a chisel and hammer.
    (4) Not less than 24 hours prior to harvest of aquacultured live 
rock, the owner or operator of the harvesting vessel must provide the 
following information to the NMFS Law Enforcement Office, Southeast 
Area, St. Petersburg, FL, telephone (813) 570-5344:
    (i) Permit number of site to be harvested and date of harvest.
    (ii) Name and official number of the vessel to be used in 
harvesting.
    (iii) Date, port, and facility at which aquacultured live rock will 
be landed.
    (b) Caribbean reef fish. A marine aquarium fish may be harvested in 
the Caribbean EEZ only by a hand-held dip net or by a hand-held slurp 
gun. For the purposes of this paragraph, a hand-held slurp gun is a 
device that rapidly draws seawater containing fish into a self-contained 
chamber, and a marine aquarium fish is a Caribbean reef fish that is 
smaller than 5.5 inches (14.0 cm), TL.
    (c) King and Spanish mackerel--(1) Prohibited gear. (i) In addition 
to the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 622.31, fishing gear is 
prohibited for use in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, and South Atlantic EEZ for 
migratory groups of king and Spanish mackerel as follows:
    (A) King mackerel, Gulf migratory group--all gear other than hook 
and line and run-around gillnet.
    (B) Spanish mackerel, Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups--purse 
seines.
    (ii) Except for the purse seine incidental catch allowance specified 
in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a vessel in the EEZ in the area of 
a migratory group or having fished in the EEZ in such area with 
prohibited gear on board may not possess any of the species for which 
that gear is prohibited.
    (2) Gillnets--(i) King mackerel. The minimum allowable mesh size for 
a gillnet used to fish in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ 
for king mackerel is 4.75 inches (12.1 cm), stretched mesh. A vessel in 
the EEZ, or having fished on a trip in the EEZ, with a gillnet on board 
that has a mesh size less than 4.75 inches (12.1 cm), stretched mesh, 
may possess on that trip an incidental catch of king mackerel that does 
not exceed 10 percent, by

[[Page 110]]

number, of the total lawfully possessed Spanish mackerel on board.
    (ii) Spanish mackerel. The minimum allowable mesh size for a gillnet 
used to fish in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ for 
Spanish mackerel is 3.5 inches (8.9 cm), stretched mesh. A vessel in the 
EEZ, or having fished on a trip in the EEZ, with a gillnet on board that 
has a mesh size less than 3.5 inches (8.9 cm), stretched mesh, may not 
possess on that trip any Spanish mackerel.
    (3) Purse seine incidental catch allowance. A vessel in the EEZ, or 
having fished in the EEZ, with a purse seine on board will not be 
considered as fishing, or having fished, for king or Spanish mackerel in 
violation of a prohibition of purse seines under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) 
of this section, or, in the case of king mackerel from the Atlantic 
migratory group, in violation of a closure effected in accordance with 
Sec. 622.43(a), provided the king mackerel on board does not exceed 1 
percent, or the Spanish mackerel on board does not exceed 10 percent, of 
all fish on board the vessel. Incidental catch will be calculated by 
number and/or weight of fish. Neither calculation may exceed the 
allowable percentage. Incidentally caught king or Spanish mackerel are 
counted toward the quotas provided for under Sec. 622.42(c) and are 
subject to the prohibition of sale under Sec. 622.43(a)(3)(iii).
    (d) South Atlantic snapper-grouper--(1) Authorized gear. Subject to 
the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 622.31, the following are the 
only gear types authorized in directed fishing for snapper-grouper in 
the South Atlantic EEZ:
    (i) Vertical hook-and-line gear, including a hand-held rod or a rod 
attached to a vessel (``bandit'' gear), in either case, with a manual, 
electric, or hydraulic reel.
    (ii) Spearfishing gear.
    (iii) Bottom longline.
    (iv) Sea bass pot.
    (2) Unauthorized gear.  All gear types other than those specified in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section are unauthorized gear and the following 
possession and transfer limitations apply.
    (i) A vessel with trawl gear on board that fishes in the EEZ on a 
trip may possess no more than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, in or from the EEZ on that trip. 
It is a rebuttable presumption that a vessel with more than 200 lb (90.7 
kg) of South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, on board 
harvested such fish in the EEZ.
    (ii) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a 
person aboard a vessel with unauthorized gear on board, other than trawl 
gear, that fishes in the EEZ on a trip is limited on that trip to:
    (A) South Atlantic snapper-grouper species for which a bag limit is 
specified in Sec. 622.39(d)(1)--the bag limit.
    (B) All other South Atlantic snapper-grouper--zero.
    (iii) South Atlantic snapper-grouper on board a vessel with 
unauthorized gear on board may not be transferred at sea, regardless of 
where such transfer takes place, and such snapper-grouper may not be 
transferred in the EEZ.
    (iv) No vessel may receive at sea any South Atlantic snapper-grouper 
from a vessel with unauthorized gear on board, as specified in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Use of sink nets off North Carolina. A vessel that has on board 
a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding 
wreckfish, that fishes in the EEZ off North Carolina on a trip with a 
sink net on board, may retain otherwise legal South Atlantic snapper-
grouper taken on that trip with vertical hook-and-line gear or a sea 
bass pot. For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(3), a sink net is a 
gillnet with stretched mesh measurements of 3 to 4.75 inches (7.6 to 
12.1 cm) that is attached to the vessel when deployed.
    (e) South Atlantic golden crab. Traps are the only fishing gear 
authorized in directed fishing for golden crab in the South Atlantic 
EEZ. Golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ may not be retained 
on board a vessel possessing or using unauthorized gear.

Sec. 622.44  Commercial trip limits.

    Commercial trip limits are limits on the amount of the applicable 
species that may be possessed on board or

[[Page 113]]

landed, purchased, or sold from a vessel per day. A person who fishes in 
the EEZ may not combine a trip limit specified in this section with any 
trip or possession limit applicable to state waters. A species subject 
to a trip limit specified in this section taken in the EEZ may not be 
transferred at sea, regardless of where such transfer takes place, and 
such species may not be transferred in the EEZ. For fisheries governed 
by this part, commercial trip limits apply as follows:
    (a) King mackerel--(1) Atlantic group. (i) North of 29 deg.25' N. 
lat., which is a line directly east from the Flagler/Volusia County, FL, 
boundary, king mackerel in or from the EEZ may not be possessed on board 
or landed from a vessel in a day in amounts exceeding 3,500 lb (1,588 
kg).
    (ii) In the area between 29 deg.25' N. lat. and 28 deg.47.8' N. 
lat., which is a line directly east from the Volusia/Brevard County, FL

eastern zone as follows. (See Sec. 622.42(c)(1)(i) for specification of 
the eastern zone and Sec. 622.42(c)(1)(i)(A)(3) for specifications of 
the subzones in the eastern zone.)
    (i) Florida east coast subzone. In the Florida east coast subzone, 
king mackerel in or from the EEZ may be possessed on board or landed 
from a vessel for which a commercial permit for king and Spanish 
mackerel has been issued, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(iv)--
    (A) From November 1, each fishing year, until 75 percent of the 
subzone's fishing year quota of king mackerel has been harvested--in 
amounts not exceeding 50 king mackerel per day.
    (B) From the date that 75 percent of the subzone's fishing year 
quota of king mackerel has been harvested until a closure of the Florida 
east coast subzone has been effected under Sec. 622.43(a)--in amounts 
not exceeding 25 king mackerel per day. However, if 75 percent of the 
subzone's quota has not been harvested by March 1, the vessel limit 
remains at 50 king mackerel per day until the subzone's quota is filled 
or until March 31, whichever occurs first.
    (ii) Florida west coast subzone--(A) Gillnet gear. (1) In the 
Florida west coast subzone, king mackerel in or from the EEZ may be 
possessed on board or landed from a vessel for which a commercial permit 
with a gillnet endorsement has been issued, as required under 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(ii), from July 1, each fishing year, until a closure of 
the Florida west coast subzone's fishery for vessels fishing with run-
around gillnets has been effected under Sec. 622.43(a)--in amounts not 
exceeding 25,000 lb (11,340 kg) per day.
    (2) In the Florida west coast subzone:
    (i) King mackerel in or from the EEZ may be possessed on board or 
landed from a vessel that uses or has on board a run-around gillnet on a 
trip only when such vessel has on board a commercial permit for king and 
Spanish mackerel with a gillnet endorsement.
    (ii) King mackerel from the west coast subzone landed by a vessel 
for which such commercial permit with endorsement has been issued will 
be counted against the run-around gillnet quota of 
Sec. 622.42(c)(1)(i)(A)(2)(ii).
    (iii) King mackerel in or from the EEZ harvested with gear other 
than run-around gillnet may not be retained on board a vessel for which 
such commercial permit with endorsement has been issued.
    (B) Hook-and-line gear. In the Florida west coast subzone, king 
mackerel in or from the EEZ may be possessed on board or landed from a 
vessel with a

[[Page 114]]

commercial permit for king and Spanish mackerel, as required by 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(iv), and operating under the hook-and-line gear quota 
in Sec. 622.42(c)(1)(i)(A)(2)(i):
    (1) From July 1, each fishing year, until 75 percent of the 
subzone's hook-and-line gear quota has been harvested--in amounts not 
exceeding 125 king mackerel per day.
    (2) From the date that 75 percent of the subzone's hook-and-line 
gear quota has been harvested until a closure of the west coast 
subzone's hook-and-line fishery has been effected under Sec. 622.43(a)--
in amounts not exceeding 50 king mackerel per day.
    (iii) Notice of trip limit changes. The Assistant Administrator, by 
filing a notification of trip limit change with the Office of the 
Federal Register, will effect the trip limit changes specified in 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section when the 
requisite harvest level has been reached or is projected to be reached.
    (b) Spanish mackerel. (1) Commercial trip limits are established for 
Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel as follows:
    (i) North of 30 deg.42'45.6'' N. lat., which is a line directly east 
from the Georgia/Florida boundary, Spanish mackerel in or from the EEZ 
may not be possessed on board or landed in a day from a vessel for which 
a permit for king and Spanish mackerel has been issued, as required 
under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(iv), in amounts exceeding 3,500 lb (1,588 kg).
    (ii) South of 30 deg.42'45.6'' N. lat., Spanish mackerel in or from

    (2) Tuesdays and Thursdays--not exceeding 1,500 lb (680 kg).
    (3) Saturdays and Sundays--not exceeding 500 lb (227 kg).
    (C) After 75 percent of the adjusted quota is taken until 100 
percent of the adjusted quota is taken, in amounts not exceeding 1,000 
lb (454 kg).
    (D) After 100 percent of the adjusted quota is taken through the end 
of the fishing year, in amounts not exceeding 500 lb (227 kg).
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the 
adjusted quota is 4.45 million lb (2.02 million kg). The adjusted quota 
is the quota for Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel reduced by an 
amount calculated to allow continued harvests of Atlantic migratory 
group Spanish mackerel at the rate of 500 lb (227 kg) per vessel per day 
for the remainder of the fishing year after the adjusted quota is 
reached. By filing a notification with the Office of the Federal 
Register, the Assistant Administrator will announce when 75 percent and 
100 percent of the adjusted quota is reached or is projected to be 
reached.
    (3) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a day 
starts at 6 a.m., local time, and extends for 24 hours. If a vessel 
terminates a trip prior to 6 a.m., but retains Spanish mackerel on board 
after that time, the Spanish mackerel retained on board will not be 
considered in possession during the succeeding day, provided the vessel 
is not underway between 6 a.m. and the time such Spanish mackerel are 
unloaded, and provided such Spanish mackerel are unloaded prior to 6 
p.m.
    (c) Golden tilefish and snowy grouper. A person who fishes in the

    (ii) After the fishing year quota specified in Sec. 622.42(e)(1) is 
reached, 300 lb (136 kg).
    (d) Gulf wild live rock. Until the quota for wild live rock from the 
Gulf EEZ is reached in 1996, a daily vessel limit of twenty-five 5-
gallon (19-L) buckets, or volume equivalent (16.88 ft\3\ (478.0 L)), 
applies to the harvest or possession of wild live rock in or from the 
Gulf EEZ, regardless of the number or duration of trips.
    (e) Gulf red snapper. This paragraph (e) is effective through 
December 31, 1997.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the trip 
limit for red snapper in or from the Gulf for a vessel that has on board 
a valid commercial permit for Gulf reef fish is 200 lb (91 kg), round or 
eviscerated weight.
    (2) The trip limit for red snapper in or from the Gulf for a vessel 
that has on board a valid commercial permit for Gulf reef fish and a 
valid Gulf red snapper endorsement is 2,000 lb (907 kg), round or 
eviscerated weight.
    (3) As a condition of a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, 
as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(v), without regard to where red 
snapper are harvested or possessed, a vessel with such permit--
    (i) May not possess red snapper in or from the Gulf in excess of the 
appropriate vessel trip limit, as specified in paragraph (e)(1) or

                     Subpart B--Management Measures


<R05>
Sec. 628.20  Fishing year.

    The fishing year is from January 1 through December 31.


<R05>
Sec. 628.21  Possession limit.

    (a) Possession limit. (1) No person shall possess more than ten 
bluefish unless he/she has a permit meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 628.4(a).
    (2) Bluefish caught while in possession of a permit meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 628.4(a) must be kept separate from the pooled 
catch and in the possession of the permit holder at all times.
    (3) If Atlantic bluefish are filleted into two or more sections, 
such fillets shall be deemed to be whole Atlantic bluefish using a ratio 
of 1:2 (two fillets to one whole fish). If Atlantic bluefish are 
filleted into a single (butterfly) fillet, such fillets shall be deemed 
to be whole Atlantic bluefish.
    (4) Atlantic bluefish harvested from party and charter boats or 
other vessels carrying more than one person may be commingled. 
Compliance with the daily possession limit will be determined by 
dividing the number of Atlantic bluefish on board by the number of 
persons on board, provided, however, that if a person or persons on 
board are fishing under a permit meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 628.4(a), his/her catch shall not be counted for determining 
compliance with the possession limit if it is maintained in the 
possession of such person(s). If there is a violation of the possession 
limit on board a vessel carrying more than one person, the violation 
shall be deemed to have been committed by the owner and/or operator.
    (b) Adjustment of the possession limit. The Secretary may adjust the 
possession limit within a range of 0 to 15 Atlantic bluefish based on a 
recommendation of the Council and Commission. The Secretary will publish 
a notice of any proposed adjustment, together with the basis for such 
adjustment in the Federal Register. The public may comment on the 
adjustment for 15 days after the date of the publication. After 
consideration of public comments, the Secretary may publish a notice of 
any adjustment in the possession limit in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 628.22  Catch monitoring, commercial controls, and gear restrictions.

    (a) The Committee will review bluefish catch statistics, a 
projection of the commercial share for the next fishing year, and the 
most recent stock assessment prior to August 15th of each year. The 
Committee will report to the Council and the Commission.
    (b) The Council and the Commission will review the report of the 
Committee. If the report indicates that the commercial catch for the 
next fishing year will equal or exceed 20 percent of the total catch 
(recreational catch plus commercial landings) of Atlantic bluefish, the 
Council and Commission will propose the commercial controls to be 
implemented at the start of the upcoming year. If the report indicates 
that the commercial catch will be greater than 17 percent but less than 
20 percent of the total catch of Atlantic bluefish, or that the 
commercial share for the last full year is 50 percent greater than

[[Page 129]]

the previous year's commercial share, the Council and Commission will 
determine whether commercial controls are necessary. In making such a 
determination the Council and Commission will consider:
    (1) The most recent catch data;
    (2) Trends in the fishery; and
    (3) Any other relevant factors.
    (c) If the catch in the commercial fishery is projected to equal or 
exceed the 20 percent limit during the upcoming year, then a State 
allocation system will be implemented. This will entail the use of 
landings data from the most recent 10-year period for each State, to 
determine the average percentage of each State's coastwide commercial 
landings. These percentages will be used to determine the amount of the 
coastwide quota allocated to each State. Quotas will apply to landings 
in each State, regardless of where the bluefish were caught.
    (d) If whole Atlantic bluefish are processed into fillets at sea, 
then fillet weight will be converted to whole weight at the State of 
landing by multiplying fillet weight by 2.5. If whole Atlantic bluefish 
are headed and gutted at sea, then the conversion is accomplished by 
multiplying headed/gutted weight by 1.5.
    (e) If the Council concludes that the increase in the commercial 
catch is attributable to the use of purse seines, pair trawls, or 
encircling (runaround) gillnets, then it will propose restrictions 
applicable to that gear type. In determining what restrictions are 
necessary to control the catch of Atlantic bluefish by commercial 
fishermen using these gear, the Council may consider:
    (1) Trip limits;
    (2) Area closures;
    (3) Banning the use of these gear types; or
    (4) Any other measures it deems appropriate.
    (f) The Regional Director will review any gear restriction(s) 
proposed by the Council. If the Regional Director concurs that the 
proposed gear restrictions are consistent with the goals and objectives 
of the FMP, the national standards, and other applicable law, the 
Regional Director will recommend that the Secretary publish a notice of 
the proposed restriction in the Federal Register with a 30-day public 
comment period. After consideration of public comments, the Secretary 
may publish a notice in the Federal Register specifying the final 
restriction(s).
    (g) The Secretary may rescind a notice of restriction in the Federal 
Register if he finds, based on the advice of the Council through the 
process set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, that the 
restriction is no longer necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 628.23  Closure of fishery.

    The Regional Director shall close the commercial fishery for 
Atlantic bluefish in the EEZ if the commercial fisheries for Atlantic 
bluefish have been closed in all Atlantic coastal States.

Sec. 630.5  Recordkeeping and reporting.

    (a) Fishing vessel reports. (1) The owner and operator of a vessel 
for which a vessel permit has been issued under Sec. 630.4 must ensure 
that a daily logbook form is maintained of the vessel's swordfishing 
effort, catch, and disposition on logbook forms available from the 
Science and Research Director. Such forms must be submitted to the 
Science and Research Director postmarked not later than the 7th day 
after sale of the swordfish off-loaded from a trip. If no fishing 
occurred during a month, a report so stating must be submitted in 
accordance with instructions provided with the logbook forms. Logbooks 
must be kept on board the vessel at all times.
    (2) The owner or operator of a vessel for which a vessel permit has 
been issued under Sec. 630.4 must insure that copies of tally sheets are 
submitted for all swordfish off-loaded and for other species off-loaded 
with the swordfish, including, but not limited to, shark, yellowfin 
tuna, bigeye tuna, and albacore. Each tally sheet must show the dealer

[[Page 133]]

to whom swordfish and other species were transferred, the date 
transferred, and the carcass weight of each swordfish transferred and of 
each of the other species for which individual carcass weights are 
normally recorded, including, but not limited to, shark, yellowfin tuna, 
bigeye tuna, and albacore. For species not individually weighed, tally 
sheets must record total weights by market category. Copies of tally 
sheets must be submitted with the logbook forms required under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Dealer reports. (1) A dealer who has been issued a dealer permit 
under Sec. 630.4 must submit a report to the Science and Research 
Director twice each month. A report form is available from the Science 
and Research Director. The following information must be included in 
each report:
    (i) Name, address, and permit number of the dealer;
    (ii) Names and official numbers of fishing vessels from which 
swordfish were received;
    (iii) Dates of receipt of swordfish; and
    (iv) Listed by each port and county where swordfish were off-loaded 
from fishing vessels:
    (A) Total weight (pounds) by market category for swordfish, and for 
other species received with the swordfish, including, but not limited 
to, shark, yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna, and albacore; and
    (B) Price per pound or total value paid by market category for 
swordfish and other species, to the extent that such price information 
is known at the time of reporting.
    (2) A report of swordfish and other applicable species received by a 
dealer on the 1st through the 15th days of each month must be submitted 
to the Science and Research Director postmarked not later than the 20th 
day of that month. A report of swordfish received by a dealer on the 
16th through the last day of each month must be submitted to the Science 
and Research Director postmarked not later than the 5th day of the 
following month. If no swordfish were received during a reporting 
period, a report so stating must be submitted postmarked as specified 
for that respective reporting period.
    (3) The reporting requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
may be satisfied by providing a copy of each appropriate weigh-out sheet 
and/or sales record, provided such weigh-out sheet and/or sales record, 
by itself or combined with the form available from the Science and 
Research Director, includes all of the required information.
    (4) For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, for a 
swordfish off-loaded from a fishing vessel in an Atlantic coastal state 
from Maine through Virginia, Science and Research Director means the

Sec. 630.21  Restrictions on transfer, off-loading, and sale.

    (a) A swordfish harvested from the North Atlantic Ocean, including 
the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5 deg.N. latitude may not 
be transferred at sea, regardless of where the transfer takes place; and 
in the North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean 
Sea, north of 5 deg.N. latitude a swordfish may not be transferred at 
sea regardless of where the swordfish was harvested.
    (b) A swordfish harvested from or possessed in the North Atlantic 
Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5 deg.N. 
latitude may be initially sold, traded, or bartered or attempted to be 
sold, traded, or bartered only by an owner or operator of a vessel that 
has been issued a vessel permit under Sec. 630.4, except that a 
swordfish that is off-loaded in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands 
from a non-permitted vessel that fished exclusively shoreward of the 
outer boundary of the EEZ around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands 
with only handline gear aboard may be sold, traded, or bartered.
    (c) A swordfish harvested from or possessed in the North Atlantic 
Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5 deg.N. 
latitude may be initially purchased, traded, or bartered or attempted to 
be purchased, traded, or bartered only by a dealer having a dealer 
permit issued under Sec. 630.4.

[[Page 136]]

    (d) A swordfish harvested from or possessed in the North Atlantic

Sec. 630.22  Gear restrictions.

    A drift gillnet with a total length of 2.5 kilometers or more may 
not be used to fish for swordfish. A vessel using or having aboard a 
drift gillnet with a total length of 2.5 kilometers or more may not 
possess a swordfish.


<R05>
Sec. 630.23  Harvest limitations.

    (a) Minimum size. The minimum allowable size for possession on board 
a fishing vessel for a swordfish taken from the management unit is 29 
inches (73 cm) carcass length, measured along the body contour (i.e., a 
curved measurement) from the cleithrum to the anterior portion of the 
caudal keel (CK measurement) or, if swordfish are weighed, 33 lb (15 kg) 
dressed weight. The cleithrum is the semicircular bony structure that 
forms the posterior edge of the gill opening. Measurement must be made 
at the point on the cleithrum that provides the shortest possible CK 
measurement (Figure 1 to part 630).
    (b) Carcass condition. A swordfish possessed in the North Atlantic 
Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, north of 
5 deg.N. latitude must be in whole or dressed form, and a swordfish 
landed from a fishing vessel in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or 
Caribbean coastal state must be maintained in whole or dressed form 
through off-loading, except such swordfish as are damaged by shark 
bites. A shark-bit swordfish for which the remainder of the carcass is 
less than the minimum size limit specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section may not be landed.
    (c) Vessel trip limits. In 1996, vessels issued a swordfish permit 
under Sec. 630.4 may not land from, or possess during, a single trip 
more than 31,600 lb (14,334 kg) dressed weight of swordfish, unless a 
closure has been effected under Sec. 630.25.

<R05>
Sec. 630.24  Quotas.

    (a) Applicability. A swordfish harvested from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock by a vessel of the United States in other than the 
recreational fishery is counted against the directed-fishery gear quota 
or the by catch quota. A swordfish harvested by drift gillnet, longline, 
or harpoon and landed before the effective date of a closure for that 
gear, done pursuant to Sec. 630.25(a)(1), is counted against the 
applicable directed-fishery gear quota. After a gear closure, a 
swordfish landed by a vessel using or possessing gear for which a 
bycatch is allowed under Sec. 630.25(c) is counted against the bycatch 
allocation specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Notwithstanding 
the above, a swordfish harvested by a vessel using or possessing gear 
other than drift gillnet, longline, harpoon, or rod and reel is counted 
against the bycatch quota specified in paragraph (c) of this section at 
all times.
    (b) Directed-fishery quota.
    (1) The directed fishery quota for the period January 1, 1996, 
through May 31, 1996, is 1,021 mt dressed weight for the longline 
fishery, 22.5 mt dressed weight for the drift gillnet fishery, and 106 
mt dressed weight for the bycatch fishery.
    (2) The annual quota for the directed fishery for swordfish is 2,371 
mt dressed weight, divided into two semiannual quotas as follows:
    (i) For the semiannual period June 1 through November 30:
    (A) 23.45 mt dressed weight, that may be harvested by drift gillnet.
    (B) 1,162.05 mt dressed weight that may be harvested by longline and 
harpoon. To account for harvested fish that are discarded dead, only 
1064.44 mt dressed weight, may be landed in this category.
    (ii) For the semiannual period December 1 through May 31:
    (A) 23.45 mt dressed weight that may be harvested by drift gillnet.

[[Page 137]]

    (B) 1,162.05 mt dressed weight that may be harvested by longline and 
harpoon. To account for harvested fish that are discarded dead, only 
1064.44 mt dressed weight may be landed in this category.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the sub-quotas 
for the drift gillnet fishery for January 1 - November 30, 1996, are 
available as follows:
    (i) For the period January 1 through June 30, 22.5 mt dressed 
weight; and
    (ii) For the period July 1 through November 30, 23.45 mt dressed 
weight.
    (4) A swordfish will be deemed to have been harvested by a drift 
gillnet when it is aboard, or off-loaded in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, 
or Caribbean coastal state from, a vessel using or having aboard a drift 
gillnet or when it is aboard, or off-loaded in an Atlantic, Gulf of 
Mexico, or Caribbean coastal state from, a vessel which used or had 
aboard a drift gillnet during its current or most recent fishing trip.
    (c) Bycatch quota. The annual bycatch quota for swordfish is 560,000 
pounds (254,014 kg), dressed weight.
    (d) Adjustments to annual quotas.
    (1) NMFS will reevaluate the annual total allowable catch, the 
annual directed-fishery quota, the annual bycatch quota, bycatch limits 
in the non-directed fishery, and the harpoon gear set-aside each year. 
For the purpose of this evaluation, NMFS will consider the best 
available scientific information regarding the following factors:
    (i) Swordfish stock abundance assessments;
    (ii) Swordfish stock age and size composition;
    (iii) Catch and effort in the swordfish fishery; and
    (iv) Consistency with ICCAT recommendations.
    (2) NMFS may, at its discretion, convene a panel of scientists with 
expertise in swordfish stock assessment for the purpose of providing 
recommendations for adjustments to annual quotas.
    (3) NMFS will prepare a report of its evaluations, a regulatory 
impact review, and an environmental assessment.
    (4) Any adjustments to the 12-month directed-fishery quota will be 
apportioned equally between the June 1 through November 30 and December 
1 through May 31 semiannual periods.
    (5) NMFS will announce any adjustments to the annual quotas by 
publication of a proposed rule in the Federal Register, providing for a 
minimum of a 30-day comment period. The report of evaluations and any 
regulatory impact review and environmental assessment will be made 
available to the public. The Assistant Administrator will take into 
consideration all information received during this comment period and 
will publish a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (e) NMFS may adjust the December 1 through May 31 semiannual 
directed-fishery quota and gear quotas to reflect actual catches during 
the June 1 through November 30 semiannual period, provided that the 12-
month directed-fishery and gear quotas are not exceeded.
    (f) Inseason adjustments to the bycatch and directed fishery quotas. 
(1) If NMFS determines that the annual bycatch quota will not be taken 
before the end of the fishing year, the excess quota may be allocated to 
the directed-fishery quotas pursuant to the requirements and procedures 
in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
    (2) If NMFS determines that it is necessary to close the directed 
fishery, any estimated overharvest or underharvest directed-fishery 
quota available immediately prior to that closure will be applied to the 
annual bycatch quota and will be used to adjust the annual bycatch quota 
accordingly.
    (g) Adjustments to gear quotas. If NMFS determines that the annual 
directed-fishery or bycatch quotas must be adjusted pursuant to 
paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, the annual or semi-annual gear 
quotas will be adjusted so that the new gear quotas represent the same 
proportion (percentage) of the adjusted quota as they did of the quota 
before adjustment.
    (h) Notice of adjustments. (1) NMFS will announce a proposed 
adjustment in management measures pursuant to paragraph (e), (f), or (g) 
of this section by publication of a proposed rule in the Federal 
Register. The proposed rule will provide for public comment unless NMFS 
finds for good cause that such

[[Page 138]]

public comment is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest. NMFS will take into consideration all information received 
during the comment period and will publish the approved adjustment in 
management measures as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (2) If NMFS finds for good cause that public comment on an 
adjustment in management measures pursuant to paragraph (e), (f), or (g) 
of this section is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest, such adjustment will be published as an interim final rule 
with a 15-day public comment period commencing on the date of 
publication.

<R05>
Sec. 630.25  Closures and bycatch limits.

    (a) Notice of closure. (1) When a directed-fishery annual, semi-
annual, or gear quota specified in Sec. 630.24 is reached, or is 
projected to be reached, NMFS will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register to close the entire directed fishery for fish from the North 
Atlantic swordfish stock, the drift gillnet fishery, or the harpoon and 
longline fisheries, as appropriate. The effective date of such notice 
will be at least 14 days after the date such notice is filed at the 
Office of the Federal Register. The closure will remain in effect until 
an additional directed-fishery or gear quota becomes available.
    (2) When the bycatch quota specified in Sec. 630.24(c) is reached, 
or is projected to be reached, NMFS will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register to prohibit further possession or retention of Atlantic 
swordfish by vessels of the United States. The effective date of such 
notice will be at least 14 days after the date such notice is filed at 
the Office of the Federal Register. The closure will remain in effect 
until a new annual bycatch quota becomes available.
    (b) Special set-aside for harpoon gear.  The procedures of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section notwithstanding, during the June 1 through 
November 30 semiannual period, swordfish not exceeding 21,500 lb (9,752 
kg), dressed weight, may be set aside for the harpoon segment of the 
fishery. If NMFS determines that the harpoon and longline quota in this 
semi-annual period will be harvested before the harpoon segment of the 
fishery has had an opportunity to harvest the set-aside amount, the 
longline segment of the fishery will be closed and the harpoon segment 
will remain open until the set-aside amount is reached. The basis for 
such determination by NMFS will be published in the Federal Register in 
the closure notice.
    (c) Bycatch limits during a directed-fishery closure. (1) During a 
closure of the drift gillnet fishery, aboard a vessel using or having 
aboard a drift gillnet--
    (i) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock; and
    (ii) No more than two swordfish per trip may be possessed in the 
North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, 
north of 5 deg.N. latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or 
Caribbean coastal state.
    (2) During a closure of the longline fishery, aboard a vessel using 
or having aboard a longline and not having aboard harpoon gear--
    (i) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock; and
    (ii) No more than 15 swordfish per trip may be possessed in the 
North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, 
north of 5<SUP>O N. lat., or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or 
Caribbean coastal state. The Assistant Administrator may modify or 
change the bycatch limits upon publication of notice in the Federal 
Register pursuant to the requirements and procedures in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. Changes in the bycatch limits will be 
based upon the length of the directed fishery closure as well as the 
estimated catch per vessel in the non-directed fishery.
    (3) During a closure of the harpoon fishery, aboard a vessel using 
or having aboard harpoon gear--
    (i) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock; and
    (ii) No swordfish may be possessed in the North Atlantic Ocean, 
including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea,

[[Page 139]]

north of 5 deg.N. latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or 
Caribbean coastal state.
    (d) Bycatch limits in the non-directed fishery. Aboard a vessel 
using or having aboard gear other than drift gillnet, harpoon, or 
longline, other than a vessel in the recreational fishery--
    (1) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock;
    (2) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, no more 
than two swordfish per trip may be possessed in the North Atlantic 
Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5  
deg.N. latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean 
coastal state; and
    (3) Aboard a vessel in the squid trawl fishery, no more than five 
swordfish per trip may be possessed in the North Atlantic Ocean, 
including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5  deg.N. 
latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean coastal 
state. For the purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), a vessel is considered 
to be in the squid trawl fishery when it has no commercial fishing gear 
other than trawl gear aboard and squid constitute not less than 75 
percent by weight of the total fish aboard or off-loaded from the 
vessel.
    (e) Limits during a bycatch closure. During a closure of the bycatch 
fishery under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the provisions of 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section notwithstanding, aboard a fishing 
vessel, other than a vessel in the recreational fishery--
    (1) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock; and
    (2) No swordfish may be possessed in the North Atlantic Ocean, 
including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5 deg.N. 
latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean coastal 
state.

Sec. 630.51  Participation.

    (a) General. Owners of vessels and dealers permitted under 
Sec. 630.4 may volunteer to participate in the swordfish donation 
program by contacting the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, 
Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, NMFS, 1335 East-West 
Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910; telephone: (301) 713-2347, facsimile 
(301) 588-4967. The Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, will 
select owners of vessels and dealers who may participate in the donation 
program and will keep selected vessel owners advised of the selected 
dealers.
    (1) Factors that will be considered in the selection process 
include:

[[Page 140]]

    (i) History of voluntary participation in NMFS cooperative 
scientific programs;
    (ii) Whether both vessel and dealer volunteers can be matched in an 
area throughout the year (including truck routes) to ensure distribution 
of donated fish;
    (iii) Representative coverage of the fishery, to the extent 
possible; and
    (iv) Compliance record of volunteers. Specifically, any person who 
has been issued a Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA) for 
violating any provision of the Magnuson Act (16 U.S.C. 1802 et seq.), 
the Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.), or the ATCA (16 U.S.C. 971 et 
seq.), or who is currently under investigation for such a violation, may 
be excluded from the program.
    (2) Selected dealers will also be advised of the selected vessel 
owners and of authorized Second Harvest recipients of donated swordfish.
    (3) Second Harvest is the Second Harvest National Foodbank Network, 
116 South Michigan Avenue, Suite 4, Chicago, IL 60603-6001. Second 
Harvest affiliates are Certified Affiliate Food Banks throughout the 
United States that have a contract with Second Harvest and are 
officially part of their National Foodbank Network. Agents of Second 
Harvest are the individual charities that distribute or serve food to 
the needy from the Affiliate Food Banks, or a business designated by 
letter from Second Harvest to transport donated food between the 
foodbank and the charity.
    (b) Vessels. The owner, or their operator, of a vessel that has been 
selected to participate in the donation program and so notified in 
writing by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, may retain 
swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock that are in excess of 
the trip allowance for undersized swordfish specified in Sec. 630.23(b) 
under the following terms and conditions. No person may land a swordfish 
in excess of the trip allowance for undersized swordfish other than in 
accordance with these terms and conditions; any such landing constitutes 
a violation of the prohibition specified in Sec. 630.7(q).
    (1) The vessel's selection letter from the Chief, Highly Migratory 
Species Division, must be carried on board the fishing vessel and the 
operator must present it for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer.
    (2) The vessel's owner or operator must release any swordfish that 
is less than the minimum allowable size specified in Sec. 630.23(a) and 
that is alive when brought aboard the vessel, in a manner that will 
ensure maximum probability of survival. If caught by hook, such fish 
must be released by cutting the line near the hook without removing the 
swordfish from the water. The owner or operator must make a reasonable 
effort to tag each swordfish released under this paragraph (b)(2). In 
addition, participants are encouraged to tag all released small bluefin 
tuna, big eye tuna, yellowfin tuna and sharks where possible. Tags will 
be provided by the Science and Research Director. A record of each tag 
and release must be maintained and submitted to the Science and Research 
Director on forms provided with the tags.
    (3) The vessel's owner or operator must retain any swordfish that is 
dead when brought aboard the vessel.
    (4) The vessel's owner or operator must tag any swordfish that is 
retained under the donation program of this subpart prior to its off-
loading from a vessel at the facility of a selected dealer, using a non-
reusable, individually numbered donation tag provided by the Chief, 
Highly Migratory Species Division. The donation tag is not to be removed 
by the vessel crew, dealer, or Second Harvest until the carcass is 
processed.
    (5) All tags assigned to a vessel by NMFS Highly Migratory Species 
Division, used or unused, must be accounted for by the owner/operator at 
the request of any authorized officer.
    (6) The vessel's owner or operator must off-load any swordfish that 
is retained under the donation program of this subpart only at a 
specified facility of a dealer who has been selected by the Chief, 
Highly Migratory Species Division, to participate in the donation 
program. Off-loading must begin between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. 
local time. An owner or operator must notify the Chief, NMFS Office of 
Enforcement, by telephone at numbers given in the vessel owner's 
selection

[[Page 141]]

letter, and a selected dealer, at least 24 hours prior to off-loading 
swordfish under the donation program, unless stated otherwise in the 
vessel owner's selection letter.
    (7) The Assistant Administrator, upon consulting with industry 
representatives and NMFS Office of Enforcement, may change the 
requirements for off-loading by notification in the Federal Register.
    (8) All swordfish harvested during a trip by a vessel participating 
in this pilot program must be off-loaded at the same facility to a 
dealer participating in this donation program.
    (9) No vessel owner or operator may sell, trade, or barter, or 
attempt to sell, trade, or barter, any swordfish or any part thereof 
that is retained under the donation program of this subpart.
    (c) Dealers. A dealer who has been selected and so notified in 
writing by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, to participate 
in the donation program may receive and retain swordfish from the North 
Atlantic swordfish stock that are in excess of a vessel's trip allowance 
for undersized swordfish specified in Sec. 630.23(b) under the following 
terms and conditions. Possession of an undersized swordfish other than 
in accordance with these terms and conditions constitutes a violation of 
the prohibition specified in Sec. 620.7(a) of this chapter.
    (1) Dealers must have available on their premises, or facility, the 
dealer selection letter from the Chief, Highly Migratory Species 
Division, and must present it for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer.
    (2) A dealer may receive swordfish in excess of a vessel's trip 
allowance for undersized swordfish only from a vessel that has been 
selected by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, to participate 
in the donation program.
    (3) A swordfish that is received under the donation program must be 
kept separate from other swordfish possessed by the dealer. The donation 
tag on such swordfish may not be removed.
    (4) No dealer may sell, trade, or barter, or attempt to sell, trade, 
or barter, any swordfish, or any part thereof, that is retained under 
the donation program of this subpart.
    (5) A dealer may transfer any swordfish that is received under the 
donation program only to Second Harvest, and such swordfish may be 
transported only by Second Harvest or their designated agent. The dealer

from Second Harvest or their designated agent. A copy of the receipt 
must be furnished by the dealer to the harvesting vessel.
    (6) The dealer must include individual swordfish tag numbers along 
with the associated individual carcass weights of swordfish received 
under the donation program in the twice-monthly reports required by 
Sec. 630.5(b).
    (d) Second Harvest. Second Harvest, or its affiliates or agents, may 
receive and distribute swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock 
that are in excess of the trip allowance for undersized swordfish 
specified in Sec. 630.23(b) under the following terms and conditions. 
Possession of a swordfish other than in accordance with these terms and 
conditions constitutes a violation of the prohibition specified in 
Sec. 620.7(a) of this chapter.
    (1) Second Harvest may receive swordfish that are in excess of the 
trip allowance for undersized swordfish only from a dealer who has been 
selected by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, to participate

<R05>
Sec. 640.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to implement the Fishery Management 
Plan for the Spiny Lobster Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico and South 
Atlantic prepared by the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery 
Management Councils under the Magnuson Act.
    (b) This part governs conservation and management of spiny lobster 
and slipper (Spanish) lobster in the EEZ in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf 
of Mexico off the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico states from the Virginia/
North Carolina border south and through the Gulf of Mexico.
    (c) An owner or operator of a vessel that has legally harvested 
spiny lobsters in the waters of a foreign nation and possesses spiny 
lobsters, or separated tails, in the EEZ incidental to such foreign 
harvesting is exempt from the requirements of this part 640, provided 
proof of lawful harvest in the waters of a foreign nation accompanies 
such lobsters or tails.

<R05>
Sec. 640.2  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson Act and in Sec. 620.2 
of this chapter, the terms used in this part have the following 
meanings:
    Bully net means a circular frame attached at right angles to the end 
of a pole and supporting a conical bag of webbing. The webbing is 
usually held up by means of a cord which is released when the net is 
dropped over a lobster.
    Carapace length means the measurement of the carapace (head, body, 
or front section) of a spiny lobster from the anteriormost edge (front) 
of the groove between the horns directly above the eyes, along the 
middorsal line (middle of the back), to the rear edge of the top part of 
the carapace, excluding any translucent membrane.
    Commercial fishing means any fishing or fishing activities which 
result in the harvest of any marine or freshwater organisms, one or more 
of which (or parts thereof) is sold, traded, or bartered.
    Hoop net means a frame, circular or otherwise, supporting a shallow 
bag of webbing and suspended by a line and bridles. The net is baited 
and lowered to the ocean bottom, to be raised rapidly at a later time to 
prevent the escape of lobster.
    Live well means a shaded container used for holding live lobsters 
aboard a vessel in which aerated seawater is continuously circulated 
from the sea. Circulation of seawater at a rate that replaces the water 
at least every 8 minutes meets the requirement for aeration.
    Off Florida means the area from the Florida coast to the outer limit 
of the EEZ between the Georgia/Florida boundary (30 deg.42'45.6''N. 
latitude) and the Alabama/Florida boundary (87 deg.31'06''W. longitude).
    Off the Gulf states, other than Florida means the area from the 
coast to the outer limit of the EEZ between the Texas/Mexico border to 
the Alabama/Florida boundary (87 deg.31'06'' W. long.).
    Off Monroe County, Florida means the area from the Florida coast to 
the outer limit of the EEZ between a line extending directly east from 
the Dade/Monroe County, Florida boundary

[[Page 145]]

(25 deg.20.4'N. latitude) and a line extending directly west from the 
Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary (25 deg.48.0'N. latitude).
    Off the southern Atlantic states, other than Florida means the area 
from the coast to the outer limit of the EEZ between the Virginia/North 
Carolina boundary (36 deg.34'55'' N. lat.) to the Georgia/Florida 
boundary (30 deg.42'45.6'' N. lat.).
    Recreational fishing means fishing or fishing activities which 
result in the harvest of fish, none of which (or parts thereof) is sold, 
traded, or bartered.
    Regional Director means the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, 9721 
Executive Center Drive N., St. Petersburg, FL 33702, telephone 813-570-
5301; or a designee.
    Slipper (Spanish) lobster means the species Scyllarides nodifer.
    Spiny lobster means the species Panulirus argus.
    Tail length means the lengthwise measurement of the entire tail 
(segmented portion), not including any protruding muscle tissue, of a 
spiny lobster along the top middorsal line (middle of the back) to the 
rearmost extremity. The measurement is made with the tail in a flat, 
straight position with the tip of the tail closed.
    Trip means a fishing trip, regardless of number of days' duration, 
that begins with departure from a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or ramp 
and that terminates with return to a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or 
ramp.

licensed by Florida, the vessel's Federal vessel permit number must be 
permanently and conspicuously displayed horizontally on the uppermost 
structural portion of the vessel in numbers at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) 
high so as to be readily identifiable from the air and water;
    (ii) If the vessel uses spiny lobster traps in the EEZ, other than 
off Florida--
    (A) The vessel's color code, as assigned by Florida or, if a color 
code has not been assigned by Florida, as assigned by the Regional 
Director, must be permanently and conspicuously displayed above the 
number specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section so as to be 
readily identifiable from the air and water, such color code being in 
the form of a circle at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) in diameter on a 
background of colors contrasting to those contained in the assigned 
color code;
    (B) A buoy or timed-release buoy of such strength and buoyancy to 
float must be attached to each spiny lobster trap or at each end of a 
string of traps;
    (C) A buoy used to mark spiny lobster traps must bear the vessel's 
assigned color code and be of such color, hue, and brilliancy as to be 
easily distinguished, seen, and located;
    (D) A buoy used to mark spiny lobster traps must bear the vessel's 
Florida crawfish license or trap number or, if not licensed by Florida, 
the vessel's Federal vessel permit number in numbers at least 2 inches 
(5.08 cm) high; and
    (E) A spiny lobster trap must bear the vessel's Florida crawfish 
license or trap number or, if not licensed by Florida, the vessel's 
Federal vessel permit number permanently and legibly affixed.
    (2) A spiny lobster trap in the EEZ, other than off Florida, will be 
presumed to be the property of the most recently documented owner. Upon 
the sale or transfer of a spiny lobster trap used in the EEZ, other than 
off Florida, within 5 days of acquiring ownership, the person acquiring 
ownership must notify the Florida Division of Law Enforcement of the 
Department of Environmental Protection, for a trap that bears a Florida 
crawfish license or trap number, or the Regional Director, for a trap 
that bears a Federal vessel permit number, as to the number of traps 
purchased, the vendor, and the crawfish license or trap number, or 
Federal vessel permit number, currently displayed on the traps, and must 
request issuance of a crawfish license or trap number, or Federal vessel 
permit, if the acquiring owner does not possess such license or trap 
number or permit.
    (c) Unmarked traps and buoys. An unmarked spiny lobster trap or buoy 
in the EEZ is illegal gear. Such trap or buoy, and any connecting lines, 
will be considered unclaimed or abandoned property and may be disposed 
of in any manner considered appropriate by the Assistant Administrator 
or an authorized officer. An owner of such trap or buoy remains subject 
to appropriate civil penalties.

    (a) EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, other than Florida. In the 
EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, other than Florida, there are no 
seasonal restrictions on the harvest of spiny lobster or on the 
possession of traps.
    (b) EEZ off Florida and off the Gulf states, other than Florida--(1) 
Commercial and recreational fishing season. The commercial and 
recreational fishing season for spiny lobster in the EEZ off Florida and 
the EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida, begins on August 6 and 
ends on March 31.
    (2) Special recreational fishing seasons--(i) EEZ off Florida. There 
is a 2-day special recreational fishing season in the EEZ off Florida on 
the last Wednesday and successive Thursday of July each year during 
which fishing for spiny lobster is limited to diving or use of a bully 
net or hoop net. (See Sec. 640.22(a) for general prohibitions on gear 
and methods.) In the EEZ off Monroe County, Florida, no person may 
harvest spiny lobster by diving at night, that is, from 1 hour after 
official sunset to 1 hour before official sunrise, during this 2-day 
special recreational fishing season.
    (ii) EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida. There is a 2-day 
special recreational fishing season in the EEZ off

[[Page 150]]

the Gulf states, other than Florida, during the last Saturday and 
successive Sunday of July each year during which fishing for spiny 
lobster may be conducted by authorized gear and methods other than 
traps. (See Sec. 640.22(a) for general prohibitions on gear and 
methods.)
    (3) Possession of traps. (i) In the EEZ off Florida, the rules and 
regulations applicable to the possession of spiny lobster traps in 
Florida's waters in Rule 46-24.005(3), (4), and (5), Florida 
Administrative Code, in effect as of June 1, 1994, apply in their 
entirety to the possession of spiny lobster traps in the EEZ off 
Florida. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of 
the Office of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) 
and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the Florida Marine 
Fisheries Commission, 2540 Executive Center Circle West, Suite 106, 
Tallahassee, FL 32301; telephone: 904-487-0554. Copies may be inspected 
at the Office of the Regional Director; the Office of Fisheries 
Conservation and Management, NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver 
Spring, MD; or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol 
Street NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC.
    (ii) In the EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida, a spiny 
lobster trap may be placed in the water prior to the commercial and 
recreational fishing season, which is specified in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section beginning on August 1 and must be removed from the water 
after such season not later than April 5.
    (iii) A spiny lobster trap, buoy, or rope in the EEZ off Florida or 
in the EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida, during periods not 
authorized in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section will 
be considered unclaimed or abandoned property and may be disposed of in 
any manner considered appropriate by the Assistant Administrator or an 
authorized officer. An owner of such trap, buoy, or rope remains subject 
to appropriate civil penalties.
    (4) Possession of spiny lobsters. In the EEZ off Florida and the 
Gulf states, a whole or a part of a spiny lobster subject to these 
regulations may only be possessed during the commercial and recreational 
fishing season and the special recreational fishing season specified in 
Sec. 640.20, unless accompanied by proof of lawful harvest in the waters 
of a foreign nation. Consistent with the provisions of paragraphs 
(b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, a spiny lobster in a trap in this 
area will not be deemed to be possessed provided such spiny lobster is 
returned immediately to the water unharmed when a trap is removed from 
the water between March 31 and April 15.
    (c) Primacy of seasonal restrictions in the EEZ off Florida. The 
seasonal restrictions applicable in the EEZ off Florida apply to all 
spiny lobsters and traps in the EEZ off Florida, without regard to 
harvest or use elsewhere, unless accompanied by proof of lawful harvest 
elsewhere.

[60 FR 41831, Aug. 14, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 640.21  Harvest limitations.

    (a) Berried lobsters. A berried (egg-bearing) spiny lobster or 
slipper lobster in or from the EEZ must be returned immediately to the 
water unharmed. If found in a trap in the EEZ, a berried spiny lobster 
or slipper lobster may not be retained in the trap. A berried spiny 
lobster or slipper lobster in or from the EEZ may not be stripped of its 
eggs or otherwise molested. The possession of a spiny lobster or slipper 
lobster, or part thereof, in or from the EEZ from which eggs, 
swimmerettes, or pleopods have been removed or stripped is prohibited.
    (b) Minimum size limits. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section--
    (i) No person may possess a spiny lobster in or from the EEZ with a 
carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less; and
    (ii) A spiny lobster, harvested in the EEZ by means other than 
diving, with a carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less must be 
returned immediately to the water unharmed.
    (2) No person may harvest or attempt to harvest a spiny lobster by 
diving in the EEZ unless he or she possesses, while in the water, a 
measuring device capable of measuring the carapace length. A spiny 
lobster captured by a diver must be measured in the water using such 
measuring device and, if the spiny lobster has a carapace length of

[[Page 151]]

3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less, it must be released unharmed immediately 
without removal from the water.
    (3) Aboard a vessel authorized under paragraph (d) of this section 
to possess a separated spiny lobster tail, no person may possess in or 
from the EEZ a separated spiny lobster tail with a tail length less than 
5.5 inches (13.97 cm).
    (c) Undersized attractants. A live spiny lobster under the minimum 
size limit specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that is 
harvested in the EEZ by a trap may be retained aboard the harvesting 
vessel for future use as an attractant in a trap provided it is held in 
a live well aboard the vessel. No more than fifty undersized spiny 
lobsters, or one per trap aboard the vessel, whichever is greater, may 
be retained aboard for use as attractants. The live well must provide a 
minimum of \3/4\ gallons (1.7 liters) of seawater per spiny lobster. An 
undersized spiny lobster so retained must be released to the water alive 
and unharmed immediately upon leaving the trap lines and prior to one 
hour after official sunset each day.
    (d) Tail separation. The possession aboard a fishing vessel of a 
separated spiny lobster tail in or from the EEZ is authorized only when 
the possession is incidental to fishing exclusively in the EEZ on a trip 
of 48 hours or more and a Federal tail-separation permit specified in 
Sec. 640.4(a)(2) has been issued to and is on board the vessel.

[57 FR 56520, Nov. 30, 1992, as amended at 59 FR 53119, Oct. 21, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 640.22  Gear and diving restrictions.

    (a) Prohibited gear and methods. (1) A spiny lobster may not be 
taken in the EEZ with a spear, hook, or similar device, or gear 
containing such devices. In the EEZ, the possession of a speared, 
pierced, or punctured spiny lobster is prima facie evidence that 
prohibited gear was used to take such lobster. Hook, as used in this 
paragraph (a)(1), does not include a hook in a hook-and-line fishery for 
species other than spiny lobster; and possession of a spiny lobster that 
has been speared, pierced, or punctured by such hook is not considered 
evidence that prohibited gear was used to take the spiny lobster, 
provided no prohibited gear is on board the vessel.
    (2) A spiny lobster may not be taken in a directed fishery by the 
use of a net or trawl. See Sec. 640.23(d) for the bycatch limits 
applicable to a vessel that uses or has on board a net or trawl.
    (3) Poisons and explosives may not be used to take a spiny lobster 
or slipper lobster in the EEZ. For the purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(3), chlorine, bleach, and similar substances, which are used to 
flush a spiny lobster out of rocks or coral, are poisons. A vessel in 
the spiny lobster or slipper lobster fishery may not possess on board in 
the EEZ any dynamite or similar explosive substance.
    (b) Traps. (1) In the EEZ, a spiny lobster trap may be no larger in 
dimension than 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet (91.4 cm by 61.0 cm by 61.0 
cm), or the volume equivalent. A trap constructed of material other than 
wood must have a panel constructed of wood, cotton, or other material 
that will degrade at the same rate as a wooden trap. Such panel must be 
located in the upper half of the sides or on top of the trap, so that, 
when removed, there will be an opening in the trap no smaller than the 
diameter found at the throat or entrance of the trap.
    (2) A spiny lobster trap in the EEZ may be pulled or tended during 
daylight hours only, that is, from 1 hour before official sunrise to 1 
hour after official sunset.
    (3) A spiny lobster trap in the EEZ may be pulled or tended only by 
the owner's vessel, or by a vessel for which permission to pull or work 
traps belonging to another person has been granted--
    (i) For traps in the EEZ off Florida, by the Florida Division of Law 
Enforcement, Department of Environmental Protection, in accordance with 
the procedures in Rule 46-24.006(7), Florida Administrative Code, in 
effect as of June 1, 1994. This incorporation by reference was approved 
by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register in accordance with 
5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the 
Florida Marine Fisheries Commission, 2540 Executive Center Circle West, 
Suite 106, Tallahassee, FL 32301; telephone: 904-487-0554. Copies may be

Sec. 640.23  Bag/possession limits.

    (a) EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, other than Florida. The 
daily bag or possession limit for spiny lobster in or from the EEZ off 
the southern Atlantic states, other than Florida, is two per person for 
commercial and recreational fishing, year-round.
    (b) EEZ off Florida and off the Gulf states, other than Florida--(1) 
Commercial and recreational fishing season. Except as specified in 
paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, during the commercial and 
recreational fishing season specified in Sec. 640.20(b)(1), the daily 
bag or possession limit of spiny lobster in or from the EEZ off Florida 
and off the Gulf states, other than Florida, is six per person.
    (2) Special recreational fishing seasons. During the special 
recreational fishing seasons specified in Sec. 640.20(b)(2), the daily 
bag or possession limit of spiny lobster--
    (i) In or from the EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida, is 
six per person;
    (ii) In or from the EEZ off Florida other than off Monroe County, 
Florida, is twelve per person; and
    (iii) In or from the EEZ off Monroe County, Florida, is six per 
person.
    (3) Exemption from the bag/possession limit. During the commercial 
and recreational fishing season specified in Sec. 640.20(b)(1), a person 
is exempt from the bag and possession limit specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, provided--
    (i) The harvest of spiny lobsters is by diving, or by the use of a 
bully net, hoop net, or spiny lobster trap; and
    (ii) The vessel from which the person is operating has on board the 
required licenses, certificates, or permits, as specified in 
Sec. 640.4(a)(1).
    (4) Harvest by net or trawl. During the commercial and recreational 
fishing season specified in Sec. 640.20(b)(1), aboard a vessel with the 
required licenses, certificates, or permits specified in 
Sec. 640.4(a)(1) that harvests spiny lobster by net or trawl or has on 
board a net or trawl, the possession of spiny lobster in or from the EEZ 
off Florida and off the Gulf states, other than Florida, may not exceed 
at any time 5 percent, whole weight, of the total whole weight of all 
fish lawfully in possession on board such vessel. If such vessel 
lawfully possesses a separated spiny lobster tail, the possession of 
spiny lobster in or from the EEZ may not exceed at any time 1.6 percent, 
by weight of the spiny lobster or parts thereof, of the total whole 
weight of all fish lawfully in possession on board such vessel. For the 
purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), the term ``net or trawl'' does not 
include a hand-held net, a loading or dip net, a bully net, or a hoop 
net.
    (5) Diving at night. The provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section notwithstanding, a person who harvests spiny lobster in the EEZ 
by diving at night, that is, from 1 hour after official sunset to 1 hour 
before official sunrise, is limited to the bag limit specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, whether or not a Federal vessel permit 
specified in Sec. 640.4(a)(1) has been issued to and is on board the 
vessel from which the diver is operating.
    (c) Combination of bag/possession limits. A person who fishes for or 
possesses spiny lobster in or from the EEZ under a bag or possession 
limit specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may not combine 
the bag or possession limits of those paragraphs or combine such bag or 
possession limit with a bag or possession limit applicable to state 
waters.
    (d) Responsibility for bag/possession limits. The operator of a 
vessel that fishes for or possesses spiny lobster in or from the EEZ is 
responsible for the cumulative bag or possession limit specified in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section applicable to that vessel, based 
on the number of persons aboard.
    (e) Transfer at sea. A person who fishes for or possesses spiny 
lobster in

[[Page 153]]

or from the EEZ under a bag or possession limit specified in paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this section may not transfer a spiny lobster at sea from 
a fishing vessel to any other vessel, and no person may receive at sea 
such spiny lobster.

<R05>
Sec. 648.3  Relation to other laws.

    (a) The relation of this part to other laws is set forth in 
Sec. 600.705.
    (b) Nothing in these regulations supersedes more restrictive state 
management measures for any of the species referenced in Sec. 648.1 and, 
for Atlantic salmon, more restrictive local management measures.


<R05>
Sec. 648.4  Vessel permits.

    (a) Fishery specific vessel permit information. (1) NE multispecies 
vessels. Any vessel of the United States, including a charter or party 
boat, must have been issued and have on board a valid multispecies 
permit to fish for, possess or land multispecies finfish in or from the 
EEZ. Multispecies frames used as, or to be used as, bait on a vessel 
fishing exclusively with pot gear are deemed not to be multispecies 
finfish for purposes

[[Page 163]]

of this part provided that there is a receipt for the purchase of those 
frames on board the vessel.
    (i) Limited access multispecies permits--(A) Eligibility. To be 
eligible to apply for a limited access multispecies permit, as specified 
in Sec. 648.82, in 1996 and thereafter, a vessel must have been issued a 
limited access multispecies permit for the preceding year, must be 
replacing a vessel that was issued a limited access multispecies permit 
for the preceding year, or must qualify for a 1996 limited access 
multispecies hook-gear permit under this paragraph (a)(1)(i). Vessels 
qualifying for 1996 limited access multispecies hook-gear permits are 
qualified only for that limited access permit category. A vessel is 
eligible for a 1996 limited access multispecies hook-gear permit, 
provided:
    (1) The vessel was issued a 1995 open access multispecies hook-gear 
permit and the owner or operator of the vessel submitted to the Regional 
Director, no later than January 26, 1996, fishing log reports dated 
between June 1, 1994, and June 1, 1995, when fishing with hook gear 
under the open access hook-gear permit, documenting landings of at least 
500 lb (226.8 kg) of NE multispecies finfish, or its equivalent in 
numbers of fish; or
    (2) The vessel is replacing such a vessel.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. Owners of vessels must apply 
for a limited access multispecies hook-gear permit before September 1, 
1996, to receive an automatic mailing of an application to renew their 
permit in 1997 and to be assured that their permit application will be 
processed within 30 days. Vessel owners applying after December 31, 
1996, will be ineligible to apply for an initial limited access 
multispecies hook-gear permit. To renew or apply for a limited access 
multispecies permit, a completed application must be received by the 
Regional Director by the first day of the fishing year for which the 
permit is required. Failure to renew a limited access multispecies 
permit in any year bars the renewal of the permit in subsequent years.
    (C) Qualification restriction. Unless the Regional Director 
determines to the contrary, no more than one vessel may qualify, at any 
one time, for a limited access permit based on that or another vessel's 
fishing and permit history. If more than one vessel owner claims 
eligibility for a limited access permit, based on one vessel's fishing 
and permit history, the Regional Director will determine who is entitled 
to qualify for the permit and the DAS allocation according to paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (D) Change in ownership. The fishing and permit history of a vessel 
is presumed to transfer with the vessel whenever it is bought, sold, or 
otherwise transferred, unless there is a written agreement, signed by 
the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, or other credible written 
evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller is retaining the vessel's 
fishing and permit history for purposes of replacing the vessel.
    (E) Replacement vessels. To be eligible for a limited access permit 
under this section, the replacement vessel must meet the following 
criteria and any applicable criteria under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of 
this section:
    (1) The replacement vessel's horsepower may not exceed by more than 
20 percent the horsepower of the vessel that was initially issued a 
limited access permit as of the date the initial vessel applied for such 
permit.
    (2) The replacement vessel's length, GRT, and NT may not exceed by 
more than 10 percent the length, GRT, and NT of the vessel that was 
initially issued a limited access permit as of the date the initial 
vessel applied for such permit. For purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(E)(2), a vessel not required to be documented under title 46 
U.S.C. will be considered to be 5 NT. For undocumented vessels, GRT does 
not apply.
    (F) Upgraded vessel. A vessel may be upgraded, whether through 
refitting or replacement, and still be eligible for or be eligible to 
retain or renew a limited access permit, only if the upgrade complies 
with the following:
    (1) The vessel's horsepower may be increased, whether through 
refitting or replacement, only once. Such an increase may not exceed 20 
percent of the horsepower of the vessel initially issued a limited 
access permit as of the

[[Page 164]]

date the initial vessel applied for such permit.
    (2) The vessel's length, GRT, and NT may be increased, whether 
through refitting or replacement, only once. Any increase in any of 
these three specifications of vessel size may not exceed 10 percent of 
the respective specification of the vessel initially issued a limited 
access permit as of the date the initial vessel applied for such permit. 
If any of these three specifications is increased, any increase in the 
other two must be performed at the same time. This type of upgrade may 
be done separately from an engine horsepower upgrade.
    (G) Consolidation restriction. Limited access permits and DAS 
allocations may not be combined or consolidated.
    (H) Appeal of denial of permit. (1) Eligibility. Any applicant 
eligible to apply for an initial limited access multispecies hook-gear 
permit who is denied such permit may appeal the denial to the Regional 
Director within 30 days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal must be 
based on one or more of the following grounds, must be in writing, and 
must state the grounds for the appeal:
    (i) The information used by the Regional Director was based on 
mistaken or incorrect data.
    (ii) The applicant was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her 
control from meeting relevant criteria.
    (iii) The applicant has new or additional information.
    (2) Appeal review. The Regional Director will appoint a designee who 
will make the initial decision on the appeal. The appellant may request 
a review of the initial decision by the Regional Director by so 
requesting in writing within 30 days of the notice of the initial 
decision. If the appellant does not request a review of the initial 
decision within 30 days, the initial decision shall become the final 
administrative action of the Department of Commerce. Such review will be 
conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the Regional Director. The 
hearing officer shall make findings and a recommendation to the Regional 
Director which shall be advisory only. Upon receiving the findings and a 
recommendation, the Regional Director will issue a final decision on the 
appeal. The Regional Director's decision is the final administrative 
action of the Department of Commerce.
    (3) Status of vessels pending appeal. A vessel denied a limited 
access multispecies hook-gear permit may fish under the limited access 
multispecies hook-gear category, provided that the denial has been 
appealed, the appeal is pending, and the vessel has on board a letter 
from the Regional Director authorizing the vessel to fish under the 
limited access hook-gear category. The Regional Director will issue such 
a letter for the pendency of any appeal. Any such decision is the final 
administrative action of the Department of Commerce on allowable fishing 
activity, pending a final decision on the appeal. The letter of 
authorization must be carried on board the vessel. If the appeal is 
finally denied, the Regional Director shall send a notice of final 
denial to the vessel owner; the authorizing letter becomes invalid 5 
days after receipt of the notice of denial.
    (I) Limited access permit restrictions. (1) A vessel may be issued a 
limited access multispecies permit in only one category during a fishing 
year. Vessels may not change limited access multispecies permit 
categories during the fishing year, except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(I)(2) of this section. A vessel issued a limited access 
multispecies hook-gear permit may not change its limited access permit 
category at any time.
    (2) The owner of a vessel issued a limited access multispecies 
permit may request a change in permit category, unless otherwise 
restricted by paragraph (a)(1)(i)(I)(1) of this section. In 1996, a 
vessel owner has one opportunity to request a change in permit category 
by submitting an application to the Regional Director by August 14, 
1996. If a complete application is not submitted by that date, the 
vessel must fish only in the DAS program assigned for the remainder of 
the 1996 fishing year. Any DAS that a vessel uses prior to a change in 
permit category will be counted against its allocation received under 
any subsequent permit category. For 1997 and beyond, the owner of a 
limited access multispecies vessel eligible to request a change

[[Page 165]]

in permit category must elect a category prior to the start of each 
fishing year and will have one opportunity to request a change in permit 
category by submitting an application to the Regional Director within 45 
days of issuance of the vessel's permit. After that date, the vessel 
must remain in that permit category for the duration of the fishing 
year.
    (3) With the exception of combination vessels, sea scallop dredge 
vessels are not eligible for limited access multispecies permits.
    (J) Confirmation of Permit History. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this part, a person who does not currently own a fishing 
vessel, but who has owned a qualifying vessel that has sunk, been 
destroyed, or transferred to another person, may apply for and receive a 
Confirmation of Permit History (CPH) if the fishing and permit history 
of such vessel has been retained lawfully by the applicant. To be 
eligible to obtain a CPH, the applicant must show that the qualifying 
vessel meets the eligibility requirements, as applicable, in this part. 
Issuance of a valid and current CPH preserves the eligibility of the 
applicant to apply for or renew a limited access permit for a 
replacement vessel based on the qualifying vessel's fishing and permit 
history at a subsequent time, subject to the replacement provisions 
specified in this section. A CPH must be applied for and received on an 
annual basis in order for the applicant to preserve the fishing rights 
and limited access eligibility of the qualifying vessel. If fishing 
privileges have been assigned or allocated previously under this part, 
based on the qualifying vessel's fishing and permit history, the CPH 
also preserves such fishing privileges. Any decision regarding the 
issuance of a CPH for a qualifying vessel that has applied for or been 
issued previously a limited access permit is a final agency action 
subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 704. An application for a CPH 
must be received by the Regional Director by the beginning of the 
fishing year for which it is required. Information requirements for the 
CPH application are the same as those for a limited access permit with 
any request for information about the vessel being applicable to the 
qualifying vessel that has been sunk, destroyed, or transferred. Vessel 
permit applicants who have been issued a CPH and who wish to obtain a 
vessel permit for a replacement vessel based upon the previous vessel 
history may do so pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J).
    (K) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. If a 
vessel's limited access permit for a particular fishery is voluntarily 
relinquished to the Regional Director, or abandoned through failure to 
renew or otherwise, no limited access permit for that fishery may be re-
issued or renewed based on that vessel's history or to any vessel 
relying on that vessel's history.
    (L) Restriction on permit splitting. A limited access multispecies 
permit may not be issued to a vessel or its replacement, or remain 
valid, if the vessel's permit or fishing history has been used to 
qualify another vessel for another Federal fishery.
    (ii) Open access permits. A vessel of the United States that has not 
been issued a limited access multispecies permit is eligible for and may 
be issued an open access multispecies handgear, charter/party or 
nonregulated multispecies permit and may fish for, possess and land 
multispecies finfish subject to the restrictions in Sec. 648.88. A 
vessel that has been issued a valid limited access scallop permit, but 
that has not been issued a limited access multispecies permit, is 
eligible for and may be issued an open access scallop multispecies 
possession limit permit and may fish for, possess and land multispecies 
finfish subject to the restrictions in Sec. 648.88. The owner of a 
vessel issued an open access permit may request a different open access 
permit category by submitting an application to the Regional Director at 
any time.
    (2) Atlantic sea scallop vessels--Any vessel of the United States 
that fishes for, possesses, or lands Atlantic sea scallops in quantities 
greater than 40 lb (18.14 kg) shucked, or 5 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell 
scallops per trip, except vessels that fish exclusively in state waters 
for scallops, must have been issued and carry on board a valid scallop 
permit.
    (i) Limited access scallop permits. Any vessel of the United States 
that possesses or lands more than 400 lb (181.44

[[Page 166]]

kg) of shucked, or the equivalent amount of in-shell scallops (50 bu 
(176.2 L)) per trip, except vessels that fish exclusively in state 
waters for scallops, must have been issued and carry on board a valid 
limited access scallop permit.
    (A) Eligibility. To be eligible to apply for a limited access 
scallop permit, a vessel must have been issued a limited access scallop 
permit for the preceding year, or the vessel must be replacing a vessel 
that has been issued a limited access scallop permit for the preceding 
year.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. To renew or apply for a 
limited access scallop permit, a completed application must be received 
by the Regional Director by the first day of the fishing year for which 
the permit is required. Failure to renew a limited access scallop permit 
in any year bars the renewal of the permit in subsequent years.
    (C) Qualification restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this 
section.
    (D) Change in ownership. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (E) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(E) of this section.
    (F) Upgraded vessel. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of this section.
    (G) Consolidation restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(G) of this 
section.
    (H) Percentage ownership restrictions. (1) For any vessel acquired 
after March 1, 1994, a vessel owner is not eligible to be issued a 
limited access scallop permit for the vessel if the issuance of the 
permit will result in the vessel owner, or any person who is a 
shareholder or partner of the vessel owner, having an ownership interest 
in limited access scallop vessels in excess of 5 percent of the number 
of all limited access scallop vessels at the time of permit application.
    (2) Vessel owners who were initially issued a 1994 limited access 
scallop permit, or were issued or renewed a limited access scallop 
permit for a vessel in 1995 and thereafter in compliance with the 
ownership restrictions in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(H)(1) of this section, are 
eligible to renew such permit(s), regardless of whether the renewal of 
the permits will result in the 5 percent ownership restriction being 
exceeded.
    (3) Having an ownership interest includes, but is not limited to, 
persons who are shareholders in a vessel owned by a corporation, who are 
partners (general or limited) to a vessel owner, or who, in any way, 
partly own a vessel.
    (I) Limited access permit restrictions. A vessel may be issued a 
limited access scallop permit in only one category during a fishing 
year. The owner of a vessel issued a limited access scallop permit must 
elect a permit category for that vessel prior to the start of each 
fishing year and will have one opportunity to request a change in permit 
category by submitting an application to the Regional Director within 45 
days of issuance of the vessel's permit. After this date, the vessel 
must remain in that permit category for the duration of the fishing 
year. Any DAS that a vessel uses prior to a change in permit category 
will be counted against its allocation received under any subsequent 
permit category.
    (J) Confirmation of Permit History. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J) of 
this section.
    (K) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. See 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section.
    (ii) General scallop permit. Any vessel of the United States that is 
not in possession of a limited access scallop permit, and that 
possesses, or lands per trip, more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) and less than 
or including 400 lb (181.44 kg) of shucked meats, or the equivalent 
amount of in-shell scallops (5 and 50 bu (176.2 L and 176.2 L), 
respectively), except vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for 
scallops, must carry on board a valid general scallop permit.
    (3) Summer flounder vessels. Any vessel of the United States that 
fishes for or retains summer flounder in the EEZ must have been issued 
and carry on board a valid summer flounder permit, except for vessels 
other than party or charter vessels that observe the possession limit 
set forth in Sec. 648.105.
    (i) Moratorium permits (applicable through 1997). (A) Eligibility. 
To be eligible to apply for a moratorium permit to fish for and retain 
summer flounder in excess of the possession limit in Sec. 648.105 in the 
EEZ, a vessel must have

[[Page 167]]

been issued a summer flounder moratorium permit in a previous year or be 
replacing a vessel that was issued a moratorium permit for a previous 
year.
    (B) Application/renewal restriction. No one may apply for a summer 
flounder moratorium permit for a vessel after:
    (1) The owner retires the vessel from the fishery.
    (2) The vessel fails to land any summer flounder at least once 
within any 52-consecutive-week period.
    (C) Replacement vessels. To be eligible for a moratorium permit, the 
replacement vessel must be replacing a vessel of substantially similar 
harvesting capacity that is judged unseaworthy by the USCG, for reasons 
other than lack of maintenance, or that involuntarily left the fishery 
during the moratorium. Both the entering and replaced vessels must be 
owned by the same person. Vessel permits issued to vessels that 
involuntarily leave the fishery may not be combined to create larger 
replacement vessels.
    (ii) Party and charter boat permits. Any party or charter boat is 
eligible for a permit to fish for summer flounder, other than a summer 
flounder moratorium permit, if it is carrying passengers for hire. Such 
vessel must observe the possession limits specified in Sec. 648.105.
    (iii) Exemption permits. Owners of summer flounder vessels seeking 
an exemption from the minimum mesh requirement under the provisions of 
Sec. 648.104(b)(1) must apply to the Regional Director under paragraph 
(c) of this section at least 7 days prior to the date they wish the 
permit to become effective. The applicant must mark ``Exemption Permit 
Request'' on the permit application at the top. A permit issued under 
this paragraph (a)(3)(iii) does not meet the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(3)(i) of this section, but is subject to the other provisions of 
this section. Persons issued an exemption permit must surrender it to 
the Regional Director at least 1 day prior to the date they wish to fish 
not subject to the exemption. The Regional Director may impose temporary 
additional procedural requirements by publishing a notification in the 
Federal Register.
    (4) Surf clam and ocean quahog vessels.--Any vessel of the United 
States that fishes for surf clams or ocean quahogs, except vessels 
taking surf clams and ocean quahogs for personal use or fishing 
exclusively within state waters, must have been issued and carry on 
board a valid surf clam or ocean quahog permit, respectively.
    (5) Mackerel, squid, and butterfish vessels--Beginning on January 1, 
1997, any vessel of the United States, including party or charter 
vessels, that fishes for, possesses, or lands mackerel, squid, or 
butterfish in or from the EEZ, must have been issued and carry on board 
a valid Loligo and butterfish moratorium permit, incidental catch 
permit, mackerel and Illex permit or party/charter permit. This 
requirement does not apply to recreational fishing vessels. Until 
January 1, 1997, vessels that have been issued 1995 Federal mackerel, 
squid, and butterfish permits and are not otherwise subject to permit 
sanctions due to enforcement proceedings, may fish for, possess, or land 
mackerel, squid, or butterfish in or from the EEZ.
    (i) Loligo squid and butterfish moratorium permits. (A) Eligibility. 
A vessel is eligible for a moratorium permit to fish for and retain 
Loligo squid or butterfish in excess of the incidental catch allowance 
specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, if it meets any of the 
following criteria:
    (1) The vessel landed and sold at least 20,000 lb (9.07 mt) of 
Loligo squid or butterfish in any 30 consecutive day period between 
August 13, 1981, and August 13, 1993.
    (2) The vessel is replacing such a vessel and meets the requirements 
of paragraph (a)(3)(i)(C) of this section.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. No one may apply for an 
initial Loligo squid and butterfish moratorium permit for a vessel 
after:
    (1) May 2, 1997.
    (2) The owner retires the vessel from the fishery.
    (C) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(3)(i)(C) of this section.
    (D) Appeal of denial of permit. (1) Any applicant denied a 
moratorium permit may appeal to the Regional Director within 30 days of 
the notice of denial. Any such appeal shall be in writing. The only 
ground for appeal is that the

[[Page 168]]

Regional Director erred in concluding that the vessel did not meet the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A)(1) of this section. The appeal shall 
set forth the basis for the applicant's belief that the Regional 
Director's decision was made in error.
    (2) The appeal may be presented, at the option of the applicant, at 
a hearing before an officer appointed by the Regional Director.
    (3) The hearing officer shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Director.
    (4) The decision on the appeal by the Regional Director is the final 
decision of the Department of Commerce.
    (ii) Incidental catch permits. Any vessel of the United States may 
obtain a permit to fish for or retain up to 2,500 lb (1.13 mt) of Loligo 
squid or butterfish as an incidental catch in another directed fishery. 
The incidental catch allowance may be revised by the Regional Director, 
based upon a recommendation by the Council, following the procedure set 
forth in Sec. 648.21.
    (iii) Mackerel and Illex squid permits. Any vessel of the United 
States may obtain a permit under this section to fish for or retain 
Atlantic mackerel or Illex squid in or from the EEZ.
    (iv) Party and charter boat permits. The owner of any party or 
charter boat must obtain a permit to fish for or retain in or from the 
EEZ mackerel, squid, or butterfish while carrying passengers for hire.
    (6) Scup vessels. Beginning on January 1, 1997, and subject to the 
eligibility requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and 
(a)(6)(ii) of this section, the owner of a vessel of the United States, 
including a party or charter vessel, must obtain a permit issued under 
this part to fish for or retain scup for sale, barter or trade, in or 
from the EEZ north of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat. Any vessel, other than a 
party or charter boat, that observes the possession limit restrictions 
established pursuant to, and the prohibition on sale specified in, 
Sec. 648.125 is exempt from the permit requirement.
    (i) Moratorium permit--(A) Eligibility. A vessel is eligible for a 
moratorium permit to fish for and retain scup for sale if it meets any 
of the following criteria:
    (1) The vessel landed and sold scup between January 26, 1988, and 
January 26, 1993; or
    (2) The vessel is replacing such a vessel and meets the requirements 
of paragraph (a)(3)(i)(C) of this section.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. (1) No one may apply for an 
initial scup moratorium permit after August 25, 1997.
    (2) No one may apply for a scup moratorium permit after the owner 
retires the vessel from the fishery.
    (C) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(3)(i)(C) of this section.
    (D) Appeal of denial of permit. (1) Any applicant denied a scup 
moratorium permit may appeal to the Regional Director within 30 days of 
the notice of denial. Any such appeal shall be in writing. The only 
ground for appeal is that the Regional Director erred in concluding that 
the vessel did not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(6)(i)(A)(1) of 
this section. The appeal shall set forth the basis for the applicant's 
belief that the Regional Director's decision was made in error.
    (2) The appeal may be presented, at the option of the applicant, at 
a hearing before an officer appointed by the Regional Director.
    (3) The hearing officer shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Director.
    (4) The decision on the appeal by the Regional Director is the final 
decision of the Department of Commerce.
    (ii) Party and charter boat permit. Any party or charter boat is 
eligible for a permit to fish for scup, other than a scup moratorium 
permit, if it is carrying passengers for hire. Such vessel must observe 
the possession limits established pursuant to, and the prohibitions on 
sale specified in, Sec. 648.125.
    (b) Permit conditions. Vessel owners who apply for a fishing vessel 
permit under this section must agree as a condition of the permit that 
the vessel and the vessel's fishing activity, catch, and pertinent gear 
(without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of 
the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, 
taken or landed), are subject to all requirements of this part, unless 
exempted from such requirements

[[Page 169]]

under this part. All such fishing activities, catch, and gear will 
remain subject to all applicable state requirements. Except as otherwise 
provided in this part, if a requirement of this part and a management 
measure required by a state or local law differ, any vessel owner 
permitted to fish in the EEZ for any species managed under this part 
must comply with the more restrictive requirement. Owners and operators 
of vessels fishing under the terms of a summer flounder moratorium 
permit must also agree not to land summer flounder in any state after 
the Regional Director has published a notification in the Federal 
Register stating that the commercial quota for that state has been 
harvested, and that no commercial quota is available. A state not 
receiving an allocation of summer flounder is deemed to have no 
commercial quota available. Owners and operators of vessels fishing 
under the terms of a scup moratorium permit must also agree not to land 
scup after the Regional Director has published a notification in the 
Federal Register stating that the commercial quota has been harvested. 
Owners or operators fishing for surf clams and ocean quahogs within 
waters under the jurisdiction of any state that requires cage tags are 
not subject to any conflicting Federal minimum size or tagging 
requirements. If a surf clam and ocean quahog requirement of this part 
differs from a surf clam and ocean quahog management measure required by 
a state that does not require cage tagging, any vessel owners or 
operator permitted to fish in the EEZ for surf clams and ocean quahogs 
must comply with the more restrictive requirement while fishing in state 
waters. However, surrender of a surf clam and ocean quahog vessel permit 
by the owner by certified mail addressed to the Regional Director allows 
an individual to comply with the less restrictive state minimum size 
requirement, so long as fishing is conducted exclusively within state 
waters.
    (c) Vessel permit applications--(1) General. Applicants for a permit 
under this section must submit a completed application on an appropriate 
form obtained from the Regional Director. The application must be signed 
by the owner of the vessel, or the owner's authorized representative, 
and be submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days before the 
date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. 
The Regional Director will notify the applicant of any deficiency in the 
application pursuant to this section. Vessel owners who are eligible to 
apply for limited access or moratorium permits under this part shall 
provide information with the application sufficient for the Regional 
Director to determine whether the vessel meets the applicable 
eligibility requirements specified in this section.
    (2) Information requirements. (i) An application for a permit issued 
under this section, in addition to the information specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, also must contain at least the 
following information, and any other information required by the 
Regional Director: Vessel name; owner name, mailing address, and 
telephone number; USCG documentation number and a copy of the vessel's 
current USCG documentation or, for a vessel not required to be

of the current Certificate of Incorporation or other corporate papers 
showing the date of incorporation and the names of the current officers 
of the corporation, and the names and addresses of all shareholders 
owning 25 percent or more of the corporation's shares; if the owner is a 
partnership, a copy of the current Partnership Agreement and the names 
and addresses of all partners; if there is more than one owner, names of 
all owners having a 25-percent interest or more; the name and signature 
of the owner or the owner's authorized representative; and permit number 
of any current or, if expired,

[[Page 170]]

previous Federal fishery permit issued to the vessel.
    (ii) An application for an initial limited access multispecies hook-
gear permit must also contain the following information:
    (A) If the engine horsepower was changed or a contract to change the 
engine horsepower had been entered into prior to May 1, 1996, such that 
it is different from that stated in the vessel's most recent application 
for a Federal fisheries permit before May 1, 1996, sufficient 
documentation to ascertain the different engine horsepower. However, the 
engine replacement must be completed within 1 year of the date of when 
the contract for the replacement engine was signed.
    (B) If the length, GRT, or NT was changed or a contract to change 
the length, GRT, or NT been entered into prior to May 1, 1996, such that 
it is different from that stated in the vessel's most recent application 
for a Federal fisheries permit, sufficient documentation to ascertain 
the different length, GRT, or NT. However, the upgrade must be completed 
within 1 year from the date when the contract for the upgrade was 
signed.
    (iii) An application for a multispecies permit must also contain a 
copy of the vendor installation receipt from a NMFS certified VTS vendor 
as described in Sec. 648.9, if the vessel has been issued a limited 
access multispecies Combination Vessel permit or individual DAS category 
permit, or if the applicant elects to use a VTS unit, although not 
required.
    (iv) An application for a limited access scallop permit must also 
contain the following information:
    (A) For every person named by applicants for limited access scallop 
permits pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the names of 
all other vessels in which that person has an ownership interest and for 
which a limited access scallop permit has been issued or applied for.
    (B) If applying for full-time or part-time limited access scallop 
permit, or if opting to use a VTS unit, though not required, a copy of 
the vendor installation receipt from a NMFS-approved VTS vendor as 
described in Sec. 648.9.
    (C) If applying to fish under the small dredge program set forth 
under Sec. 648.51(e), an annual declaration into the program.
    (v) An application for a surf clam and ocean quahog permit must also 
contain the pump horsepower.
    (d) Fees. The Regional Director may charge a fee to recover 
administrative expenses of issuing a permit required under this section. 
The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of 
the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the Regional Director, for 
determining administrative costs of each special product or service. The 
fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each application 
form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application; if it does 
not, the application will be considered incomplete for purposes of 
paragraph (e) of this section. Any fee paid by an insufficiently funded 
commercial instrument shall render any permit issued on the basis 
thereof null and void.
    (e) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 
904, the Regional Director shall issue a permit within 30 days of 
receipt of the application, unless the application is deemed incomplete 
for the following reasons:
    (i) The applicant has failed to submit a complete application. An 
application is complete when all requested forms, information, 
documentation, and fees, if applicable, have been received and the 
applicant has submitted all applicable reports specified in Sec. 648.7;
    (ii) The application was not received by the Regional Director by 
the applicable deadline set forth in this section;
    (iii) The applicant and applicant's vessel failed to meet all 
applicable eligibility requirements set forth in this section;
    (iv) The applicant applying for a limited access multispecies 
combination vessel or individual DAS permit, a full-time or part-time 
limited access scallop permit, or electing to use a VTS, has failed to 
meet all of the VTS requirements specified in Secs. 648.9 and 648.10; or
    (v) The applicant has failed to meet any other application 
requirements stated in this part.
    (2) Incomplete applications. Upon receipt of an incomplete or 
improperly

[[Page 171]]

executed application for any permit under this part, the Regional 
Director shall notify the applicant of the deficiency in the 
application. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 
days following the date of notification, the application will be 
considered abandoned.
    (f) Change in permit information. Any change in the information 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be submitted by the 
applicant in writing to the Regional Director within 15 days of the 
change, or the permit is void.
    (g) Expiration. A permit expires upon the renewal date specified in 
the permit.
    (h) Duration. A permit will continue in effect unless it is revoked, 
suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part 904, or otherwise expires, or 
ownership changes, or the applicant has failed to report any change in 
the information on the permit application to the Regional Director as 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section. However, the Regional 
Director may authorize the continuation of a permit if the new owner so 
requests. Applications for permit continuations must be addressed to the 
Regional Director.
    (i) Alteration. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (j) Reissuance. Permits may be issued by the Regional Director when 
requested in writing by the owner, stating the need for reissuance, the 
name of the vessel, and the fishing permit number assigned. An 
application for a reissued permit will not be considered a new 
application. The fee for a reissued permit shall be the same as for an 
initial permit.
    (k) Transfer. Permits issued under this part are not transferable or 
assignable. A permit will be valid only for the fishing vessel and owner 
for which it is issued.
    (l) Display. The permit must be carried, at all times, on board the 
vessel for which it is issued, and must be maintained in legible 
condition. The permit shall be subject to inspection upon request by any 
authorized official.
    (m) Sanctions. The Assistant Administrator may suspend, revoke, or 
modify, any permit issued or sought under this section. Procedures 
governing enforcement-related permit sanctions or denials are found at 
subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.

Director.
    (b) Vessel owners--(1) Fishing Vessel Log Reports--(i) Owners of 
vessels issued a moratorium permit for summer flounder, mackerel, squid, 
or butterfish, or scup, or a permit for sea scallop, or multispecies. 
The owner or operator of any vessel issued a moratorium vessel permit 
for summer flounder, or, as of January 1, 1997, for mackerel, squid, or 
butterfish, or scup, or a permit for sea scallops, or NE multispecies, 
must maintain on board the vessel, and submit, an accurate daily fishing 
log report for all fishing trips, regardless of species fished for or 
taken, on forms supplied by or approved by the Regional Director. If 
authorized in writing by the Regional Director, vessel owners or 
operators may submit reports electronically, for example by using a VTS 
or other media. At least the following information, and any other 
information required by the Regional Director, must be provided: Vessel 
name; USCG documentation number (or state registration number, if 
undocumented); permit number; date/time sailed; date/time landed; trip

    (ii) Surf clam and ocean quahog vessel owners and operators. The 
owner or operator of any vessel conducting any surf clam and ocean 
quahog fishing operations, except those conducted exclusively in waters 
of a state that requires cage tags or when he/she has surrendered the 
surf clam and ocean quahog fishing vessel permit, shall maintain, on 
board the vessel, an accurate daily fishing log for each fishing trip, 
on forms supplied by the Regional Director, showing at least: Name and 
permit number of the vessel, total amount in bushels of each species

fished, crew size, crew share by percentage, landing port, date sold, 
price per bushel, buyer, tag numbers from cages used, quantity of surf 
clams and ocean quahogs discarded, and allocation permit number.
    (iii) Owners of party and charter boats. The owner of any party or 
charter boat issued a summer flounder or scup permit other than a 
moratorium permit and carrying passengers for hire shall maintain on 
board the vessel, and submit, an accurate daily fishing log report for 
each charter or party fishing trip that lands summer flounder or scup, 
unless such a vessel is also issued a moratorium permit for summer 
flounder, a permit for sea scallops or multispecies, or, as of January 
1, 1997, a moratorium permit for mackerel, squid, or butterfish, or 
scup, in which case a fishing log report is required for each trip 
regardless of species retained. If authorized in writing by the Regional 
Director, vessel owners may submit reports electronically, for example, 
by using a VTS or other media. At least the following information, and 
any other information required by the

Sec. 648.8  Vessel identification.

    (a) Vessel name and official number. Each fishing vessel subject to 
this part and over 25 ft (7.6 m) in registered length must:
    (1) Affix permanently its name on the port and starboard sides of 
the bow and, if possible, on its stern.
    (2) Display its official number on the port and starboard sides of 
the deckhouse or hull, and on an appropriate weather deck so as to be 
clearly visible from enforcement vessels and aircraft.

[[Page 176]]

The official number is the USCG documentation number or the vessel's 
state registration number for vessels not required to be documented 
under title 46 U.S.C.
    (b) Numerals. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, 
the official number must be displayed in block arabic numerals in 
contrasting color at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) in height for fishing 
vessels over 65 ft (19.8 m) in registered length, and at least 10 inches 
(25.4 cm) in height for all other vessels over 25 ft (7.6 m) in 
registered length. The registered length of a vessel, for purposes of 
this section, is that registered length set forth in USCG or state 
records.
    (c) Duties of owner. The owner of each vessel subject to this part 
shall ensure that--
    (1) The vessel's name and official number are kept clearly legible 
and in good repair.
    (2) No part of the vessel, its rigging, its fishing gear, or any 
other object obstructs the view of the official number from any 
enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (d) Non-permanent marking. Vessels carrying recreational fishing 
parties on a per capita basis or by charter must use markings that meet 
the above requirements, except for the requirement that they be affixed 
permanently to the vessel. The non-permanent markings must be displayed 
in conformity with the above requirements.
    (e) New Jersey surf clam or ocean quahog vessels. Instead of 
complying with paragraph (a) of this section, surf clam or ocean quahog 
vessels licensed under New Jersey law may use the appropriate vessel 
identification markings established by that state.


<R05>
Sec. 648.9  VTS requirements.

    (a) Approval. The Regional Director will annually approve VTSs that 
meet the minimum performance criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Any changes to the performance criteria will be published 
annually in the Federal Register and a list of approved VTSs will be 
published in the Federal Register upon addition or deletion of a VTS 
from the list. In the event that a VTS is deleted from the list, vessel 
owners that purchased a VTS unit that is part of that VTS prior to 
publication of the revised list will be considered to be in compliance 
with the requirement to have an approved unit, unless otherwise notified 
by the Regional Director.
    (b) Minimum VTS performance criteria. The basic required features of 
the VTS are as follows:
    (1) The VTS shall be tamper proof, i.e., shall not permit the input 
of false positions; furthermore, if a system uses satellites to 
determine position, satellite selection should be automatic to provide 
an optimal fix and should not be capable of being manually overridden by 
any person aboard a fishing vessel or by the vessel owner.
    (2) The VTS shall be fully automatic and operational at all times, 
regardless of weather and environmental conditions.
    (3) The VTS shall be capable of tracking vessels in all U.S. waters 
in the Atlantic Ocean from the shoreline of each coastal state to a line 
215 nm offshore and shall provide position accuracy to within 400 m 
(1,300 ft).
    (4) The VTS shall be capable of transmitting and storing information 
including vessel identification, date, time, and latitude/longitude.
    (5) The VTS shall provide accurate hourly position transmissions 
every day of the year. In addition, the VTS shall allow polling of 
individual vessels or any set of vessels at any time and receive 
position reports in real time. For the purposes of this specification, 
``real time'' shall constitute data that reflect a delay of 15 minutes 
or less between the displayed information and the vessel's actual 
position.
    (6) The VTS shall be capable of providing network message 
communications between the vessel and shore. The VTS shall allow NMFS to 
initiate communications or data transfer at any time.
    (7) The VTS vendor shall be capable of transmitting position data to 
a NMFS-designated computer system via a modem at a minimum speed of 9600 
baud. Transmission shall be in ASCII text in a file format acceptable to 
NMFS.
    (8) The VTS shall be capable of providing vessel locations relative 
to

[[Page 177]]

international boundaries and fishery management areas.
    (9) The VTS vendor shall be capable of archiving vessel position 
histories for a minimum of 1 year and providing transmission to NMFS of 
specified portions of archived data in response to NMFS requests and in 
a variety of media (tape, floppy, etc.).
    (c) Operating requirements. All required VTS units must transmit a 
signal indicating the vessel's accurate position at least every hour, 24 
hours a day, throughout the year.
    (d) Presumption. If a VTS unit fails to transmit an hourly signal of 
a vessel's position, the vessel shall be deemed to have incurred a DAS, 
or fraction thereof, for as long as the unit fails to transmit a signal, 
unless a preponderance of evidence shows that the failure to transmit 
was due to an unavoidable malfunction or disruption of the transmission 
that occurred while the vessel was declared out of the scallop fishery 
or NE multispecies fishery, as applicable, or was not at sea.
    (e) Replacement. Should a VTS unit require replacement, a vessel 
owner must submit documentation to the Regional Director, within 3 days 
of installation and prior to the vessel's next trip, verifying that the 
new VTS unit is an operational approved system as described under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (f) Access. As a condition to obtaining a limited access scallop or 
multispecies permit, all vessel owners must allow NMFS, the USCG, and 
their authorized officers or designees access to the vessel's DAS and 
location data obtained from its VTS at the time of or after its 
transmission to the vendor or receiver, as the case may be.
    (g) Tampering. Tampering with a VTS, a VTS unit, or a VTS signal, is 
prohibited. Tampering includes any activity that is likely to affect the 
unit's ability to operate properly, signal, or accuracy of computing the 
vessel's position fix.

    (b) VTS notification. Multispecies vessels issued an individual DAS 
or combination permit, scallop vessels issued a full-time or part-time 
limited access scallop permit, or scallop vessels fishing under the 
small dredge program specified in Sec. 648.51(e), or vessels issued a 
limited access multispecies or scallop permit and whose owners elect to 
fish under the VTS notification of this paragraph (b), unless otherwise 
authorized or required by the Regional Director under Sec. 648.9(a), 
must have installed on board an operational VTS unit that meets the 
minimum performance criteria specified in Sec. 648.9(b), or as modified 
as specified in Sec. 648.9(a). Owners of such vessels must provide 
documentation to the Regional Director at the time of application for a 
limited access permit that the vessel has an operational VTS unit that 
meets the minimum performance criteria specified in Sec. 648.9(b), or as 
modified as specified in Sec. 648.9(a). If a vessel has already been 
issued a limited access permit without providing such documentation, the 
Regional Director shall allow at least 30 days for the vessel to instal 
an operational VTS unit that meets the minimum performance criteria 
specified in Sec. 648.9(b), or as modified as specified in 
Sec. 648.9(a), and to provide documentation of such installation to the 
Regional Director. The VTS unit shall be subject to the following 
requirements and presumption:
    (1) Multispecies vessels issued an individual DAS or combination 
permit, scallop vessels issued a full-time or part-time limited access 
scallop permit, or vessels issued a limited access multispecies or 
scallop permit and whose owners elect to fish under the VTS notification 
of this paragraph (b), that have crossed the VTS Demarcation Line 
specified under paragraph (a) of this section, are deemed to be fishing 
under the DAS program, unless the vessel's owner or authorized 
representative declares the vessel out of the scallop or NE multispecies 
fishery, as applicable, for a specific time period by notifying the 
Regional Director through the VTS prior to the vessel leaving port.
    (2) Part-time scallop vessels may not fish in the DAS allocation 
program unless they declare into the scallop fishery for a specific time 
period by notifying the Regional Director through the VTS.
    (3) Notification that the vessel is not under the DAS program must 
be received prior to the vessel leaving port. A change in status of a 
vessel cannot be made after the vessel leaves port or before it returns 
to port on any fishing trip.
    (4) DAS for vessels that are under the VTS notification requirements 
of this paragraph (b) are counted beginning with the first hourly 
location signal received showing that the vessel crossed the VTS 
Demarcation Line leaving port. A trip concludes and accrual of

[[Page 179]]

DAS ends with the first hourly location signal received showing that the 
vessel crossed the VTS Demarcation Line upon its return to port.
    (5) If the VTS is not available or not functional, and if authorized 
by the Regional Director, a vessel owner must provide the notifications 
required by paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section by using the 
call-in notification system described under paragraph (c) of this 
section, instead of using the VTS system.
    (c) Call-in notification. Owners of vessels issued limited access 
multispecies permits who are participating in a DAS program and who are 
not required to provide notification using a VTS, owners of scallop 
vessels qualifying for a DAS allocation under the occasional category 
and who have not elected to fish under the VTS notification requirements 
of paragraph (b) of this section, and vessels fishing pending an appeal 
as specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(H)(3) are subject to the following 
requirements:
    (1) Prior to the vessel leaving port, the vessel owner or authorized 
representative must notify the Regional Director that the vessel will be 
participating in the DAS program or the charter/party fishery by calling 
the Regional Director and providing the following information: Owner and 
caller name and phone number, vessel's name and permit number, type of 
trip to be taken, and that the vessel is beginning a trip. For NE 
multispecies vessels, the port of departure also must be specified. A 
DAS or a vessel's participation in the charter/party fishery begins once 
the call has been received and a confirmation number is given by the 
Regional Director.
    (2) The confirmation number given by the Regional Director must be 
kept on board for the duration of the trip and must be provided to an 
authorized officer upon request.
    (3) Upon the vessel's return to port, the vessel owner or owner's 
representative must call the Regional Director and notify him/her that 
the trip has ended by providing the following information: Owner and 
caller name and phone number, vessel's name and permit number, and that 
the vessel has ended a trip. For NE multispecies vessels, the port of 
landing also must be specified. A DAS ends for all but vessels fishing 
with gillnet gear when the call has been received and confirmation given 
by the Regional Director. For vessels fishing with gillnet gear, DAS 
continue to accrue as long as the vessel's gillnet gear remains in the 
water. A trip concludes and accrual of DAS ends for a gillnet vessel 
when the vessel returns to port with all of its gillnet gear that was in 
the water on board, the phone call has been received, and confirmation 
has been given by the Regional Director.
    (4) The Regional Director will furnish a phone number for DAS 
notification call-ins upon request.
    (5) Any vessel that possesses or lands per trip more than 400 lb 
(181.44 kg) of scallops, and any vessel issued a limited access 
multispecies permit subject to the DAS program and call-in requirement, 
that possesses or lands regulated species, except as provided in 
Sec. 648.83, shall be deemed in the DAS program for purposes of counting 
DAS, regardless of whether the vessel's owner or authorized 
representative provided adequate notification as required by paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (d) Temporary authorization for use of the call-in system. The 
Regional Director may authorize or require, on a temporary basis, the 
use of the call-in system of notification specified in paragraph (c) of 
this section. If use of the call-in system is authorized or required, 
the Regional Director shall notify affected permit holders through a 
letter, notification in the Federal Register, or other appropriate 
means.
    (e) Charter/party multispecies vessels. Charter/party multispecies 
vessels that are not fishing under a multispecies DAS must declare into 
and out of the charter/party fishery, providing notification under 
paragraph (b) of this section, must remain in the charter/party fishery 
for a minimum of 24 hours after declaring into the fishery, and are 
subject to the restrictions in Sec. 648.89.
    (f) Scallop vessels fishing under exemptions. Vessels fishing under 
the exemptions provided by Sec. 648.54 (a) and/or (b) must notify the 
Regional Director by VTS notification or through call-in notification as 
follows:

[[Page 180]]

    (1) VTS notification. (i) Notify the Regional Director, via their 
VTS, prior to the vessel's first trip under the state waters exemption 
program, that the vessel will be fishing exclusively in state waters; 
and
    (ii) Notify the Regional Director, via their VTS, prior to the 
vessel's first planned trip in the EEZ, that the vessel is to resume 
fishing under the vessel's DAS allocation.
    (2) Call-in notification. (i) Notify the Regional Director by 
calling the Regional Director and providing the following information at 
least 7 days prior to fishing under the exemption: Owner and caller name 
and address, vessel name and permit number, and beginning and ending 
dates of the exemption period.
    (ii) Remain under the exemption for a minimum of 7 days.
    (iii) If, under the exemption for a minimum of 7 days and wishing to 
withdraw earlier than the designated end of the exemption period, notify 
the Regional Director of early withdrawal from the program by calling 
the Regional Director, providing the vessel's name and permit number and 
the name and phone number of the caller, and stating that the vessel is 
withdrawing from the exemption. The vessel may not leave port to fish in 
the EEZ until 48 hours after notification of early withdrawal is 
received by the Regional Director.
    (iv) The Regional Director will furnish a phone number for call-ins 
upon request.

Sec. 648.11  At-sea sea sampler/observer coverage.

    (a) The Regional Director may request any vessel holding a permit 
for sea scallop or NE multispecies; or a moratorium permit for summer 
flounder; or, as of January 1, 1997, a mackerel, squid, or butterfish, 
or scup permit to carry a NMFS-approved sea sampler/observer. If 
requested by the Regional Director to carry an observer or sea sampler, 
a vessel may not engage in any fishing operations in the respective 
fishery unless an observer or sea sampler is on board, or unless the 
requirement is waived.
    (b) If requested by the Regional Director to carry an observer or 
sea sampler, it is the responsibility of the vessel owner to arrange for 
and facilitate observer or sea sampler placement. Owners of vessels 
selected for sea sampler/observer coverage must notify the appropriate 
Regional or Science and Research Director, as specified by the Regional 
Director, before commencing any fishing trip that may result in the 
harvest of resources of the respective fishery. Notification procedures 
will be specified in selection letters to vessel owners.
    (c) The Regional Director may waive the requirement to carry a sea 
sampler or observer if the facilities on a vessel for housing the 
observer or sea sampler, or for carrying out observer or sea sampler 
functions, are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the 
observer or sea sampler, or the safe operation of the vessel, would be 
jeopardized.
    (d) An owner or operator of a vessel on which a NMFS-approved sea 
sampler/observer is embarked must:
    (1) Provide accommodations and food that are equivalent to those 
provided to the crew.
    (2) Allow the sea sampler/observer access to and use of the vessel's 
communications equipment and personnel upon request for the transmission 
and receipt of messages related to the sea sampler's/observer's duties.
    (3) Provide true vessel locations, by latitude and longitude or 
loran coordinates, as requested by the observer/sea sampler, and allow 
the sea sampler/observer access to and use of the vessel's navigation 
equipment and personnel upon request to determine the vessel's position.
    (4) Notify the sea sampler/observer in a timely fashion of when 
fishing operations are to begin and end.
    (5) Allow for the embarking and debarking of the sea sampler/
observer, as specified by the Regional Director, ensuring that transfers 
of observers/sea samplers at sea are accomplished in a safe manner, via 
small boat or raft, during daylight hours as weather and sea conditions 
allow, and with the agreement of the sea samplers/ observers involved.
    (6) Allow the sea sampler/observer free and unobstructed access to 
the vessel's bridge, working decks, holding

[[Page 181]]

bins, weight scales, holds, and any other space used to hold, process, 
weigh, or store fish.
    (7) Allow the sea sampler/observer to inspect and copy any the 
vessel's log, communications log, and records associated with the catch 
and distribution of fish for that trip.
    (e) The owner or operator of a vessel issued a summer flounder or 
scup moratorium permit, if requested by the sea sampler/observer also 
must:
    (1) Notify the sea sampler/observer of any sea turtles, marine 
mammals, summer flounder or scup, or other specimens taken by the 
vessel.
    (2) Provide the sea sampler/observer with sea turtles, marine 
mammals, summer flounder or scup, or other specimens taken by the 
vessel.
    (3) Provide storage for biological specimens, including cold storage 
if available, and retain such specimens on board the vessel as 
instructed by the sea sampler/observer, until retrieved by authorized 
NMFS personnel.
    (f) NMFS may accept observer coverage funded by outside sources if:
    (1) All coverage conducted by such observers is determined by NMFS 
to be in compliance with NMFS' observer guidelines and procedures.
    (2) The owner or operator of the vessel complies with all other 
provisions of this part.
    (3) The observer is approved by the Regional Director.

requirements of subparts B (Atlantic mackerel, squid, and butterfish), D 
(sea scallop), E (surf clam and ocean quahog), F (NE multispecies), G 
(summer flounder), or H (scup), of this part for the conduct of 
experimental fishing beneficial to the management of the resources or 
fishery managed under that subpart. The Regional Director shall consult 
with the Executive Director of the MAFMC regarding such exemptions for 
the mackerel, squid, or butterfish, summer flounder and scup fisheries.
    (a) The Regional Director may not grant such an exemption unless he/
she determines that the purpose, design, and administration of the 
exemption is consistent with the objectives of the respective FMP, the 
provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law, and that 
granting the exemption will not:
    (1) Have a detrimental effect on the respective resources and 
fishery;
    (2) Cause any quota to be exceeded; or
    (3) Create significant enforcement problems.
    (b) Each vessel participating in any exempted experimental fishing 
activity is subject to all provisions of the respective FMP, except 
those necessarily relating to the purpose and nature of the exemption. 
The exemption will be specified in a letter issued by the Regional 
Director to each vessel participating in the exempted activity. This 
letter must be carried on board the vessel seeking the benefit of such 
exemption.
    (c) Experimental fishing for surf clams or ocean quahogs will not 
require an allocation permit.

dealer, is subject to all of the scallop prohibitions specified in this 
section, unless the scallops were harvested by a vessel without a 
scallop

[[Page 192]]

permit that fishes for scallops exclusively in state waters. Any person, 
regardless of the quantity of scallops possessed or landed, is subject 
to the prohibitions of paragraphs (a)(4) through (7), (10), (11), (68), 
(69), (71), (72), (73), and (87) of this section.
    (t) In addition to the general prohibitions specified in

issued a nonregulated multispecies permit to possess or land any 
regulated species as defined in Sec. 648.2, or violate any applicable 
provisions of Sec. 648.88.
    (u) For purposes of this section, the following presumptions apply:
    (1) Surf clams and ocean quahogs. (i) Possession of surf clams or 
ocean quahogs on the deck of any fishing vessel in closed areas, or the 
presence of any part of a vessel's gear in the water in closed areas, or 
the presence of any part of a vessel's gear in the water more than 12 
hours after an announcement closing the entire fishery becomes 
effective, is prima facie evidence that such vessel was fishing in 
violation of the provisions of the Magnuson Act and these regulations.
    (ii) Surf clams or ocean quahogs landed from a trip for which 
notification was provided under Sec. 648.15(b) or Sec. 648.70(b) are 
deemed to have been harvested in the EEZ and count against the 
individual's annual allocation.
    (iii) Surf clams or ocean quahogs found in cages without a valid 
state tag are deemed to have been harvested in the EEZ, and to be part 
of an individual's allocation, unless such individual demonstrates that 
he/she has surrendered his/her surf clam and ocean quahog vessel permit 
issued under Sec. 648.4 and has conducted fishing operations exclusively 
within waters under the jurisdiction of any state. Surf clams and ocean 
quahogs in cages with a Federal tag or tags, issued and still valid 
pursuant to this section, affixed thereto are deemed to have been 
harvested by the individual allocation holder to whom the tags were 
issued or transferred under Sec. 648.70(d)(2) or Sec. 648.75(b).
    (2) Scallops. Scallops that are possessed or landed at or prior to 
the time when the scallops are received by a dealer, or scallops that 
are possessed by a dealer, are deemed to be harvested from the EEZ, 
unless the preponderance of all submitted evidence demonstrates that 
such scallops were harvested by a vessel without a scallop permit and 
fishing exclusively for scallops in state waters.
    (3) Summer flounder. All summer flounder possessed aboard a party or 
charter boat issued a summer flounder permit are deemed to have been 
harvested from the EEZ.
    (4) NE multispecies. (i) Regulated species possessed for sale that 
do not meet the minimum sizes specified in Sec. 648.83 for sale are 
deemed to have been taken or imported in violation of these regulations, 
unless the preponderance of all submitted evidence demonstrates that 
such fish were harvested by a vessel not issued a permit under this part 
and fishing exclusively within state waters. This presumption does not 
apply to fish being sorted on deck.
    (ii) Regulated species possessed for sale that do not meet the 
minimum sizes specified in Sec. 648.83 for sale are deemed taken from 
the EEZ or imported in violation of these regulations, unless the 
preponderance of all submitted evidence demonstrates that such fish were 
harvested by a vessel not issued a permit under this part and fishing 
exclusively within state waters. This presumption does not apply to fish 
being sorted on deck.
    (5) Mackerel, squid, and butterfish. All mackerel and butterfish 
possessed on board a party or charter boat issued a mackerel, squid, and 
butterfish fishery permit are deemed to have been harvested from the 
EEZ.
    (6) Scup. All scup possessed on board a party or charter boat issued 
a permit under Sec. 648.4 are deemed to have been harvested from the 
EEZ.

    (a) General. See Sec. 600.504 of this chapter.
    (b) Special notification requirements applicable to surf clam and 
ocean quahog vessel owners and operators. (1) Vessel owners or operators 
are required to call the NMFS Office of Law Enforcement

[[Page 193]]

nearest to the point of offloading (contact the Regional Director for 
locations and phone numbers) and accurately provide the following 
information prior to the departure of their vessel from the dock to fish 
for surf clams or ocean quahogs in the EEZ: Name of the vessel; NMFS 
permit number assigned to the vessel; expected date and time of 
departure from port; whether the trip will be directed on surf clams or 
ocean quahogs; expected date, time, and location of landing; and name of 
the individual providing notice.
    (2) Owners or operators that have given notification of a fishing 
trip under this paragraph (b) who decide to cancel or postpone the trip 
prior to departure must immediately provide notice of cancellation by 
telephone to the Office of Law Enforcement to which the original 
notification was provided. A separate notification shall be provided for 
the next fishing trip. Owners or operators that discontinue a fishing 
trip in the EEZ must immediately provide notice of discontinuance by 
telephone to the Office of Law Enforcement to which the original 
notification was provided. The owner or operator providing notice of 
discontinuance shall advise of any changes in landing time or port of 
landing. The owner or operator discontinuing a fishing trip in the EEZ 
must return to port and offload any surf clams or ocean quahogs prior to 
commencing fishing operations in the waters under the jurisdiction of 
any state.
    (3) The vessel permits, the vessel, its gear, and catch shall be 
subject to inspection upon request by an authorized officer.

  Subpart B--Management Measures for the Atlantic Mackerel, Squid, and 
                          Butterfish Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 648.20  Maximum optimum yield (OYs).

    The OYs specified pursuant to Sec. 648.21 during a fishing year may 
not exceed the following amounts:
    (a) Mackerel--that quantity of mackerel that is less than or equal 
to the allowable biological catch (ABC) in U.S. waters specified 
pursuant to Sec. 648.21.
    (b) Loligo--36,000 mt (79,362,000 lb).
    (c) Illex--30,000 mt (66,135,000 lb).
    (d) Butterfish--16,000 mt (35,272,000 lb).


<R05>
Sec. 648.21  Procedures for determining initial annual amounts.

    (a) Initial recommended annual specifications. The Atlantic 
Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Monitoring Committee (Monitoring 
Committee) shall meet annually to develop and recommend the following 
specifications for consideration by the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish 
Committee of the MAFMC: (1) Initial OY (IOY), domestic annual harvest 
(DAH), and domestic annual processing (DAP) for the squids; (2) IOY, 
DAH, DAP, and bycatch level of the total allowable level of foreign 
fishing (TALFF), if any, for butterfish; and (3) IOY, DAH, DAP, joint 
venture processing (JVP), if any, and TALFF, if any, for mackerel. The 
Monitoring Committee may also recommend that certain ratios of TALFF, if 
any, for mackerel to purchases of domestic harvested fish and/or 
domestic processed fish be established in relation to the initial annual 
amounts.
    (b) Guidelines. As the basis for its recommendations under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the Monitoring Committee shall review available 
data pertaining to: Commercial and recreational landings, discards, 
current estimates of fishing mortality, stock status, the most recent 
estimates of recruitment, virtual population analysis results, levels of 
noncompliance by harvesters or individual states, impact of size/mesh 
regulations, results of a survey of domestic processors and joint 
venture operators of estimated mackerel processing capacity and intent 
to use that capacity, results of a survey of fishermen's trade 
associations of estimated mackerel harvesting capacity and intent to use 
that capacity, and any other relevant information. The specifications 
recommended pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must be consistent 
with the following:
    (1) Squid. (i) The ABC for any fishing year must be either the 
maximum OY specified in Sec. 648.20, or a lower amount, if stock 
assessments indicate that the

[[Page 194]]

potential yield is less than the maximum OY.
    (ii) IOY is a modification of ABC based on social and economic 
factors.
    (2) Mackerel. (i) Mackerel ABC must be calculated from the formula 
ABC = S - C - T, where C is the estimated catch of mackerel in Canadian 
waters for the upcoming fishing year; S is the mackerel spawning stock 
size at the beginning of the year for which quotas are specified; and T, 
which must be equal to or greater than 900,000 mt (1,984,050,000 lb), is 
the spawning stock size that must be maintained in the year following 
the year for which quotas are specified.
    (ii) IOY is a modification of ABC, based on social and economic 
factors, and must be less than or equal to ABC.
    (iii) IOY is composed of DAH and TALFF. DAH, DAP, and JVP must be 
projected by reviewing data from sources specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section and other relevant data, including past domestic landings, 
projected amounts of mackerel necessary for domestic processing and for 
joint ventures during the fishing year, projected recreational landings, 
and other data pertinent for such a projection. The JVP component of DAH 
is the portion of DAH that domestic processors either cannot or will not 
use. In addition, IOY is based on the criteria set forth in the Magnuson 
Act, specifically section 201(e), and on the following economic factors:
    (A) Total world export potential by mackerel producing countries.
    (B) Total world import demand by mackerel consuming countries.
    (C) U.S. export potential based on expected U.S. harvests, expected 
U.S. consumption, relative prices, exchange rates, and foreign trade 
barriers.
    (D) Increased/decreased revenues to the United States from foreign 
fees.
    (E) Increased/decreased revenues to U.S. harvesters (with/without 
joint ventures).
    (F) Increased/decreased revenues to U.S. processors and exporters.
    (G) Increases/decreases in U.S. harvesting productivity due to 
decreases/increases in foreign harvest.
    (H) Increases/decreases in U.S. processing productivity.
    (I) Potential impact of increased/decreased TALFF on foreign 
purchases of U.S. products and services and U.S.-caught fish, changes in 
trade barriers, technology transfer, and other considerations.
    (3) Butterfish. (i) If the Monitoring Committee's review indicates 
that the stock cannot support a level of harvest equal to the maximum 
OY, the Monitoring Committee shall recommend establishing an ABC less 
than the maximum OY for the fishing year. This level represents the 
modification of maximum OY to reflect biological and ecological factors. 
If the stock is able to support a harvest level equivalent to the 
maximum OY, the ABC must be set at that level.
    (ii) IOY is a modification of ABC based on social and economic 
factors. The IOY is composed of a DAH and bycatch TALFF that is equal to 
0.08 percent of the allocated portion of the mackerel TALFF.
    (c) Recommended measures. Based on the review of the data described 
in paragraph (a) of this section, the Monitoring Committee will 
recommend to the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Committee the measures 
it determines are necessary to assure that the specifications are not 
exceeded from the following measures:
    (1) Commercial quotas.
    (2) The amount of Loligo and butterfish that may be retained, 
possessed and landed by vessels issued the incidental catch permit 
specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(5).
    (3) Commercial minimum fish sizes.
    (4) Commercial trip limits.
    (5) Commercial seasonal quotas.
    (6) Minimum mesh sizes.
    (7) Commercial gear restrictions.
    (8) Recreational harvest limit.
    (9) Recreational minimum fish size.
    (10) Recreational possession limits.
    (11) Recreational season.
    (d) Annual fishing measures. (1) The Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish 
Committee shall review the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee. 
Based on these recommendations and any public comment received thereon, 
the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Committee shall recommend to the 
MAFMC appropriate specifications and any measures necessary to assure 
that

[[Page 195]]

the specifications will not be exceeded. The MAFMC shall review these 
recommendations and based on the recommendations and any public comment 
received thereon, the MAFMC shall recommend to the Regional Director 
appropriate specifications and any measures necessary to assure that the 
specifications will not be exceeded. The MAFMC's recommendations must 
include supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the 
environmental, economic, and social impacts of the recommendations. The 
Regional Director shall review the recommendations, and on or about 
November 1 of each year, shall publish notification in the Federal 
Register proposing specifications and any measures necessary to assure 
that the specifications will not be exceeded and providing a 30-day 
public comment period. If the proposed specifications differ from those 
recommended by the MAFMC, the reasons for any differences shall be 
clearly stated and the revised specifications must satisfy the criteria 
set forth in this section. The MAFMC's recommendations shall be 
available for inspection at the office of the Regional Director during 
the public comment period.
    (2) On or about December 15 of each year, the Assistant 
Administrator will make a final determination concerning the 
specifications for each species and any measures necessary to assure 
that the specifications will not be exceeded contained in the Federal 
Register notification. After the Assistant Administrator considers all 
relevant data and any public comments, notification of the final 
specifications and any measures necessary to assure that the 
specifications will not be exceeded and responses to the public comments 
will be published in the Federal Register. If the final specification 
amounts differ from those recommended by the MAFMC, the reason(s) for 
the difference(s) must be clearly stated and the revised specifications 
must be consistent with the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (e) Inseason adjustments. The specifications established pursuant to 
this section may be adjusted by the Regional Director, in consultation 
with the MAFMC, during the fishing year by publishing notification in 
the Federal Register stating the reasons for such an action and 
providing a 30-day comment public comment period.


<R05>
Sec. 648.22  Closure of the fishery.

    (a) General. The Assistant Administrator shall close the directed 
mackerel or Loligo or Illex squid or butterfish fishery in the EEZ when 
U.S. fishermen have harvested 80 percent of the DAH, of that fishery if 
such closure is necessary to prevent the DAH from being exceeded. The 
closure shall remain in effect for the remainder of the fishing year, 
with incidental catches allowed as specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section, until the entire DAH is attained. When the Regional Director 
projects that DAH will be attained for any of the species, the Assistant 
Administrator shall close the fishery in the EEZ to all fishing for that 
species, and the incidental catches specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section will be prohibited.
    (b) Notification. Upon determining that a closure is necessary, the 
Assistant Administrator will notify, in advance of the closure, the 
Executive Directors of the MAFMC, NEFMC, and SAFMC; mail notification of 
the closure to all holders of mackerel, squid, and butterfish fishery 
permits at least 72 hours before the effective date of the closure; 
provide adequate notice of the closure to recreational participants in 
the fishery; and publish notification of closure in the Federal 
Register.
    (c) Incidental catches. During the closure of a directed fishery, 
the trip limit for the species for which the fishery is closed is 10 
percent, by weight, of the total amount of fish on board for a vessel 
with a Loligo/butterfish moratorium permit or Illex or a mackerel 
commercial permit. During a period of closure of the directed fishery 
for Loligo or butterfish, the trip limit for a vessel with an incidental 
catch permit for those species is 10 percent, by weight, of the total 
amount of fish on board, or the allowed level of incidental catch 
specified in Sec. 648.4(e)(2), whichever is less.

[[Page 196]]


<R05>
Sec. 648.23  Gear restrictions.

    (a) Mesh restrictions and exemptions. Owners or operators of otter 
trawl vessels possessing Loligo harvested in or from the EEZ may only 
fish with nets having a minimum mesh size of 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm) 
diamond mesh, inside stretch measure, applied throughout the entire net, 
unless they are fishing during the months of June, July, August, and 
September for Illex seaward of the following coordinates (copies of a 
map depicting this area are available from the Regional Director upon 
request):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Vessels fishing under this exemption may not have available for 
immediate use, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, any net, or 
any piece of net, with a mesh size less than 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm) 
diamond mesh or any net, or any piece of net, with mesh that is rigged 
in a manner that is inconsistent with such minimum mesh size, when the 
vessel is landward of the specified coordinates.
    (b) Definition of ``not available for immediate use.'' A net that 
can be shown not to have been in recent use and that is stowed in 
conformance with one of the following methods is considered to be not 
available for immediate use:
    (1) Below deck stowage. (i) It is stored below the main working deck 
from which it is deployed and retrieved;
    (ii) The towing wires, including the leg wires, are detached from 
the net; and
    (iii) It is fan-folded (flaked) and bound around its circumference.
    (2) On-deck stowage. (i) It is fan-folded (flaked) and bound around 
its circumference;
    (ii) It is securely fastened to the deck or rail of the vessel; and
    (iii) The towing wires, including the leg wires, are detached from 
the net.
    (3) On-reel stowage. (i) It is on a reel and it's entire surface is 
covered with canvas or other similar material that is securely bound;
    (ii) The towing wires, including the leg wires, are detached from 
the net; and
    (iii) The codend is removed and stored below deck.
    (4) Other methods of stowage. Any other method of stowage authorized 
in writing by the Regional Director and published in the Federal 
Register.
    (c) Mesh obstruction or constriction. The owner or operator of a 
fishing vessel shall not use any combination of mesh or liners that 
effectively decreases the mesh size below the minimum mesh size, except 
that a liner may be used to close the opening created by the rings in 
the rearmost portion of the net, provided the liner extends no more than 
10 meshes forward of the rearmost portion of the net.
    (d) Net obstruction or constriction. The owner or operator of a 
fishing vessel shall not use any device, gear, or material, including, 
but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing 
gear, on the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net that results in 
an effective mesh opening of less than 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm) diamond 
mesh, inside stretch measure. Net strengtheners (covers), splitting 
straps and/or bull ropes or wire may be used, provided they do not 
constrict the top of the regulated portion of the net to less than an 
effective mesh opening of 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm), diamond mesh, inside 
stretch measure. Net strengtheners (covers) may not have an effective 
mesh opening of less than 4.5 inches (11.43 cm), diamond mesh, inside 
stretch measure. ``Top of the regulated portion of the net'' means the 
50 percent of the entire regulated portion of

[[Page 197]]

the net that (in a hypothetical situation) would not be in contact with 
the ocean bottom during a tow if the regulated portion of the net were 
laid flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of this paragraph (d), 
head ropes are not to be considered part of the top of the regulated 
portion of a trawl net.

           Subpart C--Management Measures for Atlantic Salmon


<R05>
Sec. 648.40  Prohibition on possession.

    (a) Incidental catch. All Atlantic salmon caught incidental to a 
directed fishery for other species in the EEZ must be released in such a 
manner as to insure maximum probability of survival.
    (b) Presumption. The possession of Atlantic salmon is prima facie 
evidence that such Atlantic salmon were taken in violation of this 
regulation. Evidence that such fish were harvested in state waters, or 
from foreign waters, or from aquaculture enterprises, will be sufficient 
to rebut the presumption. This presumption does not apply to fish being 
sorted on deck.


<R04>
   Subpart D--Management Measures for the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery


<R05>
Sec. 648.50  Shell-height standard.

    (a) Minimum shell height. The minimum shell height for in-shell 
scallops that may be landed, or possessed at or after landing, is 3.5 
inches (89 mm). Shell height is a straight line measurement from the 
hinge to the outermost part of the shell, that is, the edge farthest 
away from the hinge.
    (b) Compliance and sampling. Compliance with the minimum shell-
height standard will be determined by inspection and enforcement at or 
after landing, including the time when the scallops are received or 
possessed by a dealer or person acting in the capacity of a dealer as 
follows: An authorized officer will take samples of 40 scallops each, at 
random, from the total amount of scallops in possession. The person in 
possession of the scallops may request that as many as 10 samples (400 
scallops) be examined as a sample group. A sample group fails to comply 
with the standard if more than 10 percent of all scallops sampled are 
less than the shell height specified. The total amount of scallops in 
possession will be deemed in violation of this subpart and subject to 
forfeiture, if the sample group fails to comply with the standard. All 
scallops will be subject to inspection and enforcement, in accordance 
with these compliance and sampling procedures, up to and including the 
time when a dealer receives or possesses scallops for a commercial 
purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 648.51  Gear and crew restrictions.

    (a) Trawl vessel gear restrictions. Trawl vessels in possession of 
more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) of shucked, or 5 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell 
scallops, trawl vessels fishing for scallops, and trawl vessels issued a 
limited access scallop permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(2), while fishing 
under or subject to the DAS allocation program for scallops and 
authorized to fish with or possess on board trawl nets pursuant to 
Sec. 648.51(f), must comply with the following:
    (1) Maximum sweep. The trawl sweep of nets in use by or available 
for immediate use, as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this 
section, shall not exceed 144 ft (43.9 m) as measured by the total 
length of the footrope that is directly attached to the webbing of the 
net.
    (2) Net requirements--(i) Minimum mesh size. The mesh size for any 
scallop trawl net in all areas shall not be smaller than 5.5 inches 
(13.97 cm).
    (ii) Mesh stowage. Same as Sec. 648.23(b).
    (iii) Measurement of mesh size. Mesh size is measured by using a 
wedge-shaped gauge having a taper of 2 cm in 8 cm and a thickness of 2.3 
mm, inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull of 5 kg. The mesh 
size is the average of the measurements of any series of 20 consecutive 
meshes for nets having 75 or more meshes, and 10 consecutive meshes for 
nets having fewer than 75 meshes. The mesh in the regulated portion of 
the net will be measured at least five meshes away from the lacings 
running parallel to the long axis of the net.
    (3) Chafing gear and other gear obstructions--(i) Net obstruction or 
constriction. A fishing vessel may not use any device

[[Page 198]]

or material, including, but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, 
ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of a trawl net, except that 
one splitting strap and one bull rope (if present), consisting of line 
and rope no more than 3 inches (7.62 cm) in diameter, may be used if 
such splitting strap and/or bull rope does not constrict in any manner 
the top of the trawl net. ``The top of the trawl net'' means the 50 
percent of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) would not be in 
contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the net were laid flat on 
the ocean floor. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), head ropes 
shall not be considered part of the top of the trawl net.
    (ii) Mesh obstruction or constriction. A fishing vessel may not use 
any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in the 
top of the net, as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, if it 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (iii) A fishing vessel may not use or possess a net capable of 
catching scallops in which the bars entering or exiting the knots twist 
around each other.
    (b) Dredge vessel gear restrictions. All dredge vessels fishing for 
or in possession of more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) of shucked, or 5 bu 
(176.2 L) of in-shell scallops, and all dredge vessels issued a limited 
access scallop permit and fishing under the DAS Program, with the 
exception of hydraulic clam dredges and mahogany quahog dredges in 
possession of 400 lb (181.44 kg) of scallops, or less, must comply with 
the following restrictions:
    (1) Maximum dredge width. The combined dredge width in use by or in 
possession on board such vessels shall not exceed 31 ft (9.4 m) measured 
at the widest point in the bail of the dredge, except as provided under 
paragraph (e) of this section. However, component parts may be on board 
the vessel such that they do not conform with the definition of ``dredge 
or dredge gear'' in Sec. 648.2, i.e., the metal ring bag and the mouth 
frame, or bail, of the dredge are not attached, and such that no more 
than one complete spare dredge could be made from these components 
parts.
    (2) Minimum mesh size. (i) The mesh size of net material on the top 
of a scallop dredge in use by or in possession of such vessels shall not 
be smaller than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm).
    (ii) Mesh size is measured as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of 
this section.
    (3) Minimum ring size. (i) The inside ring size of a scallop dredge 
in use by or in possession of such vessels shall not be smaller than 3.5 
inches (89 mm).
    (ii) Ring size is determined by measuring the shortest straight line 
passing through the center of the ring from one inside edge to the 
opposite inside edge of the ring. The measurement shall not include 
normal welds from ring manufacturing or links. The rings to be measured 
will be at least five rings away from the mouth, and at least two rings 
away from other rigid portions of the dredge.
    (4) Chafing gear and other gear obstructions--(i) Chafing gear 
restrictions. No chafing gear or cookies shall be used on the top of a 
scallop dredge.
    (ii) Link restrictions. No more than double links between rings 
shall be used in or on all parts of the dredge bag, except the dredge 
bottom. No more than triple linking shall be used in or on the dredge 
bottom portion and the diamonds. Damaged links that are connected to 
only one ring, i.e., ``hangers,'' are allowed, unless they occur between 
two links that both couple the same two rings. Dredge rings may not be 
attached via links to more than four adjacent rings. Thus, dredge rings 
must be rigged in a configuration such that, when a series of adjacent 
rings are held horizontally, the neighboring rings form a pattern of 
horizontal rows and vertical columns. (A copy of a diagram showing a 
schematic of a legal dredge ring pattern is available upon request to 
the Office of the Regional Director).
    (iii) Dredge or net obstructions. No material, device, net, dredge, 
ring, or link configuration or design shall be used if it results in 
obstructing the release of scallops that would have passed through a 
legal sized and configured net and dredge, as described in this part, 
that did not have in use any such material, device, net, dredge, ring 
link configuration or design.
    (iv) Twine top restrictions. Vessels issued limited access scallop 
permits that are fishing for scallops under the

[[Page 199]]

DAS Program are also subject to the following restrictions:
    (A) If a vessel is rigged with more than one dredge, or if rigged 
with only one dredge, such dredge is greater than 8 ft (2.44 m) in 
width, there must be at least seven rows of non-overlapping steel rings 
unobstructed by netting or any other material, between the terminus of 
the dredge (club stick) and the net material on the top of the dredge 
(twine top).
    (B) For vessels rigged with only one dredge, and such dredge is less 
than 8 ft (2.44 m) in width, there must be at least four rows of non-
overlapping steel rings unobstructed by netting or any other material 
between the club stick and the twine top of the dredge. (A copy of a 
diagram showing a schematic of a legal dredge with twine top is 
available from the Regional Director upon request).
    (c) Crew restrictions. Limited access vessels participating in or 
subject to the scallop DAS allocation program may have no more than 
seven people aboard, including the operator, when not docked or moored 
in port, unless participating in the small dredge program specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section, or otherwise authorized by the Regional 
Director.
    (d) Sorting and shucking machines. (1) Shucking machines are 
prohibited on all limited access vessels fishing under the scallop DAS 
program or any vessel in possession of more than 400 lb (181.44 kg) of 
scallops, unless the vessel has not been issued a limited access scallop 
permit and fishes exclusively in state waters.
    (2) Sorting machines are prohibited on limited access vessels 
fishing under the scallop DAS program that shuck scallops at sea.
    (e) Small dredge program restrictions. Any vessel owner whose vessel 
is assigned to either the part-time or occasional category may request, 
in the application for the vessel's annual permit, to be placed in one 
category higher. Vessel owners making such a request will be placed in 
the appropriate category for the entire year, if they agree to comply 
with the following restrictions, in addition to and notwithstanding 
other restrictions of this part, when fishing under the DAS program 
described in Sec. 648.53, or in possession of more than 400 lb (181.44 
kg) of shucked, or 50 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell scallops:
    (1) The vessel must fish exclusively with one dredge no more than 
10.5 ft (3.2 m) in width.
    (2) The vessel may not have more than one dredge on board or in use.
    (3) The vessel may have no more than five people, including the 
operator, on board.
    (f) Restrictions on use of trawl nets--(1) Prohibition on use of 
trawl nets. A vessel issued a limited access scallop permit fishing for 
scallops under the scallop DAS allocation program may not fish with, 
possess on board, or land scallops while in possession of, trawl nets 
unless such vessel has on board a valid letter of authorization or 
permit endorsed to fish for scallops with trawl nets.
    (2) Eligibility to use trawl nets. (i) A vessel is eligible for a 
letter of authorization or a permit endorsement to fish for scallops 
with trawl nets if the vessel:
    (A) Has not fished for scallops with a scallop dredge after December 
31, 1987, and, as of July 19, 1996, has a letter of authorization or 
permit endorsed to fish for scallops with trawl nets;
    (B) Has fished for scallops with a scallop dredge on no more than 10 
trips from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1994, has an engine 
horsepower no greater than 450, and is eligible for or has been issued a 
1996 limited access scallop permit (if the vessel does not obtain a 
letter of authorization or a permit endorsed to fish for scallops with 
trawl nets for the 1996-97 scallop fishing year, the vessel shall not be 
eligible under this provision for subsequent fishing years); or
    (C) Is a replacement vessel for a vessel described in paragraph 
(f)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (ii) NMFS will contact the owners of all vessels with limited access 
scallop permits that have not previously been issued a letter of 
authorization or permit endorsed to fish for scallops with trawl nets as 
to whether, based on information available to NMFS on July 19, 1996, 
their vessels are eligible under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section 
for a letter of authorization or permit endorsed to fish for scallops 
with trawl

[[Page 200]]

nets. If a vessel owner agrees with NMFS' determination that the vessel 
is eligible under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section to fish for 
scallops with trawl nets, the owner must, within 30 days of receipt of 
the determination, sign and submit to NMFS a declaration, provided by 
NMFS, stating that the vessel has fished for scallops with a scallop 
dredge on no more than 10 trips from January 1, 1988, through December 
31, 1994, and has an engine with no greater than 450 horsepower. The 
signed declaration shall serve as a rebuttable presumption that the 
vessel qualifies for a letter of authorization or permit endorsement to 
fish for scallops with trawl nets. Any replacement vessel must meet the 
limitations on fishing for scallops with scallop dredges that the vessel 
it is replacing met. The letter of authorization or permit endorsement 
must be requested by the vessel owner at the time the vessel owner 
initially applies for a permit for the replacement vessel.

[61 FR 34968, July 3, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 38405, July 24, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 648.52  Possession restrictions.

    (a) Owners or operators of vessels with a limited access scallop 
permit that have declared out of the DAS program as specified in 
Sec. 648.10, or have used up their DAS allocations and vessels 
possessing a general scallop permit, unless exempted under the state 
waters exemption program described under Sec. 648.54, are prohibited 
from possessing or landing per trip more than 400 lb (181.44 kg) of 
shucked, or 50 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell scallops, with not more than one 
scallop trip allowable in any calendar day.
    (b) Owners or operators of vessels without a scallop permit, except 
vessels fishing for scallops exclusively in state waters, are prohibited 
from possessing or landing per trip, more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) of 
shucked, or 5 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell scallops. Owners or operators of 
vessels without a scallop permit are prohibited from selling, bartering, 
or trading scallops harvested from Federal waters.


<R05>
Sec. 648.53  DAS allocations.

    (a) Assignment to DAS categories. For each fishing year, each vessel 
issued a limited access scallop permit shall be assigned to the DAS 
category (full-time, part-time, or occasional) it was assigned in the 
preceding fishing year. Limited access scallop permits will indicate 
which category the vessel is assigned to. Vessels are prohibited from 
fishing for, landing per trip, or possessing more than 400 lb (181.44 
kg) of shucked, or 50 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell scallops once their 
allocated number of DAS, as specified under paragraph (b) of this 
section, are used up.
    (b) DAS allocations. Each vessel qualifying for one of the three 
categories specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
allocated, annually, the maximum number of DAS it may participate in the 
limited access scallop fishery, according to its category. A vessel 
whose owner/operator has declared it out of the scallop fishery pursuant 
to the provisions of Sec. 648.10, or has used up its allocated DAS, may 
leave port without being assessed a DAS, so long as it does not possess 
or land more than 400 lb (181.44 kg) of shucked, or 50 bu (176.2 L) of 
in-shell scallops, and complies with the other requirements of this 
part. The annual allocations of DAS for each category of vessel for the 
fishing years indicated are as follows:

    (c) Adjustments in annual DAS allocations. Adjustments or changes in 
annual DAS allocations, if required to meet fishing mortality reduction 
goals, may be made following a reappraisal and analysis under the 
framework provisions specified in Sec. 648.55.

[[Page 201]]

    (d) End-of-year carry-over. Limited access vessels with unused DAS 
on the last day of February of any year may carry over a maximum of 10 
DAS into the next year. At no time may more than 10 DAS be carried over.
    (e) Accrual of DAS. DAS shall accrue in hourly increments, with all 
partial hours counted as full hours.
    (f) Good Samaritan credit. Limited access vessels fishing under the 
DAS program and that spend time at sea assisting in a USCG search and 
rescue operation or assisting the USCG in towing a disabled vessel, and 
that can document the occurrence through the USCG, will not accrue DAS 
for the time documented.


<R05>
Sec. 648.54  State waters exemption.

    (a) DAS exemption. Any vessel issued a limited access scallop permit 
is exempt from the DAS requirements specified in Sec. 648.54(c) while 
fishing exclusively landward of the outer boundary of a state's waters, 
provided the vessel complies with paragraphs (c) through (f) of this 
section.
    (b) Gear restriction exemption--(1) Limited access permits. Any 
vessel issued a limited access scallop permit that is exempt from the 
DAS requirements of Sec. 648.53(c) under paragraph (a) of this section 
is also exempt from the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 648.51 (a), 
(b), and (e) (1) and (2) while fishing exclusively landward of the outer 
boundary of the waters of a state that has been determined by the 
Regional Director under paragraph (b)(3) of this section to have a 
scallop fishery and a scallop conservation program that does not 
jeopardize the fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the 
Scallop FMP, provided the vessel complies with paragraphs (c) through 
(f) of this section.
    (2) General permits. Any vessel issued a general scallop permit is 
exempt from the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 648.51 (a), (b), and 
(e) (1) and (2) while fishing exclusively landward of the outer boundary 
of the waters of a state that has been determined by the Regional 
Director under paragraph (b)(3) of this section to have a scallop 
fishery and a scallop conservation program that does not jeopardize the 
fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the Scallop FMP, 
provided the vessel complies with paragraphs (d) through (f) of this 
section.
    (3) State eligibility for gear exemption. (i) A state is eligible to 
have vessels fishing exclusively landward of the outer boundary of the 
waters of that state exempted from the gear requirements specified in 
Sec. 648.51 (a), (b), and (e) (1) and (e)(2), if it has a scallop 
fishery and a scallop conservation program that does not jeopardize the 
fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the Scallop FMP.
    (ii) The Regional Director shall determine which states have a 
scallop fishery and which of those states have a scallop conservation 
program that does not jeopardize the fishing mortality/effort reduction 
objectives of the Scallop FMP.
    (iii) Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts have been determined 
by the Regional Director to have scallop fisheries and scallop 
conservation programs that do not jeopardize the fishing mortality/
effort reduction objectives of the Scallop FMP. These states must 
immediately notify the Regional Director of any changes in their 
respective scallop conservation program. The Regional Director will 
review these changes and, if a determination is made that the state's 
conservation program jeopardizes the fishing mortality/effort reduction 
objectives of the Scallop FMP, or that the state no longer has a scallop 
fishery, the Regional Director shall publish a final rule in the Federal 
Register amending this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) to eliminate the exemption 
for that state. The Regional Director may determine that other states 
have scallop fisheries and scallop conservation programs that do not 
jeopardize the fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the 
Scallop FMP. In such case, the Regional Director shall publish a final 
rule in the Federal Register amending this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) to 
provide the exemption for such states.
    (c) Notification requirements. Vessels fishing under the exemptions 
provided by paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of this section must notify the 
Regional Director in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 648.10(f).

[[Page 202]]

    (d) Restriction on fishing in the EEZ. A vessel fishing under a 
state water's exemption may not fish in the EEZ during that time.
    (e) Duration of exemption. An exemption expires upon a change in the 
vessel's name or ownership.
    (f) Applicability of other provisions of this part. A vessel fishing 
under the exemptions provided by paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of this 
section remains subject to all other requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 648.55  Framework adjustments to management measures.

    (a) Annually, upon request from the NEFMC, but at a minimum in the 
years 1996 and 1999, the Regional Director will provide the NEFMC with 
information on the status of the scallop resource.
    (b) Within 60 days of receipt of that information, the NEFMC PDT 
shall assess the condition of the scallop resource to determine the 
adequacy of the total allowable DAS reduction schedule, described in 
Sec. 648.53(b), to achieve the target fishing mortality rate. In 
addition, the PDT shall make a determination whether other resource 
conservation issues exist that require a management response in order to 
meet the goals and objectives outlined in the Scallop FMP. The PDT shall 
report its findings and recommendations to the NEFMC. In its report to 
the NEFMC, the PDT shall provide the appropriate rationale and economic 
and biological analysis for its recommendation, utilizing the most 
current catch, effort, and other relevant data from the fishery.
    (c) After receiving the PDT findings and recommendations, the NEFMC 
shall determine whether adjustments to, or additional management 
measures are necessary to meet the goals and objectives of the Scallop 
FMP. After considering the PDT's findings and recommendations, or at any 
other time, if the NEFMC determines that adjustments to, or additional 
management measures are necessary, it shall develop and analyze 
appropriate management actions over the span of at least two NEFMC 
meetings. The NEFMC shall provide the public with advance notice of the 
availability of both the proposals and the analyses, and opportunity to 
comment on them prior to and at the second NEFMC meeting. The NEFMC's 
recommendation on adjustments or additions to management measures must 
come from one or more of the following categories:
    (1) DAS changes.
    (2) Shell height.
    (3) Offloading window reinstatement.
    (4) Effort monitoring.
    (5) Data reporting.
    (6) Trip limits.
    (7) Gear restrictions.
    (8) Permitting restrictions.
    (9) Crew limits.
    (10) Small mesh line.
    (11) Onboard observers.
    (12) Any other management measures currently included in the FMP.
    (d) After developing management actions and receiving public 
testimony, the NEFMC shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Director. The NEFMC's recommendation must include supporting rationale 
and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts and 
a recommendation to the Regional Director on whether to publish the 
management measures as a final rule. If the NEFMC recommends that the 
management measures should be published as a final rule, the NEFMC must 
consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis 
for each factor considered:
    (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season.
    (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the NEFMC's recommended management measures.
    (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource.
    (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their promulgation as a final rule.
    (e) If the NEFMC's recommendation includes adjustments or additions 
to

[[Page 203]]

management measures, and if, after reviewing the NEFMC's recommendation 
and supporting information:
    (1) The Regional Director concurs with the NEFMC's recommended 
management measures and determines that the recommended management 
measures may be published as a final rule based on the factors specified 
in paragraph (d) of this section, the action will be published in the 
Federal Register as a final rule; or
    (2) The Regional Director concurs with the NEFMC's recommendation 
and determines that the recommended management measures should be 
published first as a proposed rule, the action will be published as a 
proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional public comment, 
if the Regional Director concurs with the NEFMC recommendation, the 
action will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register; or
    (3) The Regional Director does not concur, the NEFMC will be 
notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (f) Nothing in this section is meant to derogate from the authority 
of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(e) of the 
Magnuson Act.

  Subpart E--Management Measures for the Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean 
                            Quahog Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 648.70  Annual individual allocations.

    (a) General. (1) For each fishing year, the Regional Director shall 
determine the allocation of surf clams and ocean quahogs for each vessel 
owner issued an allocation for the preceding fishing year, by 
multiplying the quotas specified for each species by the Regional 
Director under Sec. 648.71 by the allocation percentage, specified for 
that owner on the allocation permit for the preceding fishing year, 
adjusted to account for any transfer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section. These allocations shall be made in the form of an allocation 
permit specifying for each species the allocation percentage and the 
allocation in bushels. Such permits shall be issued on or before 
December 15, to the registered holders who were assigned an allocation 
by November 1. The total number of bushels of allocation shall be 
divided by 32 to determine the appropriate number of cage tags to be 
issued or acquired under Sec. 648.75. Amounts of allocation 0.5 or 
smaller created by this division shall be rounded downward to the 
nearest whole number and amounts of allocation greater than 0.5 created 
by this division shall be rounded upward to the nearest whole number so 
that allocations are specified in whole cages. An allocation permit is 
only valid for the entity for which it is issued.
    (2) The Regional Director may, after publication of a fee 
notification in the Federal Register, charge a permit fee before 
issuance of the permit to recover administrative expenses. Failure to 
pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit.
    (b) Transfers--(1) Allocation percentage. Subject to the approval of 
the Regional Director, part or all of an allocation percentage may be 
transferred, in amounts equivalent to not less than 160 bu (8,500 L) 
(i.e., 5 cages) in the year in which the transfer is made, to any person 
eligible to own a documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 
12102(a). Approval of a transfer by the Regional Director and for a new 
allocation permit reflecting that transfer may be requested by 
submitting a written application for approval of the transfer and for 
issuance of a new allocation permit to the Regional Director at least 10 
days before the date on which the applicant desires the transfer to be 
effective, in the form of a completed transfer log supplied by the 
Regional Director. The transfer is not effective until the new holder 
receives a new or revised annual allocation permit from the Regional 
Director. An application for transfer may not be made between October 15 
and December 31 of each year.
    (2) Cage tags. Cage tags issued pursuant to Sec. 648.75 may be 
transferred in quantities of not less than 5 tags at any one time, 
subject to the restrictions and procedure specified in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section; provided that application for such cage tag transfers 
may be made at any time before December 10 of each year and the transfer 
is effective upon the receipt by

[[Page 204]]

the transferee of written authorization from the Regional Director.
    (3) Review. If the Regional Director determines that the applicant 
has been issued a Notice of Permit Sanction for a violation of the 
Magnuson Act that has not been resolved, he/she may decline to approve 
such transfer pending resolution of the matter.


<R05>
Sec. 648.71  Catch quotas.

    (a) Surf clams. The amount of surf clams that may be caught annually 
by fishing vessels subject to these regulations will be specified by the 
Assistant Administrator, on or about December 1 of each year, within the 
range of 1.85 to 3.4 million bu (98.5 to 181 million L).
    (1) Establishing quotas. (i) Prior to the beginning of each year, 
the MAFMC, following an opportunity for public comment, will recommend 
to the Assistant Administrator quotas and estimates of DAH and DAP 
within the ranges specified. In selecting the quota, the MAFMC shall 
consider current stock assessments, catch reports, and other relevant 
information concerning:
    (A) Exploitable and spawning biomass relative to the OY.
    (B) Fishing mortality rates relative to the OY.
    (C) Magnitude of incoming recruitment.
    (D) Projected effort and corresponding catches.
    (E) Geographical distribution of the catch relative to the 
geographical distribution of the resource.
    (F) Status of areas previously closed to surf clam fishing that are 
to be opened during the year and areas likely to be closed to fishing 
during the year.
    (ii) The quota shall be set at that amount that is most consistent 
with the objectives of the Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog FMP. The 
Assistant Administrator may set quotas at quantities different from the 
MAFMC's recommendations only if he/she can demonstrate that the MAFMC's 
recommendations violate the national standards of the Magnuson Act and 
the objectives of the Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog FMP.
    (2) Report. Prior to the beginning of each year, the Regional 
Director shall prepare a written report, based on the latest available 
stock assessment report prepared by NMFS, data reported by harvesters 
and processors according to these regulations, and other relevant data. 
The report will include consideration of:
    (i) Exploitable biomass and spawning biomass relative to OY.
    (ii) Fishing mortality rates relative to OY.
    (iii) Magnitude of incoming recruitment.
    (iv) Projected effort and corresponding catches.
    (v) Status of areas previously closed to surf clams fishing that are 
to be opened during the year and areas likely to be closed to fishing 
during the year.
    (vi) Geographical distribution of the catch relative to the 
geographical distribution of the resource.
    (3) Public review. Based on the information presented in the report, 
and in consultation with the MAFMC, the Assistant Administrator shall 
propose an annual surf clam quota and an annual ocean quahog quota and 
shall publish them in the Federal Register. Comments on the proposed 
annual quotas may be submitted to the Regional Director within 30 days 
after publication. The Assistant Administrator shall consider all 
comments, determine the appropriate annual quotas, and publish the 
annual quotas in the Federal Register on or about December 1 of each 
year.
    (b) Ocean quahogs. The amount of ocean quahogs that may be caught by 
fishing vessels subject to these regulations shall be specified annually 
by the Assistant Administrator, on or about December 1, within the range 
of 4 to 6 million bu (213 to 319.4 million L), following the same 
procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section for surf clams.


<R05>
Sec. 648.72  Minimum surf clam size.

    (a) Minimum length. The minimum length for surf clams is 4.75 inches 
(12.065 cm).
    (b) Determination of compliance. No more than 50 surf clams in any 
cage may be less than 4.75 inches (12.065 cm) in length. If more than 50 
surf clams in any inspected cage of surf clams are less than 4.75 inches 
(12.065 cm) in

[[Page 205]]

length, all cages landed by the same vessel from the same trip are 
deemed to be in violation of the minimum size restriction.
    (c) Suspension. Upon the recommendation of the MAFMC, the Regional 
Director may suspend annually, by publication in the Federal Register, 
the minimum shell-height standard, unless discard, catch, and survey 
data indicate that 30 percent of the surf clams are smaller than 4.75 
inches (12.065 cm) and the overall reduced shell height is not 
attributable to beds where the growth of individual surf clams has been 
reduced because of density dependent factors.
    (d) Measurement. Length is measured at the longest dimension of the 
surf clam shell.


<R05>
Sec. 648.73  Closed areas.

    (a) Areas closed because of environmental degradation. Certain areas 
are closed to all surf clam and ocean quahog fishing because of adverse 
environmental conditions. These areas will remain closed until the 
Assistant Administrator determines that the adverse environmental 
conditions no longer exist. If additional areas are identified by the 
Assistant Administrator as being contaminated by the introduction or 
presence of hazardous materials or pollutants, they may be closed by the 
Assistant Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section. The areas closed are:
    (1) Boston Foul Ground. The waste disposal site known as the 
``Boston Foul Ground'' and located at 42 deg.25'36'' N. lat., 
70 deg.35'00'' W. long., with a radius of 1 nm in every direction from 
that point.
    (2) New York Bight. The polluted area and waste disposal site known 
as the ``New York Bight Closure'' and located at 40 deg.25'04'' N. lat., 
73 deg.42'38'' W. long., and with a radius of 6 nm in every direction 
from that point, extending farther northwestward, westward, and 
southwestward between a line from a point on the arc at 40 deg.31'00'' 
N. lat., 73 deg.43'38'' W. long., directly toward Atlantic Beach Light 
in New York to the limit of state territorial waters of New York; and a 
line from a point on the arc at 40 deg.19'48'' N. lat., 73 deg.45'42'' 
W. long., to a point at the limit of the state territorial waters of New 
Jersey at 40 deg.14'00'' N. lat., 73 deg.55'42'' W. long.
    (3) 106 Dumpsite. The toxic industrial dump site known as the ``106 
Dumpsite'' and located between 38 deg.40'00'' and 39 deg.00'00'' N. lat. 
and between 72 deg.00'00'' and 72 deg.30'00'' W. long.
    (b) Areas closed because of small surf clams. Areas may be closed 
because they contain small surf clams.
    (1) Closure. The Assistant Administrator may close an area to surf 
clams and ocean quahog fishing if he/she determines, based on logbook 
entries, processors' reports, survey cruises, or other information, that 
the area contains surf clams of which:
    (i) Sixty percent or more are smaller than the minimum size (4.5 
inches (11.43 cm)); and
    (ii) Not more than 15 percent are larger than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm) 
in size.
    (2) Reopening. The Assistant Administrator may reopen areas or parts 
of areas closed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if he/she 
determines, based on survey cruises or other information, that:
    (i) The average length of the dominant (in terms of weight) size 
class in the area to be reopened is equal to or greater than 4.75 inches 
(12.065 cm); or
    (ii) The yield or rate of growth of the dominant shell-height class 
in the area to be reopened would be significantly enhanced through 
selective, controlled, or limited harvest of surf clams in the area.
    (c) Procedure. (1) The Regional Director may hold a public hearing 
on the proposed closure or reopening of any area under paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this section. The Assistant Administrator shall publish 
notification in the Federal Register of any proposed area closure or 
reopening, including any restrictions on harvest in a reopened area. 
Comments on the proposed closure or reopening may be submitted to the 
Regional Director within 30 days after publication. The Assistant 
Administrator shall consider all comments and publish the final 
notification of closure or reopening, and any restrictions on harvest, 
in the Federal Register. Any adjustment to harvest restrictions in a 
reopened area shall be made by notification in the Federal Register. The 
Regional Director shall

[[Page 206]]

send notice of any action under this paragraph (c)(1) to each surf clam 
and ocean quahog processor and to each surf clam and ocean quahog permit 
holder.
    (2) If the Regional Director determines, as the result of testing by 
state, Federal, or private entities, that a closure of an area under 
paragraph (a) of this section is necessary to prevent any adverse 
effects fishing may have on the public health, he/she may close the area 
for 60 days by publication of notification in the Federal Register, 
without prior comment or public hearing. If an extension of the 60-day 
closure period is necessary to protect the public health, the hearing 
and notice requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be 
followed.


<R05>
Sec. 648.74  Shucking at sea.

    (a) Observers. (1) The Regional Director may allow the shucking of 
surf clams or ocean quahogs at sea if he/she determines that an observer 
carried aboard the vessel can measure accurately the total amount of 
surf clams and ocean quahogs harvested in the shell prior to shucking.
    (2) Any vessel owner may apply in writing to the Regional Director 
to shuck surf clams or ocean quahogs at sea. The application shall 
specify: Name and address of the applicant, permit number of the vessel, 
method of calculating the amount of surf clams or ocean quahogs 
harvested in the shell, vessel dimensions and accommodations, and length 
of fishing trip.
    (3) The Regional Director shall provide an observer to any vessel 
owner whose application is approved. The owner shall pay all reasonable 
expenses of carrying the observer on board the vessel.
    (4) Any observer shall certify at the end of each trip the amount of 
surf clams or ocean quahogs harvested in the shell by the vessel. Such 
certification shall be made by the observer's signature on the daily 
fishing log required by Sec. 648.7.
    (b) Conversion factor. (1) Based on the recommendation of the MAFMC, 
the Regional Director may allow shucking at sea of surf clams or ocean 
quahogs, with or without an observer, if he/she determines a conversion 
factor for shucked meats to calculate accurately the amount of surf 
clams or ocean quahogs harvested in the shell.
    (2) The Regional Director shall publish notification in the Federal 
Register specifying a conversion factor together with the data used in 
its calculation for a 30-day comment period. After consideration of the 
public comments and any other relevant data, the Regional Director may 
publish final notification in the Federal Register specifying the 
conversion factor.
    (3) If the Regional Director makes the determination specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, he/she may authorize the vessel owner 
to shuck surf clams or ocean quahogs at sea. Such authorization shall be 
in writing and be carried aboard the vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 648.75  Cage identification.

    (a) Tagging. Before offloading, all cages that contain surf clams or 
ocean quahogs must be tagged with tags acquired annually under paragraph 
(b) of this section. A tag must be fixed on or as near as possible to 
the upper crossbar of the cage for every 60 ft \3\ (1,700 L), or portion 
thereof, of the cage. A tag or tags must not be removed until the cage 
is emptied by the processor, at which time the processor must promptly 
remove and retain the tag(s) for collection or disposal as specified by 
the Regional Director.
    (b) Issuance. The Regional Director will issue a supply of tags to 
each individual vessel owner qualifying for an allocation under 
Sec. 648.70 prior to the beginning of each fishing year or he/she may 
specify, in the Federal Register, a vendor from whom the tags shall be 
purchased. The number of tags will be based on the owner's allocation. 
Each tag represents 32 bu (1,700 L) of allocation.
    (c) Expiration. Tags will expire at the end of the fishing year for 
which they are issued, or if rendered null and void in accordance with 
15 CFR part 904.
    (d) Return. Tags that have been rendered null and void must be 
returned to the Regional Director, if possible.
    (e) Loss. Loss or theft of tags must be reported by the owner, 
numerically identifying the tags to the Regional Director by telephone 
as soon as the loss or theft is discovered and in writing

[[Page 207]]

within 24 hours. Thereafter, the reported tags shall no longer be valid 
for use under this part.
    (f) Replacement. Lost or stolen tags may be replaced by the Regional 
Director if proper notice of the loss is provided by the person to whom 
the tags were issued. Replacement tags may be purchased from the 
Regional Director or a vendor with a written authorization from the 
Regional Director.
    (g) Transfer. See Sec. 648.70(b)(2).
    (h) Presumptions. Surf clams and ocean quahogs found in cages 
without a valid state tag are deemed to have been harvested in the EEZ 
and to be part of an individual's allocation, unless the individual 
demonstrates that he/she has surrendered his/her Federal vessel permit 
issued under Sec. 648.4(a)(4) and conducted fishing operations 
exclusively within waters under the jurisdiction of any state. Surf 
clams and ocean quahogs in cages with a Federal tag or tags, issued and 
still valid pursuant to this section, affixed thereto are deemed to have 
been harvested by the individual allocation holder to whom the tags were 
issued under Sec. 648.75(b) or transferred under Sec. 648.70(b).

    (2) Gear restrictions. (i) Minimum mesh size. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (a)(2) (iii) and (i) of this section, and unless otherwise 
restricted under paragraphs (a) (2)(ii) and (5) of this section, the 
minimum mesh size for any trawl net, sink gillnet, Scottish seine, 
midwater trawl, or purse seine on a vessel or used by a vessel fishing 
under a DAS in the NE multispecies DAS program in the GOM/GB Regulated 
Mesh Area is 6-inch (15.24-cm) square or diamond mesh throughout the 
entire net. This restriction does not apply to nets

[[Page 208]]

or pieces of nets smaller than 3 ft (0.9 m) x 3 ft (0.9 m), (9 ft\2\ 
(0.81 m\2\)), or to vessels that have not been issued a multispecies 
permit and that are fishing exclusively in state waters.
    (ii) Large-mesh vessels. When fishing in the GOM/GB regulated mesh 
area, the minimum mesh size for any sink gillnet on a vessel or used by 
a vessel fishing under a DAS in the large-mesh DAS program specified in 
Sec. 648.82(b) (6) and (7) is 7-inch (17.78-cm) diamond mesh throughout 
the entire net. The minimum mesh size for any trawl net on a vessel or 
used by a vessel fishing under a DAS in the large-mesh DAS program is 8-
inch (20.32-cm) diamond mesh throughout the entire net. This restriction 
does not apply to nets or pieces of nets smaller than 3 ft (0.9 m) x 3 
ft (0.9 m), (9 ft\2\ (0.81 m\2\)), or to vessels that have not been 
issued a multispecies permit and that are fishing exclusively in state 
waters.
    (iii) Other gear and mesh exemptions. The minimum mesh size for any 
trawl net, sink gillnet, Scottish seine, midwater trawl, or purse seine 
on a vessel or used by a vessel when fishing in the GOM/GB Regulated 
Mesh Area while not under the NE multispecies DAS program, but when 
under one of the exemptions specified in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), 
(a)(6), (a)(8), (a)(9), (d), (e), (h), and (i) of this section, is set 
forth in the respective paragraph specifying the exemption. Vessels that 
are not fishing under one of these exemptions, under the scallop state 
waters exemption specified in Sec. 648.54, or under a NE multispecies 
DAS, are prohibited from fishing in the GOM/GB regulated mesh area.
    (3) Small Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area. Vessels 
subject to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section may fish for, harvest, possess, or land northern 
shrimp in the Small Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area with 
nets with a mesh size smaller than the minimum size specified, if the 
vessel complies with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3) (i) through 
(iii) of this section. The Small Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption 
Area is defined by straight lines connecting the following points in the 
order stated (copies of a map depicting the area are available from the

    (i) Restrictions on fishing for, possessing, or landing fish other 
than shrimp. A vessel fishing in the northern shrimp fishery described 
in this section under this exemption may not fish for, possess on board, 
or land any species of fish other than shrimp, except for the following, 
with the restrictions noted, as allowable bycatch species: Longhorn 
sculpin; silver hake--up to two standard totes; monkfish and monkfish 
parts--up to 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board; and 
American lobster--up to 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on 
board or 200 lobsters, whichever is less.
    (ii) Requirement to use a finfish excluder device (FED). A vessel 
must have a rigid or semi-rigid grate consisting of parallel bars of not 
more than 1-inch (2.54-cm) spacing that excludes all fish and other 
objects, except those that are small enough to pass between its bars 
into the codend of the trawl, secured in the trawl, forward of the 
codend, in such a manner that it precludes the passage of fish or other 
objects into the codend without the fish or objects having to first pass 
between the bars of the grate, in any net with mesh smaller than the 
minimum size specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The net must 
have a outlet or hole to allow fish or other objects that are too large 
to pass between the bars of the grate to exit out of the net. The 
aftermost edge of this outlet or hole must be at least as wide as the 
grate at the point of attachment. The outlet or hole must extend forward 
from the grate toward the mouth of the net. A funnel of net material is 
allowed in the lengthening piece of the net forward of the grate to 
direct catch towards the

[[Page 209]]

grate. (Copies of a schematic example of a properly configured and 
installed FED are available from the Regional Director upon request.)
    (iii) Time restrictions. A vessel may only fish under this exemption 
during the northern shrimp season, as established by the Commission. The 
northern shrimp season is December 1 through May 30, or as modified by 
the Commission.
    (4) Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery Exemption Area. Vessels subject 
to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section may fish with, use, or possess nets in the Cultivator Shoal 
Whiting Fishery Exemption Area with a mesh size smaller than the minimum 
size specified, if the vessel complies with the requirements specified 
in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. The Cultivator Shoal Whiting 
Fishery Exemption Area (copies of a map depicting the area are available 
from the Regional Director upon request) is defined by straight lines 
connecting the following points in the order stated:

    (i) Requirements. (A) A vessel fishing in the Cultivator Shoal 
Whiting Fishery Exemption Area under this exemption must have a letter 
of authorization issued by the Regional Director on board and may not 
fish for, possess on board, or land any species of fish other than 
whiting, except for the following, with the restrictions noted, as 
allowable bycatch species: Longhorn sculpin; monkfish and monkfish 
parts--up to 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board; and 
American lobster--up to 10 percent by weight of all other species on 
board or 200 lobsters, whichever is less.
    (B) All nets must comply with a minimum mesh size of 3-inch (7.62 
cm) square or diamond mesh applied to the first 160 meshes counted from 
the terminus of the net.
    (C) Fishing is confined to a season of June 15 through October 31, 
unless otherwise specified by notification in the Federal Register.
    (D) When transiting through the GOM/GB Regulated Mesh Area specified 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any nets with a mesh size 
smaller than the minimum mesh size specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section must be stowed in accordance with one of the methods specified 
in Sec. 648.23(b).
    (ii) Sea sampling. The Regional Director shall conduct periodic sea 
sampling to determine if there is a need to change the area or season 
designation, and to evaluate the bycatch of regulated species, 
especially haddock.
    (iii) Annual review. The NEFMC shall conduct an annual review of 
data to determine if there are any changes in area or season designation 
necessary, and to make appropriate recommendations to the Regional 
Director following the procedures specified in Sec. 648.90 of this part.
    (5) Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge (SB/JL) Juvenile Protection Area. 
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (d), (e), and (h) of this 
section, the minimum mesh size for any trawl net, Scottish seine, purse 
seine, or midwater trawl in use, or available for immediate use as 
described in Sec. 648.23(b) by a vessel fishing in the following area is 
6-inch (15.24-cm) square or diamond mesh in the last 50 bars of the 
codend and extension piece for vessels 45 ft (13.7 m) in length and 
less, and in the last 100 bars of the codend and extension piece for 
vessels greater than 45 ft (13.7 m) in length.

    (ii) Fishing for northern shrimp in the SB/JL Juvenile Protection 
Area is allowed, subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (6) Transiting. (i) Vessels fishing in the Small Mesh Northern 
Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area and in Small Mesh Area 1/Small Mesh Area 
2, as specified in paragraphs (a) (3) and (8) of this section, may 
transit through the SB/JL Juvenile Protection Area defined in paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section with nets on board that do not conform to the 
requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(5) of this section, 
provided that the nets are stowed in accordance with one of the methods 
specified in Sec. 648.23(b).
    (ii) Vessels subject to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may transit through the Small Mesh 
Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area defined in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section with nets on board with a mesh size smaller than the 
minimum size specified, provided that the nets are stowed in accordance 
with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b), and provided the 
vessel has no fish on board.
    (iii) Vessels subject to the minimum mesh size restrictions 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may transit through the 
GOM/GB Regulated Mesh Area defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
with nets on board with a mesh size smaller than the minimum mesh size 
specified and with small mesh exempted species on board, provided that 
the following conditions are met:
    (A) All nets with a mesh size smaller than the minimum mesh size 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are stowed in accordance 
with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b).
    (B) A letter of authorization issued by the Regional Director is on 
board.
    (C) Vessels do not fish for, possess on board, or land any fish, 
except when fishing in the areas specified in paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(9), 
(b), and (c) of this section. Vessels may retain exempted small mesh 
species as provided in paragraphs (a)(4)(i), (a)(9)(i), (b)(3), and 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (7) Addition or deletion of exemptions. (i) An exemption may be 
added in an existing fishery for which there are sufficient data or 
information to ascertain the amount of regulated species bycatch, if the 
Regional Director, after consultation with the NEFMC, determines that 
the percentage of regulated species caught as bycatch is, or can be 
reduced to, less than 5 percent, by weight, of total catch and that such 
exemption will not jeopardize fishing mortality objectives. In 
determining whether exempting a fishery may jeopardize meeting fishing 
mortality objectives, the Regional Director may take into consideration 
factors such as, but not limited to, juvenile mortality. A

[[Page 211]]

fishery can be defined, restricted, or allowed by area, gear, season, or 
other means determined to be appropriate to reduce bycatch of regulated 
species. An existing exemption may be deleted or modified if the 
Regional Director determines that the catch of regulated species is 
equal to or greater than 5 percent, by weight, of total catch, or that 
continuing the exemption may jeopardize meeting fishing mortality 
objectives. Notification of additions, deletions or modifications will 
be made through issuance of a rule in the Federal Register.
    (ii) The NEFMC may recommend to the Regional Director, through the 
framework procedure specified in Sec. 648.90(b), additions or deletions 
to exemptions for fisheries, either existing or proposed, for which 
there may be insufficient data or information for the Regional Director 
to determine, without public comment, percentage catch of regulated 
species.
    (iii) The Regional Director may, using the process described in 
either paragraph (a)(7)(i) or (ii) of this section, authorize an 
exemption for a white hake fishery by vessels using regulated mesh or 
hook gear. Determination of the percentage of regulated species caught 
in such fishery shall not include white hake.
    (iv) Exempted fisheries authorized under this paragraph (a)(7) are 
subject, at minimum, to the following restrictions:
    (A) With the exception of fisheries authorized under paragraph 
(a)(7)(iii) of this section, a prohibition on the possession of 
regulated species.
    (B) A limit on the possession of monkfish or monkfish parts of 10 
percent, by weight, of all other species on board.
    (C) A limit on the possession of lobsters of 10 percent, by weight, 
of all other species on board or 200 lobsters, whichever is less.
    (D) A limit on the possession of skate or skate parts in the 
Southern New England regulated mesh area described in paragraph (a)(10) 
of this section of 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board.
    (8) Small Mesh Area 1/Small Mesh Area 2. Vessels subject to the 
minimum mesh size restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section may fish with or possess nets with a mesh size smaller than the 
minimum size specified from July 15 through October 31 when fishing in 
Small Mesh Area 1, and from January 1 through June 30 when fishing in 
Small Mesh Area 2. A vessel may not fish for, possess on board, or land 
any species of fish other than: Butterfish, dogfish, herring, mackerel, 
ocean pout, scup, squid, silver hake, and red hake, except for the 
following species, with the restrictions noted, as allowable bycatch 
species: Longhorn sculpin; monkfish and monkfish parts--up to 10 
percent, by weight, of all other species on board; and American 
lobster--up to 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board or 
200 lobsters, whichever is less. These areas are defined by straight

    (c) Mid-Atlantic (MA) Regulated Mesh Area--(1) Area definition. The 
MA Regulated Mesh Area (copies of a map depicting this area are 
available from the Regional Director upon request) is that area bounded 
on the east by a line running from the Rhode Island shoreline along 
71 deg.47.5' W. long. to its intersection with the 3-nm line, south 
along the 3-nm line to Montauk Point, southwesterly along the 3-nm line 
to the intersection of 72 deg.30' W. long., and south along that line to 
the intersection of the outer boundary of the EEZ.
    (2) Gear restrictions--(i) Minimum mesh size. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(3) and (i) of this section, and unless otherwise 
restricted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the minimum mesh 
size for any trawl net, sink gillnet, Scottish seine, purse seine or 
midwater trawl not stowed or not unavailable for immediate use as 
described in Sec. 648.23(b), by a vessel fishing under a DAS in the NE 
multispecies DAS program in the MA Regulated Mesh Area shall be that 
specified at Sec. 648.104(a). This restriction does not apply to vessels 
that have not been issued a multispecies permit and that are fishing 
exclusively in state waters.
    (ii) Large mesh vessels. When fishing in the MA Regulated Mesh Area, 
the minimum mesh size for any sink gillnet on a vessel, or used by a 
vessel, fishing under a DAS in the Large Mesh DAS program specified in 
Sec. 648.82(b) (6) and (7) is 7-inch (17.78-cm) diamond mesh throughout 
the entire net. The minimum mesh size for any trawl net on a vessel, or 
used by a vessel, fishing under a DAS in the Large Mesh DAS program is 
8-inch (20.32-cm) diamond mesh throughout the net. This restriction does 
not apply to nets or pieces of nets smaller than 3 ft (0.9 m) x 3 ft 
(0.9 m), (9 ft\2\ (0.81 m\2\)), or to vessels that have not been issued 
a multispecies permit and that are fishing exclusively in state waters.
    (3) Net stowage exemption. Vessels may possess regulated species 
while in possession of nets with mesh smaller than the minimum size 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, provided that such 
nets are stowed and are not available for immediate use in accordance 
with Sec. 648.23(b), and provided that regulated species were not 
harvested by nets of mesh size smaller than the minimum mesh size 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
    (4) Additional exemptions. The Regional Director may, using the 
process described in either paragraph (a)(7) (i) or (ii) of this 
section, authorize an exemption for a white hake fishery by vessels 
using regulated mesh or hook gear. Determination of the percentage of 
regulated species caught in such a fishery shall not include white hake.
    (d) Midwater trawl gear exemption. Fishing may take place throughout 
the fishing year with midwater trawl gear of mesh size less than the 
applicable minimum size specified in this section, provided that:
    (1) Midwater trawl gear is used exclusively;
    (2) When fishing under this exemption in the GOM/GB and SB/JL Areas, 
the vessel has on board a letter of authorization issued by the Regional 
Director;
    (3) The vessel only fishes for, possesses, or lands Atlantic 
herring, blueback herring, mackerel, or squid in areas south of 
42 deg.20' N. lat.; and Atlantic herring, blueback herring, or mackerel 
in areas north of 42 deg.20' N. lat; and
    (4) The vessel does not fish for, possess, or land NE multispecies.
    (e) Purse seine gear exemption. Fishing may take place throughout 
the fishing year with purse seine gear of mesh size smaller than the 
applicable minimum size specified in this section, provided that:
    (1) The vessel uses purse seine gear exclusively;
    (2) When fishing under this exemption in the GOM/GB and SB/JL areas, 
the vessel has on board an authorizing letter issued by the Regional 
Director;
    (3) The vessel only fishes for, possesses, or lands Atlantic 
herring, blueback herring, mackerel, or menhaden; and
    (4) The vessel does not fish for, possess, or land NE multispecies.
    (f) Mesh measurements--(1) Gillnets. Beginning October 15, 1996, 
mesh size of gillnet gear shall be measured by lining up five 
consecutive knots perpendicular to the float line and, with a ruler or 
tape measure, measuring ten consecutive measures on the diamond, inside 
knot to inside knot. The mesh

[[Page 215]]

shall be the average of the measurements of ten consecutive measures.
    (2) All other nets. With the exception of gillnets, mesh size shall 
be measured by a wedged-shaped gauge having a taper of 2 cm in 8 cm and 
a thickness of 2.3 mm, inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull 
of 5 kg.
    (i) Square-mesh measurement. Square mesh in the regulated portion of 
the net is measured by placing the net gauge along the diagonal line 
that connects the largest opening between opposite corners of the 
square. The square mesh size is the average of the measurements of 20 
consecutive adjacent meshes from the terminus forward along the long 
axis of the net. The square mesh is measured at least five meshes away 
from the lacings of the net.
    (ii) Diamond-mesh measurement. Diamond mesh in the regulated portion 
of the net is measured running parallel to the long axis of the net. The 
mesh size is the average of the measurements of any series of 20 
consecutive meshes. The mesh is measured at least five meshes away from 
the lacings of the net.
    (g) Restrictions on gear and methods of fishing--(1) Net obstruction 
or constriction. A fishing vessel shall not use any device or material, 
including, but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or 
chafing gear, on the top of a trawl net, except that one splitting strap 
and one bull rope (if present), consisting of line and rope no more than 
3 inches (7.62 cm) in diameter, may be used if such splitting strap and/
or bull rope does not constrict in any manner the top of the trawl net. 
``The top of the trawl net'' means the 50 percent of the net that (in a 
hypothetical situation) would not be in contact with the ocean bottom 
during a tow if the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the 
purpose of this paragraph (g)(1), head ropes are not considered part of 
the top of the trawl net.
    (2) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (i) A fishing vessel may not 
use any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in 
the top of the net, as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, if 
it obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (ii) A fishing vessel may not use a net capable of catching 
multispecies if the bars entering or exiting the knots twist around each 
other.
    (3) Pair trawl prohibition. No vessel may fish for NE multispecies 
while pair trawling, or possess or land NE multispecies that have been 
harvested by means of pair trawling.
    (h) Scallop vessels. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section, a scallop vessel that possesses a limited access scallop 
permit and either a multispecies combination vessel permit or a scallop 
multispecies possession limit permit, and that is fishing under a 
scallop DAS allocated under Sec. 648.53, may possess and land up to 300 
lb (136.1 kg) of regulated species, provided it has at least one 
standard tote on board, unless otherwise restricted by 
Sec. 648.86(a)(2).
    (2) Combination vessels fishing under a NE multispecies DAS are 
subject to the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 648.80 and may 
possess and land unlimited amounts of regulated species. Such vessels 
may simultaneously fish under a scallop DAS.
    (i) State waters winter flounder exemption. Any vessel issued a 
multispecies permit may fish for, possess, or land winter flounder while 
fishing with nets of mesh smaller than the minimum size specified in 
paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c)(2) of this section, provided that:
    (1) The vessel has on board a certificate approved by the Regional 
Director and issued by the state agency authorizing the vessel's 
participation in the state's winter flounder fishing program and is in 
compliance with the applicable state laws pertaining to minimum mesh 
size for winter flounder.
    (2) Fishing is conducted exclusively in the waters of the state from 
which the certificate was obtained.
    (3) The state's winter flounder plan has been approved by the 
Commission as being in compliance with the Commission's winter flounder 
fishery management plan.
    (4) The state elects, by a letter to the Regional Director, to 
participate in the exemption program described by this section.
    (5) The vessel does not enter or transit the EEZ.

[[Page 216]]

    (6) The vessel does not enter or transit the waters of another 
state, unless such other state is participating in the exemption program 
described by this section and the vessel is enrolled in that state's 
program.
    (7) The vessel, when not fishing under the DAS program, does not 
fish for, possess, or land more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) of winter 
flounder, and has at least one standard tote on board.
    (8) The vessel does not fish for, possess, or land any species of 
fish other than winter flounder and the exempted small mesh species 
specified under paragraphs (a)(3)(i), (a)(8)(iii), (b)(3), and (c)(3) of 
this section when fishing in the areas specified under paragraphs 
(a)(3), (a)(8), (b)(1), and (c)(1) of this section, respectively. 
Vessels fishing under this exemption in New York and Connecticut state 
waters may also possess and retain skate as incidental take in this 
fishery.
    (9) The vessel complies with all other applicable requirements.

Sec. 648.82  Effort-control program for limited access vessels.

    (a) General. A vessel issued an limited access multispecies permit 
may not fish for, possess, or land regulated species, except during a 
DAS as allocated under and in accordance with the applicable DAS program 
described in this section, unless otherwise provided in these 
regulations.
    (b) DAS program--permit categories, allocations and initial 
assignments to categories. Beginning with the 1996 fishing year, all 
limited access multispecies permit holders shall be assigned to one of 
the following DAS permit categories according to the criteria specified. 
Permit holders may request a change in permit category for the 1996 
fishing year and all fishing years thereafter, as specified in 
Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2). Each fishing year shall begin on May 1 and 
extend through April 30 of the following year.
    (1) Individual DAS category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel fishing 
under the individual DAS category shall be allocated 65 percent of its 
initial 1994 allocation baseline, as established under Amendment 5 to 
the NE Multispecies FMP, for the 1996 fishing year and 50 percent of its 
initial allocation baseline for the 1997 fishing year and beyond, as 
calculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Initial assignment. Any vessel issued a valid limited access 
multispecies individual DAS permit, including any vessel also issued a 
limited access multispecies gillnet permit, as of July 1, 1996, shall be 
initially assigned to the individual DAS category.
    (2) Fleet DAS category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel fishing under 
the fleet DAS category shall be allocated 116 DAS (139 DAS multiplied by 
the proration factor of 0.83) for the 1996 fishing year and 88 DAS for 
the 1997 fishing year and beyond.
    (ii) Initial assignment. Any vessel issued a valid fleet DAS permit, 
including any vessel also issued a limited access multispecies gillnet 
permit; limited access multispecies hook-gear permit; limited access 
multispecies gillnet permit that has not also been issued a DAS permit; 
or a limited access multispecies small vessel (less than or equal to 45 
ft (13.7 m)) permit and that is larger than 20 ft (6.1 m) in length as 
determined by its most recent permit application, as of July 1, 1996, 
shall be initially assigned to the fleet DAS category.
    (3) Small vessel category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel qualified 
and electing to fish under the small vessel category may retain cod, 
haddock, and yellowtail flounder, combined up to 300 lb (136.1 kg) per 
trip without being subject to DAS restrictions. Such a vessel is not 
subject to a possession limit for other NE multispecies.

[[Page 219]]

    (ii) Initial assignment. A vessel issued a valid limited access 
multispecies permit and fishing under the small vessel category (less 
than or equal to 45 ft (13.7 m)) permit as of July 1, 1996, and that is 
20 ft (6.1 m) or less in length as determined by the vessel's last 
application for a permit, shall be initially assigned to the small 
vessel category. Any other vessel may elect to switch into this 
category, as provided for in Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2), if such vessel 
meets or complies with the following:
    (A) The vessel is 30 ft (9.1 m) or less in length overall as 
determined by measuring along a horizontal line drawn from a 
perpendicular raised from the outside of the most forward portion of the 
stem of the vessel to a perpendicular raised from the after most portion 
of the stern.
    (B) If construction of the vessel was begun after May 1, 1994, the 
vessel must be constructed such that the quotient of the overall length 
divided by the beam is not less than 2.5.
    (C) Acceptable verification for vessels 20 ft (6.1 m) or less in 
length shall be USCG documentation or state registration papers. For 
vessels over 20 ft (6.1 m) in length, the measurement of length must be 
verified in writing by a qualified marine surveyor, or the builder, 
based on the vessel's construction plans, or by other means determined 
acceptable by the Regional Director. A copy of the verification must 
accompany an application for a multispecies permit.
    (D) Adjustments to the small vessel category requirements, including 
changes to the length requirement, if required to meet fishing mortality 
goals, may be made by the Regional Director following framework 
procedures of Sec. 648.90.
    (4) Hook-gear category--(i) DAS allocation. Any vessel issued a 
valid limited access multispecies hook-gear permit shall be allocated 
116 DAS (139 DAS multiplied by the proration factor of 0.83) for the 
1996 fishing year and 88 DAS for the 1997 fishing year, and beyond. A 
vessel fishing under this category in the DAS program must meet or 
comply with the following while fishing for, in possession of, or 
landing, regulated species:
    (A) Vessels, and persons on such vessels, are prohibited from 
possessing gear other than hook gear on board the vessel.
    (B) Vessels, and persons on such vessels, are prohibited from 
fishing, setting, or hauling back, per day, or possessing on board the 
vessel, more than 4,500 rigged hooks. An unbaited hook and gangion that 
has not been secured to the ground line of the trawl on board a vessel 
is deemed to be a replacement hook and is not counted toward the 4,500-
hook limit. A ``snap-on'' hook is deemed to be a replacement hook if it 
is not rigged or baited.
    (ii) Initial assignment. No vessel shall be initially assigned to 
the hook-gear category. Any vessel that meets the qualifications 
specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(ii) may apply for and obtain a permit to 
fish under this category.
    (5) Combination vessel category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel 
fishing under the combination vessel category shall be allocated 65 
percent of its initial 1994 allocation baseline, as established under 
Amendment 5 to the FMP, for the 1996 fishing year and 50 percent of its 
initial allocation baseline for the 1997 fishing year and beyond, as 
calculated under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Initial assignment. A vessel issued a valid limited access 
multispecies permit qualified to fish as a combination vessel as of July 
1, 1996, shall be assigned to the combination vessel category.
    (6) Large Mesh Individual DAS category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel 
fishing under the large mesh individual DAS category shall be allocated 
a DAS increase of 12 percent in year one and of 36 percent in year two 
beyond the DAS allocations specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section (this includes the proration factor for 1996). To be eligible to 
fish under the large mesh individual DAS category, a vessel while 
fishing under this category must fish with gillnet gear with a minimum 
mesh size of 7-inch (17.78-cm) diamond mesh or with trawl gear with a 
minimum mesh size of 8-inch (20.32-cm) diamond mesh, as described under 
Sec. 648.80 (a)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(ii).
    (ii) Initial assignment. No vessel shall be initially assigned to 
the large mesh

[[Page 220]]

individual DAS category. Any vessel that is initially assigned to the 
individual DAS, fleet DAS, or small vessel category may request and be 
granted a switch into this category as specified in 
Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2).
    (7) Large Mesh Fleet DAS category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel 
fishing under the large mesh fleet DAS category shall be allocated 129 
DAS (155 DAS multiplied by the proration factor of 0.83) for the 1996 
fishing year and 120 DAS for the 1997 fishing year, and beyond. To be 
eligible to fish under the large mesh fleet DAS category, a vessel while 
fishing under this category must fish with gillnet gear with a minimum 
mesh size of 7-inch (17.78-cm) diamond mesh or with trawl gear with a 
minimum mesh size of 8-inch (20.32-cm) diamond mesh, as described under 
Sec. 648.80 (a)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(ii).
    (ii) Initial assignment. No vessel shall be initially assigned to 
the large mesh fleet DAS category. Any vessel that is initially assigned 
to the individual DAS, fleet DAS, or small vessel category may request 
and be granted a switch into this category as specified in 
Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2).
    (c) 1996 DAS appeals. (1) Previously exempted vessels. A vessel that 
was issued a valid 1995 limited access multispecies permit, and that has 
been fishing under the small vessel (less than or equal to 45 ft (13.7 
m)), hook-gear, or gillnet categories, is eligible to appeal its 
allocation of DAS, if it has not previously done so, as described under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Each vessel's initial allocation of 
DAS will be considered to be 176 DAS for purposes of this appeal (i.e., 
the fleet DAS category baseline prior to the 1996-1997 reductions).
    (2) Exempted gillnet vessels that held an individual DAS permit. A 
vessel that was issued a valid 1995 limited access multispecies permit 
and that has been fishing under both the gillnet and individual DAS 
categories, is eligible to appeal its allocation of gillnet DAS, as 
described under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Each vessel's initial 
allocation of DAS will be considered to be 176 DAS for purposes of this 
appeal (i.e., the fleet DAS category baseline prior to the 1996-1997 
reductions).
    (d) Individual DAS allocations--(1) Calculation of a vessel's 
individual DAS. The DAS assigned to a vessel for purposes of determining 
that vessel's annual allocation under the individual DAS program is 
calculated as follows:
    (i) Count the total number of the vessel's NE multispecies DAS for 
the years 1988, 1989, and 1990. NE multispecies DAS are deemed to be the 
total number of days the vessel was absent from port for a trip where 
greater than 10 percent of the vessel's total landings were comprised of 
regulated species, minus any days for such trips in which a scallop 
dredge was used;
    (ii) Exclude the year of least NE multispecies DAS; and
    (iii) If 2 years of multispecies DAS are remaining, average those 
years' DAS; or
    (iv) If only 1 year remains, use that year's DAS.
    (2) Appeal of DAS allocation. (i) Initial allocations of individual 
DAS to those vessels authorized to appeal under paragraph (c) of this 
section may be appealed to the Regional Director if a request to appeal 
is received by the Regional Director no later than July 31, 1996, or 30 
days after the initial allocation is made, whichever is later. Any such 
appeal must be in writing and be based on one or more of the following 
grounds:
    (A) The information used by the Regional Director was based on 
mistaken or incorrect data.
    (B) The applicant was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her 
control from meeting relevant criteria.
    (C) The applicant has new or additional information.
    (ii) The Regional Director will appoint a designee who will make an 
initial decision on the written appeal.
    (iii) If the applicant is not satisfied with the initial decision, 
the applicant may request that the appeal be presented at a hearing 
before an officer appointed by the Regional Director.
    (iv) The hearing officer shall present his/her findings to the 
Regional Director and the Regional Director will make a decision on the 
appeal. The Regional Director's decision on this appeal is the final 
administrative decision of the Department of Commerce.

[[Page 221]]

    (3) Status of vessels pending appeal of DAS allocations. While a 
vessel's individual DAS allocation is under appeal, the vessel may fish 
under the fleet DAS category until the Regional Director has made a 
final determination on the appeal. Any DAS spent fishing for regulated 
species by a vessel while that vessel's initial DAS allocation is under 
appeal, shall be counted against any DAS allocation that the vessel may 
ultimately receive.
    (e) Accrual of DAS. Same as Sec. 648.53(e).
    (f) Good Samaritan credit. Same as Sec. 648.53(f).
    (g) Spawning season restrictions. A vessel issued a valid small 
vessel permit under paragraph (b)(3) of this section may not fish for, 
possess, or land regulated species from March 1 through March 20 of each 
year. Any other vessel issued a limited access multispecies permit must 
declare out and be out of the regulated NE multispecies for a 20-day 
period between March 1 and May 31 of each fishing year using the 
notification requirements specified in Sec. 648.10. If a vessel owner 
has not declared and been out for a 20-day period between March 1 and 
May 31 of each fishing year on or before May 12 of each such year, the 
vessel is prohibited from fishing for, possessing or landing any 
regulated species after May 11 of such year for the number of days 
needed to fulfill the 20-day requirement.
    (h) Declaring DAS and 20-day blocks. A vessel's owner or authorized 
representative shall notify the Regional Director of a vessel's 
participation in the DAS program and declaration of its 20-day out 
period of the NE multispecies fishery, using the notification 
requirements specified in Sec. 648.10.
    (i) Adjustments in annual DAS allocations. Adjustments in annual DAS 
allocations, if required to meet fishing mortality goals, may be made by 
the Regional Director following the framework procedures of Sec. 648.90.


<R05>
Sec. 648.83  Minimum fish sizes.

    (a) Minimum fish sizes. (1) Minimum fish sizes for recreational 
vessels and charter/party vessels that are not fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS are specified in Sec. 648.89. All other vessels are 
subject to the following minimum fish sizes (TL):

                         Minimum Fish Sizes (TL)                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Species                           Size (Inches)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cod.....................................................    19 (48.3 cm)
Haddock.................................................    19 (48.3 cm)
Pollock.................................................    19 (48.3 cm)
Witch flounder (gray sole)..............................    14 (35.6 cm)
Yellowtail flounder.....................................    13 (33.0 cm)
American plaice (dab)...................................    14 (35.6 cm)
Winter flounder (blackback).............................   12 (30.48 cm)
Redfish.................................................     9 (22.9 cm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The minimum fish size applies to the whole fish or to any part 
of a fish while possessed on board a vessel, except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, and to whole fish only, after landing. 
Fish or parts of fish must have skin on while possessed on board a 
vessel and at the time of landing in order to meet minimum size 
requirements. ``Skin on'' means the entire portion of the skin normally 
attached to the portion of the fish or fish parts possessed.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) Each person aboard a vessel issued a limited 
access permit and fishing under the DAS program may possess up to 25 lb 
(11.3 kg) of fillets that measure less than the minimum size, if such 
fillets are from legal-sized fish and are not offered or intended for 
sale, trade, or barter.
    (2) Recreational, party, and charter vessels may possess fillets 
less than the minimum size specified, if the fillets are taken from 
legal-sized fish and are not offered or intended for sale, trade or 
barter.
    (3) Vessels fishing exclusively with pot gear may possess 
multispecies frames used, or to be used, as bait that measure less than 
the minimum fish size, if there is a receipt for purchase of those 
frames on board the vessel.
    (c) Adjustments. (1) At any time when information is available, the 
NEFMC will review the best available mesh selectivity information to 
determine the appropriate minimum size for the species listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, except winter flounder, according to the 
length at which 25 percent of the regulated species would be retained by 
the applicable minimum mesh size.
    (2) Upon determination of the appropriate minimum sizes, the NEFMC 
shall propose the minimum fish sizes to be implemented following the 
procedures specified in Sec. 648.90.

[[Page 222]]

    (3) Additional adjustments or changes to the minimum fish sizes 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and exemptions as specified 
in paragraph (b) of this section, may be made at any time after 
implementation of the final rule as specified under Sec. 648.90.

Sec. 648.84  Gear-marking requirements and gear restrictions.

    (a) Bottom-tending fixed gear, including, but not limited to 
gillnets and longlines, designed for, capable of, or fishing for NE 
multispecies must have the name of the owner or vessel, or the official 
number of that vessel permanently affixed to any buoys, gillnets, 
longlines, or other appropriate gear so that the name of the owner or 
vessel or official number of the vessel is visible on the surface of the 
water.
    (b) Bottom-tending fixed gear, including, but not limited to 
gillnets or longline gear, must be marked so that the westernmost end 
(measuring the half compass circle from magnetic south through west to, 
and including, north) of the gear displays a standard 12-inch (30.5-cm) 
tetrahedral corner radar reflector and a pennant positioned on a staff 
at least 6 ft (1.8 m) above the buoy. The easternmost end (meaning the 
half compass circle from magnetic north through east to, and including, 
south) of the gear need display only the standard 12-inch (30.5-cm) 
tetrahedral radar reflector positioned in the same way.
    (c) Continuous gillnets must not exceed 6,600 ft (2,011.7 m) between 
the end buoys.
    (d) In the GOM/GB regulated mesh area specified in Sec. 648.80(a), 
gillnet gear set in an irregular pattern or in any way that deviates 
more than 30 deg. from the original course of the set must be marked at 
the extremity of the deviation with an additional marker, which must 
display two or more visible streamers and may either be attached to or 
independent of the gear.


<R05>
Sec. 648.85  Flexible Area Action System.

    (a) The Chair of the Multispecies Oversight Committee, upon learning 
of the presence of discard problems associated with large concentrations 
of juvenile, sublegal, or spawning multispecies, shall determine if the 
situation warrants further investigation and possible action. In making 
this determination, the Committee Chair shall consider the amount of 
discard of regulated species, the species targeted, the number and types 
of vessels operating in the area, the location and size of the area, and 
the resource condition of the impacted species. If he/she determines it 
is necessary, the Committee Chair will request the Regional Director to 
initiate a fact finding investigation to verify the situation and 
publish notification in the Federal Register requesting public comments 
in accordance with the procedures therefor in Amendment 3 to the NE 
Multispecies FMP.
    (b) After examining the facts, the Regional Director shall, within 
the deadlines specified in Amendment 3, provide the technical analysis 
required by Amendment 3.
    (c) The NEFMC shall prepare an economic impact analysis of the 
potential management options under consideration within the deadlines 
specified in Amendment 3.
    (d) Copies of the analysis and reports prepared by the Regional 
Director and the NEFMC shall be made available for public review at the 
NEFMC's office and the Committee shall hold a meeting/public hearing, at 
which time it shall review the analysis and reports and request public 
comments. Upon review of all available sources of information, the 
Committee shall determine what course of action is warranted by the 
facts and make a recommendation, consistent with the provisions of 
Amendment 3 to the Regional Director.
    (e) By the deadline set in Amendment 3 the Regional Director shall 
either accept or reject the Committee's recommendation. If the 
recommended action is consistent with the record established by the 
fact-finding report, impact analysis, and comments received at the 
public hearing, he/she shall accept the Committee's recommendation and 
implement it through notification in the Federal

[[Page 223]]

Register and by notice sent to all vessel owners holding multispecies 
permits. The Regional Director shall also use other appropriate media, 
including, but not limited to, mailings to the news media, fishing 
industry associations and radio broadcasts, to disseminate information 
on the action to be implemented.
    (f) Once implemented, the Regional Director shall monitor the 
affected area to determine if the action is still warranted. If the 
Regional Director determines that the circumstances under which the 
action was taken, based on the Regional Director's report, the NEFMC's 
report, and the public comments, are no longer in existence, he/she 
shall terminate the action by notification in the Federal Register.
    (g) Actions taken under this section will ordinarily become 
effective upon the date of filing with the Office of the Federal 
Register. The Regional Director may determine that facts warrant a 
delayed effective date.


<R05>
Sec. 648.86  Possession restrictions.

    (a) Haddock--(1) NE multispecies DAS vessels. A vessel issued a 
limited access multispecies permit that is fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS may land or possess on board up to 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) 
of haddock provided it has at least one standard tote on board. Haddock 
on board a vessel subject to this possession limit must be separated 
from other species of fish and stored so as to be readily available for 
inspection.
    (2) Scallop dredge vessels. (i) No person owning or operating a 
scallop dredge vessel issued a multispecies permit may land haddock 
from, or possess haddock on board, a scallop dredge vessel, from January 
1 through June 30.
    (ii) No person owning or operating a scallop dredge vessel without a 
multispecies permit may possess haddock in, or harvested from, the EEZ, 
from January 1 through June 30.
    (iii) From July 1 through December 31, scallop dredge vessel or 
persons owning or operating a scallop dredge vessel that is fishing 
under a scallop DAS allocated under Sec. 648.53 may land or possess on 
board up to 300 lb (136.1 kg) of haddock provided the vessel has at 
least one standard tote on board. Haddock on board a vessel subject to 
this possession limit must be separated from other species of fish and 
stored so as to be readily available for inspection.
    (b) Winter flounder. A vessel issued a limited access multispecies 
permit that is fishing in the MA regulated mesh area and is not fishing 
under a NE multispecies DAS, may land, or possess on board, winter 
flounder up to 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board, or 
200 lb (90.7 kg), whichever is less. Winter flounder on board a vessel 
subject to this possession limit must be separated from other species of 
fish and stored so as to be readily available for inspection in standard 
totes.
    (c) Other possession restrictions. Vessels are subject to any other 
applicable possession limit restrictions of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 648.87  Sink gillnet requirements to reduce harbor porpoise takes.

    (a) Areas closed to sink gillnets. Section 648.81(f) through (h) 
sets forth closed area restrictions to reduce the take of harbor 
porpoise consistent with the harbor porpoise mortality reduction goals.
    (b) Additional areas closed to sink gillnets. All persons owning or 
operating vessels must remove all of their sink gillnet gear from, and 
may not use, set, haul back, fish with, or possess on board, unless 
stowed in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 648.23(b), a sink

    (c) Framework adjustment. (1) At least annually, the Regional 
Director will provide the NEFMC with the best available information on 
the status of Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise, including estimates of 
abundance and estimates of bycatch in the sink gillnet fishery. Within 
60 days of receipt of that information, the NEFMC's HPRT shall complete 
a review of the data, assess the adequacy of existing regulations, 
evaluate the impacts of other measures that reduce harbor porpoise take 
and, if necessary, recommend additional measures in light of the NEFMC's 
harbor porpoise mortality reduction goals. In addition, the HPRT shall 
make a determination on whether other conservation issues exist that 
require a management response to meet the goals and objectives outlined 
in the NE Multispecies FMP. The HPRT shall report its findings and 
recommendations to the NEFMC.
    (2) After receiving and reviewing the HPRT's findings and 
recommendations, the NEFMC shall determine whether adjustments or 
additional management measures are necessary to meet the goals and 
objectives of the NE Multispecies FMP. If the NEFMC determines that 
adjustments or additional management measures are necessary, or at any 
other time in consultation with the HPRT, it shall develop and analyze 
appropriate management actions over the span of at least two NEFMC 
meetings.
    (3) The NEFMC may request, at any time, that the HPRT review and 
make recommendations on any harbor porpoise take reduction measures or 
develop additional take reduction proposals.
    (4) The NEFMC shall provide the public with advance notice of the 
availability of the proposals, appropriate rationale, economic and 
biological analyses, and opportunity to comment on them prior to and at 
the second NEFMC meeting. The NEFMC's recommendation on adjustments or 
additions to management measures must come from one or more of the 
categories specified under Sec. 648.90(b)(1).
    (5) If the NEFMC recommends that the management measures should be 
issued as a final rule, the NEFMC must consider at least the factors 
specified in Sec. 648.90(b)(2).
    (6) The Regional Director may accept, reject, or with NEFMC 
approval, modify the NEFMC's recommendation, including the NEFMC's 
recommendation to issue a final rule, as specified under 
Sec. 648.90(b)(3).

Sec. 648.89  Recreational and charter/party restrictions.

    (a) Recreational gear restrictions. Persons aboard charter or party 
vessels permitted under this part and not fishing under the DAS program, 
and recreational fishing vessels in the EEZ, are prohibited from fishing 
with more than two hooks per line and one line per angler and must stow 
all other fishing gear on board the vessel as specified under 
Secs. 648.23(b) and 648.81(e) (2), (3), and (4).
    (b) Recreational minimum fish sizes--(1) Minimum fish sizes. Persons 
aboard charter or party vessels permitted under this part and not 
fishing under the DAS program, and recreational fishing vessels in the 
EEZ, are subject to minimum fish sizes (TL) as follows:

                         Minimum Fish Sizes (TL)

    (2) Exception. Vessels may possess fillets less than the minimum 
size specified, if the fillets are taken from legal-sized fish and are 
not offered or intended for sale, trade or barter.
    (c) Possession restrictions. Each person on a recreational vessel 
may not possess more than 10 cod and/or haddock, combined, in or 
harvested from the EEZ.
    (1) For purposes of counting fish, fillets will be converted to 
whole fish at the place of landing by dividing fillet number by two. If 
fish are filleted into a single (butterfly) fillet, such fillet shall be 
deemed to be from one whole fish.
    (2) Cod and haddock harvested by recreational vessels with more than 
one person aboard may be pooled in one or more containers. Compliance 
with the possession limit will be determined by dividing the number of 
fish on board by the number of persons aboard. If there is a violation 
of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying more than one person, 
the violation shall be deemed to have been committed by the owner and 
operator.
    (3) Cod and haddock must be stored so as to be readily available for 
inspection.
    (d) Restrictions on sale. It is unlawful to sell, barter, trade, or 
otherwise transfer for a commercial purpose, or to attempt to sell, 
barter, trade, or otherwise transfer for a commercial purpose, NE 
multispecies caught or landed by charter or party vessels permitted 
under this part not fishing under a DAS or a recreational fishing 
vessels fishing in the EEZ.


<R05>
Sec. 648.90  Framework specifications.

    (a) Annual review. The Multispecies Monitoring Committee (MSMC) 
shall meet on or before November 15 of each year to develop target TACs 
for the upcoming fishing year and options for NEFMC consideration on any 
changes, adjustment or additions to DAS allocations, closed areas, or 
other measures necessary to achieve the NE Multispecies FMP goals and 
objectives.
    (1) The MSMC shall review available data pertaining to: Catch and 
landings, DAS and other measures of fishing effort, survey results, 
stock status, current estimates of fishing mortality, and any other 
relevant information.

[[Page 226]]

    (2) Based on this review, the MSMC shall recommend target TACs and 
develop options necessary to achieve the FMP goals and objectives, which 
may include a preferred option. The MSMC must demonstrate through 
analysis and documentation that the options it develops are expected to 
meet the NE Multispecies FMP goals and objectives. The MSMC may review 
the performance of different user groups or fleet sectors in developing 
options. The range of options developed by the MSMC may include any of 
the management measures in the NE Multispecies FMP, including, but not 
limited to: Annual target TACs, which must be based on the projected 
fishing mortality levels required to meet the goals and objectives 
outlined in the NE Multispecies FMP for the 10 regulated species; DAS 
changes; possession limits; gear restrictions; closed areas; permitting 
restrictions; minimum fish sizes; recreational fishing measures; and any 
other management measures currently included in the NE Multispecies FMP.
    (3) The NEFMC shall review the recommended target TACs and all of 
the options developed by the MSMC and other relevant information, 
consider public comment, and develop a recommendation to meet the NE 
Multispecies FMP objective that is consistent with other applicable law. 
If the NEFMC does not submit a recommendation that meets the NE 
Multispecies FMP objectives and is consistent with other applicable law, 
the Regional Director may adopt any option developed by the MSMC, unless 
rejected by the NEFMC, as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, 
provided that the option meets the NE Multispecies FMP objective and is 
consistent with other applicable law.
    (4) Based on this review, the NEFMC shall submit a recommendation to 
the Regional Director of any changes, adjustments or additions to DAS 
allocations, closed areas or other measures necessary to achieve the NE 
Multispecies FMP's goals and objectives. Included in the NEFMC's 
recommendation will be supporting documents, as appropriate, concerning 
the environmental and economic impacts of the proposed action and the 
other options considered by the NEFMC.
    (5) If the NEFMC submits, on or before January 7, a recommendation 
to the Regional Director after one NEFMC meeting, and the Regional 
Director concurs with the recommendation, the Regional Director shall 
publish the NEFMC's recommendation in the Federal Register as a proposed 
rule. The Federal Register notification of the proposed action will 
provide a 30-day public comment period. The NEFMC may instead submit its 
recommendation on or before February 1, if it chooses to follow the 
framework process outlined in paragraph (b) of this section and requests 
that the Regional Director publish the recommendation as a final rule. 
If the Regional Director concurs that the NEFMC's recommendation meets 
the NE Multispecies FMP objective and is consistent with other 
applicable law, and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published as a final rule, the action will be published as a 
final rule in the Federal Register. If the Regional Director concurs 
that the recommendation meets the FMP objective and is consistent with 
other applicable law and determines that a proposed rule is warranted, 
and, as a result, the effective date of a final rule falls after the 
start of the fishing year on May 1, fishing may continue. However, DAS 
used by a vessel on or after May 1 will be counted against any DAS 
allocation the vessel ultimately receives for that year.
    (6) If the Regional Director concurs in the NEFMC's recommendation, 
a final rule shall be published in the Federal Register on or about 
April 1 of each year, with the exception noted in paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section. If the NEFMC fails to submit a recommendation to the 
Regional Director by February 1 that meets the FMP goals and objectives, 
the Regional Director may publish as a proposed rule one of the options 
reviewed and not rejected by the NEFMC, provided that the option meets 
the FMP objective and is consistent with other applicable law. If, after 
considering public comment, the Regional Director decides to approve the 
option published as a proposed rule, the action will be published as a 
final rule in the Federal Register.

[[Page 227]]

    (b) Within season management action. The NEFMC may, at any time, 
initiate action to add or adjust management measures if it finds that 
action is necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and 
objectives of the NE Multispecies FMP.
    (1) Adjustment process. After a management action has been 
initiated, the NEFMC shall develop and analyze appropriate management 
actions over the span of at least two NEFMC meetings. The NEFMC shall 
provide the public with advance notice of the availability of both the 
proposals and the analysis, and opportunity to comment on them prior to 
and at the second NEFMC meeting. The NEFMC's recommendation on 
adjustments or additions to management measures must come from one or 
more of the following categories: DAS changes, effort monitoring, data 
reporting, possession limits, gear restrictions, closed areas, 
permitting restrictions, crew limits, minimum fish sizes, onboard 
observers, minimum hook size and hook style, the use of crucifiers in 
the hook-gear fishery, fleet sector shares, recreational fishing 
measures, area closures and other appropriate measures to mitigate 
marine mammal entanglements and interactions, and any other management 
measures currently included in the FMP.
    (2) NEFMC recommendation. After developing management actions and 
receiving public testimony, the NEFMC shall make a recommendation to the 
Regional Director. The NEFMC's recommendation must include supporting 
rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of 
impacts and a recommendation to the Regional Director on whether to 
issue the management measures as a final rule. If the NEFMC recommends 
that the management measures should be issued as a final rule, the NEFMC 
must consider at least the following factors and provide support and 
analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season.
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the NEFMC's recommended management measures.
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource.
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (3) Regional Director action. If the NEFMC's recommendation includes 
adjustments or additions to management measures and, after reviewing the 
NEFMC's recommendation and supporting information:
    (i) If the Regional Director concurs with the NEFMC's recommended 
management measures and determines that the recommended management 
measures should be issued as a final rule based on the factors specified 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the measures will be issued as a 
final rule in the Federal Register.
    (ii) If the Regional Director concurs with the NEFMC's 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if the Regional Director concurs with the NEFMC 
recommendation, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the 
Federal Register.
    (iii) If the Regional Director does not concur, the NEFMC will be 
notified in writing of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (c) Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(e) of the Magnuson Act.

    Subpart G--Management Measures for the Summer Flounder Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 648.100  Catch quotas and other restrictions.

    (a) Annual review. The Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee shall 
review the following data on or before August 15 of each year to 
determine

[[Page 228]]

the allowable levels of fishing and other restrictions necessary to 
achieve a fishing mortality rate (F) of 0.41 in 1996, 0.30 in 1997, and 
0.23 in 1998 and thereafter, provided the allowable levels of fishing in 
1996 and 1997 may not exceed 18,518,830 lb (8,400 mt), unless such 
fishing levels have an associated F of 0.23: Commercial and recreational 
catch data; current estimates of fishing mortality; stock status; recent 
estimates of recruitment; virtual population analysis results; levels of 
noncompliance by fishermen or individual states; impact of size/mesh 
regulations; sea sampling and winter trawl survey data or, if sea 
sampling data are unavailable, length frequency information from the 
winter trawl survey and mesh selectivity analyses; impact of gear other 
than otter trawls on the mortality of summer flounder; and any other 
relevant information.
    (b) Recommended measures. Based on this review, the Summer Flounder 
Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the Demersal Species Committee 
of the MAFMC and the Commission the following measures to assure that 
the F specified in paragraph (a) of this section will not be exceeded:
    (1) Commercial quota set from a range of 0 to the maximum allowed to 
achieve the specified F.
    (2) Commercial minimum fish size.
    (3) Minimum mesh size.
    (4) Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 15 summer 
flounder to achieve the specified F.
    (5) Recreational minimum fish size.
    (6) Recreational season.
    (7) Restrictions on gear other than otter trawls.
    (8) Adjustments to the exempted area boundary and season specified 
in Sec. 648.104(b)(1) by 30-minute intervals of latitude and longitude 
and 2-week intervals, respectively, based on data specified in 
paragraphs (a) (8) and (10) of this section to prevent discarding of 
sublegal sized summer flounder in excess of 10 percent, by weight.
    (c) Annual fishing measures. The Demersal Species Committee shall 
review the recommendations of the Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee. 
Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the Demersal 
Species Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC measures necessary to 
assure that the applicable specified F will not be exceeded. The MAFMC 
shall review these recommendations and, based on the recommendations and 
any public comment, recommend to the Regional Director measures 
necessary to assure that the applicable specified F will not be 
exceeded. The MAFMC's recommendations must include supporting 
documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic 
impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Director shall review these 
recommendations and any recommendations of the Commission. After such 
review, the Regional Director will publish a proposed rule in the 
Federal Register by October 15 to implement a coastwide commercial quota 
and recreational harvest limit and additional management measures for 
the commercial fishery, and will publish a proposed rule in the Federal 
Register by February 15 to implement additional management measures for 
the recreational fishery, if he/she determines that such measures are 
necessary to assure that the applicable specified F will not be 
exceeded. After considering public comment, the Regional Director will 
publish a final rule in the Federal Register to implement the measures 
necessary to assure that the applicable specified F will not be 
exceeded.
    (d) Distribution of annual quota. (1) The annual commercial quota 
will be distributed to the states, based upon the following percentages:

                     Annual Commercial Quota Shares                     
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Share  
                            State                              (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maine........................................................    0.04756
New Hampshire................................................    0.00046
Massachusetts................................................    6.82046
Rhode Island.................................................   15.68298
Connecticut..................................................    2.25708
New York.....................................................    7.64699
New Jersey...................................................   16.72499
Delaware.....................................................    0.01779
Maryland.....................................................    2.03910
Virginia.....................................................   21.31676
North Carolina...............................................   27.44584
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) All summer flounder landed for sale in a state shall be applied 
against that state's annual commercial quota, regardless of where the 
summer flounder were harvested. Any overages of

[[Page 229]]

the commercial quota landed in any state will be deducted from that 
state's annual quota for the following year.
    (e) Quota transfers and combinations. Any state implementing a state 
commercial quota for summer flounder may request approval from the 
Regional Director to transfer part or all of its annual quota to one or 
more states. Two or more states implementing a state commercial quota 
for summer flounder may request approval from the Regional Director to 
combine their quotas, or part of their quotas, into an overall regional 
quota. Requests for transfer or combination of commercial quotas for 
summer flounder must be made by individual or joint letter(s) signed by 
the principal state official with marine fishery management 
responsibility and expertise, or his/her previously named designee, for 
each state involved. The letter(s) must certify that all pertinent state 
requirements have been met and identify the states involved and the 
amount of quota to be transferred or combined.
    (1) Within 10 working days following the receipt of the letter(s) 
from the states involved, the Regional Director shall notify the 
appropriate state officials of the disposition of the request. In 
evaluating requests to transfer a quota or combine quotas, the Regional 
Director shall consider whether:
    (i) The transfer or combination would preclude the overall annual 
quota from being fully harvested.
    (ii) The transfer addresses an unforeseen variation or contingency 
in the fishery.
    (iii) The transfer is consistent with the objectives of the Summer 
Flounder FMP and Magnuson Act.
    (2) The transfer of quota or the combination of quotas will be valid 
only for the calendar year for which the request was made and will be 
effective upon the filing by NMFS of a notice of the approval of the 
transfer or combination with the Office of the Federal Register.
    (3) A state may not submit a request to transfer quota or combine 
quotas if a request to which it is party is pending before the Regional 
Director. A state may submit a new request when it receives notice that 
the Regional Director has disapproved the previous request or when 
notice of the approval of the transfer or combination has been filed at 
the Office of the Federal Register.
    (4) If there is a quota overage among states involved in the 
combination of quotas at the end of the fishing year, the overage will 
be deducted from the following year's quota for each of the states 
involved in the combined quota. The deduction will be proportional, 
based on each state's relative share of the combined quota for the 
previous year. A transfer of quota or combination of quotas does not 
alter any state's percentage share of the overall quota specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 648.101  Closures.

    (a) EEZ closure. The Regional Director shall close the EEZ to 
fishing for summer flounder by commercial vessels for the remainder of 
the calendar year by publishing notification in the Federal Register if 
he/she determines that the inaction of one or more states will cause the 
applicable F specified in Sec. 648.100(a) to be exceeded, or if the 
commercial fisheries in all states have been closed. The Regional 
Director may reopen the EEZ if earlier inaction by a state has been 
remedied by that state, or if commercial fisheries in one or more states 
have been reopened without causing the applicable specified F to be 
exceeded.
    (b) State quotas. The Regional Director will monitor state 
commercial quotas based on dealer reports and other available 
information and shall determine the date when a state commercial quota 
will be harvested. The Regional Director shall publish notification in 
the Federal Register advising a state that, effective upon a specific 
date, its commercial quota has been harvested and notifying vessel and 
dealer permit holders that no commercial quota is available for landing 
summer flounder in that state.


<R05>
Sec. 648.102  Time restrictions.

    Vessels that are not eligible for a moratorium permit under 
Sec. 648.4(a)(3) and fishermen subject to the possession limit may fish 
for summer flounder from January 1 through December 31. This time period 
may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.100.

    (a) The minimum size for summer flounder is 13 inches (33 cm) TL for 
all vessels issued a moratorium permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(3), except on 
board party and charter boats carrying passengers for hire or carrying 
more than three crew members, if a charter boat, or more than five crew 
members, if a party boat;
    (b) The minimum size for summer flounder is 14 inches (35.6 cm) TL 
for all vessels that do not qualify for a moratorium permit, or party 
and charter boats holding moratorium permits, but fishing with 
passengers for hire or carrying more than three crew members, if a 
charter boat, or more than five crew members, if a party boat.
    (c) The minimum sizes in this section apply to whole fish or to any 
part of a fish found in possession, e.g., fillets. These minimum sizes 
may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.100.


<R05>
Sec. 648.104  Gear restrictions.

    (a) General. (1) Otter trawlers whose owners are issued a summer 
flounder permit and that land or possess 100 or more lb (45.4 or more 
kg) of summer flounder from May 1 through October 31, or 200 lb or more 
(90.8 kg or more) of summer flounder from November 1 through April 30, 
per trip, must fish with nets that have a minimum mesh size of 5.5-inch 
(14.0-cm) diamond mesh or 6-inch (15.2-cm) square mesh applied 
throughout the codend for at least 75 continuous meshes forward of the 
terminus of the net, or, for codends with less than 75 meshes, the 
minimum-mesh-size codend must be a minimum of one-third of the net, 
measured from the terminus of the codend to the head rope, excluding any 
turtle excluded device extension.
    (2) Mesh sizes are measured by a wedge-shaped gauge having a taper 
of 2 cm in 8 cm and a thickness of 2.3 mm inserted into the meshes under 
a pressure or pull of 5 kg. The mesh size is the average of the 
measurement of any series of 20 consecutive meshes for nets having 75 or 
more meshes, and 10 consecutive meshes for nets having fewer than 75 
meshes. The mesh in the regulated portion of the net is measured at 
least five meshes away from the lacings, running parallel to the long 
axis of the net.
    (b) Exemptions. The minimum mesh-size requirements specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply to:
    (1) Vessels issued a summer flounder moratorium permit and fishing 
from November 1 through April 30 in the ``exemption area,'' which is 
east of the line that follows 72 deg.30.0' W. long. until it intersects 
the outer boundary of the EEZ. Vessels fishing with a summer flounder 
exemption permit shall not fish west of the line. Vessels issued a 
permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(3)(iii) may transit the area west or south of 
the line, if the vessel's fishing gear is stowed in a manner prescribed 
under Sec. 648.100(e), so that it is not ``available for immediate use'' 
outside the exempted area. The Regional Director may terminate this 
exemption if he/she determines, after a review of sea sampling data, 
that vessels fishing under the exemption are discarding more than 10 
percent, by weight, of their entire catch of summer flounder per trip. 
If the Regional Director makes such a determination, he/she shall 
publish notification in the Federal Register terminating the exemption 
for the remainder of the exemption season.
    (2) Vessels fishing with a two-seam otter trawl fly net with the 
following configuration, provided that no other nets or netting with 
mesh smaller than 5.5 inches (14.0 cm) are on board:
    (i) The net has large mesh in the wings that measures 8 inches (20.3 
cm) to 64 inches (162.6 cm).
    (ii) The first body section (belly) of the net has 35 or more meshes 
that are at least 8 inches (20.3 cm).
    (iii) The mesh decreases in size throughout the body of the net to 2 
inches (5 cm) or smaller towards the terminus of the net.
    (3) The Regional Director may terminate this exemption if he/she 
determines, after a review of sea sampling data, that vessels fishing 
under the exemption, on average, are discarding more than 1 percent of 
their entire catch of summer flounder per trip. If

[[Page 231]]

the Regional Director makes such a determination, he/she shall publish a 
notice in the Federal Register terminating the exemption for the 
remainder of the calendar year.
    (c) Net modifications. No vessel subject to this part shall use any 
device, gear, or material, including, but not limited to nets, net 
strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of the 
regulated portion of a trawl net; except that, one splitting strap and 
one bull rope (if present) consisting of line or rope no more than 3 
inches (7.2 cm) in diameter may be used if such splitting strap and/or 
bull rope does not constrict, in any manner, the top of the regulated 
portion of the net, and one rope no greater than 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) in 
diameter extending the length of the net from the belly to the terminus 
of the codend along the top, bottom, and each side of the net. ``Top of 
the regulated portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of the entire 
regulated portion of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) will not 
be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the regulated 
portion of the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of 
this paragraph (c), head ropes shall not be considered part of the top 
of the regulated portion of a trawl net. A vessel shall not use any 
means or mesh configuration on the top of the regulated portion of the 
net, as defined in Sec. 648.104(e), if it obstructs the meshes of the 
net or otherwise causes the size of the meshes of the net while in use 
to diminish to a size smaller than the minimum specified in 
Sec. 648.100(a).
    (d) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (1) A fishing vessel may not 
use any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in 
the top of the net, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, that 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (2) No person on any vessel may possess or fish with a net capable 
of catching summer flounder in which the bars entering or exiting the 
knots twist around each other.
    (e) Stowage of nets. Otter trawl vessels retaining 100 lb (45.3 kg) 
or more of summer flounder from May 1 through October 31, or 200 lb 
(90.6 kg) or more of summer flounder from November 1 through April 30, 
and subject to the minimum mesh size requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section may not have ``available for immediate use'' any net or any 
piece of net that does not meet the minimum mesh size requirement, or 
any net, or any piece of net, with mesh that is rigged in a manner that 
is inconsistent with the minimum mesh size requirement. A net that is 
stowed in conformance with one of the methods specified in 
Sec. 648.23(b) and that can be shown not to have been in recent use is 
considered to be not ``available for immediate use.''


<R05>
Sec. 648.105  Possession restrictions.

    (a) No person shall possess more than eight summer flounder in, or 
harvested from, the EEZ unless that person is the owner or operator of a 
fishing vessel issued a summer flounder moratorium permit. Persons 
aboard a commercial vessel that is not eligible for a summer flounder 
moratorium permit are subject to this possession limit. The owner, 
operator, and crew of a charter or party boat issued a summer flounder 
moratorium permit are not subject to the possession limit when not 
carrying passengers for hire and when the crew size does not exceed five 
for a party boat and three for a charter boat.
    (b) If whole summer flounder are processed into fillets, the number 
of fillets will be converted to whole summer flounder at the place of 
landing by dividing the fillet number by two. If summer flounder are 
filleted into single (butterfly) fillets, each fillet is deemed to be 
from one whole summer flounder.
    (c) Summer flounder harvested by vessels subject to the possession 
limit with more than one person on board may be pooled in one or more 
containers. Compliance with the daily possession limit will be 
determined by dividing the number of summer flounder on board by the 
number of persons on board, other than the captain and the crew. If 
there is a violation of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying 
more than one person, the violation shall be deemed to have been 
committed by the owner and operator.
    (d) Owners and operators of otter trawl vessels issued a permit 
under Sec. 648.4(a)(3) that fish with or possess

[[Page 232]]

nets or pieces of net on board that do not meet the minimum mesh 
requirements and that are not stowed in accordance with Sec. 648.104(f), 
may not retain 100 lb (45.3 kg) or more of summer flounder from May 1 
through October 31, or 200 lb (90.6 kg) or more of summer flounder from 
November 1 through April 30. Summer flounder on board these vessels must 
be stored so as to be readily available for inspection in standard 100-
lb (45.3-kg) totes or fish boxes having a liquid capacity of 18.2 gal 
(70 L), or a volume of not more than 4,320 in \3\ (2.5 ft \3\ or 70.79 
cm \3\).


<R05>
Sec. 648.106  Sea turtle conservation.

    This section will be suspended during the effectiveness of any 
temporary regulations issued to regulate incidental take of sea turtles 
in the summer flounder under authority of the ESA under parts 217, 222, 
and 227 of this title. Such suspensions and temporary regulations will 
be issued by publication in the Federal Register and will be effective 
for a specified period of time, not to exceed 1 year.
    (a) Sea turtle handling and resuscitation. The sea turtle handling 
and resuscitation requirements specified in Sec. 227.72(e)(1) (i) and 
(ii) of this title apply with respect to sea turtles incidentally taken 
by a vessel fishing for summer flounder.
    (b) Sea turtle monitoring and assessment program. (1) The Regional 
Director will establish a monitoring and assessment program, in 
cooperation with the MAFMC and the State of North Carolina, to measure 
the incidental take of sea turtles in the summer flounder fishery, 
monitor compliance with required conservation measures by trawlers, and 
predict interactions between the fishery and sea turtles to prevent 
turtle mortalities.
    (2) A scientifically designed, observer-based monitoring program in 
accordance with Sec. 648.11 may be used to gather scientific data 
measuring the incidental take of turtles by trawlers in the summer 
flounder fishery and to report turtle distribution and abundance.
    (3) A cooperative sea turtle monitoring and assessment program 
utilizing a variety of information, including aerial and vessel surveys; 
onboard observers; individually tagged turtles; physical parameters, 
such as sea surface temperatures, and reports from the sea turtle 
stranding network; and other relevant and reliable information, will 
assess and predict turtle distribution, abundance, movement patterns, 
and timing to provide information to NMFS to prevent turtle mortality 
caused by the summer flounder fishery.
    (c) Required use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TED). The Regional 
Director will require the use of a NMFS-approved TED by any vessels 
engaged in summer flounder fishing operations and utilizing trawl gear 
on or after October 15 as necessary to protect sea turtles. The Regional 
Director will publish notification in the Federal Register with the 
specific time period. Descriptions of NMFS-approved TEDs can be found in 
Sec. 227.72(e)(4) of this title. This requirement applies to vessels 
within the EEZ bounded on the north by a line along 37 deg.05' N. lat., 
bounded on the south by a line along 33 deg.35' N. lat., and bounded on 
the east by a line 7 nm from the shoreward boundary of the EEZ.
    (d) Closure of the fishery. The Regional Director may close the 
summer flounder fishery in the EEZ, or any part thereof, after 
consultation with the MAFMC, the Director of the State of North Carolina 
Division of Marine Fisheries, and the marine fisheries agency of any 
other affected state, by publishing notification in the Federal 
Register. The Regional Director shall take such action if he/she 
determines a closure is necessary to avoid jeopardizing the continued 
existence of any species listed under the ESA. The determination of the 
impact on sea turtles must be based on turtle mortalities and 
projections of turtle mortality by the NMFS monitoring and assessment 
program. A closure will be applicable to those areas specified in the 
notification and for the period specified in the notification. The 
Regional Director will provide as much advance notice as possible, 
consistent with the requirements of the ESA, and will have the closure 
announced on channel 16 of the marine VHF radio. A closure may prohibit 
all fishing operations, may prohibit the use of certain gear, may 
require that gear be stowed, or may impose similar types of restrictions 
on

[[Page 233]]

fishing activities. The prohibitions, restrictions, and duration of the 
closure will be specified in the notification.
    (e) Reopening of the fishery. (1) The Regional Director may reopen 
the summer flounder fishery in the EEZ, or any part thereof, after 
consultation with the MAFMC, the Director of the State of North Carolina 
Division of Marine Fisheries, and the marine fisheries agency of any 
other affected state, by publishing notification in the Federal 
Register. The Regional Director may reopen the summer flounder fishery 
in the EEZ, or any part thereof, if additional sea turtle conservation 
measures are implemented and if projections of NMFS' sea turtle 
monitoring program indicate that such measures will ensure that 
continued operation of the summer flounder fishery is not likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of any species listed under the ESA.
    (2) The Regional Director may reopen the summer flounder fishery in 
the EEZ, or any part thereof, if the sea turtle monitoring program 
indicates changed conditions and if projections of the sea turtle 
monitoring program indicate that NMFS can ensure that continued 
operation of the summer flounder fishery is not likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of any species listed under the ESA.
    (f) Additional sea turtle conservation measures. (1) The Regional 
Director may impose additional sea turtle conservation measures, 
including tow-time requirements, in the EEZ, after consultation with the 
MAFMC, the Director of the State of North Carolina Division of Marine 
Fisheries, and the marine fisheries agency of any other affected state, 
by publishing notification in the Federal Register. The Regional 
Director shall take such action if he/she determines further measures 
are necessary to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of any 
species listed under the ESA or if such action would allow reopening of 
the summer flounder fishery in the EEZ. The determination of the impact 
on sea turtles must be based on turtle mortalities and projections of 
turtle mortality by the NMFS monitoring and assessment program.
    (2) Consistent with the procedures specified in Sec. 648.10, the 
Regional Director may require that all or a certain portion of the 
vessels engaged in fishing for summer flounder carry observers, 
consistent with the requirements of Sec. 648.10, to gather data on 
incidental capture of sea turtles and to monitor compliance with 
required conservation measures. This requirement may apply to certain 
types of vessels, certain areas, or during certain times of the year.
    (g) Experimental projects. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through 
(f) of this section, the Regional Director may authorize summer flounder 
fishing, as a part of experimental projects to measure turtle capture 
rates, to monitor turtle abundance, to test alternative gear or 
equipment, or for other research purposes. Research must be approved by 
the Regional Director, and it must not be likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of any species listed under the ESA. The Regional 
Director will impose such conditions as he/she determines necessary to 
ensure adequate turtle protection during experimental projects. 
Individual authorizations may be issued in writing. Authorizations 
applying to multiple vessels will be published in the Federal Register.

    Source: 61 FR 43426, Aug. 23, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 648.120   Catch quotas and other restrictions.

    (a) Annual review. The Scup Monitoring Committee shall review the 
following data, subject to availability, on or before August 15 of each 
year. This review will be conducted to determine the allowable levels of 
fishing and other restrictions necessary to achieve an exploitation rate 
of 47 percent in 1997, 1998, and 1999, 33 percent in 2000 and 2001, and 
19 percent in 2002 and thereafter: Commercial and recreational catch 
data; current estimates of fishing mortality; stock status; recent 
estimates of recruitment; virtual population analysis results; levels of

[[Page 234]]

noncompliance by fishermen or individual states; impact of size/mesh 
regulations; impact of gear on the mortality of scup; and any other 
relevant information.
    (b) Recommended measures. Based on this review, the Scup Monitoring 
Committee shall recommend the following measures to the Demersal Species 
Committee of the MAFMC and the Commission to assure that the 
exploitation rate specified in paragraph (a) of this section will not be 
exceeded:
    (1) The coastwide commercial quota will be set from a range of 0 to 
the maximum allowed to achieve the specified exploitation rate.
    (2) Commercial minimum fish size.
    (3) Minimum mesh size.
    (4) Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 50 scup 
to achieve the specified exploitation rate.
    (5) Recreational minimum fish size set from a range of 7 inches 
(17.8 cm) TL to 10 inches (25.4 cm) TL.
    (6) Recreational season.
    (7) Restrictions on gear.
    (8) Season and area closures in the commercial fishery.
    (c) Annual fishing measures. The Demersal Species Committee shall 
review the recommendations of the Scup Monitoring Committee. Based on 
these recommendations and any public comment, the Demersal Species 
Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC measures necessary to assure that 
the specified exploitation rate will not be exceeded. The MAFMC shall 
review these recommendations, and based on these recommendations and any 
public comment, recommend to the Regional Director measures necessary to 
assure that the specified exploitation rate will not be exceeded. The 
MAFMC's recommendation must include supporting documentation, as 
appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the 
recommendations. The Regional Director shall review these 
recommendations and any recommendations of the Commission. After such 
review, the Regional Director will publish a proposed rule in the 
Federal Register by October 15 to implement a coastwide commercial quota 
and recreational harvest limit and additional management measures for 
the commercial fishery, and will publish a proposed rule in the Federal 
Register by February 15 to implement additional management measures for 
the recreational fishery, if he or she determines that such measures are 
necessary to assure that the specified exploitation rate will not be 
exceeded. After considering public comment, the Regional Director will 
publish a final rule in the Federal Register to implement the annual 
measures.
    (d) Additional quota measures. The commercial quota will be 
implemented as a coastwide quota, applicable to that area of the EEZ 
from 35 deg.15.3' N. lat. to the United States/Canada border. The MAFMC 
and Commission may revise the coastwide quota system to distribute and 
manage the annual commercial quota allocation in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in this section. Vessel trip limits, as well as 
coastwide, regional and state-by-state quotas may be considered in 
combination with different fractions of the fishing year. Any 
modification to the coastwide quota system shall be published as a 
proposed rule in the Federal Register with a 45-day public comment 
period. After considering public comment on the proposed rule, a final 
rule shall be published in the Federal Register to implement the 
appropriate modification.


<R05>
Sec. 648.121   Closure.

    The Regional Director will monitor the harvest of commercial quota 
based on dealer reports, state data, and other available information and 
shall determine the date when the commercial quota will be harvested. 
The Regional Director shall close the EEZ to fishing for scup by 
commercial vessels for the remainder of the calendar year by publishing 
notification in the Federal Register advising that, effective upon a 
specific date, the commercial quota has been harvested, and notifying 
vessel and dealer permit holders that no commercial quota is available 
for landing scup.


<R05>
Sec. 648.122   Season and area restrictions.

    If the MAFMC determines through its annual review process that 
seasonal

[[Page 235]]

restrictions or area closures are necessary for the commercial or 
recreational sectors to assure that the exploitation rate is not 
exceeded, or to attain other FMP objectives, such measures will be 
enacted through the procedure specified in Sec. 648.120.


<R05>
Sec. 648.123   Gear restrictions.

    (a) Trawl vessel gear restrictions--(1) Minimum mesh size. The 
owners or operators of otter trawlers issued a scup moratorium permit, 
and that possess 4,000 lb or more (1,814 kg or more) of scup, must fish 
with nets that have a minimum mesh size of 4 inches (10.2 cm) diamond 
mesh applied throughout the codend for at least 75 continuous meshes 
forward of the terminus of the net, or, for codends with less than 75 
meshes, the minimum-mesh-size codend must be a minimum of one-third of 
the net, measured from the terminus of the codend to the head rope, 
excluding any turtle excluder device extension. Scup on board these 
vessels shall be stored separately and kept readily available for 
inspection.
    (2) Mesh-size measurement. Mesh sizes will be measured according to 
the procedure specified in Sec. 648.104(a)(2).
    (3) Net modification. The owner or operator of a fishing vessel 
subject to the minimum mesh requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section shall not use any device, gear, or material, including, but not 
limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on 
the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net. However, one splitting 
strap and one bull rope (if present), consisting of line or rope no more 
than 3 inches (7.2 cm) in diameter, may be used if such splitting strap 
and/or bull rope does not constrict in any manner the top of the 
regulated portion of the net, and one rope no greater that 0.75 inches 
(1.9 cm) in diameter extending the length of the net from the belly to 
the terminus of the codend along the top, bottom, and each side of the 
net. ``Top of the regulated portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of 
the entire regulated portion of the net that (in a hypothetical 
situation) will not be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if 
the regulated portion of the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For 
the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), head ropes are not considered part 
of the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net.
    (4) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (i) The owner or operator of a 
fishing vessel subject to the minimum mesh restriction in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section shall not use any mesh construction, mesh 
configuration, or other means on or in the top of the regulated portion 
of the net, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if it 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (ii) The owner or operator of a fishing vessel subject to the 
minimum mesh requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may not use 
a net capable of catching scup if the bars entering or exiting the knots 
twist around each other.
    (5) Stowage of nets. The owner or operator of an otter trawl vessel 
retaining 4,000 lb or more (1,814 kg or more) of scup and subject to the 
minimum mesh requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, may not 
have available for immediate use any net, or any piece of net, not 
meeting the minimum mesh size requirement, or mesh that is rigged in a 
manner that is inconsistent with the minimum mesh size. A net that 
conforms to one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b) and that can 
be shown not to have been in recent use is considered to be not 
``available for immediate use.''
    (6) Roller gear. The owner or operator of an otter trawl vessel 
issued a moratorium permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(6) shall not use 
roller rig trawl gear equipped with rollers greater than 18 inches (45.7 
cm) in diameter.
    (7) Procedures for changes. The minimum net mesh and the threshold 
catch level at which it is required set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, and the maximum roller diameter set forth in paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section, may be changed following the procedures in 
Sec. 648.120.
    (b) Pot and trap gear restrictions. Owners or operators of vessels 
subject to this part must fish with scup pots or traps that comply with 
the following:
    (1) Degradable hinges. A scup pot or trap must have degradable 
hinges and fasteners made of one of the following degradable materials:

[[Page 236]]

    (i) Untreated hemp, jute, or cotton string of \3/16\ inches (4.8 mm) 
diameter or smaller;
    (ii) Magnesium alloy, timed float releases (pop-up devices) or 
similar magnesium alloy fasteners; or
    (iii) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire of 0.094 inches (2.4 mm) 
diameter or smaller.
    (2) Escape vents. (i) All scup pots or traps that have a circular 
escape vent with a minimum of 3.1 inches (7.9 cm) in diameter, or a 
square escape vent with a minimum of 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) for each side, 
or an equivalent rectangular escape vent.
    (ii) The minimum escape vent size set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
of this section may be revised following the procedures in Sec. 648.120.


<R05>
Sec. 648.124  Minimum fish sizes.

    (a) The minimum size for scup is 9 inches (22.9 cm) TL for all 
vessels issued a moratorium permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(6). If such a 
vessel is also issued a charter and party boat permit and is carrying 
passengers for hire, or carrying more than three crew members if a 
charter boat, or more than five crew members if a party boat, then the 
minimum size specified in paragraph (b) of this section applies.
    (b) The minimum size for scup is 7 inches (17.8 cm) TL for all 
vessels that do not have a moratorium permit, or for party and charter 
vessels that are issued a moratorium permit but are fishing with 
passengers for hire, or carrying more than three crew members if a 
charter boat, or more than five crew members if a party boat.
    (c) The minimum size applies to whole fish or any part of a fish 
found in possession, e.g., fillets. These minimum sizes may be adjusted 
pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.120.


<R05>
Sec. 648.125  Possession limit.

    (a) Pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.120, the Regional 
Director may limit the number of scup that may be possessed in or 
harvested from the EEZ north of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat. by persons aboard 
vessels that have not been issued a valid moratorium permit.
    (b) If whole scup are processed into fillets, an authorized officer 
will convert the number of fillets to whole scup at the place of landing 
by dividing fillet number by 2. If scup are filleted into a single 
(butterfly) fillet, such fillet shall be deemed to be from one whole 
scup.
    (c) Scup harvested by vessels subject to the possession limit with 
more than one person aboard may be pooled in one or more containers. 
Compliance with the daily possession limit will be determined by 
dividing the number of scup on board by the number of persons aboard 
other than the captain and crew. If there is a violation of the 
possession limit on board a vessel carrying more than one person, the 
violation shall be deemed to have been committed by the owner and 
operator.
    (d) Scup and scup parts harvested by a vessel with a moratorium or 
charter or party boat scup permit, or in or from the EEZ north of 
35 deg.15.3' N. lat., may not be landed with the skin removed.


<R05>
Sec. 648.126  Protection of threatened and endangered sea turtles.

    This section supplements existing regulations issued to regulate 
incidental take of sea turtles under authority of the Endangered Species 
Act under 50 CFR parts 217 and 227. In addition to the measures required 
under those parts, NMFS will investigate the extent of take in flynet 
gear and if deemed appropriate, may develop and certify a Turtle 
Excluder Device for that gear.

    (b) Nothing in these regulations shall supersede more restrictive 
state management measures for American lobsters.


<R05>
Sec. 649.4  Vessel permits.

    (a) 1994 vessel permits. (1) Through April 30, 1995, any vessel of 
the United States fishing for American lobster in the EEZ must have been 
issued and carry on board a valid permit required by or issued under 
this part. The Regional Director may, by agreement with State agencies, 
recognize permits or licenses issued by those agencies endorsed for 
fishing for lobster in the EEZ, providing that such permitting programs 
accurately identify persons who fish in the EEZ, and that the Regional 
Director can either individually, or in concert with the state agency, 
act to suspend the permit or license for EEZ fishing for any violation 
under this part.
    (2) Alternate State EEZ permitting programs will be established 
through a letter of agreement between the Regional Director and the 
director of the State marine fisheries agency concerned. The letter of 
agreement will specify the information to be collected by the alternate 
EEZ permitting program and the mode and frequency of provision of that 
information to the Regional Director. The Regional Director will, in 
cooperation with the State director, arrange for notification of the 
existence and terms of any such agreements to the affected persons. 
Persons intending to fish in the EEZ should determine whether an 
alternate EEZ permitting program is in force for their state before 
applying for a Federal permit under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) Vessel owners or operators who apply for a fishing vessel permit 
under this section, or for a State permit endorsed for EEZ fishing under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, must agree, as a condition of the 
permit, that all the vessel's lobster fishing, catch, and gear (without 
regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, 
and without regard to where such lobster, lobster meats, or parts, or 
gear are possessed, taken or landed) will be subject to all the 
requirements of this part. All such fishing, catch, and gear will remain 
subject to any applicable state or local requirements. If a requirement 
of this part and a conservation measure required by state or local law 
differ, any vessel owner or operator permitted to fish in the EEZ

[[Page 239]]

must comply with the more restrictive requirement.
    (b) Limited access American lobster permits. From May 1, 1995, 
through December 31, 1999, any vessel of the United States that fishes 
for, possesses, or lands American lobster in or harvested from the EEZ 
must have been issued and carry on board a valid Federal limited access 
American lobster permit. This requirement does not apply to party, 
charter and dive boats that possess six or fewer American lobsters, not 
intended for or resulting in trade, barter or sale, per person aboard 
the vessel at any time, or to recreational vessels, and vessels that 
fish exclusively in state waters for American lobsters.
    (1) Eligibility in 1995. (i) To be eligible for a limited access 
permit for 1995, a vessel or the permit applicant must meet one of the 
following criteria:
    (A) The vessel was issued a Federal American lobster permit and 
landed American lobster prior to March 25, 1991, while in possession of 
the lobster permit.
    (B) To qualify for the limited access permit based on a federally 
endorsed state permit history, one of the following criteria must be 
met:
    (1) The permit applicant was issued a federally endorsed state 
American lobster permit, and landed American lobster prior to March 25, 
1991, and owned a vessel that landed American lobster prior to March 25, 
1991, while in possession of the lobster permit; or
    (2) The vessel was owned by a person who landed lobster prior to 
March 25, 1991, while in possession of a valid federally endorsed state 
American lobster permit, and the vessel was transferred to the current 
vessel owner in accordance with the exception to the presumption 
specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section; or
    (3) The permit applicant owned a vessel that landed American lobster 
prior to March 25, 1991, while under the operation of an individual with 
a valid federally endorsed state lobster permit; or
    (4) The permit applicant owned a vessel that landed American lobster 
prior to March 25, 1991, while the applicant held a valid signed written 
lease, recognized and authorized by the issuing state, granting the 
rights to a federally endorsed state lobster permit.
    (C) The vessel was under written agreement for construction or 
rerigging for directed American lobster fishing, or was under written 
contract for purchase as of March 25, 1991, and the applicant meets one 
of the eligibility criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) 
of this section. For the purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) all 
references to March 25, 1991, in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this 
section should be March 25, 1992.
    (D) The vessel is replacing a vessel that meets the criteria set 
forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
    (ii) No more than one vessel may qualify, at any one time, for a 
limited access American lobster permit based on that or another vessel's 
fishing and permit history. If more than one vessel owner claims 
eligibility for a limited access American lobster permit, based on one 
vessel's fishing and permit history, the Regional Director shall 
determine who is entitled to qualify for the limited access American 
lobster permit.
    (iii) A limited access American lobster permit for 1995 will not be 
issued unless an application for such permit is received by the Regional 
Director on or before December 31, 1995.
    (2) Eligibility in 1996 and thereafter. (i) To be eligible to renew 
or apply for a limited access lobster permit after 1995, a vessel or 
permit applicant must have been issued either a limited access lobster 
permit or a confirmation of permit history for the preceding year, or a 
vessel must be replacing a valid limited access American lobster permit 
or permit history confirmation from the preceding year. If more than one 
applicant claims eligibility to apply for a limited access American 
lobster permit based on one fishing and permit history, the Regional 
Director shall determine who is entitled to qualify for the limited 
access permit or permit history confirmation.
    (ii) Beginning January 1, 2000, any vessel of the United States that 
fishes for, possesses, or lands American lobster, in or harvested from 
the EEZ, must have been issued and carry on board a valid Federal 
American lobster permit. This requirement does not apply to party, 
charter and dive boats

[[Page 240]]

that possess six or fewer American lobsters, not intended for or 
resulting in trade, barter, or sale, per person aboard the vessel at any 
time, or to recreational vessels and vessels that fish exclusively in 
state waters for American lobsters. The eligibility requirements for 
limited access permits for the years 1996 - 1999 are not applicable for 
obtaining an American lobster permit for the year 2000 and thereafter.
    (3) Change in ownership. (i) The fishing and permit history of a 
vessel that qualifies based on issuance of a Federal lobster permit 
under paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (C) of this section is presumed to 
transfer with the vessel whenever it is bought, sold or otherwise 
transferred, unless there is a written agreement, signed by the 
transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, or other credible written 
evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller is retaining the vessel 
fishing and permit history for purposes of replacing the vessel.
    (ii) The fishing and permit history of a vessel owner and a vessel 
that qualifies based on issuance of a federally endorsed state lobster 
permit under paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(B) and (C) of this section is presumed 
to remain with such owner for any transfers of the vessel before and 
including March 25, 1991; and for any transfers of ownership of the 
vessel after March 25, 1991, the fishing and permit history necessary to 
qualify for a limited access lobster permit under paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i)(B) and (C) of this section is presumed to remain with the last 
owner of the vessel as of or prior to March 25, 1991, unless there is a 
written agreement, signed by the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, 
or other credible written evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller 
is transferring the fishing and permit history of a vessel necessary to 
qualify for a limited access lobster permit under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) 
or (C) of this section to the transferee/buyer.
    (4) Notification of eligibility for a limited access permit. (i) 
NMFS will attempt to notify all owners of vessels for which NMFS has 
credible evidence that they meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (ii) If a vessel owner has not been notified that the vessel is 
eligible to be issued a limited access American lobster permit, and the 
vessel owner believes that there is credible evidence that the vessel 
does qualify under the pertinent criteria, the vessel owner may apply 
for a limited access American lobster permit by submitting the 
information described in paragraphs (d) through (e) of this section. In 
the event the application is denied, the applicant may appeal as 
specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. If, through either of 
these procedures, the Regional Director determines that the vessel meets 
the eligibility criteria, a limited access American lobster permit will 
be issued to the vessel.
    (5) Appeal of denial of limited access American lobster permit or of 
permit category assignment. (i) Any applicant denied a limited access 
American lobster permit may appeal the denial to the Regional Director 
within 30 days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal must be based on 
one or more of the following grounds, must be in writing, and must state 
the grounds for the appeal:
    (A) The information used by the Regional Director was based on 
mistaken or incorrect data;
    (B) The applicant was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her 
control from meeting relevant criteria; or
    (C) The applicant has new or additional information.
    (ii) The Regional Director will appoint a designee who will make the 
initial decision on the appeal.
    (iii) The appellant may request a review of the initial decision by 
the Regional Director by so requesting, in writing, within 30 days of 
the notice of initial decision. If the appellant does not request a 
review of the initial decision within 30 days, the initial decision 
shall become the final administrative action of the Department of 
Commerce.
    (iv) Recommendations to the Regional Director by a hearing officer. 
A hearing officer shall be appointed by the Regional Director to review 
the initial decision. The hearing officer shall make findings and a 
recommendation to the Regional Director, which shall be advisory only.

[[Page 241]]

    (v) Upon receiving the findings and a recommendation, the Regional 
Director will issue a final decision on the appeal. The Regional 
Director's decision is the final administrative action of the Department 
of Commerce.
    (vi) Fishing during appeal. A vessel for which an appeal has been 
initiated and that was issued a 1994 Federal or federally endorsed state 
lobster permit, may fish for American lobster in the EEZ if the appeal 
is pending and the vessel has on board an authorizing letter from the 
Regional Director. If the appeal is finally denied, the Regional 
Director shall send a notice of final denial to the vessel owner; the 
authorizing letter becomes invalid 5 days after receipt of the notice of 
denial.
    (6) Confirmation of Permit History. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this part, a person who does not currently own a fishing 
vessel, but who has owned a qualifying vessel that has sunk, been 
destroyed, or transferred to another person, may apply for and receive a 
Confirmation of Permit History if the fishing and permit history of such 
vessel has been retained lawfully by the applicant. To be eligible to 
obtain a Confirmation of Permit History, the applicant must show that 
the qualifying vessel meets the eligibility requirements, as applicable, 
in this part. Issuance of a valid and current Confirmation of Permit 
History preserves the eligibility of the applicant to apply for or renew 
a limited access permit for a replacement vessel based on the qualifying 
vessel's fishing and permit history at a subsequent time, subject to the 
replacement provisions specified at Sec. 649.4. A Confirmation of Permit 
History must be applied for and received on an annual basis in order for 
the applicant to preserve the fishing rights and limited access 
eligibility of the qualifying vessel. If fishing privileges have been 
assigned or allocated previously under this part based on the qualifying 
vessel's fishing and permit history, the Confirmation of Permit History 
also preserves such fishing privileges. Any decision regarding the 
issuance of a Confirmation of Permit History for a qualifying vessel 
that has applied for or been issued previously a limited access permit 
under this part is a final agency action subject to judicial review 
under 5 U.S.C. 704. Applications for a Confirmation of Permit History 
shall be accepted by the Regional Director on or before December 31, 
1995. For subsequent years, applications must be received by the end of 
the calendar year in which the Confirmation of Permit History expires. 
Information requirements for the Confirmation of Permit History 
application shall be the same as those for a limited access permit with 
any request for information about the vessel being applicable to the 
qualifying vessel that has been sunk, destroyed, or transferred. Vessel 
permit applicants who hold a Confirmation of Permit History and who wish 
to obtain a vessel permit for a replacement vessel based upon the 
previous vessel history may do so pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (c) Condition. Vessel owners who apply for a permit under this 
section must agree, as a condition of the permit, that the vessel and 
vessel's fishing, catch, and pertinent gear (without regard to whether 
such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, and without 
regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, taken, or landed), are 
subject to all requirements of this part. The vessel and all such 
fishing, catch, and gear shall remain subject to all applicable state or 
local requirements. If a requirement of this part and a management 
measure required by state or local law differ, any vessel owner 
permitted to fish in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive 
requirement.
    (d) Vessel permit application. Applicants for a permit under this 
section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form 
obtained from the Regional Director. The application must be signed by 
the owner of the vessel, or the owner's authorized representative, and 
be submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days before the date 
on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. The 
Regional Director will notify the applicant of any deficiency in the 
application pursuant to this section. Applicants for 1995 limited access 
American lobster permits who have not been notified of eligibility by 
the Regional Director shall provide information with the application 
sufficient for

[[Page 242]]

the Regional Director to determine whether the vessel meets the 
eligibility requirements specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. Acceptable forms of proof include, but are not limited to, 
state weigh-out records, packout forms, and settlement sheets.
    (e) Information requirements. In addition to applicable information 
required to be provided by paragraph (d) of this section, an application 
for a Federal American lobster permit must contain at least the 
following information, and any other information required by the 
Regional Director: Vessel name; owner name, mailing address, and 
telephone number; U.S. Coast Guard documentation number and a copy of 
the vessel's U.S. Coast Guard documentation or, if undocumented, state 
registration number and a copy of the state registration; home port and 
principal port of landing; overall length; gross tonnage; net tonnage; 
engine horsepower; year the vessel was built; type of construction; type 
of propulsion; approximate fish-hold capacity; type of fishing gear used 
by the vessel; permit category; if the owner is a corporation, a copy of 
the Certificate of Incorporation; and the names and addresses of all 
shareholders owning 25 percent or more of the corporation's shares; if 
the owner is a partnership, a copy of the Partnership Agreement and the 
names and addresses of all partners; if there is more than one owner, 
names of all owners having more than a 25 percent interest; and name and 
signature of the owner or the owner's authorized representative.
    (f) Fees. The Regional Director may charge a fee to recover the 
administrative expense of issuing a permit required under this section. 
The amount of the fee shall be calculated in accordance with the 
procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining administrative 
costs of each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such 
costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee 
must accompany each application; if it does not, the application will be 
considered incomplete for purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (g) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904 
and under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the Regional Director shall 
issue a Federal American lobster vessel permit within 30 days of receipt 
of the application unless:
    (i) The applicant has failed to submit a completed application. An 
application is complete when all requested forms, information, 
documentation, and fees, if applicable, have been received; or
    (ii) The application was not received by the Regional Director by 
the deadlines set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section; or
    (iii) The applicant and applicant's vessel failed to meet all 
eligibility requirements described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section; or
    (iv) The applicant has failed to meet any other application 
requirements stated in this part.
    (2) Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed 
application, the Regional Director shall notify the applicant of the 
deficiency in the application. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (h) Expiration. A Federal American lobster permit will expire upon 
the renewal date specified in the permit.
    (i) Duration. A permit is valid until it is revoked, suspended, or 
modified under 15 CFR part 904, or until it otherwise expires, or 
ownership changes, or the applicant has failed to report any change in 
the information on the permit application to the Regional Director as 
specified in paragraph (l) of this section.
    (j) Replacement. Replacement permits, for an otherwise valid permit, 
may be issued by the Regional Director when requested in writing by the 
owner or authorized representative, stating the need for replacement, 
the name of the vessel, and the Federal Fisheries Permit number 
assigned. An application for a replacement permit will not be considered 
a new application. An appropriate fee may be charged for issuance of the 
replacement permit.
    (k) Transfer. Permits issued under this section are not transferable 
or assignable. A permit is valid only for the vessel and owner to whom 
it is issued.

[[Page 243]]

    (l) Change in application information. Within 15 days after a change 
in the information contained in an application submitted under this 
section, a written notice of the change must be submitted to the 
Regional Director. If the written notice of the change in information is 
not received by the Regional Director within 15 days, the permit is 
void.
    (m) Alteration. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (n) Display. Any permit issued under this part must be maintained in 
legible condition and displayed for inspection upon request by any 
authorized officer.
    (o) Sanctions. Procedures governing enforcement-related permit 
sanctions and denials are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (p) Limited access American lobster permit renewal. To renew a 
limited access permit in 1996 and thereafter, a completed application 
must be received by the Regional Director by December 31 of the year in 
which the permit is required. Failure to renew a limited access American 
lobster permit or confirmation of permit history in any year prevents 
the renewal of such in subsequent years.
    (q) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of limited access 
American lobster permits. If a vessel's limited access American lobster 
permit or confirmation of permit history is voluntarily relinquished to 
the Regional Director, or abandoned through failure to renew or 
otherwise, no limited access American lobster permit or confirmation of 
permit history may be reissued or renewed based on that vessel's 
history.

Sec. 649.5  Operator permits.

    (a) General. Beginning on January 1, 1995, any operator of a vessel 
issued a Federal limited access American lobster permit under 
Sec. 649.4(b), or any operator of a vessel of the United States that 
fishes for, possesses, or lands American lobsters, in or harvested from 
the EEZ must have been issued and carry on board a valid operator's 
permit issued under this section. This requirement does not apply to 
party, charter, and dive boats that possess six or fewer American 
lobsters, not intended for or resulting in trade, barter or sale, per 
person aboard the vessel at any time, or to recreational vessels, and 
vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for American lobsters.
    (b) Operator application. Applicants for a permit under this section 
must submit a completed permit application on an appropriate form 
obtained from the Regional Director. The application must be signed by 
the applicant and submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days 
prior to the date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made 
effective. The Regional Director will notify the applicant of any 
deficiency in the application, pursuant to this section.
    (c) Condition. Vessel operators who apply for an operator's permit 
under this section must agree, as a condition of this permit, that the 
operator and vessel's fishing, catch, crew size, and pertinent gear 
(without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of 
the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, 
taken, or landed), are subject to all requirements of this part while 
fishing in the EEZ or on board a vessel permitted under Sec. 649.4(b). 
The vessel and all such fishing, catch, and gear will remain subject to 
all applicable state or local requirements. Further, such operators must 
agree, as a condition of this permit, that if the permit is suspended or 
revoked pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, the operator cannot be on board any 
fishing vessel issued a Federal Fisheries Permit or any vessel subject 
to Federal fishing regulations while the vessel is at sea or engaged in 
offloading. If a requirement of this part and a management measure 
required by state or local law differ, any operator issued a permit 
under this part must comply with the more restrictive requirement.
    (d) Information requirements. An applicant must provide at least all 
the following information and any other information required by the 
Regional Director: Name, mailing address, and telephone number; date of 
birth; hair color; eye color; height; weight; social security number 
(optional) and signature of the applicant. The applicant

[[Page 244]]

must also provide two color passport- size photographs.
    (e) Fees. The Regional Director may charge a fee to recover the 
administrative expense of issuing a permit required under this section. 
The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of 
the NOAA Financial Handbook for determining the administrative costs of 
each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and 
is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must 
accompany each application; if it does not, the application will be 
considered incomplete for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Issuance. Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, 
the Regional Director shall issue an operator's permit within 30 days of 
receipt of a completed application, if the criteria specified in this 
section are met. Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed 
application, the Regional Director will notify the applicant of the 
deficiency in the application. If the applicant fails to correct the

a valid permit issued under this section.
    (b) Dealer application. Applicants for a permit under this section 
must submit a completed application on an appropriate form provided by 
the Regional Director. The application must be signed by the applicant 
and submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days before the date 
upon which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. For 
1994, a copy of an applicant's completed application will serve as a 
temporary permit until the applicant has received a permanent permit. 
The Regional Director will notify the applicant of any deficiency in the 
application, pursuant to this section.

Partnership Agreement and the names and addresses of all partners must 
be included with the application.
    (d) Fees. The Regional Director may charge a fee to recover the 
administrative expense of issuing a permit required under this section. 
The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of 
the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining the administrative costs of 
each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and 
is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must 
accompany each application; if it does not, the application will be 
considered incomplete for purposes of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Issuance. Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, 
the Regional Director will issue a permit at any time during the fishing 
year to an applicant, unless the applicant has failed to submit a 
completed application. An application is complete when all requested 
forms, information, and documentation have been received. Upon receipt 
of an incomplete or improperly executed application, the Regional 
Director will notify the applicant of the deficiency in the application. 
If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 days 
following the date of notification, the application will be considered 
abandoned.
    (f) Expiration. A Federal dealer permit will expire upon the renewal 
date specified in the permit.
    (g) Duration. A permit is valid until it is revoked, suspended, or 
modified under 15 CFR part 904, or otherwise expires, or ownership 
changes, or the applicant has failed to report any change in the

Sec. 649.8  Prohibitions.

    (a) In addition to the general prohibitions specified in Sec. 620.7 
of this chapter, it is unlawful for any person owning or operating a 
vessel issued a Federal American lobster permit under Sec. 649.4 to do 
any of the following:
    (1) Retain on board, land, or possess at or after landing, American

American lobsters unless the vessel is a party, charter, or dive boat 
and there are six or fewer American lobsters per person on such boats, 
and the lobsters are not sold, traded or bartered, or unless the vessel 
is a recreational vessel or a vessel fishing for American lobsters 
exclusively in state waters.
    (c) In addition to the general prohibitions specified in Sec. 620.7 
of this chapter and the prohibitions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section, it is unlawful for any person to do any of the 
following:
    (1) Possess on board a vessel or land American lobsters unless:
    (i) The American lobsters were harvested by a vessel that has been 
issued and carries on board a valid Federal American lobster permit 
under Sec. 649.4(a); or a valid limited access American lobster permit 
under Sec. 649.4(b); or
    (ii) The American lobsters were harvested by a vessel without a 
Federal American lobster permit and that fishes for American lobsters 
exclusively in state waters; or

[[Page 247]]

    (iii) The American lobsters were harvested by a party, charter, or 
dive vessel that possesses six or fewer American lobsters per person on 
board the vessel and the lobsters are not intended to be or are not 
traded, bartered, or sold; or
    (iv) The American lobsters were harvested by a recreational fishing 
vessel.
    (2) Sell, barter, or trade, or otherwise transfer, or attempt to 
sell, barter, or trade, or otherwise transfer, for a commercial purpose, 
any American lobsters from a vessel, unless the vessel has been issued a 
valid Federal American lobster permit under Sec. 649.4, or the American 
lobsters were harvested by a vessel without a Federal American lobster 
permit that fishes for American lobsters exclusively in state waters;
    (3) Purchase, possess, or receive for a commercial purpose, or 
attempt to purchase, possess, or receive for a commercial purpose, as, 
or in the capacity of, a dealer, American lobsters taken from or 
harvested by a fishing vessel issued a Federal American lobster permit, 
unless in possession of a valid dealer's permit issued under Sec. 649.6;
    (4) Purchase, possess, or receive for commercial purposes, or 
attempt to purchase or receive for commercial purposes, as, or in the 
capacity of, a dealer, American lobsters caught by a vessel other than 
one issued a valid Federal American lobster permit under Sec. 649.4, 
unless the American lobsters were harvested by a vessel without a 
Federal American lobster permit and that fishes for American lobsters 
exclusively in state waters;
    (5) Beginning January 1, 1995, to be, or act as, an operator of a 
vessel fishing for or possessing American lobsters in or from the EEZ, 
or issued a Federal American lobster permit under Sec. 649.4 (b), 
without having been issued and possessing a valid operator's permit 
issued under Sec. 649.5.
    (6) Assault, resist, oppose, impede, harass, intimidate, or

authorized officer conducting any search, inspection, investigation, or 
seizure in connection with enforcement of this part;
    (7) Make any false statement, oral or written, to an authorized 
officer, concerning the taking, catching, harvesting, landing, purchase, 
sale, or transfer of any American lobsters;
    (8) Violate any provision of this part, the Magnuson Act, or any 
regulation, permit, or notification issued under the Magnuson Act or 
these regulations;
    (9) Possess or land any American lobsters harvested in or from the 
EEZ in violation of Sec. 649.20; or
    (10) Ship, transport, offer for sale, sell, or purchase, in 
interstate or foreign commerce, any whole live American lobster in 
violation of Sec. 649.20.
    (d) Any person possessing, or landing American lobsters at or prior 
to the time when those American lobsters are landed, or are received or 
possessed by a dealer, is subject to all of the prohibitions specified 
in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, unless the American 
lobsters were harvested by a vessel without a Federal American lobster 
permit and that fishes for American lobsters exclusively in state 
waters; or are from a party, charter, or dive vessel that possesses or 
possessed six or fewer American lobsters per person aboard the vessel at 
any time and the lobsters are not intended for sale, trade, or barter; 
or are from a recreational vessel.
    (e) Presumption. American lobsters that are possessed, or landed at 
or prior to the time when the American lobsters are received by a 
dealer, or American lobsters that are possessed by a dealer, are 
presumed to be harvested from the EEZ or by a vessel with a Federal 
lobster permit. A preponderance of all submitted evidence that such 
American lobsters were harvested by a vessel without a Federal American 
lobster permit and fishing exclusively for American lobsters in state 
waters will be sufficient to rebut the presumption.
    (f) The possession of egg-bearing female American lobsters, V-
notched female American lobsters, or American lobsters that are smaller 
than the minimum size set forth in Sec. 649.20(b), will be prima facie 
evidence that such American lobsters were taken or imported in violation 
of these regulations. Evidence that such American lobsters were 
harvested by a vessel not holding a permit under this part and fishing 
exclusively within state or foreign waters

[[Page 248]]

will be sufficient to rebut the presumption.

    Subpart C--Stock Rebuilding Program and Framework Adjustments to 
                           Management Measures


<R05>
Sec. 649.41  Purpose and scope.

    The purpose of this subpart is to specify the requirements and 
framework procedures for implementing the Stock Rebuilding Program, 
intended to eliminate overfishing in any resource areas.


<R05>
Sec. 649.42  Stock rebuilding program requirements and time frame.

    (a) General. (1) The Council has until July 20, 1995 to submit to 
NMFS management measures to achieve the objectives of the FMP. The 
measures must be designed to achieve the FMP objectives for reducing 
fishing mortality within 5 years for the stock in the Gulf of Maine 
segment of the fishery and 10 years for the Southern New England segment 
of the stock. Such measures may be submitted through the Magnuson Act 
amendment process or through the first-year area management framework 
specifications in Sec. 649.43.
    (2) In developing such management measures, the Council shall submit 
management measures to reduce fishing mortality in each of four 
management areas specified in paragraph (b) of this section. These 
management measures shall be implemented according to the first-year 
area management framework specifications in Sec. 649.43.
    (3) If the Council has not submitted management measures sufficient 
to achieve the objectives of the FMP on or before July 20, 1995, the 
Secretary shall determine, according to provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1854(c), 
whether to prepare an amendment to the FMP.
    (b) Management areas. The Stock Rebuilding Program to be submitted 
by the Council shall be developed based on the status of stock of 
American lobsters and management considerations for each of the areas 
described and defined in this paragraph (b) (see Figures 2 and 3 of this 
part).
    (1) Area 1. Near-shore EEZ Waters of the Gulf of Maine. This area is 
defined by the area bounded by straight lines (rhumb lines) connecting 
the following points, in the order stated, and the territorial sea:

    (c) Effort Management Teams (EMT). (1) The Council shall establish 
EMTs for each area specified in paragraph (b) of this section, for the 
purpose of making recommendations to the Council on management measures 
to achieve the objectives of the FMP.
    (2) Members of each EMT shall be appointed by the Council, in 
consultation with appropriate states and NMFS. Members of the EMT shall 
consist of a group of technical representatives that serve on each EMT 
and a group of representatives from the lobster industry, based on their 
geographical affiliation with an EMT. The Council may decide the number 
of representatives and operating procedures of the EMTs.
    (3) No later than January 20, 1995, each EMT shall report its 
recommendations for management measures for the stock rebuilding program 
for the area it represents to the Council.


<R05>
Sec. 649.43  First year framework specifications.

    (a) On or before January 20, 1995, each EMT shall submit its 
recommendations for management measures for the area it represents to 
the Council. In developing these recommendations, the EMTs may consider 
and recommend additional restrictions or limitations on vessels 
participating in the lobster fishery according to the categories and 
guidelines contained in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) After receiving the recommendations of the EMTs, the Council 
shall determine what management measures are necessary for each 
management area, in order to achieve the objectives of stock rebuilding 
specified in the FMP. For the management measures the Council determines 
are necessary to meet FMP objectives, the Council shall provide 
appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis of the 
determinations. The Council shall make these determinations over the 
span of at least two Council meetings and provide the public with 
advance notice of, and opportunity to comment on, the determinations and 
the analyses before making final recommendations to be submitted to 
NMFS. The Council's recommendation on necessary management measures may 
come from one or more of the following categories:
    (1) Minimum-size changes;
    (2) A maximum-size limit;
    (3) Trap limits;
    (4) Seasonal closures of one or more management areas;
    (5) Closed areas or zones within a management area;
    (6) Restrictions on allowable fishing time;
    (7) Restrictions on allowable catches;
    (8) Permitting restrictions;
    (9) Additional restrictions on gear;
    (10) Overfishing definition;
    (11) Limitations on participation in the fishery in accordance with 
the control date guidelines listed below. These guidelines will apply 
until a stock rebuilding program is established.
    (i) It is the intent of the Council that in the event that a system 
of assigning fishing rights is developed as part of the FMP, such 
assignments shall be based upon historical levels of participation in 
the fishery prior to March 25, 1991, with consideration for recent 
investments that have not yet been reflected in measures of 
participation.
    (ii) New or re-rigged vessels will be given consideration in the 
assignment of fishing rights if:
    (A) They were under construction or re-rigging for directed lobster 
fishing as of March 25, 1991, as evidenced by written construction 
contracts, work orders, equipment purchases, or other evidence of 
substantial investment and

[[Page 252]]

intent to participate in the lobster fishery; and
    (B) They possessed an American lobster permit and landed lobster 
prior to March 25, 1992.
    (iii) The public is further notified that it is the intent of the 
Council that historical participation will transfer with a vessel, for 
transfers made after March 25, 1991, unless such transfer is accompanied 
by a written document indication the agreement of both buyer and seller 
that any future fishing rights applicable to that vessel are not being 
transferred with the vessel.
    (iv) The Council further intends that any system of assigning 
fishing rights will take into consideration the following concerns 
relative to individuals or corporations that have sold a vessel within 
the time that may be chosen to determine historical fishing rights:
    (A) The degree of economic dependence upon the lobster fishery 
including, but not limited to, the percentage of income derived from the 
lobster fishery;
    (B) Extent of past participation in the lobster fishery; and
    (C) Demonstration of intent prior to March 25, 1991, to re-enter the 
lobster fishery with a different vessel.
    (12) Any other restrictions that the Council may designate for the 
purpose of reducing or controlling fishing mortality rates, except that 
an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system would require a full FMP 
amendment.
    (c) After developing necessary management measures and receiving 
public testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation to the 
Regional Director on or before July 20, 1995. The Council's 
recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if management 
measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and a recommendation 
to the Regional Director on whether to publish the management measures 
as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management measures 
should be published as a final rule, the Council must consider at least 
the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor 
considered:
    (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Council's recommended management measures;
    (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; and
    (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted, following their promulgation as a final rule.
    (d) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or 
additions to management measures, after reviewing the Council's 
recommendation and supporting information:
    (1) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended 
management measures and determines that the recommended management 
measures may be published as a final rule, based on the factors 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the action will be published 
in the Federal Register as a final rule; or
    (2) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, the action will be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if the Regional Director concurs with the Council 
recommendation, the action will be published as a final rule in the 
Federal Register; or
    (3) If the Regional Director does not concur, the Council will be 
notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (e) At any time, the Council may make other adjustments to 
management measures implemented under this part pursuant to the 
provisions in Sec. 649.44.
    (f) Nothing in this section is meant to diminish the authority of 
the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of the 
Magnuson Act.

[[Page 253]]


<R05>
Sec. 649.44  Framework specifications after the first year of implementation.

    (a) Annually, upon request from the Council, the Regional Director 
will provide the Council with information of the status of the American 
lobster resource, based on the most recent stock assessment report.
    (b) The Council and Atlantic States Fisheries Commission, through 
consultation with the ASMFC Lobster Scientific Committee within the 
stock assessment process and with the EMTs, shall continue to monitor 
the effectiveness of the Stock Rebuilding Program and to ensure, to the 
extent possible, that regional measures (within a Management Area) do 
not shift costs from one Management Area to another.
    (c) In addition, the EMTs, on at least an annual basis, shall 
determine the extent to which the objectives of the FMP are being 
achieved and shall make recommendations to the Council for further 
management actions, if required.
    (d) After receiving the EMT recommendations, the Council shall 
determine whether adjustments to, or additional management measures are 
necessary to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP. After considering 
the EMT's recommendations, or at any other time, if the Council 
determines that adjustments to, or additional management measures are 
necessary, it shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions 
over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council shall 
provide the appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis 
for its recommendation, utilizing the most current catch, effort, and 
other relevant data from the fishery. The Council shall provide the 
public with advance notice of the availability of both the proposals and 
the analyses, and opportunity to comment on them prior to, and at, the 
second Council meeting. The Council's recommendation on adjustments or 
additions to management measures may come from one or more of the 
following categories:
    (1) Minimum-size changes;
    (2) A maximum-size limit;
    (3) Trap limits;
    (4) Seasonal closures of one or more management areas;
    (5) Closed areas or zones within a management area;
    (6) Restrictions on allowable fishing time;
    (7) Restrictions on allowable catches;
    (8) Permitting restrictions;
    (9) Additional restrictions on gear;
    (10) Overfishing definition;
    (11) Limitations on participation in the fishery in accordance with 
the control date guidelines contained in Sec. 649.44(b)(11). These 
guidelines will apply until a stock rebuilding program is established.
    (12) Any other restrictions which the Council may designate for the 
purpose of reducing or controlling fishing mortality rates, except that 
an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system would require a full FMP 
amendment.
    (e) After developing management actions and receiving public 
testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Director. The Council's recommendation must include supporting rationale 
and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and 
a recommendation to the Regional Director on whether to publish the 
management measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the 
management measures should be published as a final rule, the Council 
must consider at least the following factors and provide support and 
analysis for each factor considered:
    (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Council's recommended management measures;
    (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; and
    (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted, following their promulgation as a final rule.

[[Page 254]]

    (f) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or 
additions to management measures, after reviewing the Council's 
recommendation and supporting information:
    (1) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended 
management measures and determines that the recommended management 
measures may be published as a final rule, based on the factors 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the action will be published 
in the Federal Register as a final rule; or
    (2) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, the action will be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if the Regional Director concurs with the Council 
recommendation, the action will be published as a final rule in the 
Federal Register; or
    (3) If the Regional Director does not concur, the Council will be 
notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (g) Nothing in this section shall impair the authority of the 
Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of the Magnuson 
Act.

    (ii) The extension authorization must be carried aboard the fishing 
vessel. The operator of a fishing vessel must present the authorization 
for inspection upon request of an authorized officer.
    (c) Possession of stone crab traps. A stone crab trap may not be 
possessed in the management area from the end of the trap removal 
period, or an extension thereto, to the beginning of the trap soak 
period, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. A stone crab 
trap, float, or rope in the management area during this period will be 
considered unclaimed or abandoned property and may be disposed of in any 
manner considered appropriate by the Assistant Administrator or an 
authorized officer. An owner of such trap, float, or rope remains 
subject to appropriate civil penalties.


<R05>
Sec. 654.21  Harvest limitations.

    (a) Claw size. No person may remove from a stone crab in or from the 
management area, or possess in the management area, a claw with a 
propodus measuring less than 2.75 inches (7.0 cm), measured in a 
straight line from the elbow to the tip of the lower immovable finger. 
The propodus is the largest section of the claw assembly that has both a 
movable and immovable finger and is located farthest from the body when 
the entire appendage is extended. (See Appendix A, Figure 1, of this 
part.)
    (b) Egg-bearing stone crabs. An egg-bearing stone crab in or from 
the management area must be returned immediately to the water unharmed--
without removal of a claw. An egg-bearing stone crab may not be stripped 
of its eggs or otherwise molested.
    (c) Holding stone crabs. A live stone crab in or from the management 
area may be held aboard a vessel until such time as a legal-sized claw 
is removed, provided it is held in a container that is shaded from 
direct sunlight and it is wet with sea water as necessary to keep it in 
a damp condition. Containers holding stone crabs must be stacked in a 
manner that does not compress the crabs. A stone crab body from which a 
legal-sized claw has been removed must be returned to the sea before the 
vessel reaches shore or a port or dock.


<R05>
Sec. 654.22  Gear restrictions.

    (a) Biodegradable panels. A stone crab trap used or possessed in the 
management area must have a panel constructed of wood or cotton and 
located on a side of the trap at least two slats above the bottom, or on 
the top of the trap, which, when removed, will leave an opening in the 
trap measuring at least 2.5 inches by 5 inches (6.35 cm by 12.7 cm).
    (b) Daylight hours. A stone crab trap in the management area may be 
pulled or tended during daylight hours only--that is, from 1 hour before 
sunrise to 1 hour after sunset.
    (c) Gear belonging to others. No fisherman may willfully tend, open, 
pull, or

[[Page 261]]

otherwise molest another fisherman's trap, buoy, or line in the 
management area without the prior written consent of that fisherman.


<R05>
Sec. 654.23  Southwest Florida seasonal trawl closure.

    From January 1 to 1 hour after sunset (local time) May 20, each 
year, the area described in this section is closed to trawling, 
including trawling for live bait. The area is that part of the 
management area shoreward of a line connecting the following points (see 
Appendix A, Figure 2, of this part):

Sec. 654.24  Shrimp/stone crab separation zones.

    Five zones are established in the management area and Florida's 
waters off Citrus and Hernando Counties for the separation of shrimp 
trawling and stone crab trapping. The zones are as shown in Appendix A, 
Figure 3, of this part. Although Zone II is entirely within Florida's 
waters, it is included in this section and Appendix A, Figure 3, of this 
part for the convenience of fishermen. Restrictions that apply to Zone 
II and those parts of the other zones that are in Florida's waters are 
contained in Rule 46-38.001, Florida Administrative Code. Geographical 
coordinates of the points referred to in this paragraph and shown in 
Appendix A, Figure 3, of this part are as follows (loran readings are

    (b) Observers. No experimental fishing for crustacean management 
unit species may be conducted unless an NMFS scientific observer is 
aboard the vessel.
    (c) Application. An applicant for an EFP must submit to the Regional 
Director at least 60 days before the desired date of the EFP a written 
application including, but not limited to, the following information:
    (1) The date of the application.
    (2) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.
    (3) A statement of the purposes and goals of the experiment for 
which an EFP is needed, including a general description of the 
arrangements for disposition of all species harvested under the EFP.
    (4) A statement of whether the proposed experimental fishing has 
broader significance than the applicant's individual goals.
    (5) For each vessel to be covered by the EFP:
    (i) Vessel name.
    (ii) Name, address, and telephone number of owner and operator.
    (iii) USCG documentation, state license, or registration number.

appear in support of the application, if the applicant desires.
    (3) Within 5 working days after the consultation in paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section, or as soon as practicable thereafter, NMFS will notify 
the applicant in writing of the decision to grant or deny the EFP and, 
if denied, the reasons for the denial. Grounds for denial of an EFP 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) The applicant has failed to disclose material information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with his or her application.
    (ii) According to the best scientific information available, the 
harvest to be conducted under the permit would detrimentally affect any 
species of fish in a significant way.
    (iii) Issuance of the EFP would inequitably allocate fishing 
privileges among domestic fishermen or would have economic allocation as 
its sole purpose.
    (iv) Activities to be conducted under the EFP would be inconsistent 
with the intent of this section or the management objectives of the FMP.
    (v) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit.
    (vi) The activity proposed under the EFP would create a significant 
enforcement problem.
    (4) The decision to grant or deny an EFP is final and unappealable. 
If the permit is granted, NMFS will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register describing the experimental fishing to be conducted under the 
EFP. The Regional Director may attach terms and conditions to the EFP 
consistent with the purpose of the experiment including, but not limited 
to:
    (i) The maximum amount of each species that can be harvested and 
landed during the term of the EFP, including trip limits, where 
appropriate.
    (ii) The number, sizes, names, and identification numbers of the 
vessels authorized to conduct fishing activities under the EFP.

under an EFP.
    (vi) Data reporting requirements.
    (vii) Such other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance 
with the purposes of the EFP consistent with the objectives of the FMP.
    (f) Duration. Unless otherwise specified in the EFP or a superseding 
notice or regulation, an EFP is effective for no longer than 1 year, 
unless revoked, suspended, or modified. EFPs may be renewed following 
the application procedures in this section.
    (g) Alteration. Any EFP that has been altered, erased, or mutilated 
is invalid.
    (h) Transfer. EFPs issued under subparts B through F of this part 
are not transferable or assignable. An EFP is valid only for the 
vessel(s) for which it is issued.
    (i) Inspection. Any EFP issued under subparts B through F of this 
part must be carried aboard the vessel(s) for which it was issued. The 
EFP must be presented for inspection upon request of any authorized 
officer.
    (j) Sanctions. Failure of the holder of an EFP to comply with the 
terms and conditions of an EFP, the provisions of subparts A through F 
of this part, any other applicable provision of this part,

[[Page 276]]

the Magnuson Act, or any other regulation promulgated thereunder, is 
grounds for revocation, suspension, or modification of the EFP with 
respect to all persons and vessels conducting activities under the EFP. 
Any action taken to revoke, suspend, or modify an EFP will be governed 
by 15 CFR part 904 subpart D. Other sanctions available under the 
statute will be applicable.
    (k) Protected species. Persons fishing under an EFP must report any 
incidental take or fisheries interaction with protected species on a 
form provided for that purpose. Reports must be submitted to the 
Regional Director within 3 days of arriving in port.

Sec. 660.23  Notifications.

    (a) The permit holder for a fishing vessel subject to the 
requirements of this subpart, or an agent designated by the permit 
holder, shall provide a notice to the Regional Director at least 72 
hours (not including weekends and Federal holidays) before the vessel 
leaves port on a fishing trip, any part of which occurs in the EEZ 
around Hawaii. The vessel operator will be presumed to be an agent 
designated by the permit holder unless the Regional Director is 
otherwise notified by the permit holder. The notice must be provided to 
the office or telephone number designated by the Regional Director. The 
notice must provide the official number of the vessel, the name of the 
vessel, the intended departure date, time, and location, the name of the 
operator of the vessel, and the name and telephone number of the agent 
designated by the permit holder to be available between 8:00 a.m. to 5 
p.m. (Hawaii time) on weekdays for NMFS to contact to arrange observer 
placement.
    (b) The operator of any vessel subject to the requirements of this 
subpart who does not have on board a VMS unit while transiting the 
protected species

[[Page 279]]

zone as defined in Sec. 660.12, must notify the NMFS Southwest 
Enforcement Office (see part 600 for address of Regional Director) 
immediately upon entering and immediately upon departing the protected 
species zone. The notification must include the name of the vessel, name 
of the operator, date and time (GMT) of access or exit from the 
protected species zone, and location by latitude and longitude to the 
nearest minute.


<R05>
Sec. 660.24  Gear identification.

    (a) Identification. The operator of each permitted vessel in the 
fishery management area must ensure that the official number of the 
vessel be affixed to every longline buoy and float, including each buoy 
and float that is attached to a radar reflector, radio antenna, or flag 
marker, whether attached to a deployed longline or possessed on board 
the vessel. Markings must be legible and permanent, and must be of a 
color that contrasts with the background material.
    (b) Enforcement action. Longline gear not marked in compliance with 
paragraph (a) of this section and found deployed in the EEZ will be 
considered unclaimed or abandoned property, and may be disposed of in 
any manner considered appropriate by NMFS or an authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 660.25  Vessel monitoring system.

    (a) VMS unit. Only a VMS unit owned by NMFS and installed by NMFS 
complies with the requirement of this subpart.
    (b) Notification. After a Hawaii longline limited access permit 
holder has been notified by the SAC of a specific date for installation 
of a VMS unit in the permit holder's vessel, the vessel must carry the 
VMS unit after the date scheduled for installation.
    (c) Fees and charges. During the experimental VMS program, a Hawaii 
longline limited access permit holder shall not be assessed any fee or 
other charges to obtain and use a VMS unit, including the communication 
charges related directly to requirements under this section. 
Communication charges related to any additional equipment attached to 
the VMS unit by the owner or operator shall be the responsibility of the 
owner or operator and not NMFS.
    (d) Permit holder duties. The holder of a Hawaii longline limited 
access permit and the master of the vessel operating under the permit 
must:
    (1) Provide opportunity for the SAC to install and make operational 
a VMS unit after notification.
    (2) Carry the VMS unit on board whenever the vessel is at sea.
    (3) Not remove or relocate the VMS unit without prior approval from 
the SAC.
    (e) Authorization by the SAC. The SAC has authority over the 
installation and operation of the VMS unit. The SAC may authorize the 
connection or order the disconnection of additional equipment, including 
a computer, to any VMS unit when deemed appropriate by the SAC.

<R05>
Sec. 660.27  Exemptions for longline fishing prohibited areas; procedures.

    (a) An exemption permitting a person to use longline gear to fish in 
a portion(s) of the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area will be 
issued to a person who can document that he or she:
    (1) Currently owns a Hawaii longline limited access permit issued 
under this part and registered for use with his or her vessel.
    (2) Before 1970, was the owner or operator of a vessel when that 
vessel landed Pacific pelagic management unit species taken on longline 
gear in an area that is now within the Hawaii longline fishing 
prohibited area.
    (3) Was the owner or operator of a vessel that landed Pacific 
pelagic management unit species taken on longline gear in an area that 
is now within the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area, in at least 5 
calendar years after 1969, which need not be consecutive.
    (4) In any one of the 5 calendar years, was the owner or operator of 
a vessel that harvested at least 80 percent of its total landings, by 
weight, of longline-caught Pacific pelagic management unit species in an 
area that is now in the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area.
    (b) Each exemption shall specify the portion(s) of the Hawaii 
longline fishing prohibited area, bounded by longitudinal and 
latitudinal lines drawn to include each statistical area, as appearing 
on Hawaii State Commercial Fisheries Charts, in which the exemption 
holder made the harvest documented for the exemption application under 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (c) Each exemption is valid only within the portion(s) of the Hawaii 
longline fishing prohibited area specified on the exemption.
    (d) A person seeking an exemption under this section must submit an 
application and supporting documentation to the Pacific Area Office at 
least 15 days before the desired effective date of the exemption.
    (e) If the Regional Director determines that a gear conflict has 
occurred and is likely to occur again in the Hawaii longline fishing 
prohibited area between a vessel used by a person holding an exemption 
under this section and a non-longline vessel, the Regional Director may 
prohibit all longline fishing in the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited 
area around the island where the conflict occurred, or in portions 
thereof, upon notice to each holder of an exemption who would be 
affected by such a prohibition.
    (f) The Council will consider information provided by persons with 
Hawaii longline limited access permits issued under this part who 
believe they have experienced extreme financial hardship resulting from 
the Hawaii longline area closure, and will consider recommendations of 
the Pelagic Advisory Review Board to assess whether exemptions under 
this section should continue to be allowed, and, if appropriate, revise 
the qualifying criteria in paragraph (a)

[[Page 281]]

of this section to permit additional exemptions.
    (1) If additional exemptions are needed, the Council will advise the 
Regional Director in writing of its recommendation, including criteria 
by which financial hardships will be mitigated, while retaining the 
effectiveness of the longline fishing prohibited area.
    (2) Following a review of the Council's recommendation and 
supporting rationale, the Regional Director may:
    (i) Reject the Council's recommendation, in which case written 
reasons will be provided by the Regional Director to the Council for the 
rejection; or
    (ii) Concur with the Council's recommendation and, after finding 
that it is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Pelagics FMP, 
the national standards, and other applicable law, initiate rulemaking to 
implement the Council's recommendations.


<R05>
Sec. 660.28  Conditions for at-sea observer coverage.

    (a) NMFS shall advise the permit holder or the designated agent of 
any observer requirement at least 24 hours (not including weekends and 
Federal holidays) before any trip for which NMFS received timely notice 
in compliance with these regulations.
    (b) The ``Notice Prior to Fishing Trip'' requirements in this 
subpart commit the permit holder to the representations in the notice. 
The notice can be modified by the permit holder or designated agent 
because of changed circumstance, if the Regional Director is promptly 
provided a modification to the notice that complies with the notice 
requirements. The notice will also be considered modified if the 
Regional Director and the permit holder or designated agent agree to 
placement changes.
    (c) When NMFS notifies the permit holder or designated agent of the 
obligation to carry an observer in response to a notification under this 
subpart, or as a condition of an EFP issued under Sec. 660.17, the 
vessel may not engage in the fishery without taking the observer.
    (d) A NMFS observer shall arrive at the observer's assigned vessel 
30 minutes before the time designated for departure in the notice or the 
notice as modified, and will wait 1 hour for departure.
    (e) A permit holder must accommodate a NMFS observer assigned under 
these regulations. The Regional Director's office, and not the observer, 
will address any concerns raised over accommodations.
    (f) The permit holder, vessel operator, and crew must cooperate with 
the observer in the performance of the observer's duties, including:
    (1) Allowing for the embarking and debarking of the observer.
    (2) Allowing the observer access to all areas of the vessel 
necessary to conduct observer duties.
    (3) Allowing the observer access to communications equipment and 
navigation equipment as necessary to perform observer duties.
    (4) Allowing the observer access to VMS units to verify operation, 
obtain data, and use the communication capabilities of the units for 
official purposes.
    (5) Providing accurate vessel locations by latitude and longitude or 
loran coordinates, upon request by the observer.
    (6) Providing sea turtle, marine mammal, or sea bird specimens as 
requested.
    (7) Notifying the observer in a timely fashion when commercial 
fishing operations are to begin and end.
    (g) The permit holder, operator, and crew must comply with other 
terms and conditions to ensure the effective deployment and use of 
observers that the Regional Director imposes by written notice.
    (h) The permit holder must ensure that assigned observers are 
provided living quarters comparable to crew members and are provided the 
same meals, snacks, and amenities as are normally provided to other 
vessel personnel. A mattress or futon on the floor or a cot is not 
acceptable if a regular bunk is provided to any crew member, unless 
other arrangements are approved in advance by the Regional Director.
    (i) Reimbursement requirements are as follows:
    (1) Upon observer verification of vessel accommodations and the 
number of

[[Page 282]]

assigned days on board, NMFS will reimburse vessel owners a reasonable 
amount for observer subsistence as determined by the Regional Director.
    (2) If requested and properly documented, NMFS will reimburse the 
vessel owner for the following:
    (i) Communications charges incurred by the observer.
    (ii) Lost fishing time arising from a seriously injured or seriously 
ill observer, provided that notification of the nature of the emergency 
is transmitted to the Fisheries Observer Branch, Southwest Region, NMFS 
(see address for Southwest Regional Director) at the earliest practical 
time. NMFS will reimburse the owner only for those days during which the 
vessel is unable to fish as a direct result of helping the NMFS employee 
who is seriously injured or seriously ill. Lost fishing time is based on 
time travelling to and from the fishing grounds and any documented out-
of-pocket expenses for medical services. Payment will be based on the 
current target fish market prices and that vessel's average target fish 
catch retained per day at sea for the previous 2 years, but shall not 
exceed $5,000 per day or $20,000 per claim. Detailed billing with 
receipts and supporting records are required for allowable communication 
and lost fishing time claims. The claim must be completed in ink, 
showing the claimant's printed name, address, vessel name, observer 
name, trip dates, days observer on board, an explanation of the charges, 
and claimant's dated signature with a statement verifying the claim to 
be true and correct. Requested reimbursement claims must be submitted to 
the Fisheries Observer Branch, Southwest Region, NMFS. NMFS will not 
process reimbursement invoices and documentation submitted more than 120 
days after the occurrence.
    (j) If a vessel normally has cabins for crew members, female 
observers on a vessel with an all-male crew must be accommodated either 
in a single person cabin or, if NMFS concludes that adequate privacy can 
be ensured by installing a curtain or other temporary divider, in a two-
person shared cabin. If the vessel normally does not have cabins for 
crew members, alternative accommodations must be approved by NMFS. If a 
cabin assigned to a female observer does not have its own toilet and 
shower facilities that can be provided for the exclusive use of the 
observer, or if no cabin is assigned, then arrangements for sharing 
common facilities must be established and approved in advance by NMFS.


<R05>
Sec. 660.29  Port privileges and transiting for unpermitted U.S. longline vessels.

    A U.S. longline fishing vessel that does not have a permit under 
subpart B of this part may enter waters of the fishery management area 
with Pacific pelagic management unit species on board, but may not land 
or transship any management unit species on board the vessel. The 
vessel's longline gear must be stowed or secured so it is rendered 
unusable during the time the vessel is in those waters.


<R05>
Sec. 660.30  Prohibition of drift gillnetting.

    Fishing with drift gillnets in the fishery management area is 
prohibited, except where authorized by an EFP issued under Sec. 660.17.


<R05>
Sec. 660.31  Framework adjustments to management measures.

    (a) Introduction. Adjustments in management measures may be made 
through rulemaking if new information demonstrates that there are 
biological, social, or economic concerns in the fishery. The following 
framework process authorizes the implementation of measures that may 
affect the operation of the fisheries, gear, harvest guidelines, or 
changes in catch and/or effort.
    (b) Annual report. By June 30 of each year, the Council-appointed 
Pelagics Plan Team will prepare an annual report on the fisheries in the 
management area. The report shall contain, among other things, 
recommendations for Council action and an assessment of the urgency and 
effects of such action(s).
    (c) Procedure for established measures. (1) Established measures are 
management measures that, at some time, have been included in 
regulations implementing the FMP, and for which the impacts have been 
evaluated in Council/NMFS documents in the context of current 
conditions.

[[Page 283]]

    (2) Following the framework procedures of Amendment 7 to the 
Pelagics FMP, the Council may recommend to the Regional Director that 
established measures be modified, removed, or re-instituted. Such 
recommendation shall include supporting rationale and analysis, and 
shall be made after advance public notice, public discussion, and 
consideration of public comment. NMFS may implement the Council's 
recommendation by rulemaking if approved by the Regional Director.
    (d) Procedure for new measures. (1) New measures are management 
measures that have not been included in regulations implementing the 
FMP, or for which the impacts have not been evaluated in Council/NMFS 
documents in the context of current conditions.
    (2) Following the framework procedures of Amendment 7 to the 
Pelagics FMP, the Council will publicize, including by Federal Register 
notice, and solicit public comment on, any proposed new management 
measure. After a Council meeting at which the measure is discussed, the 
Council will consider recommendations and prepare a Federal Register 
notice summarizing the Council's deliberations, rationale, and analysis 
for the preferred action, and the time and place for any subsequent 
Council meeting(s) to consider the new measure. At subsequent public 
meeting(s), the Council will consider public comments and other 
information received to make a recommendation to the Regional Director 
about any new measure. NMFS may implement the Council's recommendation 
by rulemaking if approved by the Regional Director.

             Subpart D--Western Pacific Crustacean Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 660.41  Permits.

    (a) Applicability. (1) The owner of any vessel used to fish for 
lobster in Permit Area 1 must have a limited access permit issued for 
such vessel. Only one permit will be assigned to any vessel.
    (2) The owner of any vessel used to fish for lobster in Permit Area 
2 or Permit Area 3, must have a permit issued for such a vessel.
    (3) No vessel owner will have permits for a single vessel to harvest 
lobsters in Permit Areas 1 and 2 at the same time.
    (4) A limited access permit is valid for fishing only in Permit Area 
1.
    (b) General requirements. General requirements governing application 
information, issuance, fees, expiration, replacement, transfer, 
alteration, display, sanctions, and appeals for permits issued under 
this section, as applicable, are contained in Sec. 660.13.
    (c) Application. An application for a permit required under this 
section will be submitted to the Pacific Area Office as described in 
Sec. 660.13. If the application for a limited access permit is submitted 
on behalf of a partnership or corporation, the application must be 
accompanied by a supplementary information sheet obtained from the 
Pacific Area Office and contain the names and mailing addresses of all 
partners or shareholders and their respective percentage of ownership in 
the partnership or corporation.
    (d) Number of permits. A maximum of 15 limited access permits can be 
valid at any time.
    (e) Transfer or sale of limited access permits. (1) Permits may be 
transferred or sold, but no one individual, partnership, or corporation 
will be allowed to hold a whole or partial interest in more than one 
permit, except that an owner who qualifies initially for more than one 
permit may maintain those permits, but may not obtain additional 
permits. Layering of partnerships or corporations shall not insulate a 
permit holder from this requirement.
    (2) If 50 percent or more of the ownership of a limited access 
permit is passed to persons other than those listed on the permit 
application, the Pacific Area Office must be notified of the change in 
writing and provided copies of the appropriate documents confirming the 
changes within 30 days.
    (3) Upon the transfer or sale of a limited access permit, a new 
application must be submitted by the new permit owner according to the 
requirements of Sec. 660.13. The transferred permit is not valid until 
this process is completed.
    (f) Replacement of a vessel covered by a limited access permit. A 
limited access permit issued under this section may, without limitation 
as to frequency, be transferred by the permit holder to a

[[Page 284]]

replacement vessel owned by that person.
    (g) Issuance of limited access permits to future applicants.
    (1) The Regional Director may issue limited access permits under 
this section when fewer than 15 vessel owners hold active permits.
    (2) When the Regional Director has determined that limited access 
permits may be issued to new persons, a notice shall be placed in the 
Federal Register, and other means will be used to notify prospective 
applicants of the opportunity to obtain permits under the limited access 
management program.
    (3) A period of 90 days will be provided after publication of the 
Federal Register notice for submission of new applications for a limited 
access permit.
    (4) Limited access permits issued under this paragraph (g) will be 
issued first to applicants qualifying under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this 
section. If the number of limited access permits available is greater 
than the number of applicants that qualify under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of 
this section, then limited access permits will be issued to applicants 
under paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (i) First priority to receive limited access permits under this 
paragraph (g) goes to owners of vessels that were used to land lobster 
from Permit Area 1 during the period 1983 through 1990, and who were 
excluded from the fishery by implementation of the limited access 
system. If there are insufficient permits for all such applicants, the 
new permits shall be issued by the Regional Director through a lottery.
    (ii) Second priority to receive limited access permits under 
paragraph (g) goes to owners with the most points, based upon a point 
system. If two or more owners have the same number of points and there 
are insufficient permits for all such owners, the Regional Director 
shall issue the permits through a lottery. Under the point system, 
limited access permits will be issued, in descending order, beginning 
with owners who have the most points and proceeding to owners who have 
the least points, based on the following:
    (A) Three points shall be assigned for each calendar year after 
August 8, 1985, that the applicant was the operator of a vessel that was 
used to land lobster from Permit Area 1.
    (B) Two points shall be assigned for each calendar year or partial 
year after August 8, 1985, that the applicant was the owner, operator, 
or crew member of a vessel engaged in either commercial fishing in 
Permit Area 2 for lobster, or fishing in Permit Area 1 for fish other 
than lobster with an intention to sell all or part of the catch.
    (C) One point shall be assigned for each calendar year or partial 
year after August 8, 1985, that the applicant was the owner, operator, 
or crew member of a vessel engaged in any other commercial fishing in 
the EEZ surrounding Hawaii.
    (5) A holder of a new limited access permit must own at least a 50-
percent share in the vessel that the permit would cover.


<R05>
Sec. 660.42  Prohibitions.

    In addition to the general prohibitions specified in Sec. 600.725 of 
this chapter and Sec. 660.16, it is unlawful for any person to do any of 
the following:

<R05>
Sec. 660.53   Framework procedures.

    (a) Introduction. New management measures may be added through 
rulemaking if new information demonstrates that there are biological, 
social, or economic concerns in Permit Areas 1, 2, or 3. The following 
framework process authorizes the implementation of measures that may 
affect the operation of the fisheries, gear, harvest guidelines, or 
changes in catch and/or effort.
    (b) Annual report. By June 30 of each year, the Council-appointed 
Crustaceans Plan Team will prepare an annual report on the fisheries in 
the management area. The report shall contain, among other things, 
recommendations for Council action and an assessment of the urgency and 
effects of such action(s).
    (c) Procedure for established measures. (1) Established measures are 
management measures that, at some time, have been included in 
regulations implementing the FMP, and for which the impacts have been 
evaluated in Council/NMFS documents in the context of current 
conditions.
    (2) Following the framework procedures of Amendment 9 to the FMP, 
the Council may recommend to the Regional Director that established 
measures be modified, removed, or re-instituted. Such recommendation 
shall include supporting rationale and analysis, and shall be made after 
advance public notice, public discussion, and consideration of public 
comment. NMFS may implement the Council's recommendation by rulemaking 
if approved by the Regional Director.
    (d) Procedure for New Measures. (1) New measures are management 
measures that have not been included in regulations implementing the 
FMP, or for which the impacts have not been

[[Page 289]]

evaluated in Council/NMFS documents in the context of current 
conditions.
    (2) Following the framework procedures of Amendment 9 to the FMP, 
the Council will publicize, including by a Federal Register document, 
and solicit public comment on, any proposed new management measure. 
After a Council meeting at which the measure is discussed, the Council 
will consider recommendations and prepare a Federal Register document 
summarizing the Council's deliberations, rationale, and analysis for the 
preferred action, and the time and place for any subsequent Council 
meeting(s) to consider the new measure. At subsequent public meeting(s), 
the Council will consider public comments and other information received 
to make a recommendation to the Regional Director about any new measure. 
NMFS may implement the Council's recommendation by rulemaking if 
approved by the Regional Director.


<R05>
Sec. 660.54   Five-year review.

    The Council, in cooperation with NMFS, will conduct a review of the 
effectiveness and impacts of the NWHI management program, including 
biological, economic, and social aspects of the fishery, by July 1, 
2001.


<R04>
         Subpart E--Bottomfish and Seamount Groundfish Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 660.61   Permits.

    (a) Applicability. (1) The owner of any vessel being used to fish 
for bottomfish or seamount groundfish species in the management area 
must have a permit issued under this section for that vessel.
    (2) No vessel owner may have permits for a single vessel to harvest 
bottomfish in the Ho'omalu Zone and the Mau Zone at the same time.
    (b) Application. (1) An application for a permit required under this 
section will be submitted to the Pacific Area Office as described in 
Sec. 660.13.
    (2) Before the Regional Director issues a Mau Zone or Ho'omalu zone 
permit to fish for bottomfish under this section, the primary operator 
and relief operator named on the application form must have completed a 
protected species workshop conducted by NMFS.
    (3) Each applicant for a Ho'omalu zone permit will submit a 
supplementary information sheet to be provided by the Pacific Area 
Office. Each application for a Ho'omalu zone permit will be signed by 
the vessel owner or a designee and include the following information:
    (i) The qualification criterion that the applicant believes he or 
she meets for issuance of a limited access permit; and
    (ii) Copies of landings receipts or other documentation, with a 
certification from a state or Federal agency that this information is 
accurate, to demonstrate participation in the NWHI bottomfish fishery; 
or
    (iii) If the application is filed by a partnership or corporation, 
the application must identify the names of the owners and their 
respective percentage of ownership of the partnership or corporation.
    (c) Sale or transfer of Ho'omalu Zone permits to new vessel owners. 
(1) A Ho'omalu zone permit shall not be sold or otherwise transferred to 
a new owner.
    (2) A Ho'omalu zone permit or permits may be held by a partnership 
or corporation. If 50 percent or more of the ownership of the vessel 
passes to persons other than those listed in the original application, 
the permit will lapse and must be surrendered to the Regional Director.
    (d) Transfer of permits to replacement vessels. (1) An owner of a 
permitted vessel may, without limitation, transfer his or her permit to 
another vessel owned by him or her, provided that the replacement vessel 
does not exceed 60 ft (18.3 m) in length and that the replacement vessel 
is put into service within 12 months after the owner declares to the 
Regional Director the intent to make the transfer of the permit.
    (2) An owner of a permitted vessel may apply to the Regional 
Director for approval to use the permit for a replacement vessel greater 
than 60 ft (18.3 m) in length. The Regional Director may allow this 
change upon determining, after consultation with the Council and 
considering the objectives of the limited access program, that the 
replacement vessel has equal catching

[[Page 290]]

power as the original vessel, or that the replacement vessel has 
catching power that is comparable to the rest of the vessels holding 
permits for the fishery, and that the change is not inconsistent with 
the objectives of the program.
    (3) The Regional Director shall consider vessel length, range, hold 
capacity, gear limitations, and other appropriate factors in making 
determinations of catching power equivalency and comparability of the 
catching power of vessels in the fishery.
    (e) Supplementary requirements for permit renewal. (1) A permit will 
be eligible for renewal if the vessel covered by the permit makes three 
or more qualifying landings as defined in Sec. 660.12 during the permit 
year.
    (2) The owner of a permitted vessel that did not make three or more 
qualifying landings of bottomfish in a year may apply to the Regional 
Director for waiver of the landing requirement. If the Regional Director 
finds that failure to make three landings was due to circumstances 
beyond the owner's control, the Regional Director may renew the permit. 
A waiver may not be granted if the failure to make three landings was 
due to general economic conditions or market conditions, such that the 
vessel operations would not be profitable.
    (f) Supplementary requirements for new limited access permits. The 
Regional Director may issue new vessel permits under this part when the 
Regional Director has determined, in consultation with the Council, that 
bottomfish stocks in the Ho'omalu Zone are able to support additional 
fishing effort. This shall be established by determining that the total 
estimated annual revenue to the fleet exceeds the total estimated annual 
fixed and variable costs to the fleet in the Ho'omalu Zone by an amount 
at least equal to the average cost of a vessel year. This determination 
shall be made and published annually in association with the annual 
report required under Sec. 660.67.
    (g) Eligibility for new limited access permits. When the Regional 
Director has determined that new permits may be issued, they shall be 
issued to applicants based upon eligibility, determined as follows:
    (1) Point system. (i) Two points shall be assigned for each year in 
which the applicant was owner or captain of a vessel that made three or 
more qualifying landings of bottomfish from the NWHI.
    (ii) One point shall be assigned for each year in which the 
applicant was owner or captain of a vessel that landed at least 6,000 lb 
(2,722 kg) of bottomfish from the main Hawaiian Islands.
    (iii) Points will be assigned only under paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (ii) 
of this section for any 1 year.
    (iv) Points will be assigned for every year for which the requisite 
landings can be documented.
    (2) Restrictions. An applicant must own at least a 25-percent share 
in the vessel that the permit would cover, and only one permit will be 
assigned to any vessel.
    (3) Order of issuance. New permits shall be awarded to applicants in 
descending order, starting with the applicant with the largest number of 
points. If two or more persons have an equal number of points, and there 
are insufficient new permits for all such applicants, the new permits 
shall be awarded by the Regional Director through a lottery.
    (4) Notification. The Regional Director shall place a notice in the 
Federal Register and shall use other means to notify prospective 
applicants of the opportunity to file applications for new permits under 
this program.
    (h) Appeals of permit actions. (1) Except as provided in subpart D 
of 15 CFR part 904, any applicant for a permit or a permit holder may 
appeal the granting, denial, conditioning, or suspension of their permit 
or a permit affecting their interests to the Assistant Administrator. In 
order to be considered by the Assistant Administrator, such appeal must 
be in writing, must state the action(s) appealed, and the reasons 
therefor, and must be submitted within 30 days of the action(s) by the 
Regional Director. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the 
appeal.
    (2) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the 
Assistant Administrator will notify the permit applicant, or permit 
holder as appropriate, and will request such additional

[[Page 291]]

information and in such form as will allow action upon the appeal. Upon 
receipt of sufficient information, the Assistant Administrator will 
decide the appeal in accordance with the permit eligibility criteria set 
forth in this section and the amendment to the FMP, as appropriate, 
based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and 
the Council and any additional information, the summary record kept of 
any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and 
such other considerations as deemed appropriate. The Assistant 
Administrator will notify all interested persons of the decision, and 
the reasons therefor, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt 
of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a 
hearing.
    (3) If a hearing is requested, or if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that one is appropriate, the Assistant Administrator may 
grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that 
purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter 
of the hearing in the Federal Register. Such a hearing shall normally be 
held no later than 30 days following publication of the notice in the 
Federal Register, unless the hearing officer extends the time for 
reasons deemed equitable. The appellant, the applicant (if different), 
and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested persons, 
may appear personally or be represented by counsel at the hearing and 
submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by 
the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the 
hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Assistant 
Administrator.
    (4) The Assistant Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's 
recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. 
In any event, the Assistant Administrator will notify interested persons 
of the decision, and the reason(s) therefore, in writing, within 30 days 
of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended decision. The Assistant 
Administrator's action shall constitute final action for the agency for 
the purposes of the APA.
    (5) Any time limit prescribed in this section may be extended for a 
period not to exceed 30 days by the Assistant Administrator for good 
cause, either upon his or her own motion or upon written request from 
the appellant or applicant stating the reason(s) therefore.

<R05>
Sec. 660.67  Framework for regulatory adjustments.

    (a) Annual reports. By June 30 of each year, a Council-appointed 
bottomfish monitoring team will prepare an annual report on the fishery 
by area covering the following topics:
    (1) Fishery performance data.
    (2) Summary of recent research and survey results.
    (3) Habitat conditions and recent alterations.
    (4) Enforcement activities and problems.
    (5) Administrative actions (e.g., data collection and reporting, 
permits).
    (6) State and territorial management actions.
    (7) Assessment of need for Council action (including biological, 
economic, social, enforcement, administrative, and state/Federal needs, 
problems, and trends). Indications of potential problems warranting 
further investigation may be signaled by the following indicator 
criteria:
    (i) Mean size of the catch of any species in any area is a pre-
reproductive size.
    (ii) Ratio of fishing mortality to natural mortality for any 
species.

[[Page 293]]

    (iii) Harvest capacity of the existing fleet and/or annual landings 
exceed best estimate of MSY in any area.
    (iv) Significant decline (50 percent or more) in bottomfish catch 
per unit of effort from baseline levels.
    (v) Substantial decline in ex-vessel revenue relative to baseline 
levels.
    (vi) Significant shift in the relative proportions of gear in any 
one area.
    (vii) Significant change in the frozen/fresh components of the 
bottomfish catch.
    (viii) Entry/exit of fishermen in any area.
    (ix) Per-trip costs for bottomfishing exceed per-trip revenues for a 
significant percentage of trips.
    (x) Significant decline or increase in total bottomfish landings in 
any area.
    (xi) Change in species composition of the bottomfish catch in any 
area.
    (xii) Research results.
    (xiii) Habitat degradation or environmental problems.
    (xiv) Reported interactions between bottomfishing operations and 
protected species in the NWHI.
    (8) Recommendations for Council action.
    (9) Estimated impacts of recommended action.
    (b) Recommendation of management action. (1) The team may present 
management recommendations to the Council at any time. Recommendations 
may cover actions suggested for Federal regulations, state/territorial 
action, enforcement or administrative elements, and research and data 
collection. Recommendations will include an assessment of urgency and 
the effects of not taking action.
    (2) The Council will evaluate the team's reports and 
recommendations, and the indicators of concern. The Council will assess 
the need for one or more of the following types of management action: 
Catch limits, size limits, closures, effort limitations, access 
limitations, or other measures.
    (3) The Council may recommend management action by either the state/
territorial governments or by Federal regulation.
    (c) Federal management action. (1) If the Council believes that 
management action should be considered, it will make specific 
recommendations to the Regional Director after requesting and 
considering the views of its Scientific and Statistical Committee and 
Bottomfish Advisory Panel and obtaining public comments at a public 
hearing.
    (2) The Regional Director will consider the Council's recommendation 
and accompanying data, and, if he or she concurs with the Council's 
recommendation, will propose regulations to carry out the action. If the 
Regional Director rejects the Council's proposed action, a written 
explanation for the denial will be provided to the Council within 2 
weeks of the decision.
    (3) The Council may appeal denial by writing to the Assistant 
Administrator, who must respond in writing within 30 days.
    (4) The Regional Director and the Assistant Administrator will make 
their decisions in accord with the Magnuson Act, other applicable law, 
and the Bottomfish FMP.
    (5) To minimize conflicts between the Federal and state management 
systems, the Council will use the procedures in paragraph (b) of this 
section to respond to state/territorial management actions. Council 
consideration of action would normally begin with a representative of 
the state or territorial government bringing a potential or actual 
management conflict or need to the Council's attention.
    (d) Access limitation procedures. (1) Access limitation may be 
adopted under this paragraph (d) only for the NWHI, American Samoa, and 
Guam.
    (2) If access limitation is proposed for adoption or subsequent 
modification through the process described in this paragraph (d), the 
following requirements must be met:
    (i) The Bottomfish Monitoring Team must consider and report to the 
Council on present participation in the fishery; historical fishing 
practices in, and dependence on, the fishery; economics of the fishery; 
capability of fishing vessels used in the fishery to engage in other 
fisheries; cultural and social framework relevant to the fishery; and 
any other relevant considerations.
    (ii) Public hearings must be held specifically addressing the 
limited access proposals.

[[Page 294]]

    (iii) A specific advisory subpanel of persons experienced in the 
fishing industry will be created to advise the Council and the Regional 
Director on administrative decisions.
    (iv) The Council's recommendation to the Regional Director must be 
approved by a two-thirds majority of the voting members.
    (3) If prior participation in the fishery is used as a factor in any 
access limitation system recommended by the Council, August 7, 1985, is 
the date selected by the Council as the date to be used for the NWHI and 
May 30, 1986, for American Samoa and Guam.

Sec. 660.303  Reporting and recordkeeping.

    (a) This subpart recognizes that catch and effort data necessary for 
implementing the PCGFMP are collected by the States of Washington, 
Oregon, and California under existing state data collection 
requirements. Telephone surveys of the domestic industry will be 
conducted biannually by NMFS to determine amounts of fish that will be 
made available to foreign fishing and JVP. No additional Federal reports 
are required of fishers or processors, so long as the data collection 
and reporting systems operated by state agencies continue to provide 
NMFS with statistical information adequate for management.
    (b) Any person who is required to do so by the applicable state law 
must make and/or file, retain, or make available any and all reports of 
groundfish landings containing all data, and in the

[[Page 300]]

exact manner, required by the applicable state law.

<R05>
Sec. 660.305  Vessel identification.

    (a) Display. The operator of a vessel that is over 25 ft (7.6 m) in 
length and is engaged in commercial fishing for groundfish must display 
the vessel's official number on the port and starboard sides of the 
deckhouse or hull, and on a weather deck so as to be visible from above. 
The number must contrast with the background and be in block Arabic 
numerals at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) high for vessels over 65 ft (19.8 
m) long and at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) high for vessels between 25 and 
65 ft (7.6 and 19.8 m) in length. The length of a vessel for purposes of 
this section is the length set forth in USCG records or in state 
records, if no USCG record exists.
    (b) Maintenance of numbers. The operator of a vessel engaged in 
commercial fishing for groundfish must keep the identifying markings 
required by paragraph (a) of this section clearly legible and in good 
repair, and must ensure that no part of the vessel, its rigging, or its 
fishing gear obstructs the view of the official number from an 
enforcement vessel or aircraft.

[[Page 301]]

    (c) Commercial passenger vessels. This section does not apply to 
vessels carrying fishing parties on a per-capita basis or by charter.


<R05>

any and all reports of groundfish landings, containing all data, and in 
the exact manner, required by the applicable State law, as specified in 
Sec. 660.303, provided that person is required to do so by the 
applicable state law.
    (h) Fail to sort, prior to the first weighing after offloading, 
those groundfish species or species groups for which there is a trip 
limit, if the weight of the total delivery exceeds 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) 
(round weight or round-weight equivalent).
    (i) Possess, deploy, haul, or carry onboard a fishing vessel subject 
to these regulations a set net, trap or pot, longline, or commercial 
vertical hook-and-line that is not in compliance with the gear 
restrictions in Sec. 660.322, unless such gear is the gear of another 
vessel that has been retrieved at sea and made inoperable or stowed in a 
manner not capable of being fished. The disposal at sea of such gear is 
prohibited by Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention 
of Pollution From Ships, 1973 (Annex V of MARPOL 73/78).
    (j) Process Pacific whiting in the fishery management area during 
times or in areas where at-sea processing is prohibited, unless the fish 
were received from a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe 
fishing under Sec. 660.324.
    (k) Take and retain or receive, except as cargo, Pacific whiting on 
a vessel in the fishery management area that already possesses processed 
Pacific whiting on board, during times or in areas where at-sea 
processing is prohibited, unless the fish were received from a member of 
a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe fishing under Sec. 660.324; when 
taking and retention is prohibited under Sec. 660.323(a)(4)(iv), fail to 
keep the trawl doors on board the vessel and attached to the trawls on a 
vessel used to fish for whiting.
    (l) Have onboard a commercial hook-and-line fishing vessel (other 
than a vessel operated by persons under Sec. 660.323(b)(1)(ii)), more 
than the amount of the trip limit set for black rockfish by Sec. 660.323 
while that vessel is fishing between the U.S.-Canada border and Cape 
Alava (48 deg.09'30'' N. lat.), or between Destruction Island 
(47 deg.40'00'' N. lat.) and Leadbetter Point (46 deg.38'10'' N. lat.).
    (m) Fish with groundfish trawl gear, or carry groundfish trawl gear 
on board a vessel that also has groundfish on board (unless the vessel 
is in continuous transit from outside the fishery management area to a

<R05>
Sec. 660.321  Specifications and management measures.

    (a) General. NMFS will establish and adjust specifications and 
management measures annually and during the fishing year. Management of 
the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery will be conducted consistent with 
the standards and procedures in the PCGFMP and other applicable law. The 
PCGFMP is available from the Regional Director or the Council.
    (b) Annual actions. The Pacific Coast groundfish fishery is managed 
on a calendar year basis. Even though specifications and management 
measures are announced annually, they may apply for more than 1 year. In 
general, management measures are designed to achieve, but not exceed, 
the specifications, particularly harvest guidelines, limited entry and 
open access allocations, or other approved fishery allocations. Annual 
specifications and management measures are developed at two Council 
meetings and published in the Federal Register at the beginning of the 
year, according to the standards and procedures in the PCGFMP and other 
applicable law.
    (c) Routine management measures. Management measures designated 
``routine'' at Sec. 660.323(b) may be adjusted during the year after 
recommendation from the Council, approval by NMFS, and publication in 
the Federal Register.
    (d) Changes to the regulations. Regulations under this subpart may 
be promulgated, removed, or revised. Any such action will be made 
according to the framework standards and procedures in the PCGFMP and 
other applicable law, and will be published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 660.322  Gear restrictions.

    (a) General. The following types of fishing gear are authorized, 
with the restrictions set forth in this section: Trawl (bottom and 
pelagic), hook-and-line, longline, pot or trap, set net (anchored 
gillnet or trammel net), and spear.
    (b) Trawl gear--(1) Use. Trawl nets may be used on and off the 
seabed. Trawl nets may be fished with or without otter boards, and may 
use warps or cables to herd fish.
    (2) Mesh size. Trawl nets may be used if they meet the minimum mesh 
sizes set forth in this paragraph (b)(2). The minimum sizes apply 
throughout the net. Minimum trawl mesh size requirements are met if a 
20-gauge stainless steel wedge, 3.0 or 4.5 inches (7.6 or 11.4 cm) 
(depending on the gear being measured), less one thickness of the metal 
wedge, can be passed with only thumb pressure through at least 16 of 20 
sets of two meshes each of wet mesh.

    (3) Chafing gear. Chafing gear may encircle no more than 50 percent 
of the net's circumference, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section. No section of chafing gear may be longer than 50 meshes of 
the net to which it is attached. Except at the corners, the terminal end 
of each section of chafing gear must not be connected to the net. (The 
terminal end is the end farthest from the mouth of the net.) Chafing 
gear must be attached outside any

[[Page 303]]

riblines and restraining straps. There is no limit on the number of 
sections of chafing gear on a net.
    (4) Codends. Only single-walled codends may be used in any trawl. 
Double-walled codends are prohibited.
    (5) Pelagic trawls. Pelagic trawl nets must have unprotected 
footropes at the trawl mouth, and must not have rollers, bobbins, tires, 
wheels, rubber discs, or any similar device anywhere in the net. 
Sweeplines, including the bottom leg of the bridle, must be bare. For at 
least 20 ft (6.15 m) immediately behind the footrope or headrope, bare 
ropes or mesh of 16-inch (40.6-cm) minimum mesh size must completely 
encircle the net. A band of mesh (a ``skirt'') may encircle the net 
under transfer cables, lifting or splitting straps (chokers), but must 
be: Over riblines and restraining straps; the same mesh size and 
coincide knot-to-knot with the net to which it is attached; and no wider 
than 16 meshes.
    (c) Fixed gear. (1) Fixed gear (longline, trap or pot, set net and 
stationary hook-and-line gear, including commercial vertical hook-and-
line gear) must be:
    (i) Marked at the surface, at each terminal end, with a pole, flag, 
light, radar reflector, and a buoy, except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Attended at least once every 7 days.
    (2) Commercial vertical hook-and-line gear that is closely tended 
may be marked only with a single buoy of sufficient size to float the 
gear. ``Closely tended'' means that a vessel is within visual sighting 
distance or within 0.25 nm (463 m) as determined by electronic 
navigational equipment, of its commercial vertical hook-and-line gear.
    (3) A buoy used to mark fixed gear under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or 
(c)(2) of this section must be marked with a number clearly identifying 
the owner or operator of the vessel. The number may be either:
    (i) If required by applicable state law, the vessel's number, the 
commercial fishing license number, or buoy brand number; or
    (ii) The vessel documentation number issued by the USCG, or, for an 
undocumented vessel, the vessel registration number issued by the state.
    (d) Set nets. Fishing for groundfish with set nets is prohibited in 
the fishery management area north of 38 deg.00' N. lat.
    (e) Traps or pots. Traps must have biodegradable escape panels 
constructed with # 21 or smaller untreated cotton twine in such a manner 
that an opening at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter results when the 
twine deteriorates.
    (f) Recreational fishing. The only types of fishing gear authorized 
for recreational fishing are hook-and-line and spear.
    (g) Spears. Spears may be propelled by hand or by mechanical means.


<R05>
Sec. 660.323  Catch restrictions.

    (a) Groundfish species harvested in the territorial sea (0-3 nm) 
will be counted toward the catch limitations in this section.
    (1) Black rockfish. The trip limit for black rockfish (Sebastes 
melanops) for commercial fishing vessels using hook-and-line gear 
between the U.S.-Canada border and Cape Alava (48 deg.09'30'' N. lat.), 
and between Destruction Island (47 deg.40' N. lat.) and Leadbetter Point 
(46 deg.38'10'' N. lat.), is 100 lbs (45 kg) or 30 percent, by weight of 
all fish on board, whichever is greater, per vessel per fishing trip.
    (2) Nontrawl sablefish. This paragraph (a)(2) applies to the limited 
entry fishery, except for paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (v), which also apply 
to the open-access fishery.
    (i) Pre-season closure--open-access and limited entry fisheries.
    (A) Sablefish taken with fixed gear in the limited entry or open 
access fishery in the EEZ may not be retained or landed from 12 noon 
August 29 through 12 noon September 1.
    (B) All fixed gear used to take and retain groundfish must be out of 
EEZ waters from 12 noon August 29 through 12 noon September 1, except 
that pot gear used to take and retain groundfish may be deployed and 
baited in the EEZ after 12 noon on August 31.
    (ii) Regular season--limited entry fishery. The regular season for 
the limited entry nontrawl sablefish fishery begins at 1201 hours on 
September 1. During

[[Page 304]]

the regular season, the limited entry nontrawl sablefish fishery may be 
subject to trip limits to protect juvenile sablefish. The regular season 
will end when 70 percent of the limited entry nontrawl allocation has 
been or is projected to be taken. The end of the regular season may be 
announced in the Federal Register either before or during the regular 
season.
    (iii) Mop-up season--limited entry fishery. A mop-up season to take 
the remainder of the limited entry nontrawl allocation will begin about 
3 weeks after the end of the regular season, or as soon as practicable 
thereafter. During the mop-up fishery, a cumulative trip limit will be 
imposed. The length of the mop-up season and amount of the cumulative 
trip limit, including the time period to which it applies, will be 
determined by the Regional Director in consultation with the Council or 
its designees, and will be based primarily on the amount of fish 
remaining in the allocation and the number of participants anticipated. 
The Regional Director may determine that too little of the nontrawl 
allocation remains to conduct an orderly or manageable fishery, in which 
case there will not be a mop-up season.
    (iv) Other announcements. The dates and times that the regular 
season ends (and trip limits on sablefish of all sizes are resumed) and 
the mop-up season begins and ends, and the size of the trip limit for 
the mop-up fishery, will be announced in the Federal Register, and may 
be modified. Unless otherwise announced, these seasons will begin and 
end at 12 noon on the specified date. A vessel landing sablefish in 
Puget Sound that was taken under a limited entry permit with nontrawl 
gear during a regular season is not subject to trip limits on that trip 
(except the regular season trip limits to protect juvenile sablefish), 
provided the landing complies with Washington State regulations 
governing sablefish landings in Puget Sound after the regular season.
    (v) Trip limits. Trip and/or frequency limits may be imposed in the 
limited entry fishery before and after the regular season, and after the 
mop-up season, under paragraph (b) of this section. Trip and/or size 
limits to protect juvenile sablefish in the limited entry or open-access 
fisheries also may be imposed at any time under paragraph (b) of this 
section. Trip limits may be imposed in the open-access fishery at any 
time under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) Pacific whiting--(i) Season. The regular season for Pacific 
whiting begins on May 15 north of 42 deg.00' N. lat., on March 1 between 
42 deg.00' N. lat. and 40 deg.30' N. lat., and on April 15 south of 
40 deg.30' N. lat. Before and after the regular season, trip landing or 
frequency limits may be imposed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Closed areas. Pacific whiting may not be taken and retained in 
the following portions of the fishery management area:
    (A) Klamath River Salmon Conservation Zone. The ocean area 
surrounding the Klamath River mouth bounded on the north by 
41 deg.38'48'' N. lat. (approximately 6 nm north of the Klamath River 
mouth), on the west by 124 deg.23' W. long. (approximately 12 nm from 
shore), and on the south by 41 deg.26'48'' N. lat. (approximately 6 nm 
south of the Klamath River mouth).
    (B) Columbia River Salmon Conservation Zone. The ocean area 
surrounding the Columbia River mouth bounded by a line extending for 6 
nm due west from North Head along 46 deg.18' N. lat. to 124 deg.13'18'' 
W. long., then southerly along a line of 167 True to 46 deg.11'06'' N. 
lat. and 124 deg.11' W. long. (Columbia River Buoy), then northeast 
along Red Buoy Line to the tip of the south jetty.
    (iii) Eureka area trip limits. Trip landing or frequency limits may 
be established, modified, or removed under Sec. 660.321 or Sec. 660.323, 
specifying the amount of Pacific whiting that may be taken and retained, 
possessed, or landed by a vessel that, at any time during a fishing 
trip, fished in the fishery management area shoreward of the 100-fathom 
(183-m) contour (as shown on NOAA Charts 18580, 18600, and 18620) in the 
Eureka area (from 43 deg.00' to 40 deg.30' N. lat.).
    (iv) At-sea processing. Pacific whiting may not be processed at sea 
south of 42 deg.00' N. lat. (Oregon-California border).
    (v) Time of day. Pacific whiting may not be taken and retained by 
any vessel in the fishery management area

[[Page 305]]

south of 42 deg.00' N. lat. between 0001 hours to one-half hour after 
official sunrise (local time). During this time south of 42 deg.00' N. 
lat., trawl doors must be on board any vessel used to fish for whiting 
and the trawl must be attached to the trawl doors. Official sunrise is 
determined, to the nearest 5 deg. lat., in The Nautical Almanac issued 
annually by the Nautical Almanac Office, U.S. Naval Observatory, and 
available from the U.S. Government Printing Office.
    (4) Pacific whiting--allocation. The following provisions apply from 
1994 through 1996--
    (i) Shoreside reserve. When 60 percent of the commercial harvest 
guideline for Pacific whiting has been or is projected to be taken, 
further at-sea processing of Pacific whiting will be prohibited pursuant 
to paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. The remaining 40 percent of the 
commercial harvest guideline is reserved for harvest by vessels 
delivering to shoreside processors.
    (ii) Release of reserve. That portion of the commercial harvest 
guideline that the Regional Director determines will not be used by 
shoreside processors by the end of that fishing year shall be made 
available for harvest by all fishing vessels, regardless of where they 
deliver, on August 15 or as soon as practicable thereafter. NMFS may 
again release whiting at a later date if it becomes obvious, after 
August 15, that shore-based needs have been substantially over-
estimated, but only after consultation with the Council and only to 
insure full utilization of the resource.
    (iii) Estimates. Estimates of the amount of Pacific whiting 
harvested will be based on actual amounts harvested, projections of 
amounts that will be harvested, or a combination of the two. Estimates 
of the amount of Pacific whiting that will be used by shoreside 
processors by the end of the fishing year will be based on the best 
information available to the Regional Director from state catch and 
landings data, the survey of domestic processing capacity and intent, 
testimony received at Council meetings, and/or other relevant 
information.
    (iv) Announcements. The Assistant Administrator will announce in the 
Federal Register when 60 percent of the commercial harvest guideline for 
whiting has been, or is about to be, harvested, specifying a time after 
which further at-sea processing of Pacific whiting in the fishery 
management area is prohibited. The Assistant Administrator will publish 
a document in the Federal Register to announce any release of the 
reserve on August 15, or as soon as practicable thereafter. In order to 
prevent exceeding the limits or underutilizing the resource, adjustments 
may be made effective immediately by actual notice to fishermen and 
processors, by phone, fax, Northwest Region computerized bulletin board 
(contact 206-526-6128), letter, press release, and/or U.S. Coast Guard 
Notice to Mariners (monitor channel 16 VHF), followed by publication in 
the Federal Register, in which instance public comment will be sought 
for a reasonable period of time thereafter. If insufficient time exists 
to consult with the Council, the Regional Director will inform the 
Council in writing of actions taken.
    (b) Routine management measures. In addition to the catch 
restrictions in this section, other catch restrictions that are likely 
to be adjusted on an annual or more frequent basis may be imposed and 
announced by a single notification in the Federal Register if they first 
have been designated as ``routine'' according to the applicable 
procedures in the PCGFMP. The following catch restrictions are 
designated as routine for the reasons given in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section:
    (1) Commercial-limited entry and open access fisheries--
    (i) Species and gear. (A) Widow rockfish--all gear--trip landing and 
frequency limits.
    (B) Sebastes complex--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (C) Yellowtail rockfish--all gear--trip landing and frequency 
limits.
    (D) Pacific ocean perch--all gear--trip landing and frequency 
limits.
    (E) Sablefish--all gear--trip landing, frequency, and size limits.
    (F) Dover sole--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (G) Thornyheads (shortspine thornyheads or longspine thornyheads,

[[Page 306]]

separately or combined)--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (H) Bocaccio--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (I) Pacific whiting--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (J) Lingcod--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits; size 
limits.
    (K) Canary rockfish--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (L) All groundfish, separately or in any combination--any legal open 
access gear (including non-groundfish trawl gear used to harvest pink 
shrimp, spot or ridgeback prawns, California halibut or sea cucumbers in 
accordance with the regulations in this subpart)--trip landing and 
frequency limits. (Size limits designated routine in this section 
continue to apply.)
    (ii) Reasons for ``routine'' management measures. All routine 
management measures on commercial fisheries are intended to keep 
landings within the harvest levels announced by NMFS. In addition, the 
following reasons apply:
    (A) Trip landing and frequency limits--to extend the fishing season; 
to minimize disruption of traditional fishing and marketing patterns; to 
reduce discards; to discourage target fishing while allowing small 
incidental catches to be landed; to allow small fisheries to operate 
outside the normal season; and, for the open access fishery only, to 
maintain landings at the historical proportions during the 1984-88 
window period.
    (B) Size limits--to protect juvenile fish; to extend the fishing 
season.
    (2) Recreational--(i) Species and gear. (A) Lingcod--all gear--bag 
and size limits.
    (B) Rockfish--all gear--bag limits.
    (ii) Reasons for ``routine'' management measures. All routine 
management measures on recreational fisheries are intended to keep 
landings within the harvest levels announced by NMFS. In addition, the 
following reasons apply:
    (A) Bag limits--to spread the available catch over a large number of 
anglers; to avoid waste; for consistency with state regulations.
    (B) Size limits--to protect juvenile fish; to enhance the quality of 
the recreational fishing experience; for consistency with state 
regulations.
    (c) Prohibited species. Groundfish species or species groups under 
the PCGFMP for which quotas have been achieved and the fishery closed 
are prohibited species. In addition, the following are prohibited 
species:
    (1) Any species of salmonid.
    (2) Pacific halibut.
    (3) Dungeness crab caught seaward of Washington or Oregon.

<R05>
Sec. 660.324  Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries.

    (a) Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes have treaty rights to harvest 
groundfish in their usual and accustomed fishing areas in U.S. waters.
    (b) For the purposes of this part, Pacific Coast treaty Indian 
tribes means the Hoh, Makah, and Quileute Indian Tribes and the Quinault 
Indian Nation.
    (c) The Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes' usual and accustomed 
fishing areas within the fishery management area (FMA) are set out below 
in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. Boundaries of a 
tribe's fishing area may be revised as ordered by a Federal court.
    (1) Makah--That portion of the FMA north of 48 deg.02'15'' N. lat. 
(Norwegian Memorial) and east of 125 deg.44'00'' W. long.
    (2) Quileute--That portion of the FMA between 48 deg.07'36'' N. lat. 
(Sand Point) and 47 deg.31'42'' N. lat. (Queets River) and east of 
125 deg.44'00'' W. long.
    (3) Hoh--That portion of the FMA between 47 deg.54'18'' N. lat. 
(Quillayute River) and 47 deg.21'00'' N. lat. (Quinault River) and east 
of 125 deg.44'00'' W. long.
    (4) Quinault--That portion of the FMA between 47 deg.40'06'' N. lat. 
(Destruction Island) and 46 deg.53'18'' N. lat. (Point Chehalis) and 
east of 125 deg.44'00'' W. long.
    (d) Procedures. The rights referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
section will be implemented by the Secretary, after consideration of the 
tribal request, the recommendation of the Council, and the comments of 
the public. The rights will be implemented either through an allocation 
of fish that will be managed by the tribes, or through regulations in 
this section that will apply specifically to the tribal fisheries. An 
allocation or a regulation specific to the tribes shall

[[Page 307]]

be initiated by a written request from a Pacific Coast treaty Indian 
tribe to the Regional Director, prior to the first of the Council's two 
annual groundfish meetings. The Secretary generally will announce the 
annual tribal allocation at the same time as the annual specifications. 
The Secretary recognizes the sovereign status and co-manager role of 
Indian tribes over shared Federal and tribal fishery resources. 
Accordingly, the Secretary will develop tribal allocations and 
regulations under this paragraph in consultation with the affected 
tribe(s) and, insofar as possible, with tribal consensus.
    (e) Identification. A valid treaty Indian identification card issued 
pursuant to 25 CFR part 249, subpart A, is prima facie evidence that the 
holder is a member of the Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe named on the 
card.
    (f) A limited entry permit under subpart C is not required for 
participation in a tribal fishery described in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (g) Fishing under this section by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty 
Indian tribe within their usual and accustomed fishing area is not 
subject to the provisions of other sections of this part.
    (h) Any member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe must comply 
with this section, and with any applicable tribal law and regulation, 
when participating in a tribal groundfish fishery described in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (i) Fishing by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe 
outside the applicable Indian tribe's usual and accustomed fishing area, 
or for a species of groundfish not covered by an allocation or 
regulation under this section, is subject to the regulations in the 
other sections of this part.
    (j) Black rockfish. Harvest guidelines for commercial harvests of 
black rockfish by members of the Pacific Coast Indian tribes using hook 
and line gear will be established annually for the areas between the 
U.S.-Canadian border and Cape Alava (48 deg.09'30'' N. lat.) and between 
Destruction Island (47 deg.40'00'' N. lat.) and Leadbetter Point 
(46 deg.38'10'' N. lat.), in accordance with the procedures for 
implementing annual specifications. Pacific Coast treaty Indians fishing 
for black rockfish in these areas under these harvest guidelines are 
subject to the provisions in this section, and not to the restrictions 
in other sections of this part.
    (k) Groundfish without a tribal allocation. Makah tribal members may 
use midwater trawl gear to take and retain groundfish for which there is 
no tribal allocation and will be subject to the trip landing and 
frequency and size limits applicable to the limited entry fishery.


<R05>
Sec. 660.331   Limited entry and open access fisheries--general.

    All commercial fishing for groundfish must be conducted in 
accordance with the regulations governing limited entry and open access 
fisheries, except such fishing by treaty Indian tribes as may be 
separately provided for.


<R05>
Sec. 660.332   Allocations.

    (a) General. The commercial portion of the Pacific Coast groundfish 
fishery, excluding the treaty Indian fishery, is divided into limited 
entry and open access fisheries. Separate allocations for the limited 
entry and open access fisheries will be established annually for certain 
species and/or areas using the procedures described in this subpart or 
the PCGFMP.
    (1) Limited entry allocation. The allocation for the limited entry 
fishery is the allowable catch (harvest guideline or quota excluding set 
asides for recreational or tribal Indian fisheries) minus the allocation 
to the open access fishery.
    (2) Open access allocation. The allocation for the open access 
fishery is derived by applying the open access allocation percentage to 
the annual harvest guideline or quota after subtracting any set asides 
for recreational or tribal Indian fisheries. For management areas where 
quotas or harvest guidelines for a stock are not fully utilized, no 
separate allocation will be established for the open access fishery 
until it is projected that the allowable catch for a species will be 
reached.
    (b) Open access allocation percentage. For each species with a 
harvest guideline or quota, the initial open access allocation 
percentage is calculated by:
    (1) Computing the total catch for that species during the window 
period

[[Page 308]]

by any vessel that does not initially receive a limited entry permit.
    (2) Dividing that amount by the total catch during the window period 
by all gear.
    (3) The guidelines in this paragraph (b)(3) apply to recalculation 
of the open access allocation percentage. Any recalculated allocation 
percentage will be used in calculating the following year's open access 
allocation. If a gear type is prohibited by a state or the Secretary and 
a vessel thereby qualifies for a limited entry permit under this 
subpart, or if a small limited entry fleet is incorporated into the 
limited entry fishery under Sec. 660.338, the window-period catch of 
these vessels will be deducted from the open access fishery's historical 
catch levels and the open access allocation percentage recalculated 
accordingly.
    (c) Catch accounting between the limited entry and open access 
fisheries. Any groundfish caught by a vessel with a limited entry permit 
will be counted against the limited entry allocation while the limited 
entry fishery for that vessel's limited entry gear is open. When the 
fishery for a vessel's limited entry gear has closed, groundfish caught 
by that vessel with open access gear will be counted against the open 
access allocation. All groundfish caught by vessels without limited 
entry permits will be counted against the open access allocation.
    (d) Additional guidelines. Additional guidelines governing 
determination of the limited entry and open access allocations are in 
the PCGFMP.
    (e) Treaty Indian fisheries. Certain amounts of groundfish may be 
set aside annually for tribal fisheries prior to dividing the balance of 
the allowable catch between the limited entry and open access fisheries. 
Tribal fisheries conducted under a set-aside are not subject to the 
regulations governing limited entry and open access fisheries.
    (f) Recreational fisheries. Recreational fishing for groundfish is 
outside the scope of, and not affected by, the regulations governing 
limited entry and open access fisheries. Certain amounts of groundfish 
may be specifically allocated to the recreational fishery, and will be 
set aside prior to dividing the commercial allocation between the 
commercial limited entry and open access fisheries.


<R05>
Sec. 660.333  Limited entry fishery-general.

    (a) General. Participation in the limited entry fishery requires 
that the owner of a vessel have a limited entry permit affixed with a 
gear endorsement registered for use with that vessel for the gear being 
fished. There are four types of gear endorsements: ``A,'' ``Provisional 
A,'' ``B,'' and ``Designated species B.'' More than one type of gear 
endorsement may be affixed to a limited entry permit. While the limited 
entry fishery is open, vessels fishing under limited entry permits may 
also fish with open access gear. All fishing with open access gear is 
subject to regulations applicable to the open access fishery. Vessels 
with limited entry permits may also participate in the open access 
fishery when the limited entry fishery is closed, but only with open 
access gear.
    (b) Renewal of limited entry permits and gear endorsements.
    (1) Limited entry permits expire at the end of each calendar year, 
and must be renewed between October 1 and November 30 of each year in 
order to remain in force the following year.
    (2) Notification to renew limited entry permits will be issued by 
FMD prior to September 1 each year to the most recent address of the 
permit owner. The permit owner shall provide FMD with notice of any 
address change within 15 days of the change.
    (3) A limited entry permit that is allowed to expire will not be 
renewed unless the FMD determines that failure to renew was proximately 
caused by the illness, injury, or death of the permit owner.
    (c) Transfer and registration of limited entry permits and gear 
endorsements. (1) Upon transfer of a limited entry permit, the FMD will 
reissue the permit in the name of the new permit holder with such gear 
endorsements as are eligible for transfer with the permit. No transfer 
is effective until the limited entry permit has been reissued and is in 
the possession of the new permit holder.

[[Page 309]]

    (2) A limited entry permit may not be used with a vessel unless it 
is registered for use with that vessel. Limited entry permits will 
normally be registered for use with a particular vessel at the time the 
permit is issued, renewed, transferred, or replaced. A permit not 
registered for use with a particular vessel may not be used. If the 
permit will be used with a vessel other than the one registered on the 
permit, a registration for use with the new vessel must be obtained from 
the FMD and placed aboard the vessel before it is used under the permit.
    (3) Application forms for the transfer and registration of limited 
entry permits are available from the FMD (see part 600 for address of 
the Regional Director). Contents of the application, and required 
supporting documentation, are specified in the application form.
    (4) The FMD will maintain records of all limited entry permits that 
have been issued, renewed, transferred, registered, or replaced.
    (d) Evidence and burden of proof. A vessel owner (or person holding 
limited entry rights under the express terms of a written contract) 
applying for issuance, renewal, transfer, or registration of a limited 
entry permit has the burden to submit evidence to prove that 
qualification requirements are met. The following evidentiary standards 
apply:
    (1) A certified copy of the current vessel document (USCG or state) 
is the best evidence of vessel ownership and LOA.
    (2) A certified copy of a state fish receiving ticket is the best 
evidence of a landing, and of the type of gear used.
    (3) A copy of a written contract reserving or conveying limited 
entry rights is the best evidence of reserved or acquired rights.
    (4) Such other relevant, credible evidence as the applicant may 
submit, or the FMD or the Regional Director request or acquire, may also 
be considered.
    (e) Initial decisions. Initial decisions regarding issuance, 
renewal, transfer, and registration of limited entry permits, and 
endorsement upgrade, will be made by the FMD.
    Adverse decisions shall be in writing and shall state the reasons 
therefor. The FMD may decline to act on an application for issuance, 
renewal, transfer, or registration of a limited entry permit if the 
permit sanction provisions of the Magnuson Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(a) and 
implementing regulations at 15 CFR part 904, subpart D, apply.
    (f) Transfers. Limited entry permits are transferable as follows:
    (1) The permit owner may transfer (by sale, assignment, lease, 
bequest, intestate succession, barter, trade, gift, or other form of 
conveyance) the limited entry permit to a different person. The permit 
holder may register the permit for use with a different vessel under the 
same ownership, subject to the conditions set forth in this subpart.
    (2) Gear endorsements may not be transferred separately from the 
limited entry permit.
    (3) Except as provided in Secs. 660.335(b), 660.336(b), and 
660.337(b)(2), only ``A'' gear endorsements remain valid with the 
transfer of a limited entry permit.
    (g) Eligibility. Only a person eligible to own a documented vessel 
under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12102(a) may be issued or may hold (by 
ownership or otherwise) a limited entry permit.
    (h) Vessel size endorsements--(1) General. The limited entry permit 
will be endorsed with the LOA for the size of the vessel that initially 
qualified for the permit, except:
    (i) If the permit was initially issued under section 14.3.2.3.8 of 
the FMP [re pre-1991 replacement vessels qualifying for ``provisional 
A'' permits] for a replacement vessel that was more than 5 ft (1.52 m) 
longer than the replaced vessel, the permit will be endorsed for the 
size of the replacement vessel.
    (ii) If the permit was initially issued to a replacement trawl 
vessel that was more than 5 ft (1.52 m) shorter than the replaced 
vessel, it will be endorsed for the size of the smaller replacement 
vessel.
    (iii) If the permit is registered for use with a trawl vessel that 
is more than 5 ft (1.52 m) shorter than the size for which the permit is 
endorsed, it will be endorsed for the size of the smaller vessel.
    (iv) When permits are combined into one permit to be registered for 
use with

[[Page 310]]

a vessel requiring a larger size endorsement, the new permit will be 
endorsed for the size of the larger vessel.
    (2) Limitations of size endorsements--(i) A limited entry permit 
endorsed only for gear other than trawl gear may be registered for use 
with a vessel up to 5 ft (1.52 m) longer than, the same length as, or 
any length shorter than, the size endorsed on the existing permit 
without requiring a combination of permits under paragraph (i) of this 
section or a change in the size endorsement.
    (ii) A limited entry permit endorsed for trawl gear may be 
registered for use with a vessel between 5 ft (1.52 m) shorter and 5 ft 
(1.52 m) longer than the size endorsed on the existing permit without 
requiring a combination of permits under paragraph (i) of this section 
or a change in the size endorsement under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this 
section.
    (iii) Combining limited entry permits. Two or more limited entry 
permits with ``A'' gear endorsements for the same type of limited entry 
gear may be combined and reissued as a single permit with a larger size 
endorsement. The vessel harvest capacity rating for each of the permits 
being combined is that indicated in Table 2 of this part for the LOA (in 
feet) endorsed on the respective limited entry permit. Harvest capacity 
ratings for fractions of a foot in vessel length will be determined by 
multiplying the fraction of a foot in vessel length by the difference in 
the two ratings assigned to the nearest integers of vessel length. The 
length rating for the combined permit is that indicated for the sum of 
the vessel harvest capacity ratings for each permit being combined. If 
that sum falls between the sums for two adjacent lengths on Table 2 of 
this part, the length rating shall be the higher length.
    (i) Limited entry permits indivisible. Limited entry permits may not 
be divided for use by more than one vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 660.334  Limited entry permits--''A'' endorsement.

    (a) A limited entry permit with an ``A'' endorsement entitles the 
holder to participate in the limited entry fishery for all groundfish 
species with the type(s) of limited entry gear specified in the 
endorsement.
    (b) An ``A'' endorsement is transferable with the limited entry 
permit to another person, or a different vessel under the same ownership 
under Sec. 660.333.
    (c) An ``A'' endorsement expires on failure to renew the limited 
entry permit to which it is affixed (see Sec. 660.333).


<R05>
Sec. 660.335  Limited entry permits--''Provisional A'' endorsement.

    (a) A ``provisional A'' endorsement entitles the permit owner to 
fish for all groundfish species with the types of limited entry gear 
specified in the endorsement.
    (b) A ``provisional A'' endorsement is not transferrable except as 
specified in the PCGFMP.
    (c) The holder of a ``provisional A'' endorsement must comply with 
the requirements set out in the PCGFMP at 14.3.2.4 in order for the 
permit to be upgraded to an ``A'' permit.
    (d) A ``provisional A'' endorsement expires at the end of any of the 
three consecutive 365-day periods (during the 3-year qualifying period) 
in which a vessel's landings do not meet the applicable landing 
requirement or upon failure to renew the limited entry permit. A 
``provisional A'' endorsement that expires will not be reissued.


<R05>
Sec. 660.336  Limited entry permits--''B'' endorsement.

    (a) A limited entry permit with a ``B'' endorsement entitles the 
permit owner to fish for all groundfish species with the type(s) of 
limited entry gear specified in the endorsement.
    (b) A ``B'' endorsement is not transferable to another person, and 
may not be used with another vessel under the same ownership, unless the 
vessel for which the endorsement was issued is totally lost, and the 
permit is transferred to a replacement vessel owned by the same owner.
    (c) All ``B'' endorsements expire on December 31, 1996.
    (d) A ``B'' endorsement expires on failure to renew the limited 
entry permit.

[[Page 311]]


<R05>
Sec. 660.337  Limited entry permits--``designated species B'' endorsement.

    (a) Issuance criteria--(1) General. Designated species means Pacific 
whiting, jack mackerel north of 39 deg. N. lat., and shortbelly 
rockfish. Bycatch allowances in fisheries for these species will be 
established using the procedures specified for incidental allowances in 
joint venture and foreign fisheries in the PCGFMP.
    (2) Catch limit. On or about October 1 of each year, the FMD will 
determine the commitment of persons with limited entry permits with 
``A'' gear endorsements (the ``limited entry fleet'') to harvest each 
designated species for delivery to domestic processors during the coming 
year. ``Commitment'' means a permit holder's contract or agreement with 
a specific domestic processor to deliver an estimated amount of the 
designated species. The ``designated species B'' endorsement catch limit 
is the harvest guideline or quota for the designated species minus the 
commitment of the limited entry fleet. If the commitment is less than 
DAP and the harvest guideline or quota for the species, ``designated 
species B'' endorsements valid for delivery to domestic processors will 
be issued in numbers necessary to reach but not exceed the harvest 
guideline or quota. ``Designated species B'' endorsements also may be 
issued for delivery to foreign processors of designated species for 
which a JVP is established. If, at any time during the fishing year, the 
FMD determines that any part of the limited entry fleet commitment will 
not be taken, the Regional Director will make a reapportionment to the 
``designated species B'' endorsement catch limit. The amount of the 
annual limited entry fleet commitment, ``designated species B'' 
endorsement catch limit, and the amounts and timing of any 
reapportionments to the ``designated species B'' endorsement catch limit 
will be announced in the Federal Register.
    (3) Procedure for issuance. Owners of vessels applying for 
``designated species B'' endorsements must apply on or before November 1 
of each year for a ``designated species B'' endorsement for the 
following year. Applications are available from the FMD. Applicants are 
required to specify their commitments for delivery of the designated 
species for the coming year. On or about November 1 of each year, the 
FMD will establish a prioritized list of applicants based on seniority 
(number of years the vessel has fished for the designated species). A 
vessel which replaces a lost vessel, consistent with the standards in 
the PCGFMP, has the same seniority status as the replaced vessel. 
Vessels with equal seniority will be ranked equally. ``Designated 
species B'' endorsements will be issued first to all vessels with the 
highest seniority, then to those with the next highest seniority, and so 
on down the list. No further endorsements will be issued when it is 
estimated that the commitments of applicants receiving endorsements is 
sufficient to take the ``designated species B'' catch limit. If there 
are insufficient commitments by senior applicants to take the 
``designated species B'' catch limit, additional applications will be 
ranked by lottery and a number of endorsements sufficient to take the 
catch limit will be issued.
    (b) Attributes. (1) A limited entry permit with a ``designated 
species B'' endorsement entitles the permit recipient to fish only for 
the species, and only with the gear, specified in the endorsement.
    (2) A ``designated species B'' endorsement is not transferable to 
another person, and may not be used with a different vessel under the 
same ownership, unless the vessel has been totally lost and replaced 
consistent with the provisions of the PCGFMP, in which case the 
replacement vessel has the same seniority as the lost vessel for 
purposes of a ``designated species B'' endorsement.
    (3) A ``designated species B'' endorsement is valid only for the 
fishing year for which it is issued.

Sec. 660.338  Limited entry permits--new permits.

    (a) Small limited entry fisheries that are controlled by a local 
government, are in existence as of July 11, 1991, and have negligible 
impacts on the groundfish resource, may be certified as consistent with 
the goals and objectives of

[[Page 312]]

the limited entry program and incorporated into the limited entry 
fishery. Permits issued under this subsection will be issued according 
to the standards and procedures set out in the PCGFMP and will carry the 
rights explained therein. Window period is that period from July 11, 
1984, through August 1, 1988.
    (b) If, after the window period, an exempt gear is prohibited by 
Washington, Oregon, or California or NMFS, the owners of vessels using 
such gear, who would not otherwise qualify for an ``A'' or ``provisional 
A'' endorsement, may qualify for a ``provisional A'' endorsement for 
only one of the three limited entry gears, if the vessel used the 
prohibited gear to make sufficient landings of groundfish during the 
window period to meet the MLR for the limited entry gear. If a vessel 
would qualify for an endorsement for more than one limited entry gear, 
the owner must choose the type of gear for which the endorsement will be 
issued. If an ``A'' or ``provisional A'' endorsement was previously 
issued for the vessel, and the endorsement was subsequently transferred 
or expired, no ``provisional A'' endorsement will be issued. Permits 
issued under this section will be issued according to the procedures and 
standards set out in the PCGFMP and will carry the rights explained 
therein.
    (c) An owner of a vessel that qualifies under this section must 
apply to the FMD for a permit within 180 days of incorporation of the 
limited entry fleet of which the vessel is a part or within 180 days of 
the effective date of the prohibition of that vessel's gear. Untimely 
applications will be rejected unless the applicant demonstrates that 
circumstances beyond the applicant's control prevented submission of the 
application during the specified period. Illness, injury, or death of 
the potential applicant are the primary grounds on which untimely 
applications may be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 660.339  Limited entry permit fees.

    The Regional Director will charge fees to cover administrative 
expenses related to issuance of limited entry permits, including initial 
issuance, renewal, transfer, vessel registration, replacement, and 
appeals. The appropriate fee must accompany each application.


<R05>
Sec. 660.340  Limited entry permit appeals.

    (a) Decisions on appeals of initial decisions regarding issuance, 
renewal, transfer, and registration of limited entry permits, and 
endorsement upgrade, will be made by the Regional Director.
    (b) Appeals decisions shall be in writing and shall state the 
reasons therefor.
    (c) Within 30 days of an initial decision by the FMD denying 
issuance, renewal, transfer, or registration of a limited entry permit, 
or endorsement upgrade, on the terms requested by the applicant, an 
appeal may be filed with the Regional Director.
    (d) The appeal must be in writing, and must allege facts or 
circumstances to show why the criteria in this subpart have been met, or 
why an exception should be granted.
    (e) At the appellant's discretion, the appeal may be accompanied by 
a request that the Regional Director seek a recommendation from the 
Council as to whether the appeal should be granted. Such a request must 
contain the appellant's acknowledgement that the confidentiality 
provisions of the Magnuson Act at 16 U.S.C. 1853(d) and part 600 of this 
chapter are waived with respect to any information supplied by the 
Regional Director to the Council and its advisory bodies for purposes of 
receiving the Council's recommendation on the appeal. In responding to a 
request for a recommendation on appeal, the Council will apply the 
provisions of the PCGFMP in making its recommendation as to whether the 
appeal should be granted.
    (f) Absent good cause for further delay, the Regional Director will 
issue a written decision on the appeal within 45 days of receipt of the 
appeal, or, if a recommendation from the Council is requested, within 45 
days of receiving the Council's recommendation. The Regional Director's 
decision is the final administrative decision of the Department as of 
the date of the decision.

                 Subpart H--West Coast Salmon Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 660.401  Purpose and scope.

    This subpart implements the Fishery Management Plan for Commercial 
and Recreational Salmon Fisheries Off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, 
and California developed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council. 
These regulations govern the management of West Coast salmon fisheries 
in the EEZ.


<R05>
Sec. 660.402  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson Act and in Sec.  
600.10 of this chapter, the terms used in this subpart have the 
following meanings:
    Barbless hook means a hook with a single shank and point, with no 
secondary point or barb curving or projecting in any other direction. 
Where barbless hooks are specified, hooks manufactured with barbs can be 
made barbless by forcing the point of the barb flat against the main 
part of the point.
    Commercial fishing means fishing with troll fishing gear as defined 
annually under Sec. 660.408, or fishing for the purpose of sale or 
barter of the catch.
    Council means the Pacific Fishery Management Council.
    Dressed, head-off length of salmon means the shortest distance 
between the midpoint of the clavicle arch (see Figure 3 of this subpart) 
and the fork of the tail, measured along the lateral line while the fish 
is lying on its side, without resort to any force or mutilation of the 
fish other than removal of the head, gills, and entrails (see Figure 3 
of this subpart).
    Dressed, head-off salmon means salmon that have been beheaded, 
gilled, and gutted without further separation of vertebrae, and are 
either being prepared for on-board freezing, or are frozen and will 
remain frozen until landed.
    Fishery management area means the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, 
Oregon, and California, bounded on the north by the Provisional 
International Boundary between the United States and Canada, and bounded 
on the south by the International Boundary between the United States and 
Mexico. The northeastern, northern, and northwestern boundaries of the 
fishery management area are as follows:
    (1) Northeastern boundary--that part of a line connecting the light 
on Tatoosh Island, WA, with the light on Bonilla Point on Vancouver 
Island, British Columbia, southerly of the International Boundary 
between the United States and Canada (at 48 deg.29'37'' N. lat., 
124 deg.43'33'' W. long.), and northerly of the point where that line 
intersects with the boundary of the U.S. territorial sea.
    (2) Northern and northwestern boundary is a line <SUP>1 connecting 
the following coordinates:

[[Page 314]]

    (4) The inner boundaries of the fishery management area are subject 
to change if the Secretary assumes responsibility for the regulation of 
the salmon fishery within state waters under section 306(b) of the 
Magnuson Act.
    Freezer trolling vessel means a fishing vessel, equipped with troll 
fishing gear, that has a present capability for:
    (1) On board freezing of the catch.
    (2) Storage of the fish in a frozen condition until they are landed.
    Land or landing means to begin transfer of fish from a fishing 
vessel. Once transfer begins, all fish onboard the vessel are counted as 
part of the landing.
    Plugs means artificial fishing lures made of wood or hard plastic 
with one or more hooks attached. Lures commonly known as ``spoons,'' 
``wobblers,'' ``dodgers,'' and flexible plastic lures are not considered 
plugs, and may not be used where ``plugs only'' are specified.
    Recreational fishing means fishing with recreational fishing gear as 
defined annually under Sec. 660.408 and not for the purpose of sale or 
barter.
    Recreational fishing gear will be defined annually under 
Sec. 660.408.
    Regional Director means the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, or a 
designee. For fisheries occurring primarily or exclusively in the 
fishery management area seaward of California, Regional Director means 
the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, acting in consultation with the 
Director, Southwest Region, NMFS.
    Salmon means any anadromous species of the family Salmonidae and 
genus Oncorhynchus, commonly known as Pacific salmon, including, but not 
limited to:

Chinook (king) salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha
Coho (silver) salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch
Pink (humpback) salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha
Chum (dog) salmon, Oncorhynchus keta
Sockeye (red) salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka
Steelhead (rainbow trout), Oncorhynchus mykiss

    Total length of salmon means the shortest distance between the tip 
of the snout or jaw (whichever extends furthest while the mouth is 
closed) and the tip of the longest lobe of the tail, without resort to 
any force or mutilation of the salmon other than fanning or swinging the 
tail.
    Treaty Indian fishing means fishing for salmon and steelhead in the 
fishery management area by a person authorized by the Makah Tribe to 
exercise fishing rights under the Treaty with the Makah, or by the 
Quileute, Hoh, or Quinault Tribes to exercise fishing rights under the 
Treaty of Olympia.
    Troll fishing gear will be defined annually under Sec. 660.408.
    Whole bait means a hook or hooks baited with whole natural bait with 
no device to attract fish other than a flasher.


<R05>
Sec. 660.403  Relation to other laws.

    (a) The relation of this part to other laws is set forth in 
Sec. 600.705 of this chapter, Sec. 660.2, and paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section.
    (b) Any person fishing subject to this subpart who also engages in 
fishing for groundfish should consult Federal regulations in subpart G 
for applicable requirements of that subpart, including the requirement 
that vessels engaged in commercial fishing for groundfish (except 
commercial passenger vessels) have vessel identification in accordance 
with Sec. 660.305.
    (c) Any person fishing subject to this subpart is bound by the 
international boundaries of the fishery management area described in

jurisdictions, until such time as new boundaries are published by the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 660.404  Recordkeeping and reporting.

    (a) This subpart recognizes that catch and effort data necessary for 
implementation of any applicable fishery management plan are collected 
by the States and Indian tribes of Washington, Oregon, California, and 
Idaho under existing data collection requirements. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, no additional catch reports will be 
required of fishermen or processors so long as the data collection and 
reporting systems operated by

[[Page 315]]

State agencies and Indian tribes continue to provide NMFS with 
statistical information adequate for management.
    (b) Persons engaged in commercial fishing may be required to submit 
catch reports that are specified annually under Sec. 660.408.

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 34600, July 2, 1996, Sec. 660.404 was

<R05>
Sec. 660.405  Prohibitions.

    (a) In addition to the general prohibitions specified in 
Sec. 600.725 of this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to do any of 
the following:
    (1) Take and retain or land salmon caught with a net in the fishery 
management area, except that a hand-held net may be used to bring hooked 
salmon on board a vessel.
    (2) Fish for, or take and retain, any species of salmon:
    (i) During closed seasons or in closed areas;
    (ii) While possessing on board any species not allowed to be taken 
in the area at the time;
    (iii) Once any catch limit is attained;
    (iv) By means of gear or methods other than recreational fishing 
gear or troll fishing gear, or gear authorized under Sec. 660.408(k) for 
treaty Indian fishing;
    (v) In violation of any action issued under this subpart; or
    (vi) In violation of any applicable area, season, species, zone, 
gear, daily bag limit, or length restriction.
    (3) Fish for salmon in an area when salmon of less than the legal 
minimum length for that area are on board the fishing vessel, except 
that this provision does not prohibit transit of an area when salmon of 
less than the legal minimum length for that area are on board, so long 
as no fishing is being conducted.
    (4) Remove the head of any salmon caught in the fishery management 
area, or possess a salmon with the head removed, if that salmon has been 
marked by removal of the adipose fin to indicate that a coded wire tag 
has been implanted in the head of the fish.
    (5) Take and retain or possess on board a fishing vessel any species 
of salmon that is less than the applicable minimum total length, 
including the applicable minimum length for dressed, head-off salmon.
    (6) Possess on board a fishing vessel a salmon, for which a minimum

recreational fishing gear, so long as that gear is legal in the fishery 
for which it is being used.
    (9) Take and retain, possess, or land any steelhead taken in the 
course of commercial fishing in the fishery management area, unless such 
take and retention qualifies as treaty Indian fishing.
    (10) Sell, barter, offer to sell, offer to barter, or purchase any 
salmon taken in the course of recreational salmon fishing.
    (11) Refuse to submit fishing gear or catch subject to such person's

    (12) Take and retain Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) 
except in accordance with regulations of the International Pacific 
Halibut Commission at part 300 of this title. Pacific halibut that 
cannot be retained lawfully must be returned to the water immediately 
and with the least possible injury.
    (13) Violate any other provision of this subpart.
    (b) The fishery management area is closed to salmon fishing except 
as opened by this subpart or superseding regulations or notices. All

[[Page 316]]


<R05>
Sec. 660.406  Exempted fishing.

    (a) NMFS may allow such exempted fishing in the fishery management 
area as may be recommended by the Council, the Federal Government, state 
government, or treaty Indian tribes having usual and accustomed fishing 
grounds in the fishery management area.
    (b) NMFS will not allow any exempted fishery recommended by the 
Council unless NMFS determines that the purpose, design, and 
administration of the exempted fishery are consistent with the goals and 
objectives of the Council's fishery management plan, the national 
standards (section 301(a) of the Magnuson Act), and other applicable 
law.
    (c) Each vessel participating in any exempted fishery recommended by 
the Council and allowed by NMFS is subject to all provisions of this 
subpart, except those portions which relate to the purpose and nature of 
the exempted fishery. These exceptions will be specified in a permit 
issued by the Regional Director to each vessel participating in the 
exempted fishery and that permit must be carried aboard each 
participating vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 660.407  Treaty Indian fishing.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, treaty Indian fishing 
in any part of the fishery management area is subject to the provisions 
of this subpart, the Magnuson Act, and any other regulations issued 
under the Magnuson Act.


<R05>
Sec. 660.408  Annual actions.

    (a) General. NMFS will annually establish or, as necessary, adjust 
management specifications for the commercial, recreational, and treaty 
Indian fisheries by publishing the action in the Federal Register under 
Sec. 660.411. Management specifications are set forth in paragraphs (b) 
through (n) of this section.
    (b) Allowable ocean harvest levels. The allowable ocean harvest for 
commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be expressed in 
terms of season regulations expected to achieve a certain optimum 
harvest level or in terms of a particular number of fish. Procedures for 
determining allowable ocean harvest vary by species and fishery 
complexity, and are documented in the fishery management plan and 
Council documents.
    (c) Allocation of ocean harvest levels--(1) Coho and chinook from 
the U.S.-Canada border to Cape Falcon--(i) Overall allocation schedule. 
Initial allocation of coho and chinook salmon north of Cape Falcon, OR, 
will be based on the following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      Percentage <SUP>1      
 Allowable non-treaty ocean harvest (thousands -------------------------
                   of fish)                     Commercial  Recreational
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coho:                                                                   
  0-300.......................................         25           75  
  >300........................................         60           40  
Chinook:                                                                
  0-100.......................................         50           50  
  >100-150....................................         60           40  
  >150........................................         70          30   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<SUP>1 The percentage allocation is tiered and must be calculated in additive
  steps when the harvest level exceeds the initial tier. For example,   
  for a total allowable ocean harvest of 150,000 chinook, the           
  recreational allocation would be equal to 50 percent of 100,000       
  chinook plus 40 percent of 50,000 chinook or 50,000 + 20,000 = 70,000 
  chinook.                                                              

    (ii) Deviations from allocation schedule. The initial allocation may 
be modified annually in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) through 
(vii) of this section. These deviations from the allocation schedule 
provide flexibility to account for the dynamic nature of the fisheries 
and better achieve the allocation objectives and fishery allocation 
priorities in paragraphs (c)(1)(viii) and (ix) of this section. Total 
allowable ocean harvest will be maximized to the extent possible 
consistent with treaty obligations, state fishery needs, and spawning 
requirements. Every effort will be made to establish seasons and gear 
requirements that provide troll and recreational fleets a reasonable 
opportunity to catch the available harvest. These may include single-
species directed fisheries with landing restrictions for other species.
    (iii) Preseason trades. Preseason species trades (chinook and coho) 
may be made if they are based upon the recommendation of the commercial 
and recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanel representatives for the area 
north of Cape Falcon; simultaneously benefit both the commercial and 
recreational fisheries or benefit one fishery without harming the other; 
and are supported by a socio-economic analysis

[[Page 317]]

that compares the impacts of the recommendation to those of the standard 
allocation schedule to determine the allocation that best meets the 
allocation objectives. This analysis will be made available to the 
public during the preseason process for establishing annual management 
measures. Preseason trades will use an exchange ratio of four coho to 
one chinook as a desirable guideline.
    (iv) Commercial allocation. The commercial allowable ocean harvest 
of chinook and coho derived during the preseason allocation process may 
be varied by major subareas (i.e., north of Leadbetter Point and south 
of Leadbetter Point) if there is need to do so to decrease impacts on 
weak stocks. Deviations in each major subarea will generally not exceed 
50 percent of the allowable ocean harvest of each species that would 
have been established without a geographic deviation in the distribution 
of the allowable ocean harvest. Deviation of more than 50 percent will 
be based on a conservation need to protect the weak stocks and will 
provide larger overall harvest for the entire fishery north of Cape 
Falcon than would have been possible without the deviation.
    (v) Recreational allocation. The recreational allowable ocean 
harvest of chinook and coho derived during the preseason allocation 
process will be distributed among the three major recreational subareas 
as described in the coho and chinook distribution sections below. 
Additionally, based upon the recommendation of the recreational Salmon 
Advisory Subpanel representatives for the area north of Cape Falcon, the 
Council will include criteria in its preseason salmon management 
recommendations to guide any inseason transfer of coho among the 
recreational subareas to meet recreational season duration objectives. 
The Council may also establish additional subarea quotas with a major 
subarea to meet recreational season objectives based on agreement of 
representatives of the affected ports.
    (A) Coho distribution. The preseason recreational allowable ocean 
harvest of coho north of Cape Falcon will be distributed to provide 50 
percent to the area north of Leadbetter Point and 50 percent to the area 
south of Leadbetter Point. In years with no fishery in Washington State 
management area 4B, the distribution of coho north of Leadbetter Point 
will be divided to provide 74 percent to the subarea between Leadbetter 
Point and the Queets River (Westport) and 26 percent to the subarea 
north of the Queets River (Neah Bay/La Push). In years when there is an 
area 4B fishery under state management, 25 percent of the numerical 
value of that fishery shall be added to the recreational allowable ocean 
harvest north of Leadbetter Point prior to applying the sharing 
percentages. That same value would then be subtracted from the Neah Bay/
La Push share in order to maintain the same total distribution north of 
Leadbetter Point.
    (B) Chinook distribution. Subarea distributions of chinook will be 
managed as guidelines based on calculations of the Salmon Technical Team 
with the primary objective of achieving all-species fisheries without 
imposing chinook restrictions (i.e., area closures or bag limit 
reductions). Chinook in excess of all-species fisheries needs may be 
utilized by directed chinook fisheries north of Cape Falcon or by 
negotiating a preseason species trade of chinook and coho between 
commercial and recreational allocations in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (vi) Inseason trades and transfers. Inseason transfers, including 
species trades of chinook and coho, may be permitted in either direction 
between commercial and recreational fishery quotas to allow for 
uncatchable fish in one fishery to be reallocated to the other. Fish 
will be deemed uncatchable by a respective commercial or recreational 
fishery only after considering all possible annual management actions to 
allow for their harvest that are consistent with the harvest management 
objectives specific in the fishery management plan including 
consideration of single species fisheries. Implementation of inseason 
transfers will require consultation with the pertinent commercial and 
recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanel representatives from the area 
involved and the Salmon

[[Page 318]]

Technical Team, and a clear establishment of available fish and impacts 
from the transfer. Inseason trades or transfers may vary from the 
guideline ratio of four coho to one chinook to meet the allocation 
objectives in paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this section.
    (vii) Other inseason provisions. Any increase or decrease in the 
recreational or commercial allowable ocean harvest resulting from an 
inseason restructuring of a fishery or other inseason management action 
does not require reallocation of the overall non-treaty allowable ocean 
harvest north of Cape Falcon between the recreational and commercial 
fisheries. Inseason redistribution of subarea quotas within the 
recreational fishery or the distribution of allowable coho catch 
transfers from the commercial fishery among subareas may deviate from 
the preseason distribution. Inseason management actions may be taken by 
the Regional Director to assure meeting the primary objective of 
achieving all-species fisheries without imposing chinook restrictions in 
each of the recreational subareas north of Cape Falcon. Such actions 
might include, but are not limited to: Closure from 0 to 3, 0 to 6, 3 to 
200, or 5 to 200 nm from shore; closure from a point extending due west 
from Tatoosh Island for 5 nm, then south to a point due west of Umatilla 
Reef Buoy, then due east to shore; closure from North Head at the 
Columbia River mouth north to Leadbetter Point; change in species that 
may be landed; or other actions as prescribed in the annual management 
measures.
    (viii) Allocation objectives. The goal of allocating ocean harvest 
north of Cape Falcon is to achieve, to the greatest degree possible, the 
following objectives for the commercial and recreational fisheries. When 
deviation from the allocation schedule is being considered, these 
objectives will serve as criteria to help determine whether a user group 
will benefit from the deviation.
    (A) Provide recreational opportunity by maximizing the duration of 
the fishing season while minimizing daily and area closures and 
restrictions on gear and daily limits.
    (B) Maximize the value of the commercial harvest while providing 
fisheries of reasonable duration.
    (ix) Fishery allocation priorities. The following fishery allocation 
priorities will provide guidance in the preseason process of 
establishing final harvest allocations and structuring seasons that best 
achieve the allocation objectives. To the extent fish are provided to 
each fishery by the allocation schedule, these priorities do not favor 
one user group over the other and should be met simultaneously for each 
fishery. Seasons may be structured that deviate from these priorities 
consistent with the allocation objectives.
    (A) At total allowable harvest levels up to 300,000 coho and 100,000 
chinook: For the recreational fishery, provide coho for a late June 
through early September all-species season; provide chinook to allow 
access to coho and, if possible, a minimal chinook-only fishery prior to 
the all-species season; and adjust days per week and/or institute area 
restrictions to stabilize season duration. For the commercial fishery, 
provide chinook for a May and early June chinook season and provide coho 
for hooking mortality and/or access to a pink fishery, and ensure that 
part of the chinook season will occur after June 1.
    (B) At total allowable harvest levels above 300,000 coho and above 
100,000 chinook: For the recreational fishery, relax any restrictions in 
the all-species fishery and/or extend the all-species season beyond 
Labor Day as coho quota allows; provide chinook for a Memorial Day 
through late June chinook-only fishery; and adjust days per week to 
ensure continuity with the all-species season. For the commercial 
fishery, provide coho for an all-species season in late summer and/or 
access to a pink fishery; and leave adequate chinook from the May 
through June season to allow access to coho.
    (2) Coho south of Cape Falcon--(i) Allocation schedule. Preseason 
allocation shares of coho salmon south of Cape Falcon, OR, will be 
determined by an allocation schedule, which is based on the following 
formula. The formula will be used to interpolate between allowable 
harvest levels as shown in the table below.

[[Page 319]]

    (A) Up to 350,000 allowable ocean harvest: The first 150,000 fish 
will be allocated to the recreational fishery. Additional fish will be 
allocated 66.7 percent to troll and 33.3 percent to recreational. The 
incidental coho mortality for a commercial all-salmon-except-coho 
fishery will be deducted from the troll allocation. If the troll 
allocation is insufficient for this purpose, the remaining number of 
coho needed for this estimated incidental coho mortality will be 
deducted from the recreational share.
    (B) From 350,000 to 800,000 allowable ocean harvest: The 
recreational allocation is equal to 14 percent of the allowable harvest 
above 350,000 fish, plus 217,000 fish. The remainder of the allowable 
ocean harvest will be allocated to the troll fishery.
    (C) Above 800,000 allowable ocean harvest: The recreational 
allocation is equal to 10 percent of the allowable harvest above 800,000 
fish, plus 280,000 fish. The remainder of the allowable ocean harvest 
will be allocated to the troll fishery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ An incidental coho allowance associated with any commercial all-    
  salmon-except-coho fishery will be deducted from the recreational     
  share of coho during periods of low coho abundance when the commercial
  allocation of coho under the schedule would be insufficient to allow  
  for incidental hooking mortality of coho in the commercial all-salmon-
  except-coho fishery.                                                  

    (ii) Geographic distribution. Allowable harvest south of Cape Falcon 
may be divided and portions assigned to subareas based on considerations 
including, but not limited to, controlling ocean harvest impacts on 
depressed, viable natural stocks within acceptable maximum allowable 
levels; stock abundance; allocation considerations; stock specific 
impacts; relative abundance of the salmon species in the fishery; 
escapement goals; and maximizing harvest potential.
    (iii) Recreational allocation at 167,000 fish or less. When the 
recreational allocation is at 167,000 fish or less, the total 
recreational allowable ocean harvest of coho will be divided between two 
major subareas with independent impact quotas. The initial allocation 
will be 70 percent from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain and 30 percent 
south of Humbug Mountain. Coho transfers between the two impact quotas 
may be permitted on a one-for-one basis, if chinook constraints preclude 
access to coho. Horse Mountain to Point Arena will be managed for an 
impact guideline of 3 percent of the south of Cape Falcon recreational 
allocation. The recreational coho fishery between Humbug Mountain and 
Point Arena may be closed when it is projected that the harvest impact 
between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena, combined with the projected 
harvest impact that will be taken south of Point Arena to the end of the 
season, equals the impact quota for south of Humbug Mountain. The 
recreational fishery for coho salmon south of Point Arena will not close 
upon attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota.
    (iv) Oregon coastal natural coho. At Oregon coastal natural coho 
spawning escapements of 28 or fewer adults per

[[Page 320]]

mile, the allocation provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section 
do not apply. Fisheries will be established that will provide only the 
minimum incidental harvest of Oregon coastal natural coho necessary to 
prosecute other fisheries, and that under no circumstances will cause 
irreparable harm to the Oregon coastal natural coho stock.
    (v) Inseason reallocation. No later than August 15 each year, the 
Salmon Technical Team will estimate the number of coho salmon needed to 
complete the recreational seasons. Any coho salmon allocated to the 
recreational fishery that are not needed to complete the recreational 
seasons will be reallocated to the commercial fishery. Once reallocation 
has taken place, the remaining recreational quota will change to a 
harvest guideline. If the harvest guideline for the recreational fishery 
is projected to be reached on or before Labor Day, the Regional Director 
may allow the recreational fishery to continue through the Labor Day 
weekend only if there is no significant danger of impacting the 
allocation of another fishery or of failing to meet an escapement goal.
    (d) Management boundaries and zones. Management boundaries and zones 
will be established or adjusted to achieve a conservation purpose. A 
conservation purpose protects a fish stock, simplifies management of a 
fishery, or promotes wise use of fishery resources by, for example, 
separating fish stocks, facilitating enforcement, separating conflicting 
fishing activities, or facilitating harvest opportunities. Management 
boundaries and zones will be described by geographical references, 
coordinates (latitude and longitude), LORAN readings, depth contours, 
distance from shore, or similar criteria.
    (e) Minimum harvest lengths. The minimum harvest lengths for 
commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be changed upon 
demonstration that a useful purpose will be served. For example, an 
increase in minimum size for commercially caught salmon may be necessary 
for conservation or may provide a greater poundage and monetary yield 
from the fishery while not substantially increasing hooking mortality. 
The removal of a minimum size for the recreational fishery may prevent 
wastage of fish and outweigh the detrimental impacts of harvesting 
immature fish.
    (f) Recreational daily bag limits. Recreational daily bag limits for 
each fishing area will be set equal to one, two, or three salmon of some 
combination of species. The recreational daily bag limits for each 
fishing area will be set to maximize the length of the fishing season 
consistent with the allowable level of harvest in the area.
    (g) Fishing gear restrictions. Gear restrictions for commercial, 
recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be established or modified 
upon demonstration that a useful purpose will be served. For example, 
gear restrictions may be imposed or modified to facilitate enforcement, 
reduce hooking mortality, or reduce gear expenses for fishermen.
    (h) Seasons--(1) In general. Seasons for commercial and recreational 
fishing will be established or modified taking into account allowable 
ocean harvest levels and quotas, allocations between the commercial and 
recreational fisheries, and the estimated amount of effort required to 
catch the available fish based on past seasons.
    (2) Commercial seasons. Commercial seasons will be established or 
modified taking into account wastage of fish that cannot legally be 
retained, size and poundage of fish caught, effort shifts between 
fishing areas, and protection of depressed stocks present in the fishing 
areas. All-species seasons will be established to allow the maximum 
allowable harvest of pink and sockeye salmon without exceeding allowable 
chinook or coho harvest levels and within conservation and allocation 
constraints of the pink and sockeye stocks.
    (3) Recreational seasons. If feasible, recreational seasons will be 
established or modified to encompass Memorial Day and Labor Day 
weekends, and to avoid the need for inseason closures.
    (i) Quotas (by species, including fish caught 0-3 nm seaward of 
Washington, Oregon, and California). Quotas for commercial, 
recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be established or modified 
to ensure that allowable ocean harvests are not exceeded.

[[Page 321]]

Quotas may be fixed or adjustable and used in conjunction with seasons. 
Any quota established does not represent a guaranteed ocean harvest, but 
a maximum ceiling on catch.
    (j) Selective fisheries. In addition to the all-species seasons and 
the all-species-except-coho seasons established for the commercial and 
recreational fisheries, selective coho-only, chinook-only, or pink-only 
fisheries may be established if harvestable fish of the target species 
are available; harvest of incidental species will not exceed allowable 
levels; proven, documented selective gear exists; significant wastage of 
incidental species will not occur; and the selective fishery will occur 
in an acceptable time and area where wastage can be minimized and target 
stocks are primarily available.
    (k) Treaty Indian fishing. (1) NMFS will establish or modify treaty 
Indian fishing seasons and/or fixed or adjustable quotas, size limits, 
gear restrictions, and/or area restrictions taking into account 
recommendations of the Council, proposals from affected tribes, and 
relevant Federal court proceedings.
    (2) The combined treaty Indian fishing seasons will not be longer 
than necessary to harvest the allowable treaty Indian catch, which is 
the total treaty harvest that would occur if the tribes chose to take 
their total entitlement of the weakest stock in the fishery management 
area, assuming this level of harvest did not create conservation or 
allocation problems on other stocks.
    (3) Any fixed or adjustable quotas established will be consistent 
with established treaty rights and will not exceed the harvest that 
would occur if the entire treaty entitlement to the weakest run were 
taken by treaty Indian fisheries in the fishery management area.
    (4) If adjustable quotas are established for treaty Indian fishing, 
they may be subject to inseason adjustment because of unanticipated coho 
hooking mortality occurring during the season, catches in treaty Indian 
fisheries inconsistent with those unanticipated under Federal 
regulations, or a need to redistribute quotas to ensure attainment of an 
overall quota.
    (l) Yurok and Hoopa Valley tribal fishing rights. For purposes of 
section 303 of the Magnuson Act, the federally reserved fishing rights 
of the Yurok and Hoopa Valley Indian Tribes as set out in a legal 
opinion <SUP>2 dated October 4, 1993, by the Office of the Solicitor, 
Department of the Interior, are applicable law. Under section 303 of the 
Magnuson Act, allowable ocean harvest must be consistent with all 
applicable laws.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Copies of the Solicitor's Opinion are available from the 
Director, Southwest Region, NMFS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (m) Inseason notice procedures. Telephone hotlines and USCG 
broadcasts will provide actual notice of inseason actions for 
commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing.
    (n) Reporting requirements. Reporting requirements for commercial 
fishing may be imposed to ensure timely and accurate assessment of 
catches in regulatory areas subject to quota management. Such reports 
are subject to the limitations described herein. Persons engaged in 
commercial fishing in a regulatory area subject to quota management and 
landing their catch in another regulatory area open to fishing may be 
required to transmit a brief radio report prior to leaving the first 
regulatory area. The regulatory areas subject to these reporting 
requirements, the contents of the radio reports, and the entities 
receiving the reports will be specified annually.

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 34601, July 2, 1996, Sec. 660.408 was 
added. This section contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 660.409  Inseason actions.

    (a) Fixed inseason management provisions. NMFS is authorized to take 
the following inseason management actions annually, as appropriate.
    (1) Automatic season closures based on quotas. When a quota for the 
commercial or the recreational fishery, or both, for any salmon species 
in any portion of the fishery management area is projected by the 
Regional Director to be reached on or by a certain date, NMFS will, by 
an inseason action issued under Sec. 660.411, close the commercial or 
recreational fishery, or

[[Page 322]]

both, for all salmon species in the portion of the fishery management 
area to which the quota applies as of the date the quota is projected to 
be reached.
    (2) Rescission of automatic closure. If a fishery is closed under a 
quota before the end of a scheduled season based on overestimate of 
actual catch, NMFS will reopen that fishery in as timely a manner as 
possible for all or part of the remaining original season provided NMFS 
finds that a reopening of the fishery is consistent with the management 
objectives for the affected species and the additional open period is no 
less than 24 hours. The season will be reopened by an inseason action 
issued under Sec. 660.411.
    (3) Adjustment for error in preseason estimates. NMFS may, by an 
inseason action issued under Sec. 660.411, make appropriate changes in 
relevant seasons or quotas if a significant computational error or 
errors made in calculating preseason estimates of salmon abundance are 
identified, provided that such correction can be made in a timely manner 
to affect the involved fishery without disrupting the capacity to meet 
the objectives of the fishery management plan.
    (b) Flexible inseason management provisions. (1) The Regional 
Director will consult with the Chairman of the Council and the 
appropriate State Directors prior to taking any of the following 
flexible inseason management provisions, which include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
    (i) Modification of quotas and/or fishing seasons.
    (ii) Modification of the species that may be caught and landed 
during specific seasons and the establishment or modification of limited 
retention regulations.
    (iii) Modification of recreational bag limits and recreational 
fishing days per calendar week.
    (iv) Establishment or modification of gear restrictions.
    (v) Modification of boundaries, including landing boundaries, and 
establishment of closed areas.
    (2) Fishery managers must determine that any inseason adjustment in 
management measures is consistent with fishery regimes established by 
the U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Commission, ocean escapement goals, 
conservation of the salmon resource, any adjudicated Indian fishing 
rights, and the ocean allocation scheme in the fishery management plan. 
All inseason adjustments will be based on consideration of the following 
factors:
    (i) Predicted sizes of salmon runs.
    (ii) Harvest quotas and hooking mortality limits for the area and 
total allowable impact limitations, if applicable.
    (iii) Amount of commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian catch 
for each species in the area to date.
    (iv) Amount of commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing 
effort in the area to date.
    (v) Estimated average daily catch per fisherman.
    (vi) Predicted fishing effort for the area to the end of the 
scheduled season.
    (vii) Other factors, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 660.410  Escapement goals.

    (a) Current escapement goals. The following specific escapement 
goals are in effect. Annual management objectives for Washington coastal 
fall, spring, and summer chinook; Puget Sound chinook; Washington 
coastal coho; and Puget Sound coho are developed through fixed 
procedures established in the U.S. District Court.

\1\ Represents adult natural spawning escapement goal for viable natural
  stocks or adult hatchery return goal for stocks managed for artificial
  production.                                                           
\2\ Includes upper and lower river components.                          
\3\ The minimum escapement floor of 35,000 naturally spawning adults may
  be modified only by amendment to the FMP.                             
\4\ At OCN stock sizes below 125 percent of the annual numerical        
  escapement goal, an exploitation rate of up to 20 percent will be     
  allowed for incidental impacts of the combined ocean troll, sport, and
  freshwater fisheries. At OCN spawning escapements of 28 or fewer      
  adults per mile, an exploitation rate of up to 20 percent may be      
  allowed to provide only minimum incidental harvest to prosecute other 
  fisheries, provided the rate chosen will cause no irreparable harm to 
  the OCN stock.                                                        
\5\ These stocks represent a negligible component of the Washington     
  ocean harvest.                                                        

    (b) Modification of escapement goals. NMFS is authorized, through an 
action issued under Sec. 660.411, to modify an escapement goal if--
    (1) A comprehensive technical review of the best scientific 
information available provides conclusive evidence that, in the view of 
the Council and the Salmon Technical Team, justifies modification of an 
escapement goal;
    (2) For Oregon coastal chinook, specific goals are developed within 
the overall goal for north coast and south coast stocks; or
    (3) Action by a Federal court indicates that modification of an 
escapement goal is appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 660.411  Notification and publication procedures.

    (a) Notification and effective dates. (1) Annual and certain other 
actions taken under Secs. 660.408 and 660.410 will be implemented by an 
action published in the Federal Register, and will be effective upon 
filing, unless a later time is specified in the action.
    (2) Inseason actions taken under Sec. 660.409 will be by actual 
notice available from telephone hotlines and USCG broadcasts, as 
specified annually. Inseason actions will also be published in the 
Federal Register as soon as practicable. Inseason actions will be 
effective from the time specified in the actual notice of the action 
(telephone hotlines and USCG broadcasts), or at the time the inseason 
action published in the Federal Register is effective, whichever comes 
first.
    (3) Any action issued under this section will remain in effect until 
the expiration date stated in the action or until rescinded, modified, 
or superseded. However, no inseason action has any effect beyond the end 
of the calendar year in which it is issued.
    (b) Public comment. If time allows, NMFS will invite public comment 
prior to the effective date of any action published in the Federal 
Register. If NMFS determines, for good cause, that an action must be 
filed without affording a prior opportunity for public comment, public 
comments on the action will be received by NMFS for a period of 15 days 
after filing of the action with the Office of the Federal Register.
    (c) Availability of data. The Regional Director will compile in 
aggregate form all data and other information relevant to the action 
being taken and will make them available for public review during normal 
office hours at the Northwest Region, NMFS. For actions affecting 
fisheries occurring primarily or exclusively in the fishery management 
area seaward of California, information relevant to the action also will 
be made available for public review during normal office hours at the 
Southwest Region, NMFS.

1. Types of corals: P=Pink G=Gold B=Bamboo.                                                                     
2. There are no restrictions under this part on the harvest of black corals, except the data submission         
  requirements (Sec.  660.3). State regulations on black coral harvesting are not superseded by this part.      
3. Only \1/5\ of the indicated amount is allowed if nonselective gear is used; that is, the nonselective harvest
  will be multiplied by 5 and counted against the quota. If both selective and nonselective methods are used,   
  the bed will be closed when S+5N=Q, where S=selective harvest amount, N=nonselective harvest amount and       
  Q=total harvest quota, for any single species on that bed.                                                    
4. Only selective gear may be used in the EEZ seaward of the main Hawaiian Islands; i.e., south and east of a   
  line midway between Nihoa and Niihau Islands. Nonselective gear or selective gear may be used in all other    
  portions of exploratory areas.                                                                                
5. S=Selective gear only; N=Nonselective or selective gear.                                                     
6. No authorized fishing for coral in refugia.

<R05>
Sec. 662.4  Recordkeeping and reporting.

    Data regarding fishing vessels, fishing activities, landings and 
processing activities required by the FMP for the reduction and 
nonreduction fisheries are collected by the State of California under 
existing data collection provisions. No additional reports will be 
required of fishermen or processors as long as the data collection and 
reporting systems operated by the State of California continue to 
provide the Secretary with statistical information adequate for 
management. Reporting requirements may be promulgated by emergency 
regulations if this reporting system becomes inadequate for management 
purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 662.5  Vessel identification.

this section, and will be announced on or about August 1 as interim 
final quotas. The quotas will be announced according to the following 
procedure:
    (1) No less than 14 calendar days before the meeting of the 
Council's Anchovy Planning team and Advisory Subpanel, a notice will be 
published in

[[Page 333]]

the Federal Register notifying the public when the estimate of the 
annual spawning biomass will be available. The notice also will announce 
the date and location of a meeting of the Council's Anchovy Planning 
team and Advisory Subpanel, where the estimated spawning biomass and the 
annual quotas will be reviewed and public comments received. This 
meeting is expected to convene during the second week of June.
    (2) All materials relating to the annual quotas will be forwarded to 
the Council and its Scientific and Statistical Committee and will be 
available for public inspection at the Office of the Regional Director.
    (3) On or about August 1, the interim final quotas will be published 
in the Federal Register with an opportunity for public comment.
    (4) At a regular meeting of the Council, the Council will review the 
estimated spawning biomass and harvest quotas and offer time for public 
comment. The Council will either accept the harvest quotas as published 
or recommend to the Regional Director that the numbers be revised. If a 
revision is requested, a justification for the revision must be 
provided. An annual quota may be adjusted only if inaccurate data were 
used or if errors were made in the calculations.
    (5) If the Regional Director determines that a change in a harvest 
quota is justified, NMFS will publish a notice in the Federal Register 
notifying the public of the change and the reasons for the change. If no 
changes are necessary, the interim final quotas will become final 
quotas, and no notice will be published.
    (b) Determination of harvest quotas. The total harvest quota in the 
PAFA will be determined by adding the non-reduction fishery allocation 
in the PAFA and the reduction harvest quota in the PAFA, and they will 
be separately determined by the following formulas.
    (1) When the estimated spawning biomass is less than 300,000 mt, 
there will be no reduction harvest quota and the nonreduction allocation 
in the PAFA will be 4,900 mt.
    (2) When the estimated spawning biomass is equal to or greater than 
300,000 mt, the reduction harvest quota in the PAFA will be 70 percent 
of the estimated spawning biomass in excess of 300,000 mt or 140,000 mt, 
whichever is less, and the nonreduction fishery allocation in the PAFA 
will be 4,900 mt except as specified in Sec. 662.21(b).
    (3) When the estimated spawning biomass is less than 50,000 mt for 2 
consecutive fishing years, there will be no reduction quota and no non-
reduction allocation until the spawning biomass reaches or exceeds 
50,000 mt.
    (4) There is no limit on the harvest of anchovy for live bait, 
except that when the spawning biomass is less than 50,000 mt for 2 
consecutive fishing years, there will be no live bait harvest until the 
spawning biomass reaches or exceeds 50,000 mt.
    (c) Subarea B harvest quota. The reduction harvest quota for subarea 
B will be equal to the reduction harvest quota in the PAFA minus a 
reserve of 10 percent of the reduction harvest quota or 9,072 mt, 
whichever is less. This reserve is allocated to the reduction fishery in 
subarea A except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Reallocation of subarea A reserve. The Secretary may reallocate 
on June 1 from subarea A to subarea B that portion of the reserve 
allocated to subarea A under paragraph (c) of this section which will 
not be harvested in subarea A by the end of the fishing year. This 
amount will be estimated based on catch to date in the current year and 
the expected intentions of processors and fishermen in the reduction 
fishery north of Point Buchon to harvest anchovies in the remaining 
fishing year. Reallocation under this paragraph will be based first on a 
need to increase the subarea B harvest quota and secondly on the 
projected reduction harvest in subarea A to the end of the fishing year.
    (e) Procedure for reallocation of subarea A reserve. (1) The 
Secretary may, by May 1 each year, determine the need to increase the 
subarea B harvest quota as provided in paragraph (d) of this section if 
the expected reduction fishery harvest in subarea B is an amount equal 
to or greater than the subarea B harvest quota. After making a 
determination that the subarea B harvest quota needs to be increased as

[[Page 334]]

provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary will make the 
estimate under paragraph (d) of this section on or about May 15 and, as 
soon as practicable after June 1, announce to all reduction fishing 
vessel owners and operators and licensed anchovy reduction plant 
operators by notice in the Federal Register and other appropriate 
notice--
    (i) The change in the subarea B quota;
    (ii) The reasons for the change; and
    (iii) A summary of, and responses to, any comments submitted under 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (2) The Regional Director will compile in aggregate form all data 
used to make the estimates under paragraph (d) of this section and make 
them available for public inspection during normal business hours at the 
Southwest Regional Office, National Marine Fisheries Service, 300 South 
Ferry Street, Terminal Island, CA 90731.
    (3) Comments from the public on the estimates made under paragraph 
(d) of this section may be submitted to the Regional Director until May 
31.
    (f) Anchovies harvested for reduction and nonreduction purposes in 
the PAFA and adjacent territorial sea will be counted toward the total 
harvest quota.

Sec. 662.21  Closures.

    (a) Closure of the reduction fishery. The Secretary will close the 
reduction fishery during the open season provided in Sec. 662.22 when 
the total harvest quota in the PAFA is taken. The Secretary will close 
only the reduction fishery in subarea B when the subarea B reduction 
harvest quota is taken.
    (b) Closure of the nonreduction fishery. The Secretary will close 
the nonreduction fishery in the PAFA only if the total harvest quota is 
taken.
    (c) Procedure for closing. (1) When the harvest quotas prescribed in 
Sec. 662.20 are about to be taken, the Secretary will announce, by 
notice in the Federal Register and to the Council and the California 
Department of Fish and Game, the date of closure in one or both 
subareas.
    (2) If a reduction fishery closure is announced, the reduction 
fishery in the affected subarea will cease on the date of closure 
specified in the Federal Register notice provided by paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, and will not resume until a final determination of new 
harvest quotas is announced under Sec. 662.20.
    (3) The nonreduction fishery in the PAFA ceases on the date that a 
total harvest quota closure is announced under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, and will not resume until a new harvest quota is announced 
under Sec. 662.20.

Sec. 674.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to implement the fishery management 
plan (FMP) for the High Seas Salmon Fishery off the Coast of Alaska East 
of 175 Degrees East Longitude. The FMP was developed by the North 
Pacific Fishery Management Council under the Magnuson Act.
    (b) This part governs fishing for salmon by fishing vessels of the 
United States in the EEZ seaward of Alaska east of 175 deg. E. 
longitude. All provisions of this part shall remain in effect until 
modified, revoked, or superseded.

[46 FR 33047, June 26, 1981 and 46 FR 57302, Nov. 23, 1981, as amended

    In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson Act and in Sec. 620.2 
of this chapter, the terms used in this part have the following 
meanings:
    ADF&G means the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
    Commercial fishing means fishing for fish for sale or barter.
    Hand troll gear means one or more lines with lures or hooks 
attached, drawn through the water behind a moving vessel, and retrieved 
by hand or hand-cranked reels or gurdies and not by any electrically,

    Management area means the two areas described below:
    (a) West Area means the waters of the EEZ seaward of Alaska which 
are west of 143 deg.53'36'' W. longitude (Cape Suckling).
    (b) East Area means the waters of the EEZ seaward of Alaska east of 
143 deg.53'36'' W. longitude.
    Optimum yield means that amount of any species of salmon which will 
provide the greatest overall benefit to the Nation, with particular 
reference to food production and recreational opportunities, as 
specified in the FMP.
    Personal use fishing means fishing other than commercial fishing.
    Power troll gear means one or more lines, with hooks or lures 
attached, drawn through the water behind a moving vessel, and 
originating from a power gurdy or power-driven spool fastened to the 
vessel, the extension or retraction of which is directly to the gurdy or 
spool.
    Regional Director means the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 
1668, Juneau, AK 99802, telephone 907-586-7221, or an individual to whom

at 53 FR 24655, 24660, June 29, 1988; 55 FR 47775, Nov. 15, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 674.3  Relation to other laws.

    (a) The relation of this part to other laws is set forth in 
Sec. 620.3 of this chapter and paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section.
    (b) For regulations concerning fishing for groundfish in the Gulf of 
Alaska, see part 672 of this chapter.
    (c) This part 674 does not apply to fishing for salmon by vessels 
other than vessels of the United States conducted under the North 
Pacific Fisheries Act of 1954, 16 U.S.C. 1021-1035, part 661 of this 
chapter concerns fishing for salmon seaward of Washington, Oregon, and 
California.
    (d) This part 674 will be administered in close coordination with 
ADF&G's administration for the State of Alaska's regulations governing 
the salmon troll fishery off Southeast Alaska. Because no commercial 
fishing for salmon is permitted in the EEZ west of Cape Suckling, all 
commercial salmon fishing west of Cape Suckling will take place in the 
territorial sea and be subject to Alaska's management authority.

    (c) Transfer of authority to fish for salmon in the management 
area--(1) Holders of State of Alaska power troll permanent entry 
permits. (i) The authority of any person described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section to engage in commercial fishing for salmon 
using power troll gear in the management area shall expire upon the 
transfer of that person's State of Alaska power troll permanent entry 
permit to another and shall be transferred to the new holder of that 
permit.
    (ii) Any person to whom transfer of a State of Alaska power troll 
permanent entry permit is denied by the State of Alaska may apply, with 
the consent of the current holder of that permit, to the Regional 
Director for transfer to the applicant of the current holder's authority 
to engage in commercial fishing for salmon using power troll gear in the 
management area. The Regional Director shall approve the transfer if it 
is determined that the applicant had the ability to participate actively 
in the fishery at the time the application for transfer of the permit 
was filed with the State of Alaska; that the applicant has access to 
power troll gear necessary for participation in the fishery; that the 
State of Alaska has not instituted proceedings to revoke the permit on 
the ground that it was fraudulently obtained; and that the proposed 
transfer of the permit is not a lease. The application shall be filed 
with the Regional Director within thirty days of the denial by the State 
of Alaska of transfer of the permit. The application shall include all 
documents and other evidence submitted to the State of Alaska in support 
of the proposed transfer of the permit and a copy of the State of 
Alaska's decision denying the transfer of the permit. The Regional 
Director may request additional information from the applicant or from 
the State of Alaska to assist in the consideration of the application. 
Upon approval of the application by the Regional Director, the authority 
of the permit holder to engage in commercial fishing for salmon in the 
management

[[Page 339]]

area using power troll gear shall expire, and that authority shall be 
transferred to the applicant.
    (2) Other permits. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, the authority of any person described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii), 
(a)(1)(iii), or (a)(3) of this section to fish for salmon in the 
management area may not be transferred to any other person. Except for 
emergency transfers, the authority to engage in commercial fishing for 
salmon which was transferred under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section 
may not be transferred to any other person except the current holder of 
the State of Alaska power troll permanent entry permit from which that 
authority was originally derived. That authority may be transferred to 
the current holder of that permit upon receipt of written notification 
of the transfer by the Regional Director, from which time the transferee 
under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section shall no longer be authorized 
to engage in commercial fishing for salmon using power troll gear in the 
management area.
    (3) Emergency transfers--authority to use power troll gear. The 
authority of any person described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to 
engage in commercial fishing for salmon using power troll gear in the 
management area may be transferred to another for a period not lasting 
beyond the end of the calendar year of the transfer when sickness, 
injury, or other unavoidable hardship prevents the holder of that 
authority from engaging in such fishing. Such a transfer shall take 
effect automatically upon approval by the State of Alaska of an 
emergency transfer of a State of Alaska power troll entry permit, in 
accordance with the terms of the permit transfer. Any person to whom 
emergency transfer of a State of Alaska power troll entry permit is 
denied by the State of Alaska and any person desiring to obtain 
emergency transfer of a Federal commercial power troll permit previously 
issued by the Regional Director may apply, with the consent of the 
current holder of that permit, to the Regional Director for transfer to 
the applicant of the current holder's authority to engage in commercial 
fishing for salmon using power troll gear in the management area for a 
period not lasting beyond the calendar year of the proposed transfer. 
The Regional Director shall approve the transfer if he determines that 
sickness, injury, or other unavoidable hardship prevents the current 
permit holder from engaging in such fishing; that the applicant had the 
ability to participate actively in the fishery at the time the 
application for emergency transfer of the permit was filed with the 
State of Alaska or, in the case of a Federal permit, with the Regional 
Director; that the applicant has access to power troll gear necessary 
for participation in the fishery; and that the State of Alaska has not 
instituted proceedings to revoke the permit on the ground that it was 
fraudulently obtained. The application in the case of a State of Alaska 
permit shall be filed with the Regional Director within thirty days of 
the denial by the State of Alaska of emergency transfer of the permit. 
The application shall include all documents and other evidence submitted 
to the State of Alaska in support of the proposed emergency transfer of 
the permit and a copy of the State of Alaska's decision denying the 
emergency transfer of the permit. The Regional Director may request 
additional information from the applicant or from the State of Alaska to 
assist in the consideration of the application. Upon approval of the 
application by the Regional Director, the authority of the permit holder 
to engage in commercial fishing for salmon using power troll gear in the 
management area shall expire for the period of the emergency transfer, 
and that authority shall be transferred to the applicant for that 
period.
    (d) Appeals and hearings. (1) A decision by the Regional Director: 
(i) To deny a permit under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section; or (ii) 
to deny transfer of authority to engage in commercial fishing for salmon 
in the management area under paragraph (c) of this section, shall be in 
writing, shall state the facts and reasons therefor, and shall advise 
the applicant of the rights provided in this paragraph (d).
    (2) Any such decision of the Regional Director shall be final thirty 
days after receipt by the applicant, unless an appeal is filed with the 
Assistant Administrator within that time. Failure to

[[Page 340]]

file a timely appeal shall constitute waiver of the appeal. (Address: 
Assistant Administrator, National Marine Fisheries Service, Room 400, 
Page 2 Building, 3300 Whitehaven Street, NW., Washington, DC 20235). 
Appeals under this paragraph shall be in writing, shall set forth the 
reasons why the appellant believes the Regional Director's decision was 
in error, and shall include any supporting facts or documentation. At 
the time the appeal is filed with the Assistant Administrator, the 
appellant may request a hearing with respect to any disputed issue of 
material fact. Failure to request a hearing at this time shall 
constitute a waiver of the hearing. If a request for a hearing is filed, 
the Assistant Administrator may order a hearing if it is determined that 
a hearing is necessary to resolve material issues of fact and shall so 
notify the appellant. If the Assistant Administrator orders a hearing, 
that order shall also serve to appoint a hearing examiner to conduct an 
informal fact finding inquiry into the matter. Following the hearing, 
the hearing examiner shall promptly furnish the Assistant Administrator 
with a report and appropriate recommendations. As soon as practicable 
after considering the matters raised in the appeal, and any report or 
recommendation of the hearing examiner in the event a hearing is held

    (a) Applicability. (1) Annual vessel permit. (i) As a prerequisite 
to sell shark from the management unit or to be eligible for exemption 
from the bag limits specified in Sec. 678.23(b), an owner or operator of 
a vessel that fishes in the EEZ must obtain an annual vessel permit; 
except that there is no Federal requirement for a permit for a vessel 
that fishes exclusively within state waters.
    (ii) For a vessel owned by a corporation or partnership to be 
eligible for a vessel permit, the earned income qualification specified 
in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section must be met by, and the 
statement required by that paragraph must be submitted by, an officer or 
shareholder of the corporation, a general partner of the partnership, or

to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ, landward of the EEZ, or 
outside the EEZ, and without regard to where such shark or gear are 
possessed, taken, or landed. However, when a vessel fishes in the waters 
of a state that has more restrictive regulations on shark fishing, those

Copies of income tax forms and schedules are treated as confidential.
    (c) Application for an annual dealer permit. (1) An application for 
a dealer permit must be submitted and signed by the dealer or an officer 
of a corporation acting as a dealer. The application must be submitted 
to the Regional Director at least 30 days prior to the date on which the

the applicant meets the earned income requirement specified in paragraph 
(b)(2)(vi) of this section. An application is complete when all 
requested forms, information, and documentation have been received and 
the applicant has submitted all applicable reports specified at 
Sec. 678.5 (a) or (b).
    (2) Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the Regional Director

Sec. 678.22  Harvest limitations.

    (a) Finning. (1) The practice of ``finning,'' that is, removing only 
the fins and returning the remainder of the shark to the sea, is 
prohibited in the EEZ or aboard a vessel that has been issued a permit 
pursuant to Sec. 678.4.
    (2) Shark fins that are possessed aboard or off-loaded from a 
fishing vessel must be in proper proportion to the weight of carcasses. 
That is, the weight of fins may not exceed five percent of the weight of 
the carcasses. All fins must be weighed in conjunction with the weighing 
of the carcasses at the vessel's first point of landing and such weights 
of the fins landed must be recorded on the weighout slips submitted by 
the vessel owner or operator under Sec. 678.5(a).
    (3) Shark fins may not be possessed aboard a fishing vessel after 
the vessel's first point of landing.
    (b) Release. A shark that is harvested in the EEZ or harvested by a 
vessel that has been issued a permit pursuant to Sec. 678.4 that is not 
retained--
    (1) Must be released in a manner that will ensure maximum 
probability of survival; and
    (2) If caught by hook and line, must be released by cutting the line 
near the hook without removing the fish from the water.
    (c) Vessel trip limits. (1) A vessel that has been issued a permit 
pursuant to Sec. 678.4 may not possess on any trip, or land from any 
trip, large coastal species in excess of 4,000 lb (1,814 kg), dressed 
weight.
    (2) A shark from any of the three management units may not be 
transferred at sea from a vessel issued an Atlantic shark permit issued 
under Sec. 678.4 to any other vessel.

    (a) Applicability. The bag limits apply to a person who fishes in 
the EEZ or possesses a shark in or from the EEZ aboard a vessel--
    (1) When the vessel does not have on board a permit issued under 
Sec. 678.4; or
    (2) When the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat.
    (b) Bag limits. Bag limits are as follows:
    (1) Large coastal species and pelagic species, combined--4 per 
fishing vessel per trip; and
    (2) Small coastal species--5 per person per day.
    (c) Combination of bag limits. A person to whom the bag limits apply 
may not

[[Page 349]]

combine a bag limit specified in paragraph (b) of this section with a 
bag or possession limit applicable to state waters.
    (d) Responsibility for the bag limits. The operator of a vessel for 
which the bag limits apply is responsible for the vessel trip limit 
applicable to large coastal species and pelagic species combined, and 
for the cumulative bag limit applicable to small coastal species based 
on the number of persons aboard.
    (e) Transfer of sharks. A person for whom a bag limit specified in 
this section applies may not transfer at sea a shark--
    (1) Taken in the EEZ, regardless of where such transfer takes place;

    (c) Adjustments to quotas. The Assistant Administrator may adjust a 
semi-annual quota to reflect actual catches during the preceding semi-
annual period. That is, catch in excess of the semi-annual quota in the 
preceding period may be deducted from the current semi-annual quota and 
catch less than the semi-annual quota may be added. Such adjustments to 
semi-annual quotas will be published in the Federal Register. Quotas may 
also be adjusted under the framework procedure for adjustment of 
management measures, as specified in Sec. 678.26.

<R05>
Sec. 679.1   Purpose and scope.

    Regulations in this part were developed by the Council under the 
Magnuson Act. Along with part 600 of this chapter, these regulations 
implement the following:
    (a) Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska. 
(1) Regulations in this part govern commercial fishing for groundfish in 
the GOA by vessels of the United States (see subparts A, B, D, and E of 
this part).
    (2) The following State of Alaska regulations are not preempted by 
this part for vessels regulated under this part fishing for demersal 
shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District, and which are 
registered under the laws of the State of Alaska: 5 AAC 28.110, fishing 
seasons; 5 AAC 28.130, gear; 5 AAC 28.160, harvest guidelines; 5 AAC 
28.190, harvest of bait by commercial permit holders.
    (b) Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering 
Sea and Aleutian Islands Area. Regulations in this part govern 
commercial fishing for groundfish in the BSAI by vessels of the United 
States (see subparts A, B, C, D, and E of this part).
    (c) Moratorium on entry (applicable through December 31, 1998). 
Regulations in this part govern a moratorium on the entry of new vessels 
in the commercial fisheries for groundfish in the GOA and BSAI and in 
the commercial fisheries for king and Tanner crabs in the BSAI (see 
subparts A and D of this part).
    (d) IFQ Program for sablefish and halibut. The IFQ management plan 
for the commercial fisheries that use fixed gear to harvest sablefish 
and halibut (see subparts A, B, D, and E of this part).
    (1) Sablefish. (i) Regulations in this part govern commercial 
fishing for sablefish by vessels of the United States:
    (A) Using fixed gear within that portion of the GOA and the BSAI 
over which the United States exercises exclusive fishery management 
authority; and

[[Page 352]]

    (B) Using fixed gear in waters of the State of Alaska adjacent to 
the BSAI and the GOA, provided that such fishing is conducted by persons 
who have been issued permits under Sec. 679.4.
    (ii) Regulations in this part do not govern commercial fishing for 
sablefish in Prince William Sound or under a State of Alaska limited 
entry program.
    (2) Halibut. Regulations in this part govern commercial fishing for 
halibut by vessels of the United States using fixed gear, as that term 
is described in 16 U.S.C. 773(d), in and off of Alaska.
    (e) Western Alaska CDQ Program. The goals and purpose of the CDQ 
program are to allocate CDQ to eligible Western Alaska communities to 
provide the means for starting or supporting commercial seafood 
activities that will result in ongoing, regionally based, commercial 
seafood or related businesses (see subparts A, B, C, and E of this 
part).
    (f) Observer requirements/Research Plan. Regulations in this part 
govern elements of the Research Plan for the following fisheries under 
the Council's authority: BSAI groundfish, GOA groundfish, BSAI king and 
Tanner crab in the EEZ; and halibut from Convention waters off Alaska 
(see subpart E of this part).
    (g) Fishery Management Plan for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab 
Fisheries in the BSAI. Regulations in this part govern commercial 
fishing for king and Tanner crab in the BSAI by vessels of the United 
States, including regulations superseding State of Alaska regulations 
applicable to the commercial king and Tanner crab fisheries in the BSAI 
EEZ that are determined to be inconsistent with the FMP (see subparts A, 
B, and E of this part).
    (h) Fishery Management Plan for the Scallop Fishery off Alaska. (1) 
Regulations in this part govern commercial fishing for scallops in the 
Federal waters off Alaska by vessels of the United States (see subparts 
A and F of this part).
    (2) State of Alaska laws that are in addition to, and not in 
conflict with, the regulations in this part are not preempted for 
vessels registered under the laws of the State fishing for scallops in 
the Federal waters off Alaska.

the Regional Director before an application for a moratorium permit 
based on that transfer can be approved. An application for approval of a 
transfer and an application for a moratorium permit may be submitted 
simultaneously.
    (ii) Contents of application. A complete application for approval of 
transfer must include the following information, as applicable, for each 
vessel involved in the transfer of moratorium qualification:
    (A) Name(s), business address(es), and telephone and fax numbers of 
the applicant(s) (including the owners of the moratorium qualification 
that is to be or was transferred and the person who is to receive or 
received the transferred moratorium qualification).
    (B) Name of the vessel whose moratorium qualification is to be or 
was transferred and the name of the vessel that would receive or 
received the transferred moratorium qualification (if any), the state 
registration number of each vessel and, if documented, the USCG 
documentation number of each vessel.
    (C) The original qualifying LOA of the vessel whose moratorium 
qualification is to be or was transferred, its current LOA, and its 
maximum LOA.

Marine Casualty, must be included with the application for transfer.
    (9) Transfer of moratorium qualification (applicable through 
December 31, 1998)--(i) General. A transfer of a vessel's moratorium 
qualification must be approved by the Regional Director before a 
moratorium permit may be issued under this section for the vessel to 
which the qualification is transferred. A moratorium permit is not 
transferrable or assignable. A fishery-specific gear type endorsement(s) 
is not severable from an endorsed permit. A transfer of moratorium 
qualification will not be approved by the Regional Director unless:
    (A) A complete transfer application that satisfies all requirements 
specified in paragraph (c)(8) of this section is submitted;
    (B) The LOA of the vessel to which the moratorium qualification is 
transferred does not exceed the maximum LOA of the original qualifying 
vessel; and
    (C) The moratorium permit associated with the moratorium 
qualification is not revoked or suspended.
    (ii) Vessels lost or destroyed in 1988. The moratorium qualification 
of a vessel that was lost or destroyed before January 1, 1989, may not 
be transferred to another vessel and is not valid for purposes of 
issuing a moratorium permit for that vessel, if salvaged, unless salvage 
began on or before June 24, 1992, and the LOA of the salvaged vessel 
does not exceed its maximum LOA. The moratorium qualification of such a

[[Page 366]]

vessel is not valid for purposes of issuing a moratorium permit for 1998 
unless that vessel is used to make a legal landing of a moratorium 
species from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 1997.
    (iii) Vessels lost or destroyed from 1989 through 1995. The 
moratorium qualification of any vessel that was lost or destroyed on or 
after January 1, 1989, but before January 1, 1996, is valid for purposes 
of issuing a moratorium permit for that vessel, if salvaged, regardless 
of when salvage began, provided that the vessel has not already been 
replaced and the LOA of the salvaged vessel does not exceed its maximum 
LOA. The moratorium qualification of any vessel that was lost or 
destroyed on or after January 1, 1989, but before January 1, 1996, may 
be transferred to another vessel, provided the LOA of that vessel does 
not exceed the maximum LOA of the original qualifying vessel. The 
moratorium qualification of such a vessel is not valid for purposes of 
issuing a moratorium permit for 1998, unless that vessel is used to make 
a legal landing of a moratorium species from January 1, 1996, through 
December 31, 1997.
    (iv) Vessels lost or destroyed after 1995. The moratorium 
qualification of any vessel that was lost or destroyed on or after 
January 1, 1996, is valid for purposes of issuing a moratorium permit 
for that vessel, if salvaged, regardless of when salvage began, provided 
that the vessel has not already been replaced and the LOA of the 
salvaged vessel does not exceed its maximum LOA. The moratorium 
qualification of any vessel that is lost or destroyed on or after 
January 1, 1996, may be transferred to another vessel, providing the LOA 
of that vessel does not exceed the maximum LOA of the original 
qualifying vessel.
    (v) Reconstruction. The moratorium qualification of a vessel is not 
valid for purposes of issuing a moratorium permit if, after June 23, 
1992, reconstruction is initiated that results in increasing the LOA of 
the vessel to exceed the maximum LOA of the original qualifying vessel. 
For a vessel whose reconstruction began before June 24, 1992, and was 
completed after June 24, 1992, the maximum LOA is the LOA on the date 
reconstruction was completed, provided the owner files an application 
for transfer and the Regional Director certifies that maximum LOA and 
approves the transfer based on information concerning the LOA of the 
reconstructed vessel submitted under paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this 
section.
    (10) Appeal--(i) Determination. The Chief, RAM Division, will issue 
an initial administrative determination to each applicant who is denied 
a moratorium permit by that official. An initial administrative 
determination may be appealed by the applicant in accordance with

Sec. 679.6  Experimental fisheries.

    (a) General. For limited experimental purposes, the Regional 
Director may authorize, after consulting with the Council, fishing for 
groundfish in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited. No 
experimental fishing may be conducted unless authorized by an 
experimental fishing permit issued by the Regional Director to the 
participating vessel owner in accordance with the criteria and 
procedures specified in this section. Experimental fishing permits will 
be issued without charge and will expire at the end of a calendar year 
unless otherwise provided for under paragraph (e) of this section.

[[Page 383]]

    (b) Application. An applicant for an experimental fishing permit 
shall submit to the Regional Director, at least 60 days before the 
desired effective date of the experimental fishing permit, a written 
application including, but not limited to, the following information:
    (1) The date of the application.
    (2) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.
    (3) A statement of the purpose and goal of the experiment for which 
an experimental fishing permit is needed, including a general 
description of the arrangements for disposition of all species harvested 
under the experimental fishing permit.
    (4) Technical details about the experiment, including:
    (i) Amounts of each species to be harvested that are necessary to 
conduct the experiment, and arrangement for disposition of all species 
taken.
    (ii) Area and timing of the experiment.
    (iii) Vessel and gear to be used.
    (iv) Experimental design (e.g., sampling procedures, the data and 
samples to be collected, and analysis of the data and samples).
    (v) Provision for public release of all obtained information, and 
submission of interim and final reports.
    (5) The willingness of the applicant to carry observers, if required 
by the Regional Director, and a description of accommodations and work 
space for the observer(s).
    (6) Details for all coordinating parties engaged in the experiment 
and signatures of all representatives of all principal parties.
    (7) Information about each vessel to be covered by the experimental 
fishing permit, including:
    (i) Vessel name.
    (ii) Name, address, and telephone number of owner and master.
    (iii) USCG documentation, state license, or registration number.
    (iv) Home port.
    (v) Length of vessel.
    (vi) Net tonnage.
    (vii) Gross tonnage.
    (8) The signature of the applicant.
    (9) The Regional Director may request from an applicant additional 
information necessary to make the determinations required under this 
section. Any application that does not include all necessary information 
will be considered incomplete. An incomplete application will not be 
considered to be complete until the necessary information is provided in 
writing. An applicant for an experimental fishing permit need not be the 
owner or operator of the vessel(s) for which the experimental fishing 
permit is requested.
    (c) Review procedures. (1) The Regional Director, in consultation 
with the Alaska Fishery Science Center, will review each application and 
will make a preliminary determination whether the application contains 
all the information necessary to determine if the proposal constitutes a 
valid fishing experiment appropriate for further consideration. If the 
Regional Director finds any application does not warrant further 
consideration, the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons 
for the decision.
    (2) If the Regional Director determines any application is complete 
and warrants further consideration, he or she will initiate consultation 
with the Council by forwarding the application to the Council. The 
Council's Executive Director shall notify the applicant of a meeting at 
which the Council will consider the application and invite the applicant 
to appear in support of the application, if the applicant desires. If 
the Regional Director initiates consultation with the Council, NMFS will 
publish notification of receipt of the application in the Federal 
Register with a brief description of the proposal.
    (d) Notifying the applicant. (1) The decision of the Regional 
Director, after consulting with the Council, to grant or deny an 
experimental fishing permit is the final action of the agency. The 
Regional Director shall notify the applicant in writing of the decision 
to grant or deny the experimental fishing permit and, if denied, the 
reasons for the denial, including:
    (i) The applicant has failed to disclose material information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with the application.
    (ii) According to the best scientific information available, the 
harvest to be conducted under the permit would

[[Page 384]]

detrimentally affect living marine resources, including marine mammals 
and birds, and their habitat in a significant way.
    (iii) Activities to be conducted under the experimental fishing 
permit would be inconsistent with the intent of this section or the 
management objectives of the FMP.
    (iv) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit.
    (v) The activity proposed under the experimental fishing permit 
could create a significant enforcement problem.
    (vi) The applicant failed to make available to the public 
information that had been obtained under a previously issued 
experimental fishing permit.
    (vii) The proposed activity had economic allocation as its sole 
purpose.
    (2) In the event a permit is denied on the basis of incomplete 
information or design flaws, the applicant will be provided an 
opportunity to resubmit the application, unless a permit is denied 
because experimental fishing would detrimentally affect marine 
resources, be inconsistent with the management objectives of the FMP, 
create significant enforcement problems, or have economic allocation as 
its sole purpose.
    (e) Terms and conditions. The Regional Director may attach terms and 
conditions to the experimental fishing permit that are consistent with 
the purpose of the experiment, including, but not limited to:
    (1) The maximum amount of each species that can be harvested and 
landed during the term of the experimental fishing permit, including 
trip limitations, where appropriate.
    (2) The number, sizes, names, and identification numbers of the 
vessels authorized to conduct fishing activities under the experimental 
fishing permit.
    (3) The time(s) and place(s) where experimental fishing may be 
conducted.
    (4) The type, size, and amount of gear that may be used by each 
vessel operated under the experimental fishing permit.
    (5) The condition that observers be carried aboard vessels operated 
under an experimental fishing permit.
    (6) Reasonable data reporting requirements.
    (7) Such other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance 
with the purposes of the experimental fishing permit and consistency 
with the FMP objectives.
    (8) Provisions for public release of data obtained under the 
experimental fishing permit.
    (f) Effectiveness. Unless otherwise specified in the experimental 
fishing permit or superseding notification or regulation, an 
experimental fishing permit is effective for no longer than 1 calendar 
year, but may be revoked, suspended, or modified during the calendar 
year. Experimental fishing permits may be renewed following the 
application procedures in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (3) Prohibit or bar by command, impediment, threat, coercion, or by 
refusal of reasonable assistance, an observer from collecting samples, 
conducting product recovery rate determinations, making observations, or 
otherwise performing the observer's duties.
    (4) Harass an observer by conduct that has sexual connotations, has 
the purpose or effect of interfering with the observer's work 
performance, or otherwise creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive 
environment. In determining whether conduct constitutes harassment, the 
totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the conduct and 
the context in which it occurred, will be considered. The determination 
of the legality of a particular action will be made from the facts on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (5) Process or receive fish from a Research Plan fishery without a 
valid permit issued pursuant to this part.
    (6) Deliver fish from a Research Plan fishery to a processor not

<R05>
Sec. 679.20  General limitations.

    This section applies to vessels engaged in directed fishing for 
groundfish in the GOA and BSAI.
    (a) Harvest limits--(1) OY. The OY for BSAI and GOA target species 
and the ``other species'' category is a range that can be harvested 
consistently with this part, plus the amounts of ``nonspecified 
species'' taken incidentally to the harvest of target species and the 
``other species'' category. The species categories are defined in Table 
1 of the specifications as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) BSAI. The OY for groundfish in the BSAI regulated by this 
section and by part 600 of this chapter is 1.4 to 2.0 million mt.
    (ii) GOA. The OY for groundfish in the GOA regulated by this section 
and by part 600 of this chapter is 116,000 to 800,000 mt.
    (2) TAC. NMFS, after consultation with the Council, will specify and 
apportion the annual TAC and reserves for each calendar year among the 
GOA and BSAI target species and the ``other species'' categories. TACs 
in the target species category may be split or combined for purposes of 
establishing new TACs with apportionments thereof under paragraph (c) of 
this section. The sum of the TACs so specified must be within the OY 
range specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) Annual TAC determination. The annual determinations of TAC for 
each target species and the ``other species'' category, and the 
reapportionment of reserves may be adjusted, based upon a review of the 
following:
    (i) Biological condition of groundfish stocks. Resource assessment 
documents prepared annually for the Council that provide information on 
historical catch trend; updated estimates of the MSY of the groundfish 
complex and its component species groups; assessments of the stock 
condition of each target species and the ``other species'' category; 
assessments of the multispecies and ecosystem impacts of harvesting the 
groundfish complex at current levels, given the assessed condition of 
stocks, including consideration of rebuilding depressed stocks; and 
alternative harvesting strategies and related effects on the component 
species group.
    (ii) Socioeconomic considerations. Socioeconomic considerations that 
are consistent with the goals of the fishery management plans for the 
groundfish fisheries of the BSAI and the GOA, including the need to 
promote efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources, including 
minimizing costs; the need to manage for the optimum marketable size of 
a species; the impact of groundfish harvests on prohibited species and 
the domestic target fisheries that utilize these species; the desire to 
enhance depleted stocks; the seasonal access to the groundfish fishery 
by domestic fishing vessels; the commercial importance of a fishery to 
local communities; the importance of a fishery to subsistence users; and 
the need to promote utilization of certain species.
    (4) Sablefish TAC--(i) GOA Eastern Area. Vessels in the Eastern Area 
of the GOA using trawl gear will be allocated 5 percent of the sablefish 
TAC for bycatch in other trawl fisheries.
    (ii) GOA Central and Western Areas--(A) Hook-and-line gear. Vessels 
in the Central and Western Areas of the GOA using hook-and-line gear 
will be allocated 80 percent of the sablefish TAC in each of the Central 
and Western areas.
    (B) Trawl gear. Vessels using trawl gear will be allocated 20 
percent of the sablefish TAC in these areas.
    (iii) Bering Sea subarea--(A) Hook-and-line or pot gear. Vessels in 
the Bering Sea subarea using hook-and-line or pot gear will be allocated 
50 percent of each TAC for sablefish.
    (B) Trawl gear. Vessels in the Bering Sea subarea using trawl gear 
will be allocated 50 percent of each TAC for sablefish.
    (iv) Aleutian Islands subarea--(A) Hook-and-line or pot gear. 
Vessels in the Aleutian Islands subarea using hook-and-line or pot gear 
will be allocated 75 percent of each TAC for sablefish.
    (B) Trawl gear. Vessels in the Aleutian Islands subarea using trawl 
gear will be allocated 25 percent of each TAC for sablefish.

[[Page 389]]

    (5) Pollock TAC--(i) BSAI--(A) Seasonal allowances. The TAC of 
pollock in each subarea or district of the BSAI will be divided, after 
subtraction of reserves, into two allowances. The first allowance will 
be available for directed fishing from 0001 hours Alaska local time 
(A.l.t.) January 1 through 1200 hours, A.l.t. , April 15. The second 
allowance will be available for directed fishing from 1200 hours, 
A.l.t., September 1 through 1200 hours A.l.t., November 1, of each 
fishing year. Within any fishing year, unharvested amounts of the first 
allowance will be added to the second allowance, and harvests in excess 
of the first allowance will be deducted from the second allowance.
    (B) Apportionment to vessels using nonpelagic trawl gear-- (1) 
General. NMFS, in consultation with the Council, may limit the amount of 
pollock TAC that may be taken in the directed fishery for pollock using 
nonpelagic trawl gear.
    (2) Factors to be considered. The Regional Director must consider 
the following information when limiting the amount of pollock TAC that 
is apportioned to the directed fishery for pollock using nonpelagic 
trawl gear:
    (i) The PSC limits and PSC bycatch allowances established under 
Sec. 679.21.
    (ii) The projected bycatch of prohibited species that would occur 
with and without a limit in the amount of pollock TAC that may be taken 
in the directed fishery for pollock using nonpelagic trawl gear.
    (iii) The cost of a limit in terms of amounts of pollock TAC that 
may be taken with nonpelagic trawl gear on the nonpelagic and pelagic 
trawl fisheries.
    (iv) Other factors pertaining to consistency with the goals and 
objectives of the FMP.
    (3) Notification. NMFS will publish proposed and final apportionment 
of pollock TAC to the directed fishery for pollock using nonpelagic 
trawl gear in the Federal Register with notification of proposed and 
final specifications defined in Sec. 679.20.
    (ii) GOA--(A) Apportionment by area. The TAC for pollock in the 
combined GOA Western and Central Regulatory Areas will be apportioned 
among statistical areas 610, 620, and 630 in proportion to the 
distribution of the pollock biomass as determined by the most recent 
NMFS surveys.
    (B) Seasonal allowances. Each apportionment will be divided into 
three seasonal allowances of 25 percent, 25 percent, and 50 percent of 
the apportionment, respectively, corresponding to the three fishing 
seasons defined at Sec. 679.23(d)(2).
    (1) Within any fishing year, any unharvested amount of any seasonal 
allowance will be added proportionately to all subsequent seasonal 
allowances, resulting in a sum for each allowance not to exceed 150 
percent of the initial seasonal allowance.
    (2) Within any fishing year, harvests in excess of a seasonal 
allowance will be deducted proportionately from all subsequent seasonal 
allowances.
    (6) Inshore/offshore apportionments (Applicable through December 31, 
1998)--(i) BSAI pollock. The apportionment of pollock in each BSAI 
subarea or district, and for each seasonal allowance defined in 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, will be allocated 35 percent to 
vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 65 
percent to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore 
component.
    (ii) GOA pollock. The apportionment of pollock in all GOA regulatory 
areas and for each seasonal allowance described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) 
of this section will be allocated entirely to vessels catching pollock 
for processing by the inshore component after subtraction of an amount 
that is projected by the Regional Director to be caught by, or delivered 
to, the offshore component incidental to directed fishing for other 
groundfish species.
    (iii) GOA Pacific cod. The apportionment of Pacific cod in all GOA 
regulatory areas will be allocated 90 percent to vessels catching 
Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component and 10 percent to 
vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the offshore component.
    (iv) Directed fishing allowances and prohibitions. The Regional 
Director may establish separate directed fishing allowances and 
prohibitions authorized under paragraph (d) of this section for:
    (A) BSAI pollock. Vessels catching pollock in the BSAI for 
processing by

[[Page 390]]

the inshore component and for vessels catching pollock for processing by 
the offshore component.
    (B) GOA pollock. Vessels catching pollock in the GOA for processing 
by the inshore component and for vessels catching pollock for processing 
by the offshore component.
    (C) GOA Pacific cod. Vessels catching Pacific cod in the GOA for 
processing by the inshore component and for vessels catching Pacific cod 
for processing by the offshore component.
    (v) Reallocation--(A) BSAI pollock. If, during a fishing year, the 
Regional Director determines that either the inshore or offshore 
component will not be able to process the entire amount of pollock in 
the BSAI allocated to vessels catching pollock for processing by that 
component, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register that 
reallocates the projected unused amount of pollock to vessels catching 
pollock for processing by the other component.
    (B) GOA pollock. If the Regional Director determines that the 
inshore component will not be able to process the entire amount of 
pollock in the GOA allocated to vessels catching pollock for processing 
by the inshore component during a fishing year, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register that reallocates the projected 
unused amount of pollock to vessels catching pollock for processing by 
the offshore component.
    (C) GOA Pacific cod. If, during a fishing year, the Regional 
Director determines that either the inshore or offshore component will 
not be able to process the entire amount of Pacific cod in the GOA 
allocated to vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by that 
component, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register that 
reallocates the projected unused amount of Pacific cod to vessels 
catching Pacific cod for processing by the other component.
    (7) Pacific cod TAC, BSAI (Applicable through December 31, 1996)--
(i) TAC by gear. (A) The BSAI TAC of Pacific cod, after subtraction of 
reserves, will be allocated 2 percent to vessels using jig gear, 44 
percent to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 54 percent to 
vessels using trawl gear.
    (B) The Regional Director may establish separate directed fishing 
allowances and prohibitions authorized under paragraph (d) of this 
section for vessels harvesting Pacific cod using jig gear, hook-and-line 
or pot gear, or trawl gear.
    (ii) Unused gear allocation. If, during a fishing year, the Regional 
Director determines that vessels using trawl gear or hook-and-line or 
pot gear will not be able to harvest the entire amount of Pacific cod in 
the BSAI allocated to those vessels under paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this 
section, NMFS may reallocate the projected unused amount of Pacific cod 
to vessels harvesting Pacific cod using the other gear type(s) through 
notification in the Federal Register.
    (iii) Reallocation of TAC specified for jig gear. On or about 
September 1 of each year, the Regional Director will reallocate 45 
percent of any unused amount of Pacific cod in the BSAI allocated to 
vessels using jig gear to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear and 55 
percent of any unused amount of Pacific cod allocated to vessels using 
jig gear to vessels using trawl gear through publication in the Federal 
Register.
    (iv) Seasonal TAC apportionment--(A) Allocation periods. In the 
publications of proposed and final harvest limit specifications required 
under paragraph (c) of this section, NMFS, after consultation with the 
Council, may seasonally apportion the amount of Pacific cod TAC in the 
BSAI allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear under 
paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section among the following three periods: 
January 1 through April 30; May 1 through August 31; and September 1 
through December 31.
    (B) Factors to be considered. NMFS will base any seasonal 
apportionment of the Pacific cod allocation to vessels using hook-and-
line or pot gear on the following information:
    (1) Seasonal distribution of Pacific cod relative to prohibited 
species distribution.
    (2) Expected variations in prohibited species bycatch rates 
experienced in the Pacific cod fisheries throughout the fishing year.

[[Page 391]]

    (3) Economic effects of any seasonal apportionment of Pacific cod on 
the hook-and-line and pot-gear fisheries.
    (8) All other groundfish TAC. The initial TAC for each target 
species and the ``other species'' category will be 85 percent of the TAC 
as provided under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Reserves--(1) BSAI--(i) General. Fifteen percent of the BSAI TAC 
for each target species and the ``other species'' category, except the 
hook-and-line and pot gear allocation for sablefish, is automatically 
placed in a reserve, and the remaining 85 percent of the TAC is 
apportioned for each target species and the ``other species'' category, 
except the hook-and-line and pot gear allocation for sablefish.
    (ii) Nonspecified reserve. The reserve is not designated by species 
or species group, and any amount of the reserve may be apportioned to a 
target species, except the hook-and-line gear and pot gear allocation 
for sablefish, or the ``other species'' category, provided that such 
apportionments are consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section and 
do not result in overfishing of a target species or the ``other 
species'' category.
    (iii) Inshore/offshore reapportionment (Applicable through December 
31, 1998). Any amounts of the BSAI nonspecific reserve that are 
reapportioned to pollock as provided by this paragraph (b) must be 
apportioned between inshore and offshore components in the same 
proportion specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.
    (iv) Pacific cod (Applicable through December 31, 1996). Any amounts 
of the BSAI nonspecific reserve that are apportioned to Pacific cod as 
provided by this paragraph (b) must be apportioned between vessels using 
jig, hook-and-line or pot, and trawl gear in the same proportion 
specified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, unless the Regional 
Director determines under paragraph (a)(7) (ii) or (iii) of this section 
that vessels using a certain gear type will not be able to harvest the 
additional amount of Pacific cod. In this case, the nonspecific reserve 
will be apportioned to vessels using the other gear type(s).
    (2) GOA. Initial reserves are established for pollock, Pacific cod, 
flounder, and ``other species,'' which are equal to 20 percent of the 
TACs for these species or species groups.
    (3) Apportionment of BSAI reserves--(i) Notification. (A) As soon as 
practicable after April 1, June 1, and August 1, and on such other dates 
as NMFS determines appropriate, NMFS will, by notification in the 
Federal Register, apportion all or part of the BSAI reserve in 
accordance with this paragraph (b).
    (B) No apportionment, retention, or PSC limit adjustment may take 
effect until notification has been published in the Federal Register 
with a statement of the findings upon which the apportionment, 
retention, or adjustment is based.
    (ii) Apportionment--(A) General. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, NMFS will apportion the amount of BSAI 
reserve that will be harvested by U.S. vessels during the remainder of 
the year.
    (B) Exception. Part or all of the reserve may be withheld if an 
apportionment would adversely affect the conservation of groundfish 
resources or prohibited species.
    (iii) Public comment--(A) Prior comment. NMFS will provide all 
interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed 
apportionments, retentions, or PSC limit adjustments under this 
paragraph (b) before such apportionments, retentions, or adjustments are 
made, unless NMFS finds that there is good cause for not providing a 
prior comment opportunity, and publishes the reasons therefor in the 
notification of apportionment, retention, or adjustment.
    (B) Submittal dates. Comments provided for in this paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) must be received by NMFS not later than 5 days before April 
1, June 1, and August 1, or other dates that may be specified.
    (C) Subsequent comment. If NMFS determines for good cause that 
notification of apportionment, retention or PSC limit adjustment must be 
issued without providing interested persons a prior opportunity for 
public comment, comments on the apportionment, retention or adjustment 
will be received for a period of 15 days after its effective date.

[[Page 392]]

    (D) Response to comments. NMFS will consider all timely comments in 
deciding whether to make a proposed apportionment, retention, or PSC 
limit adjustment or to modify an apportionment, retention, or adjustment 
that previously has been made, and shall publish responses to those 
comments in the Federal Register as soon as practicable.
    (E) Data available. The Regional Director will make available to the 
public during business hours the aggregate data upon which any 
preliminary TAC or PSC limit figure is based or the data upon which any 
apportionment or retention of surplus or reserve, or PSC limit 
adjustment was or is proposed to be based. These data will be available 
for a sufficient period to facilitate informed comment by interested 
persons.
    (c) Annual specifications--(1) Proposed specifications--
    (i) General--(A) Notification. As soon as practicable after 
consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish proposed specifications 
for the succeeding fishing year. The proposed specifications will 
reflect as accurately as possible the projected changes in U.S. 
harvesting and processing capacity and the extent to which U.S. 
harvesting and processing will occur during the coming year.
    (B) Public comment. NMFS will accept public comment on the proposed 
specifications for 30 days from the date of publication in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) GOA. The GOA proposed specifications will specify annual TAC 
amounts for each target species and the ``other species'' category and 
apportionments thereof established under Sec. 679.20(a)(2), halibut 
prohibited species catch amounts established under Sec. 679.21, seasonal 
allowances of pollock, and inshore/offshore Pacific cod.
    (iii) BSAI. The BSAI proposed specifications will specify the annual 
TAC and initial TAC amounts for each target species and the ``other 
species'' category and apportionments thereof established under 
Sec. 679.20(a)(2), prohibited species catch allowances established under 
Sec. 679.21, seasonal allowances of pollock TAC, and reserve amounts 
established under Sec. 679.31(a) and (c) for pollock CDQ and sablefish 
CDQ.
    (2) Interim specifications. Interim harvest specifications will be 
in effect on January 1 and will remain in effect until superseded by the 
filing of the final specifications by the Office of the Federal 
Register. Interim specifications will be established as follows:
    (i) GOA. One-fourth of each proposed TAC and apportionment thereof 
(not including the reserves or the first seasonal allowance of pollock), 
one-fourth of the proposed halibut prohibited species catch amounts, and 
the proposed first seasonal allowance of pollock.
    (ii) BSAI. Except for the hook-and-line and pot gear allocation of 
sablefish, one-fourth of each proposed initial TAC and apportionment 
thereof (not including the first seasonal allowance of pollock), one-
fourth of the proposed prohibited species catch allowance established 
under Sec. 679.21, and the proposed first seasonal allowance of pollock.
    (3) Final specifications--(i) Notification. NMFS will consider 
comments on the proposed specifications received during the comment 
period and, after consultation with the Council, will publish final 
specifications in the Federal Register. The final specifications will 
supersede the interim specifications.
    (ii) GOA. The final specifications will specify the annual TAC for 
each target species and the ``other species'' category and 
apportionments thereof, halibut prohibited species catch amounts, and 
seasonal allowances of pollock.
    (iii) BSAI. The final specifications will specify the annual TAC for 
each target species and the ``other species'' category and 
apportionments thereof, prohibited species catch allowances, seasonal 
allowances of the pollock TAC, and the sablefish CDQ reserve amount 
established under Sec. 679.31(c).
    (4) Inshore/offshore allocations (Applicable through December 31, 
1998). The proposed, interim, and final specifications will specify the 
allocation of GOA Pacific cod, GOA pollock, and BSAI pollock for 
processing by the inshore and offshore components, and any seasonal 
allowances thereof, as authorized under paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(7) of 
this section.
    (5) BSAI Pacific cod gear allocations (Applicable through December 
31, 1996).

[[Page 393]]

The proposed, interim, and final specifications will specify the 
allocation of BSAI Pacific cod among gear types as authorized under 
paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (d) Fishery closures--(1) Directed fishing allowance--(i) General. 
If the Regional Director determines that any allocation or apportionment 
of a target species or ``other species'' category specified under 
paragraph (c) of this section has been or will be reached, the Regional 
Director may establish a directed fishing allowance for that species or 
species group.
    (ii) Specified fishery amounts--(A) Inseason adjustments. The 
category allocations or apportionments established under paragraph (c) 
of this section may be revised by inseason adjustments for a given 
species or species group or pollock allowance, as identified by 
regulatory area, subarea, or district, and, if applicable, as further 
identified by gear type.
    (B) Incidental catch. In establishing a directed fishing allowance, 
the Regional Director shall consider the amount of the allocation or 
apportionment established under paragraph (c) of this section that will 
be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in 
the same subarea, regulatory area, or district.
    (iii) Directed fishing closure--(A) Notification. If the Regional 
Director establishes a directed fishing allowance for a fishery 
allocation or apportionment under this paragraph (d), and that allowance 
has been or will be reached before the end of the fishing season or 
year, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register prohibiting 
directed fishing in the specified subarea, regulatory area, or district.
    (B) Retention of bycatch species. If directed fishing for a target 
species or the ``other species'' category is prohibited, a vessel may 
not retain that bycatch species in an amount that exceeds the maximum 
retainable bycatch amount, as calculated under paragraphs (e) and (f) of 
this section, at any time during a fishing trip.
    (2) Groundfish as prohibited species closure. When the Regional 
Director determines that the TAC of any target species or the ``other 
species'' category specified under paragraph (c) of this section has 
been or will be achieved prior to the end of a year, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register requiring that target species or 
the ``other species'' be treated in the same manner as a prohibited 
species, as described under Sec. 679.21(b), for the remainder of the 
year.
    (3) Overfishing closure--(i) Notification. If, in making a 
determination under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Regional 
Director also determines that fishing for other target species or 
species groups in the area, district or part thereof where the 
notification applies, may lead to the overfishing of the species or 
species group for which the allocation or apportionment has been or will 
be reached, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
specifying limitations or prohibitions designed to prevent overfishing 
of that species or species group.
    (ii) Limitations and prohibitions. These limitations and 
prohibitions may prohibit directed fishing for other species or species 
groups in the area, district, or part thereof where the notification 
applies, or may limit time, area, or gear types that may be used in 
directed fishing for the other species or species groups.
    (iii) Factors to be considered. When making the determinations 
specified under paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section, 
the Regional Director may consider allowing fishing to continue or 
resume with certain gear types or in certain areas and times based on 
findings of:
    (A) The risk of biological harm to a groundfish species or species 
group for which the TAC or PSC limit is or will be reached.
    (B) The risk of socioeconomic harm to authorized users of the 
groundfish for which the TAC or PSC limit will be or has been reached.
    (C) The impact that the continued closure might have on the 
socioeconomic well-being of other domestic fisheries.
    (e) Maximum retainable bycatch amounts--(1) Proportion of basis 
species. The maximum retainable bycatch amount for a bycatch species or 
species group is calculated as a proportion of the basis species 
retained on board the vessel using the retainable percentages

[[Page 394]]

in Table 10 to this part for the GOA species categories and in Table 11 
to this part for the BSAI species categories.
    (2) Calculation. (i) To calculate the maximum retainable bycatch 
amount for a specific bycatch species, an individual retainable bycatch 
amount must be calculated with respect to each basis species that is 
retained on board that vessel.
    (ii) To obtain these individual retainable bycatch amounts, multiply 
the appropriate retainable percentage for the bycatch species/basis 
species combination, set forth in Table 10 to this part for the GOA 
species categories and Table 11 to this part for the BSAI species 
categories, by the amount of that basis species, in round-weight 
equivalents.
    (iii) The maximum retainable bycatch amount for that specific 
bycatch species is the sum of the individual retainable bycatch amounts.
    (f) Directed fishing calculations and determinations--(1) Round-
weight equivalents. Any determination concerning directed fishing, the 
amount or percentage of any species, species group, or any fish or fish 
products must be calculated in round-weight equivalents.
    (2) Retainable amounts. Arrowtooth flounder, or any groundfish 
species for which directed fishing is closed, may not be used to 
calculate retainable amounts of other groundfish species.
    (g) Allowable retention of pollock roe--(1) Percentage of pollock 
roe. (i) Pollock roe retained on board a vessel at any time during a 
fishing trip must not exceed 7 percent of the total round-weight 
equivalent of pollock, as calculated from the primary pollock product on 
board the vessel during the same fishing trip.
    (ii) Determinations of allowable retention of pollock roe will be 
based on amounts of pollock harvested, received, or processed during a 
single fishing trip.
    (iii) Pollock or pollock products from previous fishing trips that 
are retained on board a vessel may not be used to determine the 
allowable retention of pollock roe for that vessel.
    (2) Primary product. (i) For purposes of this paragraph (g), only 
one primary pollock product per fish, other than roe, may be used to 
calculate the round-weight equivalent.
    (ii) A primary pollock product that contains roe (such as headed and 
gutted pollock with roe) may not be used to calculate the round-weight 
equivalent of pollock.
    (iii) The primary pollock product must be distinguished from 
ancillary pollock products in the DCPL required under Sec. 679.5. 
Ancillary products are those such as meal, heads, internal organs, 
pectoral girdles, or any other product that may be made from the same 
fish as the primary product.
    (3) Pollock product recovery rates (PRRs). Only the following 
product types and standard PRRs may be used to calculate round-weight 
equivalents for pollock for purposes of this paragraph (g):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Standard 
                                                               product

31.......................  Mince...........................         0.22
32.......................  Meal............................         0.17
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Calculation of retainable pollock roe--(i) Round-weight 
equivalent. (A) To calculate the amount of pollock roe that can be 
retained on board during a fishing trip, first calculate the round-
weight equivalent by dividing the total amount of primary product on 
board by the appropriate PRR.

[[Page 395]]

    (B) To determine the maximum mount of pollock roe that can be 
retained on board a vessel during the same fishing trip, multiply the 
round-weight equivalent by 0.07.
    (C) Pollock roe retained on board from previous fishing trips will 
not be counted.
    (ii) Two or more products from different fish. (A) If two or more 
products, other than roe, are made from different fish, round-weight 
equivalents are calculated separately for each product.
    (B) To determine the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be 
retained on board a vessel during a fishing trip, add the round-weight 
equivalents together; then, multiply the sum by 0.07.
    (iii) Two or more products from same fish. If two or more products, 
other than roe, are made from the same fish, the maximum amount of 
pollock roe that can be retained during a fishing trip is determined 
from the primary product.
    (5) Primary pollock product--(i) Process prior to transfer. Any 
primary pollock product used to calculate retainable amounts of pollock 
roe must be frozen, canned, or reduced to meal by the vessel retaining 
the pollock roe prior to any transfer of the product to another vessel.
    (ii) No discard of processed product. Any pollock product that has 
been frozen, canned, or reduced to meal may not be discarded at sea.
    (h) Standard product types and standard PRRs--(1) Calculating round-
weight equivalents from standard PRRs. Round-weight equivalents for 
groundfish products are calculated using the product codes and standard 
PRRs specified in Table 3 of this part.
    (2) Adjustments. The Regional Director may adjust standard PRRs and 
product types specified in Table 3 of this part if he or she determines 
that existing standard PRRs are inaccurate or if new product types are 
developed.
    (i) Adjustments to any standard PRR listed in Table 3 of this part 
that are within and including 15 percent of that standard PRR may be 
made without providing notification and opportunity for prior public 
comment.
    (ii) Adjustments of any standard PRR during a calendar year, when 
aggregated with all other adjustments made during that year, will not 
exceed 15 percent of the standard PRR listed in Table 3 of this part at 
the beginning of that calendar year.
    (iii) No new product type will be announced until NMFS publishes the 
proposed adjustment and/or new product type in the Federal Register and 
provides the public with at least 30 days opportunity for public 
comment.
    (iv) Any adjustment of a PRR that acts to further restrict the 
fishery will not be effective until 30 days after the date of 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (v) If NMFS makes any adjustment or announcement without providing a 
prior notification and opportunity for prior public comment, the 
Regional Director will receive public comments on the adjustment or 
announcement for a period of 15 days from the date of publication in the 
Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 679.21  Prohibited species bycatch management.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all vessels required 
to have a Federal fisheries permit under Sec. 679.4.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided, this section also applies to all 
motherships and shoreside processors that receive groundfish from 
vessels required to have a Federal fisheries permit under Sec. 679.4.
    (b) General-- (1) Definition. Prohibited species, for the purpose of 
this part, means any of the species of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus 
spp.), steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), halibut, Pacific herring 
(Clupea harengus pallasi), king crab, and Tanner crab caught by a vessel 
regulated under this part while fishing for groundfish in the BSAI or 
GOA, unless retention is authorized by other applicable laws, including 
the annual management measures published in the Federal Register 
pursuant to Sec. 300.62 of this title.
    (2) Prohibited species catch restrictions. The operator of each 
vessel engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the GOA or BSAI 
must:
    (i) Minimize its catch of prohibited species.

[[Page 396]]

    (ii) Sort its catch as soon as possible after retrieval of the gear 
and, except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section or 
Sec. 679.26, must return all prohibited species or parts thereof to the 
sea immediately, with a minimum of injury, regardless of its condition, 
after allowing for sampling by an observer if an observer is aboard.
    (3) Rebuttable presumption. Except as provided under paragraph (c) 
of this section, it will be a rebuttable presumption that any prohibited 
species retained on board a fishing vessel regulated under this part was 
caught and retained in violation of this section.
    (4) Prohibited species taken seaward of the EEZ off Alaska. No 
vessel fishing for groundfish in the GOA or BSAI may have on board any 
species listed in this paragraph (b) that was taken in waters seaward of 
these management areas, regardless of whether retention of such species 
was authorized by other applicable laws.
    (c) Salmon taken in BSAI trawl fishery-- (1) Salmon discard. Except 
as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the operator of a 
vessel and the manager of a shoreside processor must not discard any 
salmon or transfer or process any salmon under the SDP at Sec. 679.26, 
if the salmon were taken incidental to a directed fishery for BSAI 
groundfish by vessels using trawl gear until the number of salmon has 
been determined by a NMFS-certified observer and the collection of any 
scientific data or biological samples from the salmon has been 
completed.
    (2) Salmon retention and storage. (i) Operators of vessels carrying 
observers aboard and whose fishing operations allow for sorting of BSAI 
groundfish catch for salmon must retain all salmon bycatch from each 
haul in a separate bin or other location that allows an observer free 
and unobstructed physical access to the salmon to count each fish and 
collect any scientific data or biological samples. Salmon from different 
hauls must be retained separately in a manner that identifies the haul 
from which the salmon were taken.
    (ii) Operators of vessels not carrying observers aboard or whose 
fishing operations do not allow for sorting of BSAI groundfish catch for 
salmon must ice, freeze, or store in a refrigerated saltwater tank all 
salmon taken as bycatch in trawl operations for delivery to the 
processor receiving the vessel's BSAI groundfish catch.
    (iii) Processors receiving BSAI groundfish harvested in a directed 
fishery for groundfish using trawl gear must retain all salmon delivered 
by each trawl vessel during a weekly reporting period in separate bins 
marked with the vessel's name and ADF&G fish ticket number(s) for each 
delivery until a NMFS-certified observer has counted each salmon and 
collected any scientific data or biological samples from the salmon 
delivered to the processor by that vessel. Processors without an 
observer present must store whole salmon in an iced or frozen state 
until an observer is available to count each fish. Salmon must be stored 
at a location that allows an observer free and unobstructed physical 
access to each salmon.
    (3) Exemption. Motherships and shoreside processors that are exempt 
from obtaining observer coverage during a month under Sec. 679.52 are 
exempt from mandatory retention of salmon.
    (4) Assignment of crew to assist observer. Operators of vessels and 
managers of shoreside processors that are required to retain salmon 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must designate and identify to 
the NMFS-certified observer aboard the vessel or at the shoreside 
processor a crew person or employee to be responsible for sorting, 
retention, and storage of salmon. Upon request of the NMFS-certified 
observer, the designated crew person or employee also is responsible for 
counting salmon and taking biological samples from retained salmon under 
the direction of the observer.
    (5) Release of salmon. Salmon must be returned to Federal waters as 
soon as is practicable, with a minimum of injury, regardless of 
condition, following notification by a NMFS-certified observer that the 
number of salmon has been determined and the collection of any 
scientific data or biological samples has been completed.
    (d) GOA halibut PSC limits. This section is applicable for vessels 
engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the GOA.

[[Page 397]]

    (1) Notification--(i) Proposed and final limits and apportionments. 
NMFS will publish annually in the Federal Register proposed and final 
halibut PSC limits and apportionments thereof in the notification 
required under Sec. 679.20.
    (ii) Modification of limits. NMFS, by notification in the Federal 
Register, may change the halibut PSC limits during the year for which 
they were specified, based on new information of the types set forth in 
this paragraph (d)(1).
    (2) Public comment. NMFS will accept public comment on the proposed 
halibut PSC limits, and apportionments thereof, for a period of 30 days 
from the date of publication in the Federal Register. NMFS will consider 
comments received on proposed halibut limits and, after consultation 
with the Council, will publish notification in the Federal Register 
specifying the final halibut PSC limits and apportionments thereof.
    (3) Trawl gear proposed halibut limit--(i) Notification. After 
consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish notification in the 
Federal Register specifying the proposed halibut PSC limit for vessels 
using trawl gear.
    (ii) Bycatch allowance. The halibut PSC limit specified for vessels 
using trawl gear may be further apportioned as bycatch allowances to the 
fishery categories listed in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, 
based on each category's proportional share of the anticipated halibut 
bycatch mortality during a fishing year and the need to optimize the 
amount of total groundfish harvest under the halibut PSC limit. The sum 
of all bycatch allowances will equal the halibut PSC limit established 
under this paragraph (d).
    (iii) Trawl fishery categories. For purposes of apportioning the 
trawl halibut PSC limit among fisheries, the following fishery 
categories are specified and defined in terms of round-weight 
equivalents of those GOA groundfish species for which a TAC has been 
specified under Sec. 679.20:
    (A) Shallow-water species fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during 
any weekly reporting period that results in a retained aggregate catch 
of pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka 
mackerel, and ``other species'' that is greater than the retained 
aggregate amount of other GOA groundfish species or species group.
    (B) Deep-water species fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any 
weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of groundfish 
and is not a shallow-water species fishery as defined under paragraph 
(d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (4) Hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries--(i) Notification. After 
consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish notification in the 
Federal Register specifying the proposed and final halibut PSC limits 
for vessels using hook-and-line gear. The notification also may specify 
a halibut PSC limit for the pot gear fisheries.
    (ii) Halibut bycatch allowance. The halibut PSC limit specified for 
vessels using hook-and-line gear may be further apportioned, as bycatch 
allowances, to the fishery categories listed in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of 
this section, based on each category's proportional share of the 
anticipated halibut bycatch mortality during a fishing year and the need 
to optimize the amount of total groundfish harvest under the halibut PSC 
limit. The sum of all bycatch allowances will equal the halibut PSC 
limit established under this paragraph (d).
    (iii) Hook-and-line fishery categories. For purposes of apportioning 
the hook-and-line halibut PSC limit among fisheries, the following 
fishery categories are specified and defined in terms of round-weight 
equivalents of those GOA groundfish species for which a TAC has been 
specified under Sec. 679.20.
    (A) Demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District. 
Fishing with hook-and-line gear in the Southeast Outside District of the 
GOA Eastern Regulatory Area (SEEO) during any weekly reporting period 
that results in a retained catch of demersal shelf rockfish that is 
greater than the retained amount of any other fishery category defined 
under this paragraph (d)(4)(iii).
    (B) Sablefish fishery. Fishing with hook-and-line gear during any 
weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of sablefish 
that is greater than the retained amount of any other

[[Page 398]]

fishery category defined under this paragraph (d)(4)(iii).
    (C) Other hook-and-line fishery. Fishing with hook-and-line gear 
during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of 
groundfish and is not a demersal shelf rockfish fishery or a sablefish 
fishery defined under paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (5) Seasonal apportionments--(i) General. NMFS, after consultation 
with the Council, may apportion each halibut PSC limit or bycatch 
allowance specified under this paragraph (d) on a seasonal basis.
    (ii) Factors to be considered. NMFS will base any seasonal 
apportionment of a halibut PSC limit or bycatch allowance on the 
following types of information:
    (A) Seasonal distribution of halibut.
    (B) Seasonal distribution of target groundfish species relative to 
halibut distribution.
    (C) Expected halibut bycatch needs, on a seasonal basis, relative to 
changes in halibut biomass and expected catches of target groundfish 
species.
     (D) Expected variations in bycatch rates throughout the fishing 
year.
     (E) Expected changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons.
     (F) Expected start of fishing effort.
     (G) Economic effects of establishing seasonal halibut allocations 
on segments of the target groundfish industry.
     (iii) Unused seasonal apportionments. Unused seasonal 
apportionments of halibut PSC limits specified for trawl, hook-and-line, 
or pot gear will be added to the respective seasonal apportionment for 
the next season during a current fishing year.
     (iv) Seasonal apportionment exceeded. If a seasonal apportionment 
of a halibut PSC limit specified for trawl, hook-and-line, or pot gear 
is exceeded, the amount by which the seasonal apportionment is exceeded 
will be deducted from the respective apportionment for the next season 
during a current fishing year.
     (6) Apportionment among regulatory areas and districts. Each 
halibut PSC limit specified under this paragraph (d) also may be 
apportioned among the GOA regulatory areas and districts.
     (7) Halibut PSC closures--(i) Trawl gear fisheries. If, during the 
fishing year, the Regional Director determines that U.S. fishing vessels 
participating in either of the trawl fishery categories listed in 
paragraph (d)(3)(iii) (A) or (B) of this section will catch the halibut 
bycatch allowance, or apportionments thereof, specified for that fishery 
category under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register closing the entire GOA or the 
applicable regulatory area or district to directed fishing with trawl 
gear for each species and/or species group that comprises that fishing 
category; provided, however, that when the halibut bycatch allowance, or 
seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for the shallow-water species 
fishery is reached, fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl 
gear may continue, consistent with other provisions of this part.
     (ii) Hook-and-line fisheries. If, during the fishing year, the 
Regional Director determines that U.S. fishing vessels participating in 
any of the three hook-and-line gear fishery categories listed under 
paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section will catch the halibut bycatch 
allowance, or apportionments thereof, specified for that fishery 
category under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register closing the entire GOA or the 
applicable regulatory area or district to directed fishing with hook-
and-line gear for each species and/or species group that comprises that 
fishing category.
     (iii) Pot gear fisheries. If, during the fishing year, the Regional 
Director determines that the catch of halibut by operators of vessels 
using pot gear to participate in a directed fishery for groundfish will 
reach the halibut PSC limit, or seasonal apportionment thereof, NMFS 
will publish notification in the Federal Register prohibiting directed 
fishing for groundfish by vessels using pot gear for the remainder of 
the season to which the halibut PSC limit or seasonal apportionment 
applies.
     (iv) Nonpelagic trawl gear fisheries--(A) Continued fishing under 
specified conditions. When the vessels to which a halibut PSC limit 
applies have caught an amount of halibut equal to that

[[Page 399]]

PSC, the Regional Director may, by notification in the Federal Register, 
allow some or all of those vessels to continue to fish for groundfish 
using nonpelagic trawl gear under specified conditions, subject to the 
other provisions of this part.
     (B) Factors to be considered. In authorizing and conditioning such 
continued fishing with bottom-trawl gear, the Regional Director will 
take into account the following considerations, and issue relevant 
findings:
     (1) The risk of biological harm to halibut stocks and of socio-
economic harm to authorized halibut users posed by continued bottom 
trawling by these vessels.
     (2) The extent to which these vessels have avoided incidental 
halibut catches up to that point in the year.
     (3) The confidence of the Regional Director in the accuracy of the 
estimates of incidental halibut catches by these vessels up to that 
point in the year.
     (4) Whether observer coverage of these vessels is sufficient to 
assure adherence to the prescribed conditions and to alert the Regional 
Director to increases in their incidental halibut catches.
     (5) The enforcement record of owners and operators of these 
vessels, and the confidence of the Regional Director that adherence to 
the prescribed conditions can be assured in light of available 
enforcement resources.
     (e) BSAI PSC limits--(1) Trawl gear--(i) Red king crab. The PSC 
limit of red king crab caught while conducting any trawl fishery for 
groundfish in Zone 1 during any fishing year is 200,000 red king crabs.
     (ii) Tanner crab (C. bairdi), Zone 1. The PSC limit of C. bairdi 
Tanner crabs caught while conducting any trawl fishery for groundfish in 
Zone 1 during any fishing year is 1 million animals.
     (iii) Tanner crab (C. bairdi), Zone 2. The PSC limit of C. bairdi 
Tanner crabs caught while conducting any trawl fishery for groundfish in 
Zone 2 during any fishing year is 3 million animals.
     (iv) Halibut. The PSC limit of halibut caught while conducting any 
trawl fishery for groundfish in the BSAI during any fishing year is an 
amount of halibut equivalent to 3,775 mt of halibut mortality.
     (v) Pacific herring. The PSC limit of Pacific herring caught while 
conducting any domestic trawl fishery for groundfish in the BSAI is 1 
percent of the annual eastern Bering Sea herring biomass. The PSC limit 
will be apportioned into annual herring PSC allowances, by target 
fishery, and will be published along with the annual herring PSC limit 
in the Federal Register with the proposed and final groundfish 
specifications defined in Sec. 679.20.
     (vi) Chinook salmon. The PSC limit of chinook salmon caught while 
conducting any trawl fishery for groundfish in the BSAI between January 
1 and April 15 is 48,000 fish.
     (vii) Non-chinook salmon. The PSC limit of non-chinook salmon 
caught by vessels using trawl gear during August 15 through October 14 
in the CVOA is 42,000 fish.
     (2) Nontrawl gear, halibut. The PSC limit of halibut caught while 
conducting any nontrawl fishery for groundfish in the BSAI during any 
fishing year is an amount of halibut equivalent to 900 mt of halibut 
mortality.
     (3) PSC apportionment to trawl fisheries--(i) General. NMFS, after 
consultation with the Council, will apportion each PSC limit set forth 
in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section into bycatch 
allowances for fishery categories defined in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of 
this section, based on each category's proportional share of the 
anticipated incidental catch during a fishing year of prohibited species 
for which a PSC limit is specified and the need to optimize the amount 
of total groundfish harvested under established PSC limits. The sum of 
all bycatch allowances of any prohibited species will equal its PSC 
limit.
     (ii) Red king crab, C. bairdi Tanner crab, and halibut--(A) 
General. For vessels engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the 
GOA or BSAI, the PSC limits for red king crab, C. bairdi Tanner crab, 
and halibut will be apportioned to the trawl fishery categories defined 
in paragraphs (e)(3)(iv) (B) through (F) of this section.
    (B) Incidental catch in midwater pollock fishery. Any amount of red 
king crab, C. bairdi Tanner crab, or halibut that is incidentally taken 
in the

[[Page 400]]

midwater pollock fishery as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this 
section will be counted against the bycatch allowances specified for the 
pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species'' category defined in paragraph 
(e)(3)(iv)(F) of this section.
    (iii) Pacific herring. The PSC limit for Pacific herring will be 
apportioned to the BSAI trawl fishery categories defined in paragraphs 
(e)(3)(iv) (A) through (F) of this section.
    (iv) Trawl fishery categories. For purposes of apportioning trawl 
PSC limits among fisheries, the following fishery categories are 
specified and defined in terms of round-weight equivalents of those 
groundfish species or species groups for which a TAC has been specified 
under Sec. 679.20.
    (A) Midwater pollock fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any 
weekly reporting period that results in a catch of pollock that is 95 
percent or more of the total amount of groundfish caught during the 
week.
    (B) Flatfish fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly 
reporting period that results in a retained aggregate amount of rock 
sole, ``other flatfish,'' and yellowfin sole that is greater than the 
retained amount of any other fishery category defined under this 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (1) Yellowfin sole fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any 
weekly reporting period that is defined as a flatfish fishery under this 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) and results in a retained amount of yellowfin 
sole that is 70 percent or more of the retained aggregate amount of rock 
sole, ``other flatfish,'' and yellowfin sole.
    (2) Rock sole/flathead sole/``other flatfish'' fishery. Fishing with 
trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that is defined as a 
flatfish fishery under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) and is not a 
yellowfin sole fishery as defined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of 
this section.
    (C) Greenland turbot/arrowtooth flounder/sablefish fishery. Fishing 
with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a 
retained aggregate amount of Greenland turbot, arrowtooth flounder, and 
sablefish that is greater than the retained amount of any other fishery 
category defined under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (D) Rockfish fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly 
reporting period that results in a retained aggregate amount of rockfish 
species of the genera Sebastes and Sebastolobus that is greater than the 
retained amount of any other fishery category defined under this 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (E) Pacific cod fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly 
reporting period that results in a retained aggregate amount of Pacific 
cod that is greater than the retained amount of any other groundfish 
fishery category defined under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (F) Pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species.'' Fishing with trawl gear 
during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained aggregate 
amount of pollock other than pollock harvested in the midwater pollock 
fishery defined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, Atka 
mackerel, and ``other species'' that is greater than the retained amount 
of any other fishery category defined under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (4) Halibut apportionment to nontrawl fishery categories--(i) 
General. NMFS, after consultation with the Council, may apportion the 
halibut PSC limit for nontrawl gear set forth under paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section into bycatch allowances for nontrawl fishery categories 
defined under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, based on each 
category's proportional share of the anticipated bycatch mortality of 
halibut during a fishing year and the need to optimize the amount of 
total groundfish harvested under the nontrawl halibut PSC limit. The sum 
of all halibut bycatch allowances will equal the halibut PSC limit 
established in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Nontrawl fishery categories. For purposes of apportioning the 
nontrawl halibut PSC limit among fisheries, the following fishery 
categories are specified and defined in terms of round-weight 
equivalents of those BSAI groundfish species for which a TAC has been 
specified under Sec. 679.20.
    (A) Pacific cod hook-and-line fishery. Fishing with hook-and-line 
gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch 
of Pacific cod

[[Page 401]]

that is greater than the retained amount of any other groundfish 
species.
    (B) Sablefish hook-and-line fishery. Fishing with hook-and-line gear 
during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of 
sablefish that is greater than the retained amount of any other 
groundfish species.
    (C) Groundfish jig gear fishery. Fishing with jig gear during any 
weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of groundfish.
    (D) Groundfish pot gear fishery. Fishing with pot gear under 
restrictions set forth in Sec. 679.24(b) during any weekly reporting 
period that results in a retained catch of groundfish.
    (E) Other nontrawl fisheries. Fishing for groundfish with nontrawl 
gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch 
of groundfish and does not qualify as a Pacific cod hook-and-line 
fishery, a sablefish hook-and-line fishery, a jig gear fishery, or a 
groundfish pot gear fishery as defined under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of 
this section.
    (5) Seasonal apportionments of bycatch allowances--(i) General. 
NMFS, after consultation with the Council, may apportion fishery bycatch 
allowances on a seasonal basis.
    (ii) Factors to be considered. NMFS will base any seasonal 
apportionment of a bycatch allowance on the following types of 
information:
    (A) Seasonal distribution of prohibited species;

year;
    (E) Expected changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons;
    (F) Expected start of fishing effort; or
    (G) Economic effects of establishing seasonal prohibited species 
apportionments on segments of the target groundfish industry.
    (iii) Seasonal trawl fishery bycatch allowances--(A) Unused seasonal 
apportionments. Unused seasonal apportionments of trawl fishery bycatch 
allowances made under this paragraph (e)(5) will be added to its 
respective fishery bycatch allowance for the next season during a 
current fishing year.
    (B) Seasonal apportionment exceeded. If a seasonal apportionment of 
a trawl fishery bycatch allowance made under paragraph (d)(5) of this 
section is exceeded, the amount by which the seasonal apportionment is 
exceeded will be deducted from its respective apportionment for the next 
season during a current fishing year.
    (iv) Seasonal nontrawl fishery bycatch allowances--(A) Unused 
seasonal apportionments. Any unused portion of a seasonal nontrawl 
fishery bycatch allowance made under this paragraph (e)(5) will be 
reapportioned to the fishery's remaining seasonal bycatch allowances 
during a current fishing year in a manner determined by NMFS, after 
consultation with the Council, based on the types of information listed 
under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (B) Seasonal apportionment exceeded. If a seasonal apportionment of 
a nontrawl fishery bycatch allowance made under this paragraph (e)(5) is 
exceeded, the amount by which the seasonal apportionment is exceeded 
will be deducted from the fishery's remaining seasonal bycatch 
allowances during a current fishing year in a manner determined by NMFS, 
after consultation with the Council, based on the types of information 
listed under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (6) Notification--(i) General. NMFS will publish annually in the

    (8) Nontrawl halibut closures. If, during the fishing year, the 
Regional Director determines that U.S. fishing vessels participating in 
any of the nontrawl fishery categories listed under paragraph (e)(4) of 
this section will catch the halibut bycatch allowance, or seasonal 
apportionment thereof, specified for that fishery category under 
paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, NMFS will publish in the Federal 
Register the closure of the entire BSAI to directed fishing with the 
relevant gear type for each species and/or species group in that fishery 
category.
    (f) Program to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates--(1) 
Requirements--(i) General. A vessel's bycatch rate, as calculated at the 
end of a fishing month under paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section, while 
participating in the fisheries identified in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, shall not exceed bycatch rate standards referenced in paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Applicability. A vessel is subject to this paragraph (f) if the 
groundfish catch of the vessel is observed on board the vessel, or on 
board a mothership that receives unsorted codends from the vessel, at 
any time during a weekly reporting period, and the vessel is assigned to 
one of the fisheries defined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (2) Assigned fisheries. During any weekly reporting period, a 
vessel's observed catch composition of groundfish species for which a 
TAC has been specified in the GOA or BSAI will determine the fishery to 
which the vessel is assigned, as follows:
    (i) GOA midwater pollock fishery means fishing with trawl gear in 
the GOA that results in an observed catch of groundfish from the GOA 
during any weekly reporting period that is composed of 95 percent or 
more of pollock when the directed fishery for pollock by vessels using 
trawl gear other than pelagic trawl gear is closed.
    (ii) GOA other trawl fishery means fishing with trawl gear in the 
GOA that results in an observed catch of groundfish from the GOA during 
any weekly reporting period that does not qualify as a midwater pollock 
fishery under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) BSAI midwater pollock fishery means fishing with trawl gear in 
the BSAI that results in an observed catch of groundfish from the BSAI 
during any weekly reporting period that is

[[Page 404]]

composed of 95 percent or more of pollock when the directed fishery for 
pollock by vessels using trawl gear other than pelagic trawl gear is 
closed.
    (iv) BSAI yellowfin sole fishery means fishing with trawl gear in 
the BSAI that results in a retained aggregate amount of rock sole, 
``other flatfish,'' and yellowfin sole caught in the BSAI during any 
weekly reporting period that is greater than the retained amount of any 
other fishery under this paragraph (f)(2) and results in a retained 
amount of BSAI yellowfin sole that is 70 percent or more of the retained 
aggregate amount of BSAI rock sole, ``other flatfish,'' and yellowfin 
sole.
    (v) BSAI bottom pollock fishery means fishing with trawl gear in the 
BSAI that results in a retained amount of pollock caught in the BSAI 
during any weekly reporting period other than pollock harvested in the 
midwater pollock fishery in the BSAI defined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of 
this section, that is greater than the retained amount of any other 
fishery defined under this paragraph (f)(2).
    (vi) BSAI other trawl fishery means fishing with trawl gear in the 
BSAI that results in a retained amount of groundfish caught in the BSAI 
during any weekly reporting period that does not qualify as a midwater 
pollock, yellowfin sole, or bottom pollock fishery.
    (3) Notification of bycatch rate standards--(i) Prior notice. Prior 
to January 1 and July 1 of each year, the Regional Director will publish 
notification in the Federal Register specifying bycatch rate standards 
for the fisheries identified in this paragraph (f) that will be in 
effect for specified seasons within the 6-month periods of January 1 
through June 30 and July 1 through December 31, respectively.
    (ii) Adjustments. The Regional Director may adjust bycatch rate 
standards as frequently as he or she considers appropriate.
    (4) Factors upon which bycatch rate standards are based. Bycatch 
rate standards for a fishery and adjustments to such standards will be 
based on the following information and considerations:
    (i) Previous years' average observed bycatch rates for that fishery.
    (ii) Immediately preceding season's average observed bycatch rates 
for that fishery.
    (iii) The bycatch allowances and associated fishery closures 
specified under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
    (iv) Anticipated groundfish harvests for that fishery.
    (v) Anticipated seasonal distribution of fishing effort for 
groundfish.
    (vi) Other information and criteria deemed relevant by the Regional 
Director.
    (5) Public comment--(i) Prior comment. Bycatch rate standards or 
adjustments to such standards specified under this section will not take 
effect until NMFS has published the proposed bycatch rate standards or 
adjustments to such standards in the Federal Register for public comment 
for a period of 30 days, unless NMFS finds for good cause that such 
notification and public comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or 
contrary to the public interest.
    (ii) Comment after notification. If NMFS decides, for good cause, 
that bycatch rate standards or adjustments to such standards are to be 
made effective without affording a prior opportunity for public comment, 
public comments on the necessity for, and extent of, bycatch rate 
standards or adjustments to such standards will be received by the 
Regional Director for a period of 15 days after the effective date of 
notification.
    (iii) Public inspection of data. During any such 15-day period, the 
Regional Director will make available for public inspection, during 
business hours, the aggregate data upon which bycatch rate standards or 
adjustments to such standards were based.
    (iv) Written comments. If written comments are received during any 
such 15-day period that oppose or protest bycatch rate standards or 
adjustments to such standards issued under this section, NMFS will 
reconsider the necessity for the bycatch standards or adjustment to such 
standards and, as soon as practicable after that reconsideration, will 
either--
    (A) Publish in the Federal Register notification of continued 
effectiveness

[[Page 405]]

of bycatch rate standards or adjustment to such standards, responding to 
comments received; or
    (B) Modify or rescind bycatch rate standards or adjustment to such 
standards.
    (6) Notification of adjustment to bycatch rate standards. 
Notification of adjustments to bycatch rate standards issued by NMFS 
under paragraph (f)(3) of this section will include the following 
information:
    (i) A description of the adjustment to one or more bycatch rate 
standards specified for a fishery.
    (ii) The reasons for the adjustment and the determinations required 
under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (iii) The effective date and any termination date of such 
adjustment. If no termination date is specified, the adjustment will 
remain in effect until revised by subsequent notification in the Federal 
Register.
    (7) Vessel bycatch rates--(i) Observed data. For purposes of this 
section, observed data collected for each haul sampled during a day will 
include: Date; Federal reporting area where trawl gear for the haul was 
retrieved; total round weight of groundfish, in metric tons in the 
portion of the haul sampled by groundfish species or species group for 
which a TAC has been specified under Sec. 679.20; and total round weight 
of halibut, in kilograms, in the portion of the haul sampled. Observer 
data from the BSAI trawl fisheries also will include the total number of 
red king crab in the portion of the haul sampled.
    (ii) Observer sampling procedures. (A) NMFS will randomly 
predetermine the hauls to be sampled by an observer during the time the 
observer is on a vessel.
    (B) An observer will take samples at random from throughout the 
haul, and take samples prior to sorting of the haul by the crew for 
processing or discarding of the catch.
    (C) An observer will sample a minimum of 100 kg of fish from each 
haul sampled.
    (D) While an observer is at sea, the observer will report to NMFS, 
on at least a weekly basis, the data for sampled hauls.
    (E) Upon request, the observer will allow the vessel operator to see 
all observed data set forth under paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section 
that the observer submits to NMFS.
    (8) Determination of individual vessel bycatch rates. For each 
vessel, the Regional Director will aggregate from sampled hauls the 
observed data collected during a weekly reporting period on the total 
round weight, in metric tons, of each groundfish species or species 
group for which a TAC has been specified under Sec. 679.20 to determine 
to which of the fisheries described in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this 
section the vessel should be assigned for that week.
    (i) Vessel assignment to fisheries--(A) BSAI catcher/processors. 
Catcher/proc- essors will be assigned to fisheries at the end of each 
weekly reporting period based on the round-weight equivalent of the 
retained groundfish catch composition reported on a vessel's WPR that is 
submitted to the Regional Director under Sec. 679.5.
    (B) BSAI catcher vessel delivery in Federal waters. Catcher vessels 
that deliver to motherships in Federal waters during a weekly reporting 
period will be assigned to fisheries based on the round-weight 
equivalent of the retained groundfish catch composition reported on the 
WPR submitted to the Regional Director for that week by the mothership 
under Sec. 679.5.
    (C) BSAI catcher vessel delivery in Alaska State waters. Catcher 
vessels delivering groundfish to shoreside processors or to motherships 
in Alaska State waters during a weekly reporting period will be assigned 
to fisheries based on the round-weight equivalent of the groundfish 
retained by the processor and reported on an ADF&G fish ticket as 
required under Alaska State regulations at A.S. 16.05.690.
    (ii) Calculation of monthly bycatch rates--(A) Assigned fishery. At 
the end of each fishing month during which an observer sampled at least 
50 percent of a vessel's total number of trawl hauls retrieved while an 
observer was aboard (as recorded in the vessel's DFL), the Regional 
Director will calculate the vessel's bycatch rate based on observed data 
for each fishery to which the vessel was assigned for any weekly 
reporting period during that fishing month.

[[Page 406]]

    (B) Verified observer data. Only observed data that have been 
checked, verified, and analyzed by NMFS will be used to calculate vessel 
bycatch rates for purposes of this section.
    (C) Calculation. The bycatch rate of a vessel for a fishery defined 
under paragraph (f)(2) of this section during a fishing month is a ratio 
of halibut to groundfish that is calculated by using the total round 
weight of halibut (in kilograms), or total number of red king crab, in 
samples during all weekly reporting periods in which the vessel was 
assigned to that fishery and the total round weight of the groundfish 
(in metric tons) for which a TAC has been specified under Sec. 679.20 in 
samples taken during all such periods.
    (9) Compliance with bycatch rate standards. A vessel has exceeded a 
bycatch rate standard for a fishery if the vessel's bycatch rate for a 
fishing month, as calculated under paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section 
exceeds the bycatch rate standard established for that fishery under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

Sec. 679.25  Inseason adjustments.

    (a) General--(1) Types of adjustments. Inseason adjustments issued 
by NMFS under this section include:
    (i) Closure, extension, or opening of a season in all or part of a 
management area.
    (ii) Modification of the allowable gear to be used in all or part of 
a management area.
    (iii) Adjustment of TAC and PSC limits.
    (iv) Interim closures of statistical areas, or portions thereof, to 
directed fishing for specified groundfish species.
    (2) Determinations. (i) Any inseason adjustment taken under 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section must be based on a 
determination that such adjustments are necessary to prevent:
    (A) Overfishing of any species or stock of fish or shellfish;
    (B) Harvest of a TAC for any groundfish species or the taking of a 
PSC limit for any prohibited species that, on the basis of the best 
available scientific information, is found by NMFS to be incorrectly 
specified; or
    (C) Underharvest of a TAC or gear share of a TAC for any groundfish 
species when catch information indicates that the TAC or gear share has 
not been reached.
    (ii) Any inseason closure of a statistical area, or portion thereof, 
under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, must be based upon a 
determination that such closures are necessary to prevent:
    (A) A continuation of relatively high bycatch rates of prohibited 
species

[[Page 411]]

specified under Sec. 679.21(b) in a statistical area, or portion 
thereof;
    (B) Take of an excessive share of PSC limits or bycatch allowances 
established under Sec. 679.21(d) and (e) by vessels fishing in a 
statistical area, or portion thereof;
    (C) Closure of one or more directed fisheries for groundfish due to 
excessive prohibited species bycatch rates occurring in a specified 
fishery operating within all or part of a statistical area; or
    (D) Premature attainment of established PSC limits or bycatch 
allowances and associated loss of opportunity to harvest the groundfish 
OY.
    (iii) The selection of the appropriate inseason management 
adjustments under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section must be 
from the following authorized management measures and must be based upon 
a determination by the Regional Director that the management adjustment 
selected is the least restrictive necessary to achieve the purpose of 
the adjustment:
    (A) Any gear modification that would protect the species in need of 
conservation, but that would still allow other fisheries to continue;
    (B) An inseason adjustment that would allow other fisheries to 
continue in noncritical areas and time periods;
    (C) Closure of a management area and season to all groundfish 
fishing; or
    (D) Reopening of a management area or season to achieve the TAC or 
gear share of a TAC for any of the target species or the ``other 
species category.
    (iv) The adjustment of a TAC or PSC limit for any species under 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section must be based upon a determination 
by the Regional Director that the adjustment is based upon the best 
available scientific information concerning the biological stock status 
of the species in question and that the currently specified TAC or PSC 
limit is incorrect. Any adjustment to a TAC or PSC limit must be 
reasonably related to the change in biological stock status.
    (v) The inseason closure of a statistical area, or a portion 
thereof, under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section shall not extend 
beyond a 60-day period unless information considered under paragraph (b) 
of this section warrants an extended closure period. Any closure of a 
statistical area, or portion thereof, to reduce prohibited species 
bycatch rates requires a determination by the Regional Director that the 
closure is based on the best available scientific information concerning 
the seasonal distribution and abundance of prohibited species and 
bycatch rates of prohibited species associated with various groundfish 
fisheries.
    (b) Data. All information relevant to one or more of the following 
factors may be considered in making the determinations required under 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:
    (1) The effect of overall fishing effort within a statistical area;
    (2) Catch per unit of effort and rate of harvest;
    (3) Relative distribution and abundance of stocks of groundfish 
species and prohibited species within all or part of a statistical area;
    (4) Condition of a stock in all or part of a statistical area;
    (5) Inseason prohibited species bycatch rates observed in groundfish 
fisheries in all or part of a statistical area;
    (6) Historical prohibited species bycatch rates observed in 
groundfish fisheries in all or part of a statistical area;
    (7) Economic impacts on fishing businesses affected; or
    (8) Any other factor relevant to the conservation and management of 
groundfish species or any incidentally caught species that are 
designated as prohibited species or for which a PSC limit has been 
specified.
    (c) Procedure. (1) No inseason adjustment issued under this section 
will take effect until--
    (i) NMFS has filed the proposed adjustment for public inspection 
with the Office of the Federal Register; and
    (ii) NMFS has published the proposed adjustment in the Federal 
Register for public comment for a period of 30 days before it is made 
final, unless NMFS finds for good cause that such notification and 
public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.

[[Page 412]]

    (2) If NMFS decides, for good cause, that an adjustment is to be 
made without affording a prior opportunity for public comment, public 
comments on the necessity for, and extent of, the adjustment will be 
received by the Regional Director for a period of 15 days after the 
effective date of notification.
    (3) During any such 15-day period, the Regional Director will make 
available for public inspection, during business hours, the aggregate 
data upon which an adjustment was based.
    (4) If written comments are received during any such 15-day period 
that oppose or protest an inseason adjustment issued under this section, 
NMFS will reconsider the necessity for the adjustment and, as soon as 
practicable after that reconsideration, will either--
    (i) Publish in the Federal Register notification of continued 
effectiveness of the adjustment, responding to comments received; or
    (ii) Modify or rescind the adjustment.
    (5) Notifications of inseason adjustments issued by NMFS under 
paragraph (a) of this section will include the following information:
    (i) A description of the management adjustment.
    (ii) Reasons for the adjustment and the determinations required 
under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) The effective date and any termination date of such 
adjustment. If no termination date is specified, the adjustment will 
terminate on the last day of the fishing year.

      Subpart C--Western Alaska Community Development Quota Program


<R05>
Sec. 679.30  General CDQ regulations.

    (a) State of Alaska CDQ responsibilities--(1) Compliance. The State 
of Alaska must be able to ensure implementation of the CDPs once 
approved by NMFS. To accomplish this, the State must establish a 
monitoring system that defines what constitutes compliance and non-
compliance.
    (2) Public hearings. Prior to granting approval of a CDP recommended 
by the Governor, NMFS shall find that the Governor developed and 
approved the CDP after conducting at least one public hearing, at an 
appropriate time and location in the geographical area concerned, so as 
to allow all interested persons an opportunity to be heard. Hearing(s) 
on the CDP do not have to be held on the actual documents submitted to 
the Governor under paragraph (b) of this section, but must cover the 
substance and content of the proposed CDP in such a manner that the 
general public, and particularly the affected parties, have a reasonable 
opportunity to understand the impact of the CDP. The Governor must 
provide reasonable public notification of hearing date(s) and 
location(s). The Governor must make available for public review, at the 
time of public notification of the hearing, all state materials 
pertinent to the hearing(s) and must include a transcript or summary of 
the public hearing(s) with the Governor's recommendations to NMFS in 
accordance with this subpart. At the same time this transcript is 
submitted to NMFS, it must be made available, upon request, to the 
public. The public hearing held by the Governor will serve as the public 
hearing for purposes of NMFS review under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Council consultation. Before sending his/her recommendations for 
approval of CDPs to NMFS, the Governor must consult with the Council, 
and make available, upon request, CDPs that are not part of the 
Governor's recommendations.

    (c) Review and approval of CDPs--(1) Consistent with criteria. (i) 
Upon receipt by NMFS of the Governor's recommendation for approval of 
proposed CDPs, NMFS will review the record to determine whether the 
community eligibility criteria and the evaluation criteria set forth in 
paragraph (d) of this section have been met. NMFS shall then approve or 
disapprove the Governor's recommendation within 45 days of its receipt.
    (ii) In the event of approval, NMFS shall notify the Governor and 
the Council in writing that the Governor's recommendations for CDPs are 
consistent with the evaluation criteria under paragraph (d) of this 
section and other applicable law, including NMFS reasons for approval.
    (iii) Publication of the decision, including the percentage of each 
CDQ reserve for each subarea or district allocated under the CDPs and 
the availability of the findings, will be published in the Federal 
Register.
    (iv) NMFS will allocate no more than 33 percent of the total CDQ to 
any approved CDP application.
    (v) A CDQ community may not concurrently receive more than one 
pollock, halibut, or sablefish allocation and only one application for 
each type of CDP per CDQ applicant will be accepted.
    (2) Not consistent with criteria. (i) If NMFS finds that the 
Governor's recommendations for CDQ allocations are not consistent with 
the evaluation criteria set forth in these regulations and disapproves 
the Governor's recommendations, NMFS shall so advise the Governor and 
the Council in writing, including the reasons therefor.
    (ii) Notification of the decision will be published in the Federal 
Register.
    (3) Revised CDP. (i) The CDP applicant may submit a revised CDP to 
the Governor for submission to NMFS.
    (ii) Review by NMFS of a revised CDP application will be in 
accordance with the provisions set forth in this section.
    (d) Evaluation criteria. NMFS will approve the Governor's 
recommendations for CDPs if NMFS finds the CDP is consistent with the 
requirements of these regulations, including the following:
    (1) CDP application. Each CDP application is submitted in compliance 
with the application procedures described in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (2) NMFS review. Prior to approval of a CDP recommended by the 
Governor, NMFS will review the Governor's findings to determine that 
each community that is part of a CDP is listed in Table 7 of this part 
or meets the following criteria for an eligible community:
    (i) The community is located within 50 nm from the baseline from 
which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured along the Bering 
Sea coast from the Bering Strait to the western most of the Aleutian 
Islands, or on an island within the Bering Sea. A community is not 
eligible if it is located on the GOA coast of the North Pacific Ocean, 
even if it is within 50 nm of the baseline of the Bering Sea.
    (ii) The community is certified by the Secretary of the Interior 
pursuant to the Native Claims Settlement Act (Public Law 92-203) to be a 
native village.
    (iii) The residents of the community conduct more than half of their 
current commercial or subsistence fishing effort in the waters of the 
BSAI.
    (iv) The community has not previously developed harvesting or 
processing capability sufficient to support substantial groundfish 
fisheries participation in the BSAI, unless the community can show that 
benefits from an approved CDP would be the only way to realize a return 
from previous investments. The community of Unalaska is excluded under 
this provision.
    (3) Qualified managing organization. Each CDP application 
demonstrates that a qualified managing organization will be responsible 
for the harvest and use of the CDQ allocation pursuant to the CDP.
    (4) Exceeding the CDQ allocation. Each CDP application demonstrates 
that its

[[Page 417]]

managing organization can effectively prevent exceeding the CDQ 
allocation.
    (5) Governor's findings. The Governor has found for each recommended 
CDP that:
    (i) The CDP and the managing organization are fully described in the 
CDP application, and have the ability to successfully meet the CDP 
milestones and schedule.
    (ii) The managing organization has an adequate budget for 
implementing the CDP, and the CDP is likely to be successful.
    (iii) A qualified applicant has submitted the CDP application and 
the applicant and managing organization have the support of each 
community participating in the proposed CDQ project as demonstrated 
through an official letter approved by the governing body of each such 
community.
    (iv) The following factors have been considered:
    (A) The number of individuals from applicant communities who will be 
employed under the CDP, the nature of their work, and career 
advancement.
    (B) The number and percentage of low income persons residing in the 
applicant communities, and the economic opportunities provided to them 
through employment under the CDP.
    (C) The number of communities cooperating in the application.
    (D) The relative benefits to be derived by participating communities 
and the specific plans for developing a self-sustaining fisheries 
economy.
    (E) The success or failure of the applicant and/or the managing 
organization in the execution of a prior CDP (e.g., exceeding a CDQ 
allocation or any other related violation may be considered a failure 
and may therefore result in partially or fully precluding a CDP from a 
future CDQ allocation).
    (6) Qualified applicant. For purposes of this paragraph (d), 
``qualified applicant'' means:
    (i) A local fishermen's organization from an eligible community, or 
group of eligible communities, that is incorporated under the laws of 
the State of Alaska, or under Federal law, and whose board of directors 
is composed of at least 75 percent resident fishermen of the community 
(or group of communities) that is (are) making an application; or
    (ii) A local economic development organization incorporated under 
the laws of the State of Alaska, or under Federal law, specifically for 
the purpose of designing and implementing a CDP, and that has a board of 
directors composed of at least 75 percent resident fishermen of the 
community (or group of communities) that is (are) making an application.
    (7) Resident fisherman. For the purpose of this paragraph (d), 
``resident fisherman'' means an individual with documented commercial or 
subsistence fishing activity who maintains a mailing address and 
permanent domicile in the community and is eligible to receive an Alaska 
Permanent Fund dividend at that address.
    (8) Board of directors. If a qualified applicant represents more 
than one community, the board of directors of the applicant must include 
at least one member from each of the communities represented.
    (e) Monitoring of CDPs--(1) CDP reports. The following reports must 
be submitted to NMFS:
    (i) Annual progress reports. (A) CDP applicants are required to 
submit annual progress reports to the Governor by June 30 of the year 
following allocation.
    (B) Annual progress reports will include information describing how 
the CDP has met its milestones, goals, and objectives.
    (C) On the basis of those reports, the Governor will submit an 
annual progress report to NMFS and recommend whether CDPs should be 
continued.
    (D) NMFS must notify the Governor in writing within 45 days of 
receipt of the Governor's annual progress report, accepting or rejecting 
the annual progress report and the Governor's recommendations.
    (E) If NMFS rejects the Governor's annual progress report, NMFS will 
return it for revision and resubmission.
    (F) The report will be deemed approved if NMFS does not notify the 
Governor in writing within 45 days of the report's receipt.

[[Page 418]]

    (ii) Annual budget report. (A) An annual budget report is a detailed 
estimation of income and expenditures for each CDP project as described 
in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for a calendar year.
    (B) The annual budget report must be submitted to NMFS by December 
15 preceding the year for which the annual budget applies.
    (C) Annual budget reports are approved upon receipt by NMFS, unless 
disapproved in writing by December 31. If disapproved, the annual budget 
report may be revised and resubmitted to NMFS.
    (D) NMFS will approve or disapprove a resubmitted annual budget 
report in writing.
    (iii) Annual budget reconciliation report. A CDQ group must 
reconcile each annual budget by May 30 of the year following the year 
for which the annual budget applied. Reconciliation is an accounting of 
the annual budget's estimated income and expenditures with the actual 
income and expenditures, including the variance in dollars and variance 
in percentage for each CDP project that is described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section. If a general budget, as described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section, is no longer correct due to the 
reconciliation of an annual budget, then the general budget must also be 
revised to reflect the annual budget reconciliation. The revised general 
budget must be included with the annual budget reconciliation report.
    (2) Increase in CDQ allocation. If an applicant requests an increase 
in a CDQ, the applicant must submit a new CDP application for review by 
the Governor and approval by NMFS as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section.
    (3) Substantial amendments. (i) A CDP is a working business plan and 
must be kept up to date. Substantial amendments, as described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, to a CDP will require written 
notification to the Governor and subsequent approval by the Governor and 
NMFS before any change in a CDP can occur. The Governor may recommend to 
NMFS that the request for an amendment be approved.
    (ii) NMFS may notify the Governor in writing of approval or 
disapproval of the amendment within 30 days of receipt of the Governor's 
recommendation. The Governor's recommendation for approval of an 
amendment will be deemed approved if NMFS does not notify the Governor 
in writing within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Governor's 
recommendation.
    (iii) If NMFS determines that the CDP, if changed, would no longer 
meet the criteria under paragraph (d) of this section, or if any of the 
requirements under this section would not be met, NMFS shall notify the 
Governor in writing of the reasons why the amendment cannot be approved.
    (iv) For the purposes of this section, substantial amendments are 
defined as changes in a CDP, including, but not limited to, any of the 
following:
    (A) Any change in the applicant communities or replacement of the 
managing organization.
    (B) A change in the CDP applicant's harvesting or processing 
partner.
    (C) Funding a CDP project in excess of $100,000 that is not part of 
an approved general budget.
    (D) More than a 20-percent increase in the annual budget of an 
approved CDP project.
    (E) More than a 20-percent increase in actual expenditures over the 
approved annual budget for administrative operations.
    (F) A change in the contractual agreement(s) between the CDP 
applicant and its harvesting or processing partner, or a change in a CDP 
project, if such change is deemed by the Governor or NMFS to be a 
material change.
    (v) Notification of an amendment to a CDP shall include the 
following information:
    (A) The background and justification for the amendment that explains 
why the proposed amendment is necessary and appropriate.
    (B) An explanation of why the proposed change to the CDP is an 
amendment according to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section.
    (C) A description of the proposed amendment, explaining all changes 
to the CDP that result from the proposed amendment.

[[Page 419]]

    (D) A comparison of the original CDP text with the text of the 
proposed changes to the CDP, and the changed pages of the CDP for 
replacement in the CDP binder.
    (E) Identification of any NMFS findings that would need to be 
modified if the amendment is approved along with the proposed modified 
text.
    (F) A description of how the proposed amendment meets the 
requirements of this subpart. Only those CDQ regulations that are 
affected by the proposed amendment need to be discussed.
    (4) Technical amendments. (i) Any change to a CDP that is not a 
substantial amendment as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section 
is a technical amendment. It is the responsibility of the CDQ group to 
coordinate with the Governor to ensure that a proposed technical 
amendment does not meet the definition for a substantial amendment. 
Technical amendments require written notification to the Governor and 
NMFS before the change in a CDP occurs.
    (ii) A technical amendment will be approved when the CDQ group 
receives a written notification from NMFS announcing the receipt of the 
technical amendment. The Governor may recommend to NMFS, in writing, 
that a technical amendment be disapproved at any time. NMFS may 
disapprove a technical amendment in writing at any time, with the 
reasons therefor.
    (iii) Notification should include:
    (A) The pages of the CDP, with the text highlighted to show 
deletions and additions.
    (B) The changed pages of the CDP for replacement in the CDP binder.
    (5) Cease fishing operations. It is the responsibility of the CDQ-
managing organization to cease fishing operations once a CDQ allocation 
has been reached.
    (f) Suspension or termination of a CDP--(1) Governor's 
recommendation. (i) NMFS, at any time, may partially suspend, suspend, 
or terminate any CDP upon written recommendation of the Governor setting 
out his or her reasons that the CDP recipient is not complying with 
these regulations.
    (ii) After review of the Governor's recommendation and reasons for a 
partial suspension, suspension, or termination of a CDP, NMFS will 
notify the Governor in writing of approval or disapproval of his or her 
recommendation within 45 days of its receipt.
    (iii) In the event of approval of the Governor's recommendation, 
NMFS will publish an announcement in the Federal Register that the CDP 
has been partially suspended, suspended, or terminated, along with 
reasons therefor.
    (2) Non-compliance. NMFS also may partially suspend, suspend, or 
terminate any CDP at any time if NMFS finds a recipient of a CDQ 
allocation pursuant to the CDP is not complying with these regulations, 
other regulations, or provisions of the Magnuson Act or other applicable 
law. Publication of suspension or termination will appear in the Federal 
Register, along with the reasons therefor.
    (3) Review of allocation. An annual progress report, required under 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, will be used by the Governor to 
review each CDP to determine whether the CDP and CDQ allocation 
thereunder should be continued, decreased, partially suspended, 
suspended, or terminated under the following circumstances:
    (i) If the Governor determines that the CDP will successfully meet 
its goals and objectives, the CDP may continue without any Secretarial 
action.
    (ii) If the Governor recommends to NMFS that an allocation be 
decreased, the Governor's recommendation for decrease will be deemed 
approved if NMFS does not notify the Governor, in writing, within 30 
days of receipt of the Governor's recommendation.
    (iii) If the Governor determines that a CDP has not successfully met 
its goals and objectives, or appears unlikely to become successful, the 
Governor may submit a recommendation to NMFS that the CDP be partially 
suspended, suspended, or terminated. The Governor must set out, in 
writing, his or her reasons for recommending suspension or termination 
of the CDP.
    (iv) After review of the Governor's recommendation and reasons 
therefor, NMFS will notify the Governor, in writing, of approval or 
disapproval of his or her recommendation within 30 days of its receipt. 
In the case of suspension or termination, NMFS will

[[Page 420]]

publish notification in the Federal Register, with reasons therefor.

Sec. 679.31  CDQ reserve.

    (a) Pollock CDQ reserve (applicable through December 31, 1998). (1) 
In the proposed and final harvest specifications required under 
Sec. 679.20(c), one-half of the pollock TAC placed in the reserve for 
each subarea or district will be assigned to a CDQ reserve for each 
subarea or district.
    (2) NMFS may add any amount of a CDQ reserve back to the nonspecific 
reserve if, after September 30, the Regional Director determines that 
amount will not be used during the remainder of the fishing year.
    (b) Halibut CDQ reserve. (1) NMFS will annually withhold from IFQ 
allocation the proportions of the halibut catch limit that are specified 
in this paragraph (b) for use as a CDQ reserve.
    (2) Portions of the CDQ for each specified IPHC regulatory area may 
be allocated for the exclusive use of an eligible Western Alaska 
community or group of communities in accordance with a CDP approved by 
the Governor in consultation with the Council and approved by NMFS.
    (3) The proportions of the halibut catch limit annually withheld for 
purposes of the CDQ program, exclusive of issued QS, are as follows for 
each IPHC regulatory area:
    (i) Area 4B. In IPHC regulatory area 4B, 20 percent of the annual 
halibut quota shall be made available for the halibut CDQ program to 
eligible communities physically located in or proximate to this 
regulatory area. For the purposes of this section, ``proximate to'' an 
IPHC regulatory area means within 10 nm from the point where the 
boundary of the IPHC regulatory area intersects land.
    (ii) Area 4C. In IPHC regulatory area 4C, 50 percent of the halibut 
quota shall be made available for the halibut CDQ program to eligible 
communities physically located in IPHC regulatory area 4C.
    (iii) Area 4D. In IPHC regulatory area 4D, 30 percent of the halibut 
quota shall be made available for the halibut CDQ program to eligible 
communities located in or proximate to IPHC regulatory areas 4D and 4E.
    (iv) Area 4E. In IPHC regulatory area 4E, 100 percent of the halibut 
quota shall be made available for the halibut CDQ program to communities 
located in or proximate to IPHC regulatory area 4E. A fishing trip limit 
of 6,000 lb (2.7 mt) will apply to halibut CDQ harvesting in IPHC 
regulatory area 4E.
    (c) Sablefish CDQ reserve. In the proposed and final harvest limit 
specifications required under Sec. 679.20(c), NMFS will specify 20 
percent of the fixed gear allocation of sablefish in each BSAI subarea 
as a sablefish CDQ reserve, exclusive of issued QS. Portions of the CDQ 
reserve for each subarea may be allocated for the exclusive use of CDQ 
applicants in accordance with CDPs approved by the Governor in 
consultation with the Council and approved by NMFS. NMFS will allocate 
no more than 33 percent of the total CDQ for all subareas combined to 
any one applicant with an approved CDP application.


<R05>
Sec. 679.32  Estimation of total pollock harvest in the CDQ fisheries (applicable through December 31, 1998).

    (a) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Vessels and processors 
participating in pollock CDQ fisheries must comply with recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements set out at Sec. 679.5.
    (b) Total pollock harvests--(1) Observer estimates. Total pollock 
harvests for each CDP will be determined by observer estimates of total 
catch and catch composition, as reported on the daily observer catch 
message.
    (2) Cease fishing. The CDQ-managing organization must arrange to 
receive a copy of the observer daily catch message from processors in a 
manner that allows the CDQ-managing organization to inform processors to 
cease fishing operations before the CDQ allocation has been exceeded. 
CDQ-managing organization representatives must also inform NMFS within 
24 hours after the CDQ has been reached and fishing has ceased.
    (3) NMFS estimates. If NMFS determines that the observer, the 
processor, or the CDQ-managing organization

[[Page 421]]

failed to follow the procedures described in paragraphs (c), (d), and 
(e) of this section for estimating the total harvest of pollock, or 
violated any other regulation in this subpart C of this part, NMFS 
reserves the right to estimate the total pollock harvest based on the 
best available data.
    (c) Observer coverage. Vessel operators and processors participating 
in CDQ fisheries must comply with the following requirements for 
observer coverage:
    (1) Shoreside processor. (i) Each shoreside processor participating 
in the CDQ fisheries must have one NMFS-certified observer present at 
all times while groundfish harvested under a CDQ are being received or 
processed.
    (ii) The Regional Director is authorized to require more than one 
observer for a shoreside processor if:
    (A) The CDQ delivery schedule requires an observer to be on duty 
more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period;
    (B) Simultaneous deliveries of CDQ harvests by more than one vessel 
cannot be monitored by a single observer; or
    (C) One observer is not capable of adequately monitoring CDQ 
deliveries.
    (2) Processor vessel. Each processor vessel participating in the CDQ 
fisheries must have two NMFS-certified observers aboard the vessel at 
all times while groundfish harvested under a CDQ are being harvested, 
processed, or received from another vessel.
    (3) Catcher vessel. Observer coverage requirements for catcher 
vessels participating in the CDQ fisheries are in addition to any 
observer coverage requirements in subpart E of this part. Each catcher 
vessel delivering groundfish harvested under a CDQ, other than a catcher 
vessel delivering only unsorted codends to a processor or another 
vessel, must have a NMFS-certified observer on the vessel at all times 
while the vessel is participating in the CDQ fisheries, regardless of 
the vessel length.
    (d) Shoreside processor equipment and operational requirements. Each 
shoreside processor participating in the CDQ fisheries must comply with 
the following requirements:
    (1) Certified scale. Groundfish harvested in the CDQ fisheries must 
be recorded and weighed on a scale certified by the State of Alaska. 
Such a scale must measure catch weights at all times to at least 95-
percent accuracy, as determined by a NMFS-certified observer or 
authorized officer. The scale and scale display must be visible 
simultaneously by the observer.
    (2) Access to scale. Observers must be provided access to the scale 
used to weigh groundfish landings.
    (3) Retention of scale printouts. Printouts of scale measurements of 
each CDQ delivery must be made available to observers and be maintained 
in the shoreside processor for the duration of the fishing year, or for 
as long after a fishing year as product from fish harvested during that 
year are retained in the shoreside processor.
    (4) Prior notice of offloading schedule. The manager of each 
shoreside processor must notify the observer(s) of the offloading 
schedule of each CDQ groundfish delivery at least 1 hour prior to 
offloading to provide the observer an opportunity to monitor the 
weighing of the entire delivery.
    (e) Processor vessel measurement requirements. Each processor vessel 
participating in the CDQ fishery for pollock must estimate the total 
weight of its groundfish catch by the volumetric procedures specified in 
this paragraph (e).
    (1) Receiving bins. Each processor vessel estimating its catch by 
volumetric measurement must have one or more receiving bins in which all 
fish catches are placed to determine total catch weight prior to sorting 
operations.
    (2) Bin volume. The volume of each bin must be accurately measured, 
and the bin must be permanently marked and numbered in 10-cm increments 
on all internal sides of the bin. Marked increments, except those on the 
wall containing the viewing port or window, must be readable from the 
outside of the bin at all times. Bins must be lighted in a manner that 
allows marked increments to be read from the outside of the bin by a 
NMFS-certified observer or authorized officer.
    (3) Bin certification. (i) The bin volume and marked and numbered 
increments must be certified by a registered engineer with no financial 
interest in fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessels, or by a 
qualified organization

[[Page 422]]

that has been designated by the USCG Commandant, or an authorized 
representative thereof, for the purpose of classing or examining 
commercial fishing industry vessels under the provisions of 46 CFR 
28.76.
    (ii) Bin volumes and marked and numbered increments must be 
recertified each time a bin is structurally or physically changed.
    (iii) The location of bin markings, as certified, must be described 
in writing. Tables certified under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) indicating 
the volume of each certified bin in cubic meters for each 10-cm 
increment marked on the sides of the bins, must be submitted to the NMFS 
Observer Program prior to harvesting or receiving groundfish and must be 
maintained on board the vessel and made available to NMFS-certified 
observers at all times.
    (iv) All bin certification documents must be dated and signed by the 
certifier.
    (4) Prior notification. Vessel operators must notify observers prior 
to any removal or addition of fish from each bin used for volumetric 
measurements of catch in such a manner that allows an observer to take 
bin volume measurements prior to fish being removed from or added to the 
bin. Once a volumetric measurement has been taken, additional fish may 
not be added to the bin until at least half the original volume has been 
removed. Fish may not be removed from or added to a bin used for 
volumetric measurements of catch until an observer indicates that bin 
volume measurements have been completed and any samples of catch 
required by the observer have been taken.
    (5) Separation of fish. Fish from separate hauls or deliveries from 
separate harvesting vessels may not be mixed in any bin used for 
volumetric measurements of catch.
    (6) Bin viewing port. The receiving bins must not be filled in a 
manner that obstructs the viewing ports or prevents the observer from 
seeing the level of fish throughout the bin.

Sec. 679.33  Halibut and sablefish CDQ.

    (a) Permits. The Regional Director will issue a halibut and/or 
sablefish CDQ permit to the managing organization responsible for 
carrying out an approved CDQ project. A copy of the halibut and/or 
sablefish CDQ permit must be carried on any fishing vessel operated by 
or for the managing organization, and be made available for inspection 
by an authorized officer. Each halibut and/or sablefish CDQ permit will 
be non-transferable and will be effective for the duration of the CDQ 
project or until revoked, suspended, or modified.
    (b) CDQ cards. The Regional Director will issue halibut and/or 
sablefish CDQ cards to all individuals named on an approved CDP 
application. Each halibut and/or sablefish CDQ card will identify a CDQ 
permit number and the individual authorized by the managing organization 
to land halibut and/or sablefish for debit against its CDQ allocation.
    (c) Alteration. No person may alter, erase, or mutilate a halibut 
and/or sablefish CDQ permit, card, registered buyer permit, or any valid 
and current permit or document issued under this part. Any such permit, 
card, or document that has been intentionally altered, erased, or 
mutilated will be invalid.
    (d) Landings. All landings of halibut and/or sablefish harvested 
under an approved CDQ project, dockside sales, and outside landings of 
halibut and/or sablefish must be landed by a person with a valid halibut 
and/or sablefish CDQ card to a person with a valid registered buyer 
permit, and reported in compliance with Sec. 679.5 (l)(1) and (l)(2).
    (e) CDQ fishing seasons. See Sec. 679.23(e)(4).

<R04>
         Subpart D--Individual Fishing Quota Management Measures


<R05>
Sec. 679.40  Sablefish and halibut QS.

    The Regional Director shall annually divide the TAC of halibut and 
sablefish that is apportioned to the fixed gear fishery pursuant to the 
annual management measures published in the Federal Register pursuant to 
Sec. 300.62 of chapter III of this title and Sec. 679.20, minus the CDQ 
reserve, among qualified halibut and sablefish quota share holders, 
respectively.
    (a) Initial allocation of QS--(1) General. The Regional Director 
shall initially assign to qualified persons, on or after October 18, 
1994, halibut and sablefish fixed gear fishery QS that are specific to 
IFQ regulatory areas and vessel categories. QS will be assigned as a 
block in the appropriate IFQ regulatory area and vessel category, if 
that QS would have resulted in an allocation of less than 20,000 lb (9 
mt) of IFQ for halibut or sablefish based on the 1994 TAC for fixed gear 
in those fisheries for specific IFQ regulatory areas and the QS pools of 
those fisheries for specific IFQ regulatory areas as of October 17, 
1994.
    (2) Qualified person. (i) As used in this section, a ``qualified 
person'' means a ``person,'' as defined in Sec. 679.2:
    (A) That owned a vessel that made legal landings of halibut or 
sablefish, harvested with fixed gear, from any IFQ regulatory area in 
any QS qualifying year; or
    (B) That leased a vessel that made legal landings of halibut or 
sablefish, harvested with fixed gear, from any IFQ regulatory area in 
any QS qualifying year. A person who owns a vessel cannot be a qualified 
person based on the legal fixed gear landings of halibut or sablefish 
made by a person who leased the vessel for the duration of the lease.
    (ii) Qualified persons, or their successors-in-interest, must exist 
at the time of their application for QS.
    (iii) A former partner of a dissolved partnership or a former 
shareholder of a dissolved corporation who would otherwise qualify as a 
person may apply for QS in proportion to his or her interest in the 
dissolved partnership or corporation.
    (iv) Sablefish harvested within Prince William Sound, or under a 
State of Alaska limited entry program, will not be considered in 
determining whether a person is a qualified person.
    (3) Qualification for QS--(i) Year. A QS qualifying year is 1988, 
1989, or 1990.
    (ii) Vessel ownership. Evidence of vessel ownership shall be limited 
to the following documents, in order of priority:
    (A) For vessels required to be documented under the laws of the 
United States, the USCG abstract of title issued in respect of that 
vessel.
    (B) A certificate of registration that is determinative as to vessel 
ownership.
    (C) A bill of sale.
    (iii) Vessel lease. Conclusive evidence of a vessel lease will 
include a written vessel lease agreement or a notarized statement from 
the vessel owner and lease holder attesting to the existence of a vessel 
lease agreement at any time during the QS qualifying years. Conclusive 
evidence of a vessel lease must identify the leased vessel and indicate 
the name of the lease holder and the period of time during which the 
lease was in effect. Other evidence, which may not be conclusive, but 
may tend to support a vessel lease, may also be submitted.
    (iv) Ownership interest. Evidence of ownership interest in a 
dissolved partnership or corporation shall be limited to corporate 
documents (e.g., articles of incorporation) or notarized statements 
signed by each former partner, shareholder or director, and specifying 
their proportions of interest.
    (v) Legal landing of halibut or sablefish--(A) Definition. As used 
in this section, a ``legal landing of halibut or sablefish'' means 
halibut or sablefish harvested with fixed gear and landed in compliance 
with state and Federal regulations in effect at the time of the landing.
    (B) Documentation. Evidence of legal landings shall be limited to 
documentation of state or Federal catch reports that indicate the amount 
of halibut or sablefish harvested, the IPHC regulatory area or 
groundfish reporting area in which it was caught, the vessel and gear 
type used to catch it, and the

[[Page 424]]

date of harvesting, landing, or reporting. State catch reports are 
Alaska, Washington, Oregon, or California fish tickets. Federal catch 
reports are WPRs required under Sec. 679.5. Sablefish harvested within 
Prince William Sound or under a State of Alaska limited entry program 
will not be considered in determining qualification to receive QS, nor 
in calculating initial QS.
    (4) Calculation of initial QS--(i) Halibut QS. The Regional Director 
shall calculate the halibut QS for any qualified person in each IFQ 
regulatory area based on that person's highest total legal landings of 
halibut in each IPHC regulatory area for any 5 years of the 7-year 
halibut QS base period 1984 through 1990. The sum of all halibut QS for 
an IFQ regulatory area will be the halibut QS pool for that area.
    (ii) Sablefish QS. The Regional Director shall calculate the 
sablefish QS for any qualified person in each IFQ regulatory area based 
on that person's highest total legal landings of sablefish in each 
groundfish reporting area for any 5 years of the 6-year sablefish QS 
base period 1985 through 1990. The sum of all sablefish QS for an IFQ 
regulatory area will be the sablefish QS pool for that area.
    (iii) CDQ program. Each initial QS calculation will be modified to 
accommodate the CDQ program prescribed at subpart C of this part.
    (5) Assignment of QS to vessel categories--(i) LOA. Each qualified 
person's QS will be assigned to a vessel category based on the LOA of 
vessel(s) from which that person made fixed gear legal landings of 
groundfish or halibut in the most recent year of participation and the 
product type landed. As used in this paragraph (a)(5), ``the most recent 
year of participation'' means the most recent of 4 calendar years in 
which any groundfish or halibut were harvested using fixed gear, as 
follows: 1988, 1989, or 1990; or calendar year 1991 prior to September 
26, 1991.
    (ii) Vessel categories. QS and its associated IFQ assigned to vessel 
categories include:
    (A) Category A QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ 
cardholder to harvest and process IFQ species on a vessel of any length;
    (B) Category B QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ 
cardholder to harvest IFQ species on a vessel of any length;
    (C) Category C QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ 
cardholder to harvest IFQ species on a vessel less than or equal to 60 
ft (18.3 m) LOA:
    (D) Category D QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ 
cardholder to harvest IFQ halibut on a vessel less than or equal to 35 
ft (10.7 m) LOA;
    (iii) QS assignment. A qualified person's QS will be assigned:
    (A) To vessel category A if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel processed any groundfish or 
halibut caught with fixed gear.
    (B) To vessel category B if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel was greater than 60 ft (18.3 
m) LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught with fixed 
gear.
    (C) To each applicable vessel category in proportion to the landings 
of halibut or sablefish made by that person if, at any time during their 
most recent year of participation, that person used more than one vessel 
in different categories.
    (iv) Sablefish QS. A qualified person's sablefish QS will be 
assigned:
    (A) To vessel category C if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel was less than or equal to 60 
ft (18.3 m) LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught 
with fixed gear.
    (B) To the vessel category in which halibut and groundfish were 
landed, or vessel categories in proportion to the total fixed gear 
landings of halibut and groundfish, if, at any time during the most 
recent year of participation, that person's vessel(s) makes no 
landing(s) of sablefish.
    (v) Halibut QS. A qualified person's halibut QS will be assigned:
    (A) To vessel category C if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel was less than or equal to 60 
ft (18.3 m), but greater than 35 ft (10.7 m), LOA and did not process 
any groundfish or halibut caught with fixed gear.

[[Page 425]]

    (B) To vessel category D if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel was less than or equal to 35 
ft (10.7 m) LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught 
with fixed gear.
    (C) To the vessel category in which groundfish were landed, or 
vessel categories in proportion to the total fixed gear landings of 
groundfish, if, at any time during the most recent year of 
participation, that person's vessel(s) makes no landing(s) of halibut.
    (vi) Both species QS. A qualified person's QS for both species will 
be assigned to the vessel category in which groundfish were landed in 
the most recent year of participation if, at any time during that year, 
that person landed halibut in one vessel category and sablefish in a 
different vessel category.
    (6) Application for initial QS--(i) Application form. Upon request, 
the Regional Director shall make available to any person an application 
form for an initial allocation of QS. The application form sent to the 
person requesting a QS allocation will include all data on that person's 
vessel ownership and catch history of halibut and sablefish that can be 
released to the applicant under current state and Federal 
confidentiality rules, and that are available to the Regional Director 
at the time of the request.
    (ii) Application period. An application period of no less than 180 
days will be specified by notification in the Federal Register and other 
information sources that the Regional Director deems appropriate.
    (iii) Complete application. Complete applications received by the 
Regional Director will be acknowledged. An incomplete application will 
be returned to the applicant with specific kinds of information 
identified that are necessary to make it complete.
    (7) Insufficient documentation. Halibut and sablefish catch history, 
vessel ownership or lease data, and other information supplied by an 
applicant will be compared with data compiled by the Regional Director. 
If additional data presented in an application are not consistent with 
the data compiled by the Regional Director, the applicant will be 
notified of insufficient documentation. The applicant will have 90 days 
to submit corroborating documents (as specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section) in support of his/her application or to resubmit a revised 
application. All applicants will be limited to one opportunity to 
provide corroborating documentation or a revised application in response 
to notification of insufficient documentation.
    (8) Verified data. Uncontested data in applications will be approved 
by the Regional Director. Based on these data, the Regional Director 
will calculate each applicant's initial halibut and sablefish QS, as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for each IFQ regulatory area, 
respectively, and will add each applicant's halibut and sablefish QS for 
an IFQ regulatory area to the respective QS pool for that area.
    (9) Unverified data. Catch history, vessel ownership, or lease data 
that cannot be verified by the Regional Director, following the 
procedure described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, will not 
qualify for QS. An initial determination denying QS on the grounds that 
claimed catch history, vessel ownership or lease data were not verified 
may be appealed following the procedure described in Sec. 679.43. Quota 
share reflecting catch history, vessel ownership, or lease data that are 
contested between two or more applicants, at least one of which is 
likely to qualify for QS when the dispute is resolved, will be assigned 
to a reserve that will be considered part of the QS pool for the 
appropriate IFQ regulatory area. Any QS and IFQ that results from agency 
action resolving the dispute will be assigned to the prevailing 
applicant(s) pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), (b), and (c) of this 
section. If the assigned IFQ for the 1995 fishing season becomes moot by 
passage of time needed to resolve the dispute, the assignment of QS and 
IFQ for subsequent fishing seasons will be unaffected.
    (b) Annual allocation of IFQ. The Regional Director shall assign 
halibut or sablefish IFQs to each person holding unrestricted QS for 
halibut or sablefish, respectively, up to the limits prescribed in 
Sec. 679.42 (e) and (f). Each assigned IFQ will be specific to an IFQ 
regulatory area and vessel category, and will represent the maximum

[[Page 426]]

amount of halibut or sablefish that may be harvested from the specified 
IFQ regulatory area and by the person to whom it is assigned during the 
specified fishing year, unless the IFQ assignment is changed by the 
Regional Director within the fishing year because of an approved 
transfer or because all or part of the IFQ is sanctioned for violating 
rules of this part.
    (c) Calculation of annual IFQ allocation--(1) General. The annual 
allocation of IFQ to any person (person p) in any IFQ regulatory area 
(area a) will be equal to the product of the TAC of halibut or sablefish 
by fixed gear for that area (after adjustment for purposes of the 
Western Alaska CDQ Program) and that person's QS divided by the QS pool 
for that area. Overages will be subtracted from a person's IFQ pursuant 
to paragraph (d) of this section. Expressed algebraically, the annual 
IFQ allocation formula is as follows:

IFQ <INF>pa = [(fixed gear TAC<INF>a - CDQ reserve<INF>a)  x  
(QS<INF>pa/QS pool<INF>a)] - overage of IFQ<INF>pa.

    (2) QS amounts. For purposes of calculating IFQs for any fishing 
year, the amount of a person's QS and the amount of the QS pool for any 
IFQ regulatory area will be the amounts on record with the Alaska 
Region, NMFS, as of 1200 hours, A.l.t., on January 31 of that year.
    (3) IFQ permit. The Regional Director shall issue to each QS holder, 
pursuant to Sec. 679.4, an IFQ permit accompanied by a statement 
specifying the maximum amount of halibut and sablefish that may be 
harvested with fixed gear in a specified IFQ regulatory area and vessel 
category as of January 31 of that year. Such IFQ permits will be mailed 
to each QS holder at the address on record for that person after the 
beginning of each fishing year but prior to the start of the annual IFQ 
fishing season.
    (d) Ten-percent adjustment policy. A person's annual IFQ account 
will be adjusted in the year following a determination that the person 
harvested or landed IFQ species in an amount is greater than the amount 
available in the person's annual IFQ account and if the amount greater 
than the amount available does not exceed 10 percent of the amount 
available in the person's annual IFQ account at the time of landing. The 
adjustment would be a deduction of the amount of IFQ species harvested 
or landed that was determined to exceed the amount available in the 
person's annual IFQ account and will apply to any person to whom the 
affected IFQ is allocated in the year following the determination.
    (e) Underages. Underages of up to 10 percent of a person's total 
annual IFQ account for a current fishing year will be added to that 
person's annual IFQ account in the year following determination of the 
underage. This underage adjustment to the annual IFQ allocation will be 
specific to IFQ species, IFQ regulatory area, and vessel category for 
which an IFQ is calculated, and will apply to any person to whom the 
affected IFQ is allocated in the year following determination of an 
underage.
    (f) Harvesting privilege. Quota shares allocated or permits issued 
pursuant to this part do not represent either an absolute right to the 
resource or any interest that is subject to the ``takings'' provision of 
the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Rather, such quota shares 
or permits represent only a harvesting privilege that may be revoked or 
amended subject to the requirements of the Magnuson Act and other 
applicable law.
    (g) Tagged halibut and sablefish. (1) Nothing contained in this part 
shall prohibit any person at any time from retaining and landing a 
Pacific halibut or sablefish that bears at the time of capture a 
research tag from any state, Federal, or international agency, provided 
that the halibut or sablefish is:
    (i) A Pacific halibut landed pursuant to 50 CFR 300.18; or
    (ii) A sablefish landed in accordance with the Tagged Groundfish 
Research Program.
    (2) Tagged halibut or sablefish landed pursuant to paragraphs (1)(i) 
or (1)(ii) of this section shall not be calculated as part of an 
individual's IFQ harvest or be debited against an individual's halibut 
or sablefish IFQ.

<R05>
Sec. 679.41  Transfer of QS and IFQ.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, transfer of QS or IFQ means any transaction requiring QS, or 
the use thereof in the form of IFQ, to pass from one person to another, 
permanently or for a fixed period of time.
    (2) Transactions requiring IFQ cards to be issued in the name of a 
vessel master employed by an individual or a corporation are not 
transfers of QS or IFQ.
    (b) Transfer procedure--(1) Application for transfer. An Application 
for Transfer of QS/IFQ (Application for Transfer) must be approved by 
the Regional Director before a person may use IFQ to harvest IFQ halibut 
or IFQ sablefish, whether the IFQ was the result of a direct transfer or 
the result of a QS transfer. An Application for Transfer will not be 
approved until the Regional Director has reviewed and approved the 
transfer agreement signed by the parties to the transaction. The 
Regional Director shall provide an Application for Transfer form to any 
person on request. Persons who submit an Application for Transfer to the 
Regional Director for approval will receive notification of the Regional 
Director's decision to approve or disapprove the Application for 
Transfer, and, if applicable, the reason(s) for disapproval, by mail 
posted on the date of that decision, unless another communication mode 
is requested on the Application for Transfer.
    (2) QS or IFQ accounts. QS or IFQ accounts affected by an 
Application for Transfer approved by the Regional Director will change 
on the date of approval. Any necessary IFQ permits will be sent with the 
notification of the Regional Director's decision.
    (c) Application for Transfer approval criteria. Except as provided 
in paragraph (f) of this section, an Application for Transfer will not 
be approved until the Regional Director has determined that:
    (1) The person applying for transfer received the QS or IFQ to be 
transferred:
    (i) By initial assignment by the Regional Director as provided in 
Sec. 679.40(a); or
    (ii) By approved transfer.
    (2) The person applying to receive the QS or IFQ meets the 
requirements of eligibility in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) The person applying for transfer and the person applying to 
receive the QS or IFQ have their notarized signatures on the Application 
for Transfer.
    (4) There are no fines, civil penalties, or other payments due and 
owing, or outstanding permit sanctions, resulting from Federal fishery 
violations involving either person.
    (5) The person applying to receive the QS or IFQ currently exists.
    (6) The transfer would not cause the person applying to receive the 
QS or IFQ to exceed the use limits in Sec. 679.42 (e) or (f).
    (7) The transfer would not violate the provisions of paragraph (g) 
of this section.
    (8) Other pertinent information requested on the Application for 
Transfer has been supplied to the satisfaction of the Regional Director.
    (d) Eligibility to receive QS or IFQ by transfer--(1) Application 
for Eligibility. All persons applying to receive QS or IFQ must submit 
an Application for Eligibility to Receive QS/IFQ (Application for 
Eligibility), containing accurate information, to the Regional Director. 
The Regional Director will not approve a transfer of IFQ or QS to a 
person until the Application for Eligibility for that person is approved 
by the Regional Director. The Regional Director shall provide an 
Application for Eligibility form to any person on request.
    (2) Type of eligibility. A person must indicate on the Application 
for Eligibility whether the eligibility sought is as:
    (i) An individual; or
    (ii) A corporation, partnership, or other entity.
    (3) Application filing order. A person may submit the Application 
for Eligibility with the Application for Transfer or file the 
Application for Eligibility prior to submitting the Application for 
Transfer. If a person, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this 
section, files the Application for Eligibility prior to submitting the 
Application for Transfer, and that person's status subsequently changes, 
as described in

[[Page 428]]

Sec. 679.42(j), that person must resubmit an Application for Eligibility 
before submitting, or with, the Application for Transfer.
    (4) Notification of approval. Applicants will be notified by mail of 
the Regional Director's approval of an application for eligibility.
    (5) Notification of disapproval. The Regional Director will notify 
the applicant if an Application for Eligibility is disapproved. This 
notification of disapproval will include:
    (i) The disapproved Application for Eligibility.
    (ii) An explanation of why the Application for Eligibility was not 
approved.
    (6) Reasons for disapproval. Reasons for disapproval of an 
Application for Eligibility may include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Fewer than 150 days of experience working as an IFQ crewmember.
    (ii) Lack of compliance with the U.S. citizenship or corporate 
ownership requirements specified by the definition of ``person'' at 
Sec. 679.2.
    (iii) An incomplete Application for Eligibility.
    (iv) Fines, civil penalties, or other payments due and owing, or 
outstanding permit sanctions, resulting from Federal fishery violations.
    (e) Transfers of QS blocks. (1) A QS block must be transferred as an 
undivided whole, unless the size of the QS block exceeds the use limits 
specified at Sec. 679.42. If the QS block to be transferred exceeds the 
use limits specified at Sec. 679.42, the Regional Director will divide 
the block into two blocks, one block containing the maximum amount of QS 
allowable under the QS use limits and the other block containing the 
residual QS.
    (2) QS blocks representing less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for 
halibut or less than 3,000 lb (1.9 mt) for sablefish, based on the 
factors listed in Sec. 679.40(a), for the same IFQ regulatory area and 
vessel category, may be consolidated into larger QS blocks, provided 
that the consolidated QS blocks do not represent greater than 1,000 lb 
(0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut or greater than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for 
sablefish based on the factors listed in Sec. 679.40(a). A consolidated 
QS block cannot be divided and is considered a single block for purposes 
of use and transferability.
    (f) Transfer of QS or IFQ with restrictions. If QS or IFQ must be 
transferred as a result of a court order, operation of law, or as part 
of a security agreement, but the person receiving the QS or IFQ by 
transfer does not meet all of the eligibility requirements of this 
section, the Regional Director will approve the Application for Transfer 
with restrictions. The Regional Director will not assign IFQ resulting 
from the restricted QS to any person. IFQ with restrictions may not be 
used for harvesting halibut or sablefish with fixed gear. The QS or IFQ 
will remain restricted until:
    (1) The person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions meets 
the eligibility requirements of this section and the Regional Director 
approves an Application for Eligibility for that person; or
    (2) The Regional Director approves the Application for Transfer from 
the person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions to a person who 
meets the requirements of this section.
    (g) Transfer restrictions. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f) 
or paragraph (g)(2) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew 
members or who were initially issued QS assigned to vessel categories B, 
C, or D, and meet the other requirements in this section, may receive by 
transfer QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D, or the IFQ 
resulting from it.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, only 
persons who are IFQ crew members, and meet the other requirements in 
this section, may receive by transfer QS assigned to vessel categories 
B, C, or D, or the IFQ resulting from it, in IFQ regulatory area 2C for 
halibut or in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long. for 
sablefish.
    (3) Individuals who were initially issued QS assigned to vessel 
categories B, C, or D may transfer that QS to a corporation that is 
solely owned by the same individual. Such transfers of QS assigned to 
vessel categories B, C, or D in IFQ regulatory area 2C for halibut or in 
the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long. for sablefish will be 
governed by the use provisions of

[[Page 429]]

Sec. 679.42(i); the use provisions pertaining to corporations at 
Sec. 679.42(j) shall not apply.
    (4) The Regional Director will not approve an Application for 
Transfer of QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D subject to a 
lease or any other condition of repossession or resale by the person 
transferring QS, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, or 
by court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement. 
The Regional Director may request a copy of the sales contract or other 
terms and conditions of transfer between two persons as supplementary 
information to the transfer application.
    (h) Transfer of IFQ. (1) Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, 
an Application for Transfer must be approved by the Regional Director 
before a person may use any IFQ that results from a direct transfer to 
harvest halibut or sablefish. After approving the Application for 
Transfer, the Regional Director will change any IFQ accounts affected by 
the approved transfer and issue all necessary IFQ permits.
    (2) (Applicable until January 2, 1998). A person may transfer no 
more than 10 percent of the total IFQ resulting from QS held by that 
person and assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D for any IFQ species 
in any IFQ regulatory area to one or more persons for any fishing year.
    (i) Transfer across catcher vessel categories--(1) CDQ compensation. 
Persons issued CDQ compensation QS in a catcher vessel category, 
pursuant to Sec. 679.41(j), and in an IFQ regulatory area in which they 
do not hold QS other than CDQ compensation QS, may use that CDQ 
compensation QS on any catcher vessel. This exemption from catcher 
vessel categories ends upon the first transfer of the CDQ compensation 
QS. CDQ compensation QS being transferred will be permanently assigned 
to a specific catcher vessel category as designated by the person 
receiving the transfer.
    (2) Redesignated catcher vessel category (Applicable until February 
24, 1997). Catcher vessel QS transferred as partial or total 
consideration for the transfer of CDQ compensation QS may be 
redesignated into a new catcher vessel category if the CDQ compensation 
QS being transferred can be used on any catcher vessel pursuant to the 
exemption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section and the person to which 
that CDQ compensation QS was issued is party to the transfer.
    (3) CDQ compensation QS definition. For purposes of this paragraph 
(i), CDQ compensation QS is QS issued as compensation for halibut and 
sablefish harvest privileges foregone due to the CDQ Program, as 
provided in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (j) Compensation for CDQ allocations. (1) The Regional Director will 
compensate persons that receive a reduced halibut QS in IPHC regulatory 
areas 4B, 4C, 4D, or 4E because of the halibut CDQ program by adding 
halibut QS from IPHC regulatory areas 2C, 3A, 3B, and 4A. This 
compensation of halibut QS from areas 2C, 3A, 3B, and 4A will be 
allocated in proportion to the amount of halibut QS foregone due to the 
CDQ allocation authorized by this section.
    (2) The Regional Director will compensate persons that receive a 
reduced sablefish QS in any BSAI IFQ regulatory area because of the 
sablefish CDQ program by taking sablefish QS from the IFQ regulatory 
areas of the GOA and allocating it in proportion to the loss suffered by 
persons in the BSAI area. Such additional compensation of sablefish QS 
will be allocated in proportion to the amount of sablefish QS foregone 
due to the CDQ allocation authorized by this section.
    (3) Persons initially issued QS for IFQ regulatory areas in which a 
portion of the TAC is allocated to the CDQ Program will be compensated 
for halibut and sablefish harvest privileges foregone due to the CDQ 
Program. If a person does not hold QS in an IFQ regulatory area on the 
date the compensation is issued, that person's compensation will be 
issued as unblocked. If a person does hold QS in an IFQ regulatory area 
on the date compensation is issued, that person's compensation will be 
added to their existing QS in that IFQ regulatory area. The resulting QS 
amount will be blocked or unblocked according to the criteria found at 
Sec. 679.40(a). Compensation will be calculated for each non-CDQ area 
using the following formula:


[[Page 430]]


Q<INF>N = (Q<INF>C x QSP<INF>N x RATE)/(SUM<INF>CDQ- 
[RATE x SUM<INF>TAC]) ([1-RATE] x TAC<INF>AVE)(QSP<INF>C x 
[CDQ <INF>PCT -RATE])

Where:

Q<INF>N = quota share in non-CDQ area
Q<INF>C = quota share in CDQ area
QSP<INF>N = quota share pool in non-CDQ area (as existing on January 31, 
          1995)
RATE = SUM<INF>CDQ/average of the TAC (1988-1994) for all CDQ and non-
          CDQ areas
TAC<INF>AVE = average of the TAC (1988-1994) for CDQ area
QSP<INF>C = quota share pool in CDQ area (as existing on January 31, 
          1995)
CDQ<INF>PCT = CDQ percentage for CDQ area
SUM<INF>CDQ = sum [TAC<INF>AVE x CDQ<INF>PCT]
SUM<INF>TAC = sum [TAC<INF>AVE]
    (k) Transfer to the surviving spouse. (1) On the death of an 
individual who holds QS or IFQ, the surviving spouse receives all QS and 
IFQ held by the decedent by right of survivorship, unless a contrary 
intent was expressed by the decedent in a will that is probated. The 
Regional Director will approve an Application for Transfer to the 
surviving spouse when sufficient evidence has been provided to verify 
the death of the individual.
    (2) The Regional Director will approve, for 3 calendar years 
following the date of death of an individual, an Application for 
Transfer of IFQ from the surviving spouse to a person eligible to 
receive IFQ under the provisions of this section, notwithstanding the 
limitations on transfers of IFQ in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

[61 FR 31230, June 19, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 33385, June 27, 1996; 
61 FR 41526, Aug. 9, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 679.42  Limitations on use of QS and IFQ.

    (a) IFQ regulatory area and vessel category. The QS or IFQ specified 
for one IFQ regulatory area must not be used in a different IFQ 
regulatory area. Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section or 
in Sec. 679.41(i)(1) of this part, the IFQ assigned to one vessel 
category must not be used to harvest IFQ species on a vessel of a 
different vessel category. Notwithstanding Sec. 679.40(a)(5)(ii) of this 
part, IFQ assigned to vessel Category B must not be used on any vessel 
less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA to harvest IFQ halibut in IFQ 
regulatory area 2C or IFQ sablefish in the IFQ regulatory area east of 
140 deg. W. long. unless such IFQ derives from blocked QS units that 
result in IFQ of less than 5,000 lb (2.3 mt), based on the 1996 TAC for 
fixed gear specified for the IFQ halibut fishery and the IFQ sablefish 
fishery in each of these two regulatory areas.
    (b) Gear. Halibut IFQ must be used only to harvest halibut with 
fishing gear authorized in Sec. 679.2. Sablefish fixed gear IFQ must not 
be used to harvest sablefish with trawl gear in any IFQ regulatory area, 
or with pot gear in any IFQ regulatory area of the GOA.
    (c) Requirements. Any individual who harvests halibut or sablefish 
with fixed gear must:
    (1) Have a valid IFQ card.
    (2) Be aboard the vessel at all times during fishing operations.
    (3) Sign any required fish ticket or IFQ landing report for the 
amount of halibut or sablefish that will be debited against the IFQ 
associated with their IFQ card.
    (i) Sablefish PRRs. The amount of sablefish to be reported to NMFS 
for debit from an IFQ account will be the round-weight equivalent 
determined by dividing the initial accurate scale weight of the 
sablefish product obtained at time of landing by the standard PRRs for 
sablefish in Table 3 to this part.
    (ii) Halibut PRRs. The amount of halibut to be reported to NMFS for 
debit from an IFQ account will be the gutted, head-off weight determined 
by multiplying the initial accurate scale weight of the halibut obtained 
at the time of landing by the following conversion factors:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Conversion
        Product code               Product  description         factor  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
01..........................  Whole fish...................         0.75
04..........................  Gutted, head on..............         0.90
05..........................  Gutted, head off.............         1.00
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Emergency waiver. The requirement of paragraph (c) of this 
section for an individual IFQ card holder to be aboard the vessel during 
fishing operations and to sign the IFQ landing report may be waived in 
the event of extreme personal emergency involving the IFQ user during a 
fishing trip. The waiving of these requirements shall

[[Page 431]]

apply only to IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish retained on the fishing trip 
during which such emergency occurred.
    (e) Sablefish QS use. (1) No person, individually or collectively, 
may use an amount of sablefish QS greater than 1 percent of the combined 
total sablefish QS for the GOA and BSAI IFQ regulatory areas, unless the 
amount in excess of 1 percent was received in the initial allocation of 
QS.
    (2) In the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long., no person, 
individually or collectively, may use more than 1 percent of the total 
amount of QS for this area, unless the amount in excess of 1 percent was 
received in the initial allocation of QS.
    (f) Halibut QS use. Unless the amount in excess of the following 
limits was received in the initial allocation of halibut QS, no person, 
individually or collectively, may use more than:
    (1) IFQ regulatory area 2C. One percent of the total amount of 
halibut QS for IFQ regulatory area 2C.
    (2) IFQ Regulatory areas 2C, 3A, and 3B. One-half percent of the 
total amount of halibut QS for IFQ regulatory areas 2C, 3A, and 3B, 
combined.
    (3) IFQ Regulatory areas 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and 4E. One-half percent of 
the total amount of halibut QS for IFQ regulatory areas 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 
and 4E, combined.
    (g) Limitations on QS blocks--(1) Number of blocks per species. (i) 
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, no person, 
individually or collectively, may hold more than two blocks for each 
species in any IFQ regulatory area.
    (ii) If that person, individually or collectively, holds unblocked 
QS for a species in an IFQ regulatory area, such person may only hold 
one QS block for that species in that IFQ regulatory area.
    (2) Holding or to hold blocks of QS. For purposes of this section, 
``holding'' or ``to hold'' blocks of QS means being registered by NMFS 
as the person who received QS by initial assignment or approved 
transfer.
    (h) Vessel limitations--(1) Halibut. (i) Except as provided in 
paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, no vessel may be used, during any 
fishing year, to harvest more than one-half percent of the combined 
total catch limits of halibut for IFQ regulatory areas 2C, 3A, 3B, 4A, 
4B, 4C, 4D, and 4E.
    (ii) In IFQ regulatory area 2C, no vessel may be used to harvest 
more than 1 percent of the halibut catch limit for this area.
    (2) Sablefish. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of 
this section, no vessel may be used, during any fishing year, to harvest 
more than 1 percent of the combined fixed gear TAC of sablefish for the 
GOA and BSAI IFQ regulatory areas.
    (ii) In the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long., no vessel 
may be used to harvest more than 1 percent of the fixed gear TAC of 
sablefish for this area.
    (3) Excess. A person who receives an approved IFQ allocation of 
halibut or sablefish in excess of these limitations may nevertheless 
catch and retain all of that IFQ with a single vessel. However, two or 
more persons may not catch and retain their IFQs with one vessel in 
excess of these limitations.
    (i) Use of IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, 
or D by individuals. In addition to the requirements of paragraph (c) of 
this section, IFQ cards issued for IFQ resulting from QS assigned to 
vessel categories B, C, or D must be used only by the individual who 
holds the QS from which the associated IFQ is derived, except as 
provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
    (1) An individual who receives an initial allocation of QS assigned 
to vessel categories B, C, or D does not have to be on board and sign 
IFQ landing reports if that individual owns the vessel on which IFQ 
sablefish or halibut are harvested, and is represented on the vessel by 
a master employed by the individual who received the initial allocation 
of QS.
    (2) The exemption provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section does 
not apply to individuals who receive an initial allocation of QS 
assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D for halibut in IFQ regulatory 
area 2C or for sablefish QS in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. 
W. long., and this exemption is not transferrable.
    (j) Use of IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, 
or D by

[[Page 432]]

corporations and partnerships. A corporation or partnership that 
receives an initial allocation of QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, 
or D may use the IFQ resulting from that QS and any additional QS 
acquired within the limitations of this section provided the corporation 
or partnership owns the vessel on which its IFQ is used, and it is 
represented on the vessel by a master employed by the corporation or 
partnership that received the initial allocation of QS. This provision 
is not transferrable and does not apply to QS assigned to vessel 
categories B, C, or D for halibut in IFQ regulatory area 2C or for 
sablefish in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long. that is 
transferred to a corporation or partnership. Such transfers of 
additional QS within these areas must be to an individual pursuant to 
Sec. 676.41(c) of this part and be used pursuant to paragraphs (c) and 
(i) of this section.
    (1) A corporation or partnership, except for a publicly-held 
corporation, that receives an initial allocation of QS assigned to 
vessel categories B, C, or D loses the exemption provided under 
paragraph (j) of this section on the effective date of a change in the 
corporation or partnership from that which existed at the time of 
initial allocation.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (j), ``a change in the 
corporation or partnership'' means the addition of any new 
shareholder(s) or partner(s), except that a court appointed trustee to 
act on behalf of a shareholder or partner who becomes incapacitated is 
not a change in the corporation or partnership.
    (3) The Regional Director must be notified of a change in a 
corporation or partnership as defined in this paragraph (j) within 15 
days of the effective date of the change. The effective date of change, 
for purposes of this paragraph (j), is the date on which the new 
shareholder(s) or partner(s) may realize any corporate liabilities or 
benefits of the corporation or partnership.
    (4) QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D and IFQ resulting 
from that QS held in the name of a corporation or partnership that 
changes, as defined in this paragraph, must be transferred to an 
individual, as prescribed in Sec. 679.41 of this part, before it may be 
used at any time after the effective date of the change.
    (k) Processing of fish other than IFQ halibut and IFQ sablefish. 
Fish other than IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish may be processed on a 
vessel on which persons:
    (1) Are authorized to harvest IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish based on 
allocations of IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel category A; or
    (2) Are authorized to harvest IFQ sablefish based on allocations of 
IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel categories B or C unless any 
person aboard the vessel is authorized to harvest IFQ halibut based on 
allocations of IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, 
or D.

<R05>
Sec. 679.43  Determinations and appeals.

    (a) General. This section describes the procedure for appealing 
initial administrative determinations made under this subpart D, 
portions of subpart C of this part that apply to the halibut and 
sablefish CDQ program, and Sec. 679.4(c).
    (b) Who may appeal. Any person whose interest is directly and 
adversely affected by an initial administrative determination may file a 
written appeal. For purposes of this section, such persons will be 
referred to as ``applicant'' or ``appellant.''
    (c) Submission of appeals. Appeals must be in writing and must be 
submitted in original form to the Regional Director. Contact the 
Regional Director for appeals address. Appeals transmitted by electronic 
means will not be accepted.
    (d) Timing of appeals. (1) If an applicant appeals an initial 
administrative determination, the appeal must be filed not later than 60 
days after the date the determination is issued.
    (2) The time period within which an appeal may be filed begins to 
run on the date the initial administrative determination is issued. If 
the last day of the time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal 
holiday, the time period will extend to the close of business on the 
next business day.

[[Page 433]]

    (e) Address of record. NMFS will establish as the address of record 
the address used by the applicant in initial correspondence to Chief, 
RAM Division, after the application period has begun. Notifications of 
all actions affecting the applicant after establishing an address of 
record will be mailed to that address, unless the applicant provides 
NMFS, in writing, with any changes to that address. NMFS bears no 
responsibility if a notification is sent to the address of record and is 
not received because the applicant's actual address has changed without 
notification to NMFS.
    (f) Statement of reasons for appeals. Applicants must timely submit 
a full written statement in support of the appeal, including a concise 
statement of the reasons the initial administrative determination has a 
direct and adverse effect on the applicant and should be reversed or 
modified. If the applicant requests a hearing on any issue presented in 
the appeal, such request for hearing must be accompanied by a concise 
written statement raising genuine and substantial issues of adjudicative 
fact for resolution and a list of available and specifically identified 
reliable evidence upon which the factual issues can be resolved. The 
appellate officer will limit his/her review to the issues stated in the 
appeal; all issues not set out in the appeal will be waived.
    (g) Hearings. The appellate officer will review the applicant's 
appeal and request for hearing, and has discretion to proceed as 
follows:
    (1) Deny the appeal;
    (2) Issue a decision on the merits of the appeal, if the record 
contains sufficient information on which to reach final judgment; or
    (3) Order that a hearing be conducted. The appellate officer may so 
order only if the appeal demonstrates the following:
    (i) There is a genuine and substantial issue of adjudicative fact 
for resolution at a hearing. A hearing will not be ordered on issues of 
policy or law.
    (ii) The factual issue can be resolved by available and specifically 
identified reliable evidence. A hearing will not be ordered on the basis 
of mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and 
contentions.
    (iii) The evidence described in the request for hearing, if 
established at hearing, would be adequate to justify resolution of the 
factual issue in the way sought by the applicant. A hearing will not be 
ordered if the evidence described is insufficient to justify the factual 
determination sought, even if accurate.
    (iv) Resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the 
applicant is adequate to justify the action requested. A hearing will 
not be ordered on factual issues that are not determinative with respect 
to the action requested.
    (h) Types of hearings. If the appellate officer determines that a 
hearing should be held to resolve one or more genuine and substantial 
issues of adjudicative fact, he/she may order:
    (1) A written hearing, as provided in paragraph (m) of this section; 
or
    (2) An oral hearing, as provided in paragraph (n) of this section.
    (i) Authority of the appellate officer. The appellate officer is 
vested with general authority to conduct all hearings in an orderly 
manner, including the authority to:
    (1) Administer oaths.
    (2) Call and question witnesses.
    (3) Issue a written decision based on the record.
    (j) Evidence. All evidence that is relevant, material, reliable, and 
probative may be included in the record. Formal rules of evidence do not 
apply to hearings conducted under this section.
    (k) Appellate officers' decisions. The appellate officer will close 
the record and issue a decision after determining there is sufficient 
information to render a decision on the record of the proceedings and 
that all procedural requirements have been met. The decision must be 
based solely on the record of the proceedings. Except as provided in 
paragraph (o) of this section, an appellate officer's decision takes 
effect 30 days after it is issued and, upon taking effect, is the final 
agency action for purposes of judicial review.
    (l) Disqualification of an appellate officer. (1) The appellate 
officer will withdraw from an appeal at any time he/she deems himself/
herself disqualified.
    (2) The appellate officer may withdraw from an appeal on an 
appellant's motion if:

[[Page 434]]

    (i) The motion is entered prior to the appellate officer's issuance 
of a decision; and
    (ii) The appellant demonstrates that the appellate officer has a 
personal bias or any other basis for disqualification.
    (3) If the appellate officer denies a motion to withdraw, he/she 
will so rule on the record.
    (m) Written hearing. (1) An appellate officer may order a written 
hearing under paragraph (h)(1) of this section if he/she:
    (i) Orders a hearing as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section; and
    (ii) Determines that the issues to be resolved at hearing can be 
resolved by allowing the appellant to present written materials to

    (2) After ordering a written hearing, the appellate officer will:
    (i) Provide the appellant with notification that a written hearing 
has been ordered.
    (ii) Provide the appellant with a statement of issues to be 
determined at hearing.
    (iii) Provide the appellant with 30 days to file a written response. 
The appellant may also provide documentary evidence to support his/her 
position. The period to file a written response may be extended at the 
sole discretion of the appellate officer, if the appellant shows good 
cause for the extension.
    (3) The appellate officer may, after reviewing the appellant's 
written response and documentary evidence:
    (i) Order that an oral hearing be held, as provided in paragraph 
(h)(2) of this section, to resolve issues that cannot be resolved 
through the written hearing process;
    (ii) Request supplementary evidence from the appellant before 
closing the record; or
    (iii) Close the record.
    (4) The appellate officer will close the record and issue a decision 
after determining that the information on the record is sufficient to 
render a decision.
    (n) Oral hearing. (1) The appellate officer may order an oral 
hearing under paragraphs (h)(2) and (m)(3)(i) of this section if he/she:
    (i) Orders a hearing as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section; and
    (ii) Determines that the issues to be resolved at hearing can best 
be resolved through the oral hearing process.
    (2) After ordering an oral hearing, the appellate officer will:
    (i) Provide the appellant with notification that an oral hearing has 
been ordered.
    (ii) Provide the appellant with a statement of issues to be 
determined at hearing.
    (iii) Provide the appellant with notification, at least 30 days in 
advance, of the place, date, and time of the oral hearing. Oral hearings 
will be held in Juneau, AK, at the prescribed date and time, unless the 
appellate officer determines, based upon good cause shown, that a 
different place, date, or time will better serve the interests of 
justice. A continuance of the oral hearing may be ordered at the sole 
discretion of the appellate officer if the appellant shows good cause 
for the continuance.
    (3) The appellate officer may, either at his/her own discretion or 
on the motion of the appellant, order a pre-hearing conference, either 
in person or telephonically, to consider:
    (i) The simplification of issues.
    (ii) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions of facts, 
and agreements to the introduction of documents.
    (iii) The possibility of settlement or other means to facilitate 
resolution of the case.
    (iv) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the 
proceedings.
    (4) The appellate officer must provide the appellant with 
notification of a pre-hearing conference, if one is ordered, at least 30 
days in advance of the conference. All action taken at the pre-hearing 
conference will be made part of the record.
    (5) At the beginning of the oral hearing, the appellate officer may 
first seek to obtain stipulations as to material facts and the issues 
involved and may state any other issues on which he/she may wish to have 
evidence presented. Issues to be resolved at the hearing will be limited 
to those identified by the appellate officer as provided in

[[Page 435]]

paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The appellant will then be given an 
opportunity to present his/her case.
    (6) During the oral hearing, the appellant has the right to present 
reliable and material oral or documentary evidence and to conduct such 
cross-examination as may be required in the interests of justice.
    (7) After the conclusion of the oral hearing, the appellant may be 
given time by the appellate officer to submit any supplementary 
information that may assist in the resolution of the case.
    (8) The appellate officer will close the record and issue a decision 
after determining that the information on the record is sufficient to 
render a decision.
    (o) Review by the Regional Director. An appellate officer's decision 
is subject to review by the Regional Director, as provided in this

 Subpart E--Observer Requirements/North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan


<R05>
Sec. 679.50  Research Plan fee.

    (a) Fee percentage. The fee percentage will be set annually under 
procedures at Sec. 679.53, such that the total fees equal the lesser of 
the following:
    (1) The cost of implementing the Research Plan, including 
nonpayments, minus any other Federal funds that support the Research 
Plan and any existing surplus in the North Pacific Fishery Observer 
Fund; or
    (2) Two percent of the exvessel value of all Research Plan 
fisheries.
    (b) Fee assessment--(1) Fee assessments applicable from January 1, 
1995, through August 31, 1995--(i) General. NMFS will calculate 
bimonthly fee assessments for each processor of Research Plan fisheries 
based on the best available information received by the Regional 
Director since the last bimonthly billing period on the amount of fish 
retained by the processor from Research Plan fisheries. Fee assessments 
will not be calculated for the retained amounts of whole fish processed 
into meal product.
    (ii) Groundfish calculation. The bimonthly fee assessment is 
calculated by NMFS for each shoreside processor or mothership retaining 
groundfish, as follows:

A<INF>g = (G<INF>1  x  $<INF>exvessel  x  \1/2\F) + (G<INF>2  x  
$<INF>exvessel  x  F)

Where:
    (A) A<INF>g is the bimonthly fee assessment for groundfish.
    (B) G<INF>1 is the round weight or round-weight equivalent of 
retained catch of each groundfish species delivered by catcher vessels 
equal to and greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA determined by the best 
available information received by the Regional Director since the last 
bimonthly billing period.
    (C) G<INF>2 is the round weight or round-weight equivalent of 
retained catch of each groundfish species delivered by catcher vessels 
less than 60 ft (18.3 m)

[[Page 436]]

LOA determined by the best available information received by the 
Regional Director since the last bimonthly billing period.
    (D) F is the fee percentage established pursuant to Sec. 679.53 for 
the calendar year.
    (E) $<INF>exvessel is the standard exvessel price established 
pursuant to Sec. 679.53 for the calendar year.
    (iii) Crab calculation. The bimonthly fee assessment is calculated 
by NMFS for each processor retaining king or Tanner crab, as follows:

A<INF>c = (C<INF>1  x  $<INF>exvessel  x  \1/2\F) + (C<INF>2  x  
$<INF>exvessel  x  F)

Where:
    (A) A<INF>c is the bimonthly fee assessment for crab.
    (B) C<INF>1 is the round weight or round-weight equivalent of 
retained catch of red king crab or brown king crab harvested from 
ADF&G's statistical area R (Adak), defined at 5 AAC 34.700, brown king 
crab harvested from ADF&G's statistical area O (Dutch Harbor), defined 
at 5 AAC 34.600, Chionoecetes tanneri Tanner crab, C. angulatus Tanner 
crab, and Lithodes cousei king crab determined by the best available 
information received by the Regional Director since the last bimonthly 
billing period.
    (C) C<INF>2 is, except for those species listed under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, the round weight or round-weight 
equivalent of retained catch of king or Tanner crab, determined by the 
best available information received by the Regional Director since the 
last bimonthly billing period.
    (D) $<INF>exvessel is the standard exvessel price established 
pursuant to Sec. 679.53 for the calendar year.
    (E) F is the fee percentage established pursuant to Sec. 679.53 for 
the calendar year.
    (iv) Groundfish and halibut calculation. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the bimonthly fee assessment is 
calculated by NMFS for each processor that retains groundfish or 
halibut, as follows:

A<INF>h,g = (H  x  $<INF>exvessel  x  F)

Where:
(A) A<INF>h,g is the bimonthly fee assessment for groundfish or halibut.
    (B) H is the round weight or round-weight equivalent of retained 
catch of groundfish or halibut determined by the best available 
information received by the Regional Director since the last bimonthly 
billing period.
    (C) $<INF>exvessel is the standard exvessel price established 
pursuant to Sec. 679.53 for the calendar year.
    (D) F is the fee percentage established pursuant to Sec. 679.53 for 
the calendar year.
    (2) Fee assessments applicable from September 1, 1995, through 
December 31, 1996. Processors of Research Plan fisheries will not be 
assessed fees based on catch from Research Plan fisheries that is 
retained during the period September 1, 1995, through December 31, 1996.
    (3) Fee assessments applicable after December 31, 1996. (i) The 
bimonthly fee assessment is calculated by NMFS for each processor of 
Research Plan fisheries, as follows:

A<INF>RP = (R   x   $<INF>exvessel  x  F)

Where:
    (A) A<INF>RP is the bimonthly fee assessment for Research Plan 
fisheries.
    (B) R is the round weight or round-weight equivalent of retained 
catch for each species from Research Plan fisheries determined by the 
best available information received by the Regional Director since the 
last bimonthly billing period.
    (C) $<INF>exvessel is the standard exvessel price established 
pursuant to Sec. 679.53 for the calendar year.
    (D) F is the fee percentage established pursuant to Sec. 679.53 for 
the calendar year.
    (ii) Fee assessments will not be calculated for the retained amounts 
of whole fish processed into meal product.
    (c) Fee payments. (1) NMFS will bill each processor of Research Plan 
fisheries for bimonthly fee assessments calculated under paragraph (b) 
of this section. Each processor must collect and pay the bimonthly fee 
assessments. Bimonthly fee assessment payments must be in the form of 
certified check, draft, or money order payable in U.S. currency to ``The 
Department of Commerce/NOAA.''
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, 
payment in full must be received by the financial institution authorized 
by the U.S.

[[Page 437]]

Treasury to receive these funds within 30 calendar days from the date of 
issuance of each bimonthly fee assessment bill. Payments will be 
deposited in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund within the U.S. 
Treasury.
    (d) Credit for observer coverage costs incurred from January 1, 
1995, through August 31, 1995--(1) General. Subject to the limitations 
set out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, each processor may subtract 
from its portion of the processor's billed fee assessment the cost of 
observer coverage paid by the processor to an observer contractor(s) for 
the processor's compliance with observer coverage requirements at 
Sec. 679.51.
    (2) Limitations. (i) Only those payments to observer contractors for 
observer coverage required under Sec. 679.51 that are received by 
observer contractors prior to April 1, 1996, will be credited against a 
processor's billed fee assessment under this paragraph (d).
    (ii) The amount that may be subtracted from a catcher/processor's 
billed fee assessment for retained catch of groundfish is limited to the 
actual cost of observer coverage required under Sec. 679.51 up to an 
amount equal to the fee assessment calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) 
of this section.
    (iii) The amount that may be subtracted from a shoreside processor's 
or mothership processor vessel's billed fee assessment for retained 
catch of groundfish is limited to the actual cost of observer coverage 
required under Sec. 679.51 up to an amount equal to the sum of the fee 
assessment calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section plus 
one half the fee assessment calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of 
this section.
    (iv) The amount that may be subtracted from a catcher/processor or 
mothership processor vessel's billed fee assessment for retained catch 
of king or Tanner crab is limited to the actual cost of observer 
coverage required under Sec. 679.51 up to an amount equal to the sum of 
the fee assessment calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this 
section plus one half the fee assessment calculated under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii)(C) of this section.
    (3) Credit applied by NMFS to bimonthly fee assessments. If a 
processor's cost for observer coverage required under Sec. 679.51 during 
a bimonthly period exceeds the calculated fee assessment for that 
period, the Regional Director will credit the processor's next bimonthly 
fee assessment up to an amount equal to the remaining observer coverage 
costs as reported to the Regional Director under paragraph (e) of this 
section, or the bimonthly fee assessment, whichever is less.
    (e) Recordkeeping and reporting--(1) Processor requirements. (i) All 
processors that subtract costs for observer coverage from their 
bimonthly fee assessment under this paragraph (e) must submit to the 
Regional Director a copy of each paid invoice for observer coverage and 
a copy of the check, money order, or other form of payment sent to the 
observer contractor in payment for observer coverage listed on the 
invoice.
    (ii) The information required under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this 
section must be sent at the time the processor submits the payment of 
the bimonthly fee assessment to the Department of Commerce/NOAA under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Observer contractor requirements. (i) Observer contractors must 
submit to the Regional Director a completed Observer Coverage Payment 
Receipt Form for each payment received from a processor for compliance 
with observer coverage requirements at Sec. 679.51 and a copy of the 
check, money order, or other form of payment. Each completed form and 
the attached copy of the record of payment must be submitted to NMFS 
Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, WA, within 7 days after 
payment is received.
    (ii) Observer coverage payment receipt form. Observer contractors 
may obtain Observer Coverage Payment Receipt Forms from the Regional 
Director. The form requests the following information:
    (A) Observer contractor name and signature of a person serving as a 
representative for the observer contractor;
    (B) Identification of the processor vessel or shoreside processor 
that received observer coverage;
    (C) Name of the observer(s) and date(s) of deployment for observer 
coverage;

[[Page 438]]

    (D) The name and mailing address of the person who paid for observer 
coverage; and
    (E) The total amount paid for observer coverage and the date payment 
for observer coverage was received; and
    (F) Copies of the check, money order, or other form of payment.
    (f) Disputed fee assessments. (1) A processor must notify the 
Regional Director, in writing, within 30 days of issuance of a bimonthly 
fee assessment bill, if any portion of the bimonthly fee assessment bill 
is disputed. The processor must pay the undisputed amount of the 
bimonthly fee assessment bill within 30 days of its issuance, and 
provide documentation supporting the disputed portion claimed to be 
under- or over-billed.
    (2) The Regional Director will review the bimonthly fee assessment 
bill and the documentation provided by the processor, and will notify 
the processor of his/her determination within 60 days of the date of 
issuance of the bimonthly fee assessment bill. If the Regional Director 
determines a billing error has occurred, the processor's account will be 
rectified by credit or issuance of a corrected fee assessment bill. If 
the Regional Director determines that a billing error has not occurred, 
the outstanding payment on the bimonthly fee assessment bill will be 
considered past-due from the date 30 days from the date of issuance of 
the bill and late charges will be assessed under paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (3) If the processor does not dispute the amount of the fee 
assessment bill within 30 days of its issuance, the fee assessment will 
be final, and will be due to the United States.
    (g) Late charges. The NOAA Office of the Comptroller shall assess 
late charges in the form of interest and administrative charges for late 
payment of fee assessments. Interest will accrue on the unpaid amount at 
a percentage rate established by the Federal Reserve Board and applied 
to funds held by the U.S. Treasury for each 30-day period, or portion 
thereof, that the payment is overdue. Payment received after 90 days 
from the due date will be charged an additional late payment penalty 
charge of 6 percent of the balance due.
    (h) Refund of the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund (Observer 
Fund)--(1) General. (i) All monies in the Observer Fund will be refunded 
according to the refund procedure set out in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section. The sum of all amounts refunded cannot exceed the amount 
available in the Observer Fund.
    (ii) The monies in the Observer Fund include: Fee assessment 
payments as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, assessed late 
charges in the form of interest and administrative charges for late 
payment of fee assessments as specified in paragraph (g) of this 
section, and accrued interest. Until the time of refund, monies will 
remain deposited in the Observer Fund earning interest.
    (iii) Without exception, full disbursement of the Observer Fund will 
occur to refund Research Plan processors. NMFS will not retain any funds 
either to reimburse programs for costs incurred to implement the 
Research Plan or to issue refunds.
    (2) Identification of the Research Plan refund recipient.
    (i) Except as indicated in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, 
Research Plan fees will be refunded to the person who was billed and 
made payment to NMFS. The recipient of the refund and the refund amount 
will be based on Federal processor permit records and Research Plan 
billing.
    (ii) Exceptions. (A) If a refund recipient has died, the refund will 
be issued to the recipient's estate;
    (B) If a refund recipient is a corporation and has gone bankrupt, 
successor-in-interest guidelines, as set forth in applicable state law, 
will be followed.
    (3) Calculation of the principal portion of refund. All payment 
amounts as assessed under paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section, and 
paid by processors, will be verified by NMFS in the Research Plan 
billing records and will constitute the principal portion of the refund.
    (4) Calculation of the interest portion of refund--(i) General. (A) 
The interest earned by the principal portion invested in the Observer 
Fund will be distributed among paying processors

[[Page 439]]

based on their proportional contribution to the Observer Fund. 
Contributions are based on two factors: The processor's total payment 
amount and the number of days the processor's total payment amount was 
on deposit.
    (B) This method is necessary to ensure that the interest that is 
refunded does not exceed the interest amount that was earned and is 
available in the Observer Fund. Due to the administrative process used 
to invest the funds, certain delays existed between the date a processor 
made payment and the actual investment date. The date of payment is not 
the date the deposits were invested. Therefore, using the date of 
payment to calculate interest earned on an individual processor's 
payments will not accurately reflect the interest that was actually 
earned.
    (C) NMFS has determined that the calculation specified in this 
paragraph (h)(4) is a fair and equitable way to distribute the interest 
earned on Observer Fund investments among the processors that made 
Research Plan payments. The interest portion of the refund will be 
calculated as follows.
    (ii) Processor's contribution. A processor's total payment amount 
multiplied by the number of days the processor's total payment amount 
was on deposit equals the processor's contribution. The number of days 
is based on the payment receipt date at the First National Bank of 
Chicago. For example, if a processor's total payment amount was $20,000 
and this amount was on deposit for 150 days, then the processor's 
contribution is $20,000 x 150=$3,000,000);
    (iii) Processor's percent contribution to Observer Fund. A 
processor's contribution divided by the total amount of all processor 
contributions multiplied by 100 equals the processor's percent 
contribution to the Observer Fund. For example, if the total amount of 
all processor contributions is $750,000,000 ($5,000,000 x 150 days), 
then the processor's percent contribution is $3,000,000/
$750,000,000 x 100=0.4 percent.
    (iv) Processor's interest portion of Research Plan refund. A 
processor's percent contribution multiplied by the total amount of 
interest earned by the Observer Fund equals the processor's interest 
portion of the Research Plan refund. For example, if the total amount of 
interest earned by the Observer Fund is $200,000, then the processor's 
interest portion of the Research Plan refund is 0.4 
percent x $200,000=$800.
    (5) Disinvestment of the Observer Fund. The interest portion of the 
refund cannot be calculated until Observer Fund investments are 
withdrawn. Withdrawal of investments will occur just prior to the 
earliest possible issuance of refund checks in order to avoid 
unwarranted loss of interest. The actual amount of a processor's 
interest portion of the refund will be evident upon receipt of the 
refund check.
    (6) Notification to processors of refund amounts. (i) NMFS will 
notify each processor by certified mail of a preliminary determination 
of the principal portion of the refund amount. The sum of the payment 
amounts received for each processor equals the principal portion of the 
Research Plan refund.
    (ii) Final determination of a processor's principal portion is 
subject to resolution of all disputes received under paragraph (h)(7) of 
this section.
    (iii) The notification letter to each processor will include the 
following itemized reference information:
    (A) Payment amount received.
    (B) Payment receipt date at the First National Bank of Chicago.
    (C) Check number.
    (D) Research Plan bill number to which the payment was applied.
    (E) The fishery category to which the payment was applied.
    (7) Dispute process. A processor that disagrees with any 
determination of the principal portion of the refund amount as described 
in paragraph (h)(3) of this section must sign the certified notification 
letter and return it to NMFS within 30 days of receipt of the certified 
letter, accompanied by documentation supporting the disputed principal 
portion of the refund amount.
    (i) NMFS review. NMFS will review letters and documentation received 
under this paragraph (h)(7).
    (ii) NMFS determination. (A) If NMFS determines an error exists in 
the calculation of the principal portion of refund amounts, NMFS will 
correct such calculations and notify the affected processors of its 
determination; or

[[Page 440]]

    (B) If NMFS determines no error exists in the calculation of the 
principal portion of refund amounts, NMFS will notify the affected 
processors of its determination.
    (8) Disbursement of refund checks. Once all disputes received under 
paragraph (h)(7) of this section have been resolved, NMFS will authorize 
and provide necessary documentation for refund checks to be disbursed by 
the U.S. Treasury.

the days it receives or processes groundfish during that month.
    (iii) Each mothership that receives pollock harvested by catcher 
vessels in the CVOA, defined in Figure 2 of this part, during the second 
pollock season that starts on August 15 under Sec. 679.23, is required 
to have a second NMFS-certified observer aboard, in addition to the 
observer required under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, 
for each day of the second pollock season until the chum salmon savings 
area is closed under Sec. 679.21(e)(7)(vi), or October 15, 1996, 
whichever occurs first.
    (2) Catcher/processor or catcher vessel. A catcher/processor or 
catcher vessel:
    (i) Except for a vessel fishing for groundfish with pot gear as 
provided in paragraphs (a)(2) (iv) and (v) of this section, 125 ft (38.1 
m) LOA or longer must carry a NMFS-certified observer during 100 percent 
of its fishing days while fishing for groundfish.
    (ii) Equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA, but less than 125 
ft (38.1 m) LOA, must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least 30 
percent of its fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessel 
participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for 
groundfish. Each vessel that participates for more than 3 fishing days 
in a directed fishery for groundfish in a calendar quarter must carry a 
NMFS-certified observer during at least one fishing trip during that 
calendar quarter for each of the groundfish fishery categories defined 
under paragraph (b) of this section in which the vessel participates.
    (iii) Fishing with hook-and-line gear that is required to carry an 
observer under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must carry a NMFS-
certified observer during at least one fishing trip in the GOA Eastern 
Regulatory Area during each calendar quarter in which the vessel 
participates in a directed fishery for groundfish in the Eastern 
Regulatory Area.
    (iv) Equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA fishing with pot 
gear must carry a NMFS-certified observer during at least 30 percent of 
its fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessel 
participates for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for 
groundfish.
    (v) Participating for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery 
for groundfish using pot gear must carry a NMFS-certified observer 
during at least one fishing trip during a calendar quarter for each of 
the groundfish fishery categories defined under paragraph (b) of this 
section in which the vessel participates.
    (b) Groundfish fishery categories requiring separate coverage. 
Directed fishing for groundfish, during any fishing trip, results:
    (1) Pollock fishery. In a retained catch of pollock that is greater 
than the retained catch of any other groundfish species or species group 
that is specified as a separate groundfish fishery under this paragraph 
(b).
    (2) Pacific cod fishery. In a retained catch of Pacific cod that is 
greater than the retained catch of any other groundfish species or

[[Page 441]]

that is specified as a separate groundfish fishery under this paragraph 
(b).
    (3) Sablefish fishery. In a retained catch of sablefish that is 
greater than the retained catch of any other groundfish species or 
species group that is specified as a separate groundfish fishery under 
this paragraph (b).
    (4) Rockfish fishery. In a retained aggregate catch of rockfish of 
the genera Sebastes and Sebastolobus that is greater than the retained 
catch of any other groundfish species or species group that is specified 
as a separate groundfish fishery under this paragraph (b).
    (5) Flatfish fishery. In a retained aggregate catch of all flatfish 
species, except halibut, that is greater than the retained catch of any 
other groundfish species or species group that is specified as a 
separate groundfish fishery under this paragraph (b).
    (6) Other species fishery. In a retained catch of groundfish that 
does not qualify as a pollock, Pacific cod, sablefish, rockfish, or 
flatfish fishery as defined under paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this 
section.
    (c) Assignment of vessels to fisheries. At the end of any fishing 
trip, a vessel's retained catch composition of groundfish species or 
species groups for which a TAC has been specified under Sec. 679.20, in 
round weight or round-weight equivalents, will determine to which of the 
fishery categories listed under paragraph (b) of this section the vessel 
is assigned.
    (1) Catcher/processor. A catcher/processor will be assigned to a 
fishery category based on retained groundfish catch composition reported 
on the vessel's WPR submitted to the Regional Director under Sec. 679.5.
    (2) Catcher vessel delivery in Federal waters. A catcher vessel that 
delivers to motherships in Federal waters will be assigned to a fishery 
category based on the retained groundfish catch composition reported on 
the WPR submitted to the Regional Director for that week by the 
mothership under Sec. 679.5.
    (3) Catcher vessel delivery in Alaska State waters. A catcher vessel 
that delivers groundfish to a shoreside processor or to a mothership in 
Alaska State waters will be assigned to a fishery category based on the

tickets as required under Alaska Statutes at A.S. 16.05.690.
    (d) Coverage requirements for managers of BSAI and GOA groundfish 
shoreside processors. Observer coverage is required as follows. A 
shoreside processor:
    (1) That processes 1,000 mt or more in round weight or round-weight 
equivalents of groundfish during a calendar month is required to have a 
NMFS-certified observer present at the facility each day it receives or 
processes groundfish during that month.
    (2) That processes 500 mt to 1,000 mt in round weight or round-
weight equivalents of groundfish is required to have a NMFS-certified 
observer present at the facility at least 30 percent of the days it 
receives or processes groundfish during that month.
    (3) That offloads pollock at more than one location on the same 
dock; has distinct and separate equipment at each location to process 
those pollock; and that receives pollock harvested by catcher vessels in 
the CVOA during the second pollock season that starts on August 15, 
under Sec. 679.23, is required to have a NMFS-certified observer, in 
addition to the observer required under paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of 
this section, at each location where pollock is offloaded, for each day 
of the second pollock season until the chum salmon savings area is 
closed under Sec. 679.21(e)(7)(vi), or October 15, 1996, whichever 
occurs first.
    (e) Coverage requirements for vessel operators of BSAI king and 
Tanner crab. An operator of a vessel that harvests or processes king or 
Tanner crab must have one or more State of Alaska-certified observers 
aboard the vessel whenever king or Tanner crab are received, processed,

Sec. 679.52  Observer coverage requirements for Research Plan fisheries (applicable after December 31, 1996).

    (a) BSAI and GOA groundfish and halibut from convention waters off 
Alaska--(1) Operators of vessels. An operator of a vessel that catches 
and retains groundfish or halibut, or a vessel that processes groundfish

<R05>
Sec. 679.53  Annual Research Plan specifications.

    (a) Proposed Research Plan specifications. Annually, after 
consultation with the Council, and, in the case of observer coverage 
levels in the crab fisheries, the State of Alaska, NMFS will publish for 
public comment in the Federal Register:
    (1) Standard exvessel prices. Standard exvessel prices will be used 
in determining the annual fee percentage for the calendar year and will 
be the basis for calculating fee assessments. Standard exvessel prices 
for species harvested in Research Plan fisheries for each calendar year 
will be based on:
    (i) Exvessel price information by applicable season, area, gear, and 
processing sector for the most recent 12-month period for which data are 
available.
    (ii) Factors that are expected to change exvessel prices in the 
calendar year.
    (iii) Any other relevant information that may affect expected 
exvessel prices during the calendar year.
    (2) Total exvessel value. The total exvessel value of Research Plan 
fisheries will be calculated as the sum of the product of the standard 
exvessel prices established under paragraph

[[Page 446]]

(a)(1) of this section and projected retained catches, by species. The 
value of whole fish processed into meal product will not be included in 
this calculation.
    (3) Research Plan fee percentage. The Research Plan fee percentage 
for a calendar year will equal the lesser of 2 percent of the exvessel 
value of retained catch in the Research Plan fisheries or the fee 
percentage calculated using the following equation:

Fee percentage=[100 x (RRPC-FB-OF)/V]/(1-NPR)

Where:
    (i) RRPC is the projection of recoverable Research Plan costs for 
the coming year.
    (ii) FB is the projected end of the year balance of funds collected 
under the Research Plan.
    (iii) OF is the projection of other funding for the coming year.
    (iv) V is the projected exvessel value of retained catch in the 
Research Plan fisheries for the coming year.
    (v) NPR is the percent (expressed as a decimal) of fee assessments 
that are expected to result in nonpayment.
    (4) Observer coverage. For the period January 1, 1996, through 
December 31, 1996, observer coverage levels in Research Plan fisheries 
will be as required by Sec. 679.51. After December 31, 1996, the level 
of observer coverage will be determined annually by NMFS, after 
consultation with the Council and the State of Alaska, and may vary by 
fishery and vessel or processor size, depending upon the objectives to 
be met for the groundfish, halibut, and king and Tanner crab fisheries. 
The Regional Director may change observer coverage inseason pursuant to 
Sec. 679.52(d).
    (5) Embarkment/disembarkment ports. Ports to be used to embark and 
disembark observers will be selected on the basis of convenience to the 
affected industry and on the availability of facilities, transportation, 
and accommodations deemed by the Regional Director to be necessary for 
the safe and reasonable deployment of observers.
    (b) Final Research Plan specifications. NMFS will consider comments 
received on the proposed specifications and, following consultation with 
the Council, and with the State of Alaska, in the case of observer 
coverage in the crab fisheries, will publish the final total exvessel 
value; standard exvessel prices; fee percentage; levels of observer 
coverage for Research Plan fisheries, including names of observer 
contractors and information for contacting them; and embarkment/
disembarkment ports in the Federal Register annually, prior to the 
beginning of the calendar year.

described under this section. The total annual TAC amount for scallops 
off Alaska will be established within the OY range of 0 to 1.8 million 
lb (0 to 815.5 mt) of shucked scallop meat.
    (2) TACs. (i) The annual TACs for scallops in each Registration Area 
or part thereof will be established as a weight in pounds of shucked 
scallop meat based on a review of the following:
    (A) Assessments of the biological condition of each scallop species. 
Assessments will include, where practicable, updated estimates of MSY; 
historical catch trends and current catch statistics, reviews of 
alternative harvesting strategies; and relevant information relating to 
changes in scallop markets.
    (B) Socioeconomic considerations that are consistent with the goals 
and objectives of the FMP.
    (ii) Annual scallop TACs will be specified for the 12-month time 
period extending from July 1 through June 30 of the following year. An 
annual TAC amount is available for harvest only for the registration 
area or district specified, only during the applicable season set out in 
Sec. 679.64, and only if no closure or other restriction or limitation 
is applicable.
    (3) CBLs. (i) CBLs may be specified for red king crab and Tanner 
crab species for any registration area or district.
    (ii) Except as provided under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, 
annual CBLs will be based on the biological

[[Page 449]]

condition of each crab species, historical bycatch rates in the scallop 
fishery, and other socioeconomic considerations that are consistent with 
the goals and objectives of the FMP.
    (iii) Annual CBLs in Registration Area Q will equal the following 
amounts:
    (A) The CBL for red king crab caught while conducting any fishery 
for scallops will be specified within the range of 500 to 3,000 crab 
based on the considerations listed in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section.
    (B) The CBL for Chionoecetes opilio Tanner crab caught while 
conducting any fishery for scallops is 0.003176 percent of the best 
available estimate of C. opilio abundance in Registration Area Q.
    (C) The CBL for C. bairdi Tanner crab caught while conducting any 
fishery for scallops is 0.13542 percent of the best available estimate 
of C. bairdi abundance in Registration Area Q.
    (iv) Annual CBLs will be specified for the 12-month time period from 
July 1 through June 30 of the following year. An annual CBL may be 
utilized only for the registration area or district specified, only if 
any applicable TAC amount is available for harvest, only during the 
applicable season set out in Sec. 679.64, and only if no closure or 
other limitation or restriction is applicable.
    (b) Specifications. The following procedure is established for 
specifying TAC amounts and CBLs:
    (1) On an annual basis, prior to the April Council meeting, the 
Council will distribute a summary of the State's most recent TAC and CBL 
recommendations and supporting documentation to the public through its 
mailing list, as well as provide copies of the recommendations, 
documentation, and the annual SAFE report to the public upon request. 
The Council will notify the public of its intent to develop final 
recommendations at the April Council meeting and solicit public comment 
both before and during the April Council meeting.
    (2) Following the April Council meeting, the Council will submit its 
TAC and CBL recommendations along with rationale and supporting 
information to NMFS for review and implementation.
    (3) As soon as practicable after receiving recommendations from the 
Council, NMFS will publish in the Federal Register annual specifications 
of TAC amounts and CBLs for the succeeding 12-month period extending 
from July 1 through June 30 of the following year.
    (c) Closures. (1) If the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, determines 
that a TAC or CBL specified under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
has been or will be reached, NMFS will publish notification in the 
Federal Register prohibiting the taking and retention of scallops in the 
Federal waters of the registration area or district where the 
notification is applicable.
    (2) It is unlawful for any person to conduct any fishing for 
scallops contrary to the notification of closure issued pursuant to this 
paragraph.
    (d) Closed areas. It is unlawful for any person to dredge for 
scallops in any Federal waters off Alaska that are closed to fishing 
with trawl gear or non pelagic trawl gear under Sec. 679.22(a)(1)(i), 
(a)(2)(i), (a)(4), (a)(6), (a)(7) and (b).
