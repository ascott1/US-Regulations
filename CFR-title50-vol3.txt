                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

biological and statistical information to determine the changes in the 
abundance of fishery stocks in response to fishing, and, to the extent 
possible, to predict future trends of stock abundance. Stock assessments 
are based on resource surveys; knowledge of the habitat requirements, 
life history, and behavior of the species; the use of environmental 
indices to determine impacts on stocks; and catch statistics. Stock 
assessments are used as a basis to ``assess and specify the present and 
probable future condition of a fishery'' (as is required by the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act), and are summarized in the Stock Assessment and 
Fishery Evaluation or similar document.
    Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) means a document or 
set of documents that provides Councils with a summary of the most 
recent biological condition of species in an FMU, and the social and 
economic condition of the recreational and commercial fishing industries

the best available scientific information concerning the past, present, 
and possible future condition of the stocks and fisheries being managed 
under Federal regulation.
    Substantially (affects) means, for the purpose of subpart G, with 
respect to whether a state's action or omission will substantially 
affect the carrying out of an FMP for a fishery, that those effects are 
important or material, or considerable in degree. The effects of a 
state's action or omission for purposes of this definition include 
effects upon:
    (1) The achievement of the FMP's goals or objectives for the 
fishery;
    (2) The achievement of OY from the fishery on a continuing basis;
    (3) The attainment of the national standards for fishery 
conservation and management (as set forth in section 301(a) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act) and compliance with other applicable law; or
    (4) The enforcement of regulations implementing the FMP.

    (a) Voting members (other than principal state officials, the 
Regional Administrators, or their designees) are appointed for a term of 
3 years and, except as discussed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, may be reappointed. A voting member's Council service of 18 
months or more during a term of office will be counted as service for 
the entire 3-year term.
    (b) The anniversary date for measuring terms of membership is August 
11. The Secretary may designate a term of appointment shorter than 3 
years, if necessary, to provide for balanced expiration of terms of 
office. Members may not serve more than three consecutive terms.
    (c) A member appointed after January 1, 1986, who has completed 
three consecutive terms will be eligible for appointment to another term 
one full year after completion of the third consecutive term.

<R05>
Sec. 600.215  Appointments.

    (a) Members appointed from Governors' lists. This paragraph applies 
to council members selected by the Secretary from lists submitted by 
Governors pursuant to section 302(b)(2)(C) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (1) Each year, terms of approximately one-third of the appointed 
members of each Council expire. New members will be appointed, or seated 
members will be reappointed to another term, by the Secretary to fill 
the seats being vacated. The Secretary will select the appointees from 
lists of nominees submitted by March 15 of each year by the Governors of 
the constituent states that are eligible to nominate candidates for that 
vacancy. When an appointed member vacates his/her seat prior to the 
expiration of his/her term, the Secretary will fill the vacancy for the 
remainder of the term by selecting from among the nominees submitted by 
the responsible Governor(s).
    (2) A Governor must submit the names of at least three qualified 
nominees for each applicable vacancy.
    (3) Governors are responsible for ensuring that persons nominated 
for appointment meet the qualification requirements of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act. A Governor must provide a statement explaining how each of 
his or her

[[Page 15]]

nominees meets the qualification requirements; and must provide 
appropriate documentation to the Secretary that each nomination was made 
in consultation with commercial and recreational fishing interests of 
that state, and that each nominee is knowledgeable and experienced, by 
reason of his or her occupational or other experience, scientific 
expertise, or training, in one or more of the following ways related to 
the fishery resources of the geographical area of concern to the 
Council:
    (i) Commercial fishing or the processing or marketing of fish, fish 
products, or fishing equipment;
    (ii) Fishing for pleasure, relaxation, or consumption, or experience 
in any business supporting fishing;
    (iii) Leadership in a state, regional, or national organization 
whose members participate in a fishery in the Council's area of 
authority;
    (iv) The management and conservation of natural resources, including 
related interactions with industry, government bodies, academic 
institutions, and public agencies. This includes experience serving as a 
member of a Council, AP, SSC, or FIAC;
    (v) Representing consumers of fish or fish products through 
participation in local, state, or national organizations, or performing 
other activities specifically related to the education or protection of 
consumers of marine resources; and
    (vi) Teaching, journalism, writing, consulting, legal practice, or 
researching matters related to fisheries, fishery management, and marine 
resource conservation.
    (4) To assist in identifying necessary qualifications, each nominee 
must furnish to the appropriate Governor's office a current resume, or 
equivalent, describing career history--with particular attention to 
experience related to the above criteria. Nominees may provide such 
information in any format they wish. Career and educational history 
information sent to the Governors should also be sent to the NMFS Office 
of Sustainable Fisheries.
    (5) The Secretary will review each list submitted by a Governor to 
ascertain if the individuals on the list are qualified for the vacancy 
on the basis of the criteria prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section. If the Secretary determines that any nominee is not qualified, 
the Secretary will notify the appropriate Governor of that 
determination. The Governor shall then submit a revised list or resubmit 
the original list with an additional explanation of the qualifications 
of the nominee in question. The Secretary reserves the right to 
determine whether nominees are qualified.
    (6) There are two categories of seats to which voting members are 
appointed: ``obligatory'' and ``at-large.''
    (i) Each constituent state is entitled to one seat on the Council on 
which it is a member, except that Alaska is entitled to five seats and 
Washington is entitled to two seats on the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council. When the term of a state's obligatory member is 
expiring, or that seat becomes vacant before the expiration of its term, 
the Governor of that state must submit the names of at least three 
qualified individuals to fill that seat. In order to fill a state's 
obligatory seat, the Secretary may select from any of the nominees for 
such obligatory seat and from the nominees for any at-large seat 
submitted by the Governor of that state. If a Governor fails to provide 
a list of at least three qualified nominees for a seat obligated to that 
Governor's state, then the state's obligatory seat will remain vacant 
until three qualified nominees are submitted by the Governor and acted 
upon by the Secretary.
    (ii) Prior to submitting nominees for appointment to a Council, a 
constituent state Governor must determine if each of his or her nominees 
is a resident of that constituent state. A State Governor may not 
nominate a non-resident of that state for appointment to a Council seat 
obligated to that state. If, at any time during a term, an appointee to 
an obligatory seat changes residency to another state that is not a 
constituent state of that Council, the member may no longer vote as a 
representative of that state and must resign from that obligated seat. 
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a state resident is an individual 
who maintains his/her principal residence within that constituent state 
and, if applicable,

[[Page 16]]

pays income taxes to that state and/or to another appropriate 
jurisdiction within that state.
    (7) When the term of an at-large member is expiring, or that seat 
becomes vacant before the expiration of a term, the Governors of all 
constituent states of that Council must each submit the names of at 
least three qualified individuals to fill that seat.
    (i) In order to fill an at-large seat, the Secretary may select a 
nominee for that seat submitted by any Governor of a constituent state. 
When the terms of both an obligatory member and an at-large member 
expire concurrently, the Governor of the state holding the expiring 
obligatory seat may indicate that the nominees who were not selected for 
appointment to the obligatory seat may be considered for appointment to 
an at-large seat, provided that the resulting total number of nominees 
submitted by that Governor for the expiring at-large seat is no fewer 
than three.
    (ii) If a Governor fails to submit a list of three qualified 
nominees for an available at-large seat within the time allotted, then a 
new at-large member will be appointed from lists of qualified nominees 
submitted by Governors of other constituent states.
    (iii) If a Governor chooses to submit nominations for one or more 
vacant at-large seats on a Council, he or she must submit lists that 
contain at least three different nominees for each vacant seat. In 
making selections to each of the available at-large seats, the Secretary 
will consider all names submitted by the constituent state governors.
    (iv) In filling expiring at-large seats, the Secretary will consider 
only complete slates of nominees submitted by the Governors of the 
Council's constituent states. If nominations are requested to fill more 
than one at-large seat and a Governor elects to nominate a total of four 
candidates, (i.e., a slate of three candidates for one seat and one for 
the other(s)), the set of three candidates will be considered only for 
the first seat, but the two candidates who were not selected will not be 
considered for the other(s). In this case, the only candidates 
considered for the other seat(s) would be derived from the slates 
offered by the Governors of the other states that included three 
different qualified candidates (i.e., candidates who were not considered 
for one of the other seats).
    (v) Governors may nominate residents of another constituent state of 
a Council for appointment to an at-large seat on that Council.
    (vi) The Secretary must, to the extent practicable, ensure a fair 
and balanced apportionment, on a rotating or other basis, of the active 
participants (or their representatives) in the commercial and 
recreational fisheries in the Council's area of authority. Further, the 
Secretary must take action to ensure, to the extent practicable, that 
those persons dependent for their livelihood upon the fisheries in the 
Council's area of authority are fairly represented as voting members.
    (b) Tribal Member. This paragraph applies to the selection of the 
Pacific Fishery Management Council's tribal member as required by 
section 302(b)(5) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (1) The Secretary shall appoint to the Pacific Fishery Management 
Council one representative of an Indian tribe with federally recognized 
fishing rights from California, Oregon, Washington, or Idaho from a list 
of not less than three individuals submitted by the tribal Governments.
    (2) The Secretary shall solicit nominations of individuals for the 
list referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section only from those 
Indian tribes with federally recognized fishing rights from California, 
Oregon, Washington, or Idaho. The Secretary will consult with the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, to determine which Indian 
tribes may submit nominations.
    (3) To assist in assessing the qualifications of each nominee, each 
tribal government must furnish to the NMFS Office of Sustainable 
Fisheries a current resume, or equivalent, describing the nominee's 
qualifications with emphasis on knowledge and experience related to the 
fishery resources affected by recommendations of the Pacific Council. 
Prior service on the Council in a different capacity will not disqualify 
nominees proposed by tribal governments.

[[Page 17]]

    (4) Nominations must be provided to NMFS by March 15 of the year in 
which the term of the current tribal member expires.
    (5) The Secretary shall rotate the appointment among the tribes 
taking into consideration:
    (i) The qualifications of the individuals on the list referred to in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (ii) The various rights of the Indian tribes involved and judicial 
cases that set out how those rights are to be exercised.
    (iii) The geographic area in which the tribe of the representative 
is located.
    (iv) No tribal representative shall serve more than three 
consecutive terms in the Indian tribal seat.
    (6) Any vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of any term shall 
be filled in the same manner as described above except that the 
Secretary may use the list referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section from which the vacating member was chosen.

<R05>
Sec. 600.220  Oath of office.

    Each member appointed to a Council must take an oath of office.


<R05>
Sec. 600.225  Rules of conduct.

    (a) Council members, as Federal office holders, and Council 
employees are subject to most Federal criminal statutes covering 
bribery, conflict-of-interest, disclosure of confidential information, 
and lobbying with appropriated funds.
    (b) The Councils are responsible for maintaining high standards of 
ethical conduct among themselves, their staffs, and their advisory 
groups. In addition to abiding by the applicable Federal conflict of 
interest statutes, both members and employees of the Councils must 
comply with the following standards of conduct:
    (1) No employee of a Council may use his or her official authority 
or influence derived from his or her position with the Council for the 
purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election to or 
a nomination for any national, state, county, or municipal elective 
office.
    (2) No employee of a Council may be deprived of employment, 
position, work, compensation, or benefit provided for or made possible 
by the Magnuson-Stevens Act on account of any political activity or lack 
of such activity in support of or in opposition to any candidate or any 
political party in any national, state, county, or municipal election, 
or on account of his or her political affiliation.
    (3) No Council member or employee may pay, offer, promise, solicit, 
or receive from any person, firm, or corporation a contribution of money 
or anything of value in consideration of either support or the use of 
influence or the promise of support or influence in obtaining for any 
person any appointive office, place, or employment under the Council.
    (4) No employee of a Council may have a direct or indirect financial 
interest that conflicts with the fair and impartial conduct of his or 
her Council duties. However, an Executive Director may retain a 
financial interest in harvesting, processing or marketing activities, 
and participate in matters of general public concern on the Council that 
might affect that interest, if that interest has been disclosed in a 
report filed under Sec. 600.235.
    (5) No Council member, employee of a Council, or member of a Council 
advisory group may use or allow the use, for other than official 
purposes, of information obtained through or in connection with his or 
her Council employment that has not been made available to the general 
public.
    (6) No Council member or employee of the Council may engage in 
criminal, infamous, dishonest, notoriously immoral, or disgraceful 
conduct.
    (7) No Council member or employee of the Council may use Council 
property on other than official business. Such property must be 
protected and preserved from improper or deleterious operation or use.
    (8) No Council member may participate--
    (i) Personally and substantially as a member through decision, 
approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, 
investigation, or otherwise in a particular matter primarily

[[Page 18]]

of individual concern, such as a contract, in which he or she has a 
financial interest; or
    (ii) In any matter of general public concern that is likely to have 
a direct and predictable effect on a member's financial interest, unless 
that interest is in harvesting, processing, or marketing activities and 
has been disclosed in a report filed under Sec. 600.235. For purposes of 
this section, the member's financial interest includes that of the 
member's spouse; minor child; partner; organization in which the member 
is serving as officer, director, trustee, partner or employee; or any 
person or organization with whom the member is negotiating or has any 
arrangement concerning prospective employment.

<R05>
Sec. 600.230  Removal.

    The Secretary may remove for cause any Secretarially appointed 
member of a Council in accordance with section 302(b)(6) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, wherein the Council concerned first recommends 
removal of that member by not less than two-thirds of the voting 
members. A recommendation of a Council to remove a member must be made 
in writing to the Secretary and accompanied by a statement of the 
reasons upon which the recommendation is based.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 7073, Feb. 12, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 600.235  Financial disclosure.

    (a) The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires the disclosure by each Council 
nominee, voting member appointed to the Council by the Secretary, and 
Executive Director, of any financial interest of the reporting 
individual in any harvesting, processing, or marketing activity that is 
being, or will be, undertaken within any fishery under the authority of 
the individual's Council, and of any such financial interest of the 
reporting individual's spouse, minor child, partner, or any organization 
(other than the Council) in which that individual is serving as an 
officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee. The information 
required to be reported must be disclosed on NOAA Form 88-195, 
``Statement of Financial Interests for Use by Voting Members, Nominees, 
and Executive Directors of Regional Fishery Management Councils'' 
(Financial Interest Form), or such other form as the Secretary may 
prescribe. The report must be filed by each nominee for Secretarial 
appointment with the Assistant Administrator by April 15 or, if 
nominated after March 15, 1 month after nomination by the Governor. A 
seated voting member appointed by the Secretary, or an Executive 
Director, must file a Financial Interest Form within 45 days of taking 
office; must update his or her statement within 30 days of acquiring any 
such financial interest, or of substantially changing a financial 
interest; and must update his/her statement annually and file that 
update by February 1 of each year with the Executive Director of the 
appropriate Council, and concurrently provide copies of such documents 
to the NMFS Regional Administrator for the geographic area concerned. 
The completed Financial Interest Forms will be kept on file, and made 
available for public inspection at reasonable hours at the Council 
offices. In addition, the statements will be made available at each 
public Council meeting or hearing.
    (b) The provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208 do not apply to an individual 
who has filed a financial report under this section regarding an 
interest that has been reported.
    (c) By February 1 of each year, Councils must forward copies of the 
completed disclosure from each current Council member and Executive 
Director to the Director, Office of Sustainable Fisheries, NMFS. 
Councils must also include any updates in disclosures, as well as 
revisions required for changes of interests.
    (d) Councils must retain the disclosure forms for each member for at 
least 5 years after the expiration of that member's last term.

<R05>
Sec. 600.240  Security assurances.

    (a) DOC/OS will issue security assurances to Council nominees and 
members following completion of background checks. Security assurances

[[Page 19]]

will be valid for 5 years from the date of issuance. A security 
assurance will not entitle the member to access classified data. In 
instances in which Council members may need to discuss, at closed 
meetings, materials classified for national security purposes, the 
agency or individual (e.g., DOS, USCG) providing such classified 
information will be responsible for ensuring that Council members and 
other attendees have the appropriate security clearances.
    (b) Each nominee to a Council is required to complete a 
Certification of Status form (``form''). All nominees must certify, 
pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, whether they 
serve as an agent of a foreign principal. Each nominee must certify, 
date, sign, and return the form with his or her completed nomination 
kit. Nominees will not be considered for appointment to a Council if 
they have not filed this form. Any nominee who currently is an agent of 
a foreign principal will not be eligible for appointment to a Council, 
and therefore should not be nominated by a Governor for appointment.


<R05>
Sec. 600.245  Council member compensation.

    (a) The obligatory and at-large voting members of each Council 
appointed under section 302(b)(1)(C) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act who are 
not employed by the Federal Government or any state or local government 
(i.e., any member who does not receive compensation from any such 
government for the period when performing duties as a Council member) 
shall receive compensation at 1.2 times the daily rate for a GS-15 (Step 
1) of the General Schedule (without locality pay) when engaged in actual 
performance of duties as assigned by the Chair of the Council. Actual 
performance of duties, for the purposes of compensation, may include 
travel time.
    (b) All voting Council members whose eligibility for compensation 
has been established in accordance with NOAA guidelines will be paid 
through the cooperative agreement as a direct line item on a contractual 
basis without deductions being made for Social Security or Federal and 
state income taxes. A report of compensation will be furnished each year 
by the member's Council to the proper Regional Program Officer, as 
required by the Internal Revenue Service. Such compensation may be paid 
on a full day's basis, whether in excess of 8 hours a day or less than 8 
hours a day. The time is compensable where the individual member is 
required to expend a significant private effort that substantially 
disrupts the daily routine to the extent that a work day is lost to the 
member. ``Homework'' time in preparation for formal Council meetings is 
not compensable.
    (c) Non-government Council members receive compensation for:
    (1) Days spent in actual attendance at a meeting of the Council or 
jointly with another Council.
    (2) Travel on the day preceding or following a scheduled meeting 
that precluded the member from conducting his normal business on the day 
in question.
    (3) Meetings of standing committees of the Council if approved in 
advance by the Chair.
    (4) Individual member meeting with scientific and technical 
advisors, when approved in advance by the Chair and a substantial 
portion of any day is spent at the meeting.
    (5) Conducting or attending hearings, when authorized in advance by 
the Chair.
    (6) Other meetings involving Council business when approved in 
advance by the Chair.
    (d) The Executive Director of each Council must submit to the 
appropriate Regional Office annually a report, approved by the Council 
Chair, of Council member compensation authorized. This report shall 
identify, for each member, amount paid, dates, and location and purpose 
of meetings attended.

<R04>
                      Subpart D--National Standards


<R05>
Sec. 600.305  General.

    (a) Purpose. (1) This subpart establishes guidelines, based on the 
national standards, to assist in the development and review of FMPs, 
amendments, and

[[Page 20]]

regulations prepared by the Councils and the Secretary.
    (2) In developing FMPs, the Councils have the initial authority to 
ascertain factual circumstances, to establish management objectives, and 
to propose management measures that will achieve the objectives. The 
Secretary will determine whether the proposed management objectives and 
measures are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary has an 
obligation under section 301(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act to inform 
the Councils of the Secretary's interpretation of the national standards 
so that they will have an understanding of the basis on which FMPs will 
be reviewed.
    (3) The national standards are statutory principles that must be 
followed in any FMP. The guidelines summarize Secretarial 
interpretations that have been, and will be, applied under these 
principles. The guidelines are intended as aids to decisionmaking; FMPs 
formulated according to the guidelines will have a better chance for 
expeditious Secretarial review, approval, and implementation. FMPs that 
are in substantial compliance with the guidelines, the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act, and other applicable law must be approved.
    (b) Fishery management objectives. (1) Each FMP, whether prepared by 
a Council or by the Secretary, should identify what the FMP is designed 
to accomplish (i.e., the management objectives to be attained in 
regulating the fishery under consideration). In establishing objectives, 
Councils balance biological constraints with human needs, reconcile 
present and future costs and benefits, and integrate the diversity of 
public and private interests. If objectives are in conflict, priorities 
should be established among them.
    (2) How objectives are defined is important to the management 
process. Objectives should address the problems of a particular fishery. 
The objectives should be clearly stated, practicably attainable, framed 
in terms of definable events and measurable benefits, and based upon a 
comprehensive rather than a fragmentary approach to the problems 
addressed. An FMP should make a clear distinction between objectives and 
the management measures chosen to achieve them. The objectives of each 
FMP provide the context within which the Secretary will judge the 
consistency of an FMP's conservation and management measures with the 
national standards.
    (c) Word usage. The word usage refers to all regulations in this 
subpart.
    (1) Must is used, instead of ``shall'', to denote an obligation to 
act; it is used primarily when referring to requirements of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, the logical extension thereof, or of other 
applicable law.
    (2) Shall is used only when quoting statutory language directly, to 
avoid confusion with the future tense.
    (3) Should is used to indicate that an action or consideration is 
strongly recommended to fulfill the Secretary's interpretation of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, and is a factor reviewers will look for in 
evaluating a SOPP or FMP.
    (4) May is used in a permissive sense.
    (5) May not is proscriptive; it has the same force as ``must not.''
    (6) Will is used descriptively, as distinguished from denoting an 
obligation to act or the future tense.
    (7) Could is used when giving examples, in a hypothetical, 
permissive sense.
    (8) Can is used to mean ``is able to,'' as distinguished from 
``may.''
    (9) Examples are given by way of illustration and further 
explanation. They are not inclusive lists; they do not limit options.
    (10) Analysis, as a paragraph heading, signals more detailed 
guidance as to the type of discussion and examination an FMP should 
contain to demonstrate compliance with the standard in question.
    (11) Council includes the Secretary, as applicable, when preparing 
FMPs or amendments under section 304(c) and (g) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act.
    (12) Stock or stock complex is used as a synonym for ``fishery'' in 
the sense of the Magnuson-Stevens Act's first definition of the term; 
that is, as ``one or more stocks of fish that can be treated as a unit 
for purposes of conservation

[[Page 21]]

and management and that are identified on the basis of geographic, 
scientific, technical, recreational, or economic characteristics,'' as 
distinguished from the Magnuson-Stevens Act's second definition of 
fishery as ``any fishing for such stocks.''

<R05>
Sec. 600.310  National Standard 1--Optimum Yield.

    (a) Standard 1. Conservation and management measures shall prevent 
overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the OY from each 
fishery for the U.S. fishing industry.
    (b) General. The determination of OY is a decisional mechanism for 
resolving the Magnuson-Stevens Act's multiple purposes and policies, 
implementing an FMP's objectives, and balancing the various interests 
that comprise the national welfare. OY is based on MSY, or on MSY as it 
may be reduced under paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The most 
important limitation on the specification of OY is that the choice of OY 
and the conservation and management measures proposed to achieve it must 
prevent overfishing.
    (c) MSY. Each FMP should include an estimate of MSY as explained in 
this section.
    (1) Definitions. (i) ``MSY'' is the largest long-term average catch 
or yield that can be taken from a stock or stock complex under 
prevailing ecological and environmental conditions.
    (ii) ``MSY control rule'' means a harvest strategy which, if 
implemented, would be expected to result in a long-term average catch 
approximating MSY.
    (iii) ``MSY stock size'' means the long-term average size of the 
stock or stock complex, measured in terms of spawning biomass or other 
appropriate units, that would be achieved under an MSY control rule in 
which the fishing mortality rate is constant.
    (2) Options in specifying MSY. (i) Because MSY is a theoretical 
concept, its estimation in practice is conditional on the choice of an 
MSY control rule. In choosing an MSY control rule, Councils should be 
guided by the characteristics of the fishery, the FMP's objectives, and 
the best scientific information available. The simplest MSY control rule 
is to remove a constant catch in each year that the estimated stock size 
exceeds an appropriate lower bound, where this catch is chosen so as to 
maximize the resulting long-term average yield. Other examples include 
the following: Remove a constant fraction of the biomass in each year, 
where this fraction is chosen so as to maximize the resulting long-term 
average yield; allow a constant level of escapement in each year, where 
this level is chosen so as to maximize the resulting long-term average 
yield; vary the fishing mortality rate as a continuous function of stock 
size, where the parameters of this function are constant and chosen so 
as to maximize the resulting long-term average yield. In any MSY control 
rule, a given stock size is associated with a given level of fishing 
mortality and a given level of potential harvest, where the long-term 
average of these potential harvests provides an estimate of MSY.
    (ii) Any MSY values used in determining OY will necessarily be 
estimates, and these will typically be associated with some level of 
uncertainty. Such estimates must be based on the best scientific 
information available (see Sec. 600.315) and must incorporate 
appropriate consideration of risk (see Sec. 600.335). Beyond these 
requirements, however, Councils have a reasonable degree of latitude in 
determining which estimates to use and how these estimates are to be 
expressed. For example, a point estimate of MSY may be expressed by 
itself or together with a confidence interval around that estimate.
    (iii) In the case of a mixed-stock fishery, MSY should be specified 
on a stock-by-stock basis. However, where MSY cannot be specified for 
each stock, then MSY may be specified on the basis of one or more 
species as an indicator for the mixed stock as a whole or for the 
fishery as a whole.
    (iv) Because MSY is a long-term average, it need not be estimated 
annually, but it must be based on the best scientific information 
available, and should be re-estimated as required by changes in 
environmental or ecological

[[Page 22]]

conditions or new scientific information.
    (3) Alternatives to specifying MSY. When data are insufficient to 
estimate MSY directly, Councils should adopt other measures of 
productive capacity that can serve as reasonable proxies for MSY, to the 
extent possible. Examples include various reference points defined in 
terms of relative spawning per recruit. For instance, the fishing 
mortality rate that reduces the long-term average level of spawning per 
recruit to 30-40 percent of the long-term average that would be expected 
in the absence of fishing may be a reasonable proxy for the MSY fishing 
mortality rate. The long-term average stock size obtained by fishing 
year after year at this rate under average recruitment may be a 
reasonable proxy for the MSY stock size, and the long-term average catch 
so obtained may be a reasonable proxy for MSY. The natural mortality 
rate may also be a reasonable proxy for the MSY fishing mortality rate. 
If a reliable estimate of pristine stock size (i.e., the long-term 
average stock size that would be expected in the absence of fishing) is 
available, a stock size approximately 40 percent of this value may be a 
reasonable proxy for the MSY stock size, and the product of this stock 
size and the natural mortality rate may be a reasonable proxy for MSY.
    (d) Overfishing--(1) Definitions. (i) ``To overfish'' means to fish 
at a rate or level that jeopardizes the capacity of a stock or stock 
complex to produce MSY on a continuing basis.
    (ii) ``Overfishing'' occurs whenever a stock or stock complex is 
subjected to a rate or level of fishing mortality that jeopardizes the 
capacity of a stock or stock complex to produce MSY on a continuing 
basis.
    (iii) In the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the term ``overfished'' is used 
in two senses: First, to describe any stock or stock complex that is 
subjected to a rate or level of fishing mortality meeting the criterion 
in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, and second, to describe any 
stock or stock complex whose size is sufficiently small that a change in 
management practices is required in order to achieve an appropriate 
level and rate of rebuilding. To avoid confusion, this section uses 
``overfished'' in the second sense only.
    (2) Specification of status determination criteria. Each FMP must 
specify, to the extent possible, objective and measurable status 
determination criteria for each stock or stock complex covered by that 
FMP and provide an analysis of how the status determination criteria 
were chosen and how they relate to reproductive potential. Status 
determination criteria must be expressed in a way that enables the 
Council and the Secretary to monitor the stock or stock complex and 
determine annually whether overfishing is occurring and whether the 
stock or stock complex is overfished. In all cases, status determination 
criteria must specify both of the following:
    (i) A maximum fishing mortality threshold or reasonable proxy 
thereof. The fishing mortality threshold may be expressed either as a 
single number or as a function of spawning biomass or other measure of 
productive capacity. The fishing mortality threshold must not exceed the 
fishing mortality rate or level associated with the relevant MSY control 
rule. Exceeding the fishing mortality threshold for a period of 1 year 
or more constitutes overfishing.
    (ii) A minimum stock size threshold or reasonable proxy thereof. The 
stock size threshold should be expressed in terms of spawning biomass or 
other measure of productive capacity. To the extent possible, the stock 
size threshold should equal whichever of the following is greater: One-
half the MSY stock size, or the minimum stock size at which rebuilding 
to the MSY level would be expected to occur within 10 years if the stock 
or stock complex were exploited at the maximum fishing mortality 
threshold specified under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Should 
the actual size of the stock or stock complex in a given year fall below 
this threshold, the stock or stock complex is considered overfished.
    (3) Relationship of status determination criteria to other national 
standards--(i) National standard 2. Status determination criteria must 
be based on the best scientific information available (see 
Sec. 600.315). When data are insufficient to estimate MSY, Councils 
should base

[[Page 23]]

status determination criteria on reasonable proxies thereof to the 
extent possible (also see paragraph (c)(3) of this section). In cases 
where scientific data are severely limited, effort should also be 
directed to identifying and gathering the needed data.
    (ii) National standard 3. The requirement to manage interrelated 
stocks of fish as a unit or in close coordination notwithstanding (see 
Sec. 600.320), status determination criteria should generally be 
specified in terms of the level of stock aggregation for which the best 
scientific information is available (also see paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of 
this section).
    (iii) National standard 6. Councils must build into the status 
determination criteria appropriate consideration of risk, taking into 
account uncertainties in estimating harvest, stock conditions, life 
history parameters, or the effects of environmental factors (see 
Sec. 600.335).
    (4) Relationship of status determination criteria to environmental 
change. Some short-term environmental changes can alter the current size 
of a stock or stock complex without affecting the long-term productive 
capacity of the stock or stock complex. Other environmental changes 
affect both the current size of the stock or stock complex and the long-
term productive capacity of the stock or stock complex.
    (i) If environmental changes cause a stock or stock complex to fall 
below the minimum stock size threshold without affecting the long-term 
productive capacity of the stock or stock complex, fishing mortality 
must be constrained sufficiently to allow rebuilding within an 
acceptable time frame (also see paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section). 
Status determination criteria need not be respecified.
    (ii) If environmental changes affect the long-term productive 
capacity of the stock or stock complex, one or more components of the 
status determination criteria must be respecified. Once status 
determination criteria have been respecified, fishing mortality may or 
may not have to be reduced, depending on the status of the stock or 
stock complex with respect to the new criteria.
    (iii) If manmade environmental changes are partially responsible for 
a stock or stock complex being in an overfished condition, in addition 
to controlling effort, Councils should recommend restoration of habitat 
and other ameliorative programs, to the extent possible (see also the 
guidelines issued pursuant to section 305(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act 
for Council actions concerning essential fish habitat).
    (5) Secretarial approval of status determination criteria. 
Secretarial approval or disapproval of proposed status determination 
criteria will be based on consideration of whether the proposal:
    (i) Has sufficient scientific merit.
    (ii) Contains the elements described in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (iii) Provides a basis for objective measurement of the status of 
the stock or stock complex against the criteria.
    (iv) Is operationally feasible.
    (6) Exceptions. There are certain limited exceptions to the 
requirement to prevent overfishing. Harvesting one species of a mixed-
stock complex at its optimum level may result in the overfishing of 
another stock component in the complex. A Council may decide to permit 
this type of overfishing only if all of the following conditions are 
satisfied:
    (i) It is demonstrated by analysis (paragraph (f)(6) of this 
section) that such action will result in long-term net benefits to the 
Nation.
    (ii) It is demonstrated by analysis that mitigating measures have 
been considered and that a similar level of long-term net benefits 
cannot be achieved by modifying fleet behavior, gear selection/
configuration, or other technical characteristic in a manner such that 
no overfishing would occur.
    (iii) The resulting rate or level of fishing mortality will not 
cause any species or evolutionarily significant unit thereof to require 
protection under the ESA.
    (e) Ending overfishing and rebuilding overfished stocks-- (1) 
Definition. A threshold, either maximum fishing mortality or minimum 
stock size, is being ``approached'' whenever it is projected that the 
threshold will be breached within 2 years, based on trends in fishing 
effort, fishery resource size, and other appropriate factors.

[[Page 24]]

    (2) Notification. The Secretary will immediately notify a Council 
and request that remedial action be taken whenever the Secretary 
determines that:
    (i) Overfishing is occurring;
    (ii) A stock or stock complex is overfished;
    (iii) The rate or level of fishing mortality for a stock or stock 
complex is approaching the maximum fishing mortality threshold;
    (iv) A stock or stock complex is approaching its minimum stock size 
threshold; or
    (v) Existing remedial action taken for the purpose of ending 
previously identified overfishing or rebuilding a previously identified 
overfished stock or stock complex has not resulted in adequate progress.
    (3) Council action. Within 1 year of such time as the Secretary may 
identify that overfishing is occurring, that a stock or stock complex is 
overfished, or that a threshold is being approached, or such time as a 
Council may be notified of the same under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, the Council must take remedial action by preparing an FMP, FMP 
amendment, or proposed regulations. This remedial action must be 
designed to accomplish all of the following purposes that apply:
    (i) If overfishing is occurring, the purpose of the action is to end 
overfishing.
    (ii) If the stock or stock complex is overfished, the purpose of the 
action is to rebuild the stock or stock complex to the MSY level within 
an appropriate time frame.
    (iii) If the rate or level of fishing mortality is approaching the 
maximum fishing mortality threshold (from below), the purpose of the 
action is to prevent this threshold from being reached.
    (iv) If the stock or stock complex is approaching the minimum stock 
size threshold (from above), the purpose of the action is to prevent 
this threshold from being reached.
    (4) Constraints on Council action. (i) In cases where overfishing is 
occurring, Council action must be sufficient to end overfishing.
    (ii) In cases where a stock or stock complex is overfished, Council 
action must specify a time period for rebuilding the stock or stock 
complex that satisfies the requirements of section 304(e)(4)(A) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (A) A number of factors enter into the specification of the time 
period for rebuilding:
    (1) The status and biology of the stock or stock complex;
    (2) Interactions between the stock or stock complex and other 
components of the marine ecosystem (also referred to as ``other 
environmental conditions'');
    (3) The needs of fishing communities;
    (4) Recommendations by international organizations in which the 
United States participates; and
    (5) Management measures under an international agreement in which 
the United States participates.
    (B) These factors enter into the specification of the time period 
for rebuilding as follows:
    (1) The lower limit of the specified time period for rebuilding is 
determined by the status and biology of the stock or stock complex and 
its interactions with other components of the marine ecosystem, and is 
defined as the amount of time that would be required for rebuilding if 
fishing mortality were eliminated entirely.
    (2) If the lower limit is less than 10 years, then the specified 
time period for rebuilding may be adjusted upward to the extent 
warranted by the needs of fishing communities and recommendations by 
international organizations in which the United States participates, 
except that no such upward adjustment can result in the specified time 
period exceeding 10 years, unless management measures under an 
international agreement in which the United States participates dictate 
otherwise.
    (3) If the lower limit is 10 years or greater, then the specified 
time period for rebuilding may be adjusted upward to the extent 
warranted by the needs of fishing communities and recommendations by 
international organizations in which the United States participates, 
except that no such upward adjustment can exceed the rebuilding period 
calculated in the absence of fishing mortality, plus one mean generation 
time

[[Page 25]]

or equivalent period based on the species' life-history characteristics. 
For example, suppose a stock could be rebuilt within 12 years in the 
absence of any fishing mortality, and has a mean generation time of 8 
years. The rebuilding period, in this case, could be as long as 20 
years.
    (C) A rebuilding program undertaken after May 1, 1998 commences as 
soon as the first measures to rebuild the stock or stock complex are 
implemented.
    (D) In the case of rebuilding plans that were already in place as of 
May 1, 1998, such rebuilding plans must be reviewed to determine whether 
they are in compliance with all requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act.
    (iii) For fisheries managed under an international agreement, 
Council action must reflect traditional participation in the fishery, 
relative to other nations, by fishermen of the United States.
    (5) Interim measures. The Secretary, on his/her own initiative or in 
response to a Council request, may implement interim measures to reduce 
overfishing under section 305(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, until such 
measures can be replaced by an FMP, FMP amendment, or regulations taking 
remedial action.
    (i) These measures may remain in effect for no more than 180 days, 
but may be extended for an additional 180 days if the public has had an 
opportunity to comment on the measures and, in the case of Council-
recommended measures, the Council is actively preparing an FMP, FMP 
amendment, or proposed regulations to address overfishing on a permanent 
basis. Such measures, if otherwise in compliance with the provisions of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act, may be implemented even though they are not 
sufficient by themselves to stop overfishing of a fishery.
    (ii) If interim measures are made effective without prior notice and 
opportunity for comment, they should be reserved for exceptional 
situations, because they affect fishermen without providing the usual 
procedural safeguards. A Council recommendation for interim measures 
without notice-and-comment rulemaking will be considered favorably if 
the short-term benefits of the measures in reducing overfishing outweigh 
the value of advance notice, public comment, and deliberative 
consideration of the impacts on participants in the fishery.
    (f) OY--(1) Definitions. (i) The term ``optimum,'' with respect to 
the yield from a fishery, means the amount of fish that will provide the 
greatest overall benefit to the Nation, particularly with respect to 
food production and recreational opportunities and taking into account 
the protection of marine ecosystems; that is prescribed on the basis of 
the MSY from the fishery, as reduced by any relevant economic, social, 
or ecological factor; and, in the case of an overfished fishery, that 
provides for rebuilding to a level consistent with producing the MSY in 
such fishery.
    (ii) In national standard 1, use of the phrase ``achieving, on a 
continuing basis, the OY from each fishery'' means producing, from each 
fishery, a long-term series of catches such that the average catch is 
equal to the average OY and such that status determination criteria are 
met.
    (2) Values in determination. In determining the greatest benefit to 
the Nation, these values that should be weighed are food production, 
recreational opportunities, and protection afforded to marine 
ecosystems. They should receive serious attention when considering the 
economic, social, or ecological factors used in reducing MSY to obtain 
OY.
    (i) The benefits of food production are derived from providing 
seafood to consumers, maintaining an economically viable fishery 
together with its attendant contributions to the national, regional, and 
local economies, and utilizing the capacity of the Nation's fishery 
resources to meet nutritional needs.
    (ii) The benefits of recreational opportunities reflect the quality 
of both the recreational fishing experience and non-consumptive fishery 
uses such as ecotourism, fish watching, and recreational diving, and the 
contribution of recreational fishing to the national, regional, and 
local economies and food supplies.
    (iii) The benefits of protection afforded to marine ecosystems are 
those

[[Page 26]]

resulting from maintaining viable populations (including those of 
unexploited species), maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes 
(e.g., disturbance regimes, hydrological processes, nutrient cycles), 
maintaining the evolutionary potential of species and ecosystems, and 
accommodating human use.
    (3) Factors relevant to OY. Because fisheries have finite 
capacities, any attempt to maximize the measures of benefit described in 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section will inevitably encounter practical 
constraints. One of these is MSY. Moreover, various factors can 
constrain the optimum level of catch to a value less than MSY. The 
Magnuson-Stevens Act's definition of OY identifies three categories of 
such factors: Social, economic, and ecological. Not every factor will be 
relevant in every fishery. For some fisheries, insufficient information 
may be available with respect to some factors to provide a basis for 
corresponding reductions in MSY.
    (i) Social factors. Examples are enjoyment gained from recreational 
fishing, avoidance of gear conflicts and resulting disputes, 
preservation of a way of life for fishermen and their families, and 
dependence of local communities on a fishery. Other factors that may be 
considered include the cultural place of subsistence fishing, 
obligations under Indian treaties, and worldwide nutritional needs.
    (ii) Economic factors. Examples are prudent consideration of the 
risk of overharvesting when a stock's size or productive capacity is 
uncertain, satisfaction of consumer and recreational needs, and 
encouragement of domestic and export markets for U.S.-harvested fish. 
Other factors that may be considered include the value of fisheries, the 
level of capitalization, the decrease in cost per unit of catch afforded 
by an increase in stock size, and the attendant increase in catch per 
unit of effort, alternate employment opportunities, and economies of 
coastal areas.
    (iii) Ecological factors. Examples are stock size and age 
composition, the vulnerability of incidental or unregulated stocks in a 
mixed-stock fishery, predator-prey or competitive interactions, and 
dependence of marine mammals and birds or endangered species on a stock 
of fish. Also important are ecological or environmental conditions that 
stress marine organisms, such as natural and manmade changes in wetlands 
or nursery grounds, and effects of pollutants on habitat and stocks.
    (4) Specification. (i) The amount of fish that constitutes the OY 
should be expressed in terms of numbers or weight of fish. However, OY 
may be expressed as a formula that converts periodic stock assessments 
into target harvest levels; in terms of an annual harvest of fish or 
shellfish having a minimum weight, length, or other measurement; or as 
an amount of fish taken only in certain areas, in certain seasons, with 
particular gear, or by a specified amount of fishing effort.
    (ii) Either a range or a single value may be specified for OY. 
Specification of a numerical, fixed-value OY does not preclude use of 
annual target harvest levels that vary with stock size. Such target 
harvest levels may be prescribed on the basis of an OY control rule 
similar to the MSY control rule described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section, but designed to achieve OY on average, rather than MSY. 
The annual harvest level obtained under an OY control rule must always 
be less than or equal to the harvest level that would be obtained under 
the MSY control rule.
    (iii) All fishing mortality must be counted against OY, including 
that resulting from bycatch, scientific research, and any other fishing 
activities.
    (iv) The OY specification should be translatable into an annual 
numerical estimate for the purposes of establishing any TALFF and 
analyzing impacts of the management regime. There should be a mechanism 
in the FMP for periodic reassessment of the OY specification, so that it 
is responsive to changing circumstances in the fishery.
    (v) The determination of OY requires a specification of MSY, which 
may not always be possible or meaningful. However, even where sufficient 
scientific data as to the biological characteristics of the stock do not 
exist, or where

[[Page 27]]

the period of exploitation or investigation has not been long enough for 
adequate understanding of stock dynamics, or where frequent large-scale 
fluctuations in stock size diminish the meaningfulness of the MSY 
concept, the OY must still be based on the best scientific information 
available. When data are insufficient to estimate MSY directly, Councils 
should adopt other measures of productive capacity that can serve as 
reasonable proxies for MSY to the extent possible (also see paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section).
    (vi) In a mixed-stock fishery, specification of a fishery-wide OY 
may be accompanied by management measures establishing separate annual 
target harvest levels for the individual stocks. In such cases, the sum 
of the individual target levels should not exceed OY.
    (5) OY and the precautionary approach. In general, Councils should 
adopt a precautionary approach to specification of OY. A precautionary 
approach is characterized by three features:
    (i) Target reference points, such as OY, should be set safely below 
limit reference points, such as the catch level associated with the 
fishing mortality rate or level defined by the status determination 
criteria. Because it is a target reference point, OY does not constitute 
an absolute ceiling, but rather a desired result. An FMP must contain 
conservation and management measures to achieve OY, and provisions for 
information collection that are designed to determine the degree to 
which OY is achieved on a continuing basis--that is, to result in a 
long-term average catch equal to the long-term average OY, while meeting 
the status determination criteria. These measures should allow for 
practical and effective implementation and enforcement of the management 
regime, so that the harvest is allowed to reach OY, but not to exceed OY 
by a substantial amount. The Secretary has an obligation to implement 
and enforce the FMP so that OY is achieved. If management measures prove 
unenforceable--or too restrictive, or not rigorous enough to realize 
OY--they should be modified; an alternative is to reexamine the adequacy 
of the OY specification. Exceeding OY does not necessarily constitute 
overfishing. However, even if no overfishing resulted from exceeding OY, 
continual harvest at a level above OY would violate national standard 1, 
because OY was not achieved on a continuing basis.
    (ii) A stock or stock complex that is below the size that would 
produce MSY should be harvested at a lower rate or level of fishing 
mortality than if the stock or stock complex were above the size that 
would produce MSY.
    (iii) Criteria used to set target catch levels should be explicitly 
risk averse, so that greater uncertainty regarding the status or 
productive capacity of a stock or stock complex corresponds to greater 
caution in setting target catch levels. Part of the OY may be held as a 
reserve to allow for factors such as uncertainties in estimates of stock 
size and DAH. If an OY reserve is established, an adequate mechanism 
should be included in the FMP to permit timely release of the reserve to 
domestic or foreign fishermen, if necessary.
    (6) Analysis. An FMP must contain an assessment of how its OY 
specification was determined (section 303(a)(3) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act). It should relate the explanation of overfishing in paragraph (d) 
of this section to conditions in the particular fishery and explain how 
its choice of OY and conservation and management measures will prevent 
overfishing in that fishery. A Council must identify those economic, 
social, and ecological factors relevant to management of a particular 
fishery, then evaluate them to determine the amount, if any, by which 
MSY exceeds OY. The choice of a particular OY must be carefully defined 
and documented to show that the OY selected will produce the greatest 
benefit to the Nation. If overfishing is permitted under paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section, the assessment must contain a justification in 
terms of overall benefits, including a comparison of benefits under 
alternative management measures, and an analysis of the risk of any 
species or ecologically significant unit thereof reaching a threatened 
or endangered status, as well as the risk of any stock or stock complex 
falling below its minimum stock size threshold.
    (7) OY and foreign fishing. Section 201(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act

[[Page 28]]

provides that fishing by foreign nations is limited to that portion of 
the OY that will not be harvested by vessels of the United States.
    (i) DAH. Councils must consider the capacity of, and the extent to 
which, U.S. vessels will harvest the OY on an annual basis. Estimating 
the amount that U.S. fishing vessels will actually harvest is required 
to determine the surplus.
    (ii) DAP. Each FMP must assess the capacity of U.S. processors. It 
must also assess the amount of DAP, which is the sum of two estimates: 
The estimated amount of U.S. harvest that domestic processors will 
process, which may be based on historical performance or on surveys of 
the expressed intention of manufacturers to process, supported by 
evidence of contracts, plant expansion, or other relevant information; 
and the estimated amount of fish that will be harvested by domestic 
vessels, but not processed (e.g., marketed as fresh whole fish, used for 
private consumption, or used for bait).
    (iii) JVP. When DAH exceeds DAP, the surplus is available for JVP. 
JVP is derived from DAH.

Sec. 600.315  National Standard 2--Scientific Information.

    (a) Standard 2. Conservation and management measures shall be based 
upon the best scientific information available.
    (b) FMP development. The fact that scientific information concerning 
a fishery is incomplete does not prevent the preparation and 
implementation of an FMP (see related Secs. 600.320(d)(2) and 
600.340(b).
    (1) Scientific information includes, but is not limited to, 
information of a biological, ecological, economic, or social nature. 
Successful fishery management depends, in part, on the timely 
availability, quality, and quantity of scientific information, as well 
as on the thorough analysis of this information, and the extent to which 
the information is applied. If there are conflicting facts or opinions 
relevant to a particular point, a Council may choose among them, but 
should justify the choice.
    (2) FMPs must take into account the best scientific information 
available at the time of preparation. Between the initial drafting of an 
FMP and its submission for final review, new information often becomes 
available. This new information should be incorporated into the final 
FMP where practicable; but it is unnecessary to start the FMP process 
over again, unless the information indicates that drastic changes have 
occurred in the fishery that might require revision of the management 
objectives or measures.
    (c) FMP implementation. (1) An FMP must specify whatever information 
fishermen and processors will be required or requested to submit to the 
Secretary. Information about harvest within state boundaries, as well as 
in the EEZ, may be collected if it is needed for proper implementation 
of the FMP and cannot be obtained otherwise. The FMP should explain the 
practical utility of the information specified in monitoring the 
fishery, in facilitating inseason management decisions, and in judging 
the performance of the management regime; it should also consider the 
effort, cost, or social impact of obtaining it.
    (2) An FMP should identify scientific information needed from other 
sources to improve understanding and management of the resource, marine 
ecosystem, and the fishery (including fishing communities).
    (3) The information submitted by various data suppliers should be 
comparable and compatible, to the maximum extent possible.
    (d) FMP amendment. FMPs should be amended on a timely basis, as new 
information indicates the necessity for change in objectives or 
management measures.
    (e) SAFE Report. (1) The SAFE report is a document or set of 
documents that provides Councils with a summary of information 
concerning the most recent biological condition of stocks and the marine 
ecosystems in the FMU and the social and economic condition of the 
recreational and commercial fishing interests, fishing communities, and 
the fish processing industries. It summarizes, on a periodic basis, the 
best available scientific information concerning the past, present, and 
possible

[[Page 29]]

future condition of the stocks, marine ecosystems, and fisheries being 
managed under Federal regulation.
    (i) The Secretary has the responsibility to assure that a SAFE 
report or similar document is prepared, reviewed annually, and changed 
as necessary for each FMP. The Secretary or Councils may utilize any 
combination of talent from Council, state, Federal, university, or other 
sources to acquire and analyze data and produce the SAFE report.
    (ii) The SAFE report provides information to the Councils for 
determining annual harvest levels from each stock, documenting 
significant trends or changes in the resource, marine ecosystems, and 
fishery over time, and assessing the relative success of existing state 
and Federal fishery management programs. Information on bycatch and 
safety for each fishery should also be summarized. In addition, the SAFE 
report may be used to update or expand previous environmental and 
regulatory impact documents, and ecosystem and habitat descriptions.
    (iii) Each SAFE report must be scientifically based, and cite data 
sources and interpretations.
    (2) Each SAFE report should contain information on which to base 
harvest specifications.
    (3) Each SAFE report should contain a description of the maximum 
fishing mortality threshold and the minimum stock size threshold for 
each stock or stock complex, along with information by which the Council 
may determine:
    (i) Whether overfishing is occurring with respect to any stock or 
stock complex, whether any stock or stock complex is overfished, whether 
the rate or level of fishing mortality applied to any stock or stock 
complex is approaching the maximum fishing mortality threshold, and 
whether the size of any stock or stock complex is approaching the 
minimum stock size threshold.
    (ii) Any management measures necessary to provide for rebuilding an 
overfished stock or stock complex (if any) to a level consistent with 
producing the MSY in such fishery.
    (4) Each SAFE report may contain additional economic, social, 
community, essential fish habitat, and ecological information pertinent 
to the success of management or the achievement of objectives of each 
FMP.
    (5) Each SAFE report may contain additional economic, social, and 
ecological information pertinent to the success of management or the 
achievement of objectives of each FMP.

Sec. 600.320  National Standard 3--Management Units.

    (a) Standard 3. To the extent practicable, an individual stock of 
fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range, and interrelated 
stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.
    (b) General. The purpose of this standard is to induce a 
comprehensive approach to fishery management. The geographic scope of 
the fishery, for planning purposes, should cover the entire range of the 
stocks(s) of fish, and not be overly constrained by political 
boundaries. Wherever practicable, an FMP should seek to manage 
interrelated stocks of fish.
    (c) Unity of management. Cooperation and understanding among 
entities concerned with the fishery (e.g., Councils, states, Federal 
Government, international commissions, foreign nations) are vital to 
effective management. Where management of a fishery involves multiple 
jurisdictions, coordination among the several entities should be sought 
in the development of an FMP. Where a range overlaps Council areas, one 
FMP to cover the entire range is preferred. The Secretary designates 
which Council(s) will prepare the FMP, under section 304(f) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (d) Management unit. The term ``management unit'' means a fishery or 
that portion of a fishery identified in an FMP as relevant to the FMP's 
management objectives.
    (1) Basis. The choice of a management unit depends on the focus of 
the FMP's objectives, and may be organized around biological, 
geographic, economic, technical, social, or ecological perspectives. For 
example:
    (i) Biological--could be based on a stock(s) throughout its range.
    (ii) Geographic--could be an area.

[[Page 30]]

    (iii) Economic--could be based on a fishery supplying specific 
product forms.
    (iv) Technical--could be based on a fishery utilizing a specific 
gear type or similar fishing practices.
    (v) Social--could be based on fishermen as the unifying element, 
such as when the fishermen pursue different species in a regular pattern 
throughout the year.
    (vi) Ecological--could be based on species that are associated in 
the ecosystem or are dependent on a particular habitat.
    (2) Conservation and management measures. FMPs should include 
conservation and management measures for that part of the management 
unit within U.S. waters, although the Secretary can ordinarily implement 
them only within the EEZ. The measures need not be identical for each 
geographic area within the management unit, if the FMP justifies the 
differences. A management unit may contain, in addition to regulated 
species, stocks of fish for which there is not enough information 
available to specify MSY and OY or to establish management measures, so 
that data on these species may be collected under the FMP.
    (e) Analysis. To document that an FMP is as comprehensive as 
practicable, it should include discussions of the following:
    (1) The range and distribution of the stocks, as well as the 
patterns of fishing effort and harvest.
    (2) Alternative management units and reasons for selecting a 
particular one. A less-than-comprehensive management unit may be 
justified if, for example, complementary management exits or is planned 
for a separate geographic area or for a distinct use of the stocks, or 
if the unmanaged portion of the resource is immaterial to proper 
management.
    (3) Management activities and habitat programs of adjacent states 
and their effects on the FMP's objectives and management measures. Where 
state action is necessary to implement measures within state waters to 
achieve FMP objectives, the FMP should identify what state action is 
necessary, discuss the consequences of state inaction or contrary 
action, and make appropriate recommendations. The FMP should also 
discuss the impact that Federal regulations will have on state 
management activities.
    (4) Management activities of other countries having an impact on the 
fishery, and how the FMP's management measures are designed to take into 
account these impacts. International boundaries may be dealt with in 
several ways. For example:
    (i) By limiting the management unit's scope to that portion of the 
stock found in U.S. waters;
    (ii) By estimating MSY for the entire stock and then basing the 
determination of OY for the U.S. fishery on the portion of the stock 
within U.S. waters; or
    (iii) By referring to treaties or cooperative agreements.

Sec. 600.325  National Standard 4--Allocations.

    (a) Standard 4. Conservation and management measures shall not 
discriminate between residents of different states. If it becomes 
necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various U.S. 
fishermen, such allocation shall be:
    (1) Fair and equitable to all such fishermen.
    (2) Reasonably calculated to promote conservation.
    (3) Carried out in such manner that no particular individual, 
corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such 
privileges.
    (b) Discrimination among residents of different states. An FMP may 
not differentiate among U.S. citizens, nationals, resident aliens, or 
corporations on the basis of their state of residence. An FMP may not 
incorporate or rely on a state statute or regulation that discriminates 
against residents of another state. Conservation and management measures 
that have different effects on persons in various geographic locations 
are permissible if they satisfy the other guidelines under Standard 4. 
Examples of these precepts are:
    (1) An FMP that restricted fishing in the EEZ to those holding a 
permit from state X would violate Standard 4 if

[[Page 31]]

state X issued permits only to its own citizens.
    (2) An FMP that closed a spawning ground might disadvantage 
fishermen living in the state closest to it, because they would have to 
travel farther to an open area, but the closure could be justified under 
Standard 4 as a conservation measure with no discriminatory intent.
    (c) Allocation of fishing privileges. An FMP may contain management 
measures that allocate fishing privileges if such measures are necessary 
or helpful in furthering legitimate objectives or in achieving the OY, 
and if the measures conform with paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through 
(c)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (1) Definition. An ``allocation'' or ``assignment'' of fishing 
privileges is a direct and deliberate distribution of the opportunity to 
participate in a fishery among identifiable, discrete user groups or 
individuals. Any management measure (or lack of management) has 
incidental allocative effects, but only those measures that result in 
direct distributions of fishing privileges will be judged against the 
allocation requirements of Standard 4. Adoption of an FMP that merely 
perpetuates existing fishing practices may result in an allocation, if 
those practices directly distribute the opportunity to participate in 
the fishery. Allocations of fishing privileges include, for example, 
per-vessel catch limits, quotas by vessel class and gear type, different 
quotas or fishing seasons for recreational and commercial fishermen, 
assignment of ocean areas to different gear users, and limitation of 
permits to a certain number of vessels or fishermen.
    (2) Analysis of allocations. Each FMP should contain a description 
and analysis of the allocations existing in the fishery and of those 
made in the FMP. The effects of eliminating an existing allocation 
system should be examined. Allocation schemes considered, but rejected 
by the Council, should be included in the discussion. The analysis 
should relate the recommended allocations to the FMP's objectives and OY 
specification, and discuss the factors listed in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section.
    (3) Factors in making allocations. An allocation of fishing 
privileges must be fair and equitable, must be reasonably calculated to 
promote conservation, and must avoid excessive shares. These tests are 
explained in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section:
    (i) Fairness and equity. (A) An allocation of fishing privileges 
should be rationally connected to the achievement of OY or with the 
furtherance of a legitimate FMP objective. Inherent in an allocation is 
the advantaging of one group to the detriment of another. The motive for 
making a particular allocation should be justified in terms of the 
objectives of the FMP; otherwise, the disadvantaged user groups or 
individuals would suffer without cause. For instance, an FMP objective 
to preserve the economic status quo cannot be achieved by excluding a 
group of long-time participants in the fishery. On the other hand, there 
is a rational connection between an objective of harvesting shrimp at 
their maximum size and closing a nursery area to trawling.
    (B) An allocation of fishing privileges may impose a hardship on one 
group if it is outweighed by the total benefits received by another 
group or groups. An allocation need not preserve the status quo in the 
fishery to qualify as ``fair and equitable,'' if a restructuring of 
fishing privileges would maximize overall benefits. The Council should 
make an initial estimate of the relative benefits and hardships imposed 
by the allocation, and compare its consequences with those of 
alternative allocation schemes, including the status quo. Where 
relevant, judicial guidance and government policy concerning the rights 
of treaty Indians and aboriginal Americans must be considered in 
determining whether an allocation is fair and equitable.
    (ii) Promotion of conservation. Numerous methods of allocating 
fishing privileges are considered ``conservation and management'' 
measures under section 303 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. An allocation 
scheme may promote conservation by encouraging a rational, more easily 
managed use of the resource. Or, it may promote conservation (in the 
sense of wise use) by optimizing the yield in terms of size, value,

[[Page 32]]

market mix, price, or economic or social benefit of the product. To the 
extent that rebuilding plans or other conservation and management 
measures that reduce the overall harvest in a fishery are necessary, any 
harvest restrictions or recovery benefits must be allocated fairly and 
equitably among the commercial, recreational, and charter fishing 
sectors of the fishery.
    (iii) Avoidance of excessive shares. An allocation scheme must be 
designed to deter any person or other entity from acquiring an excessive 
share of fishing privileges, and to avoid creating conditions fostering 
inordinate control, by buyers or sellers, that would not otherwise 
exist.
    (iv) Other factors. In designing an allocation scheme, a Council 
should consider other factors relevant to the FMP's objectives. Examples 
are economic and social consequences of the scheme, food production, 
consumer interest, dependence on the fishery by present participants and 
coastal communities, efficiency of various types of gear used in the 
fishery, transferability of effort to and impact on other fisheries, 
opportunity for new participants to enter the fishery, and enhancement 
of opportunities for recreational fishing.

<R05>
Sec. 600.330  National Standard 5--Efficiency.

    (a) Standard 5. Conservation and management measures shall, where 
practicable, consider efficiency in the utilization of fishery 
resources; except that no such measure shall have economic allocation as 
its sole purpose.
    (b) Efficiency in the utilization of resources--(1) General. The 
term ``utilization'' encompasses harvesting, processing, marketing, and 
non-consumptive uses of the resource, since management decisions affect 
all sectors of the industry. In considering efficient utilization of 
fishery resources, this standard highlights one way that a fishery can 
contribute to the Nation's benefit with the least cost to society: Given 
a set of objectives for the fishery, an FMP should contain management 
measures that result in as efficient a fishery as is practicable or 
desirable.
    (2) Efficiency. In theory, an efficient fishery would harvest the OY 
with the minimum use of economic inputs such as labor, capital, 
interest, and fuel. Efficiency in terms of aggregate costs then becomes 
a conservation objective, where ``conservation'' constitutes wise use of 
all resources involved in the fishery, not just fish stocks.
    (i) In an FMP, management measures may be proposed that allocate 
fish among different groups of individuals or establish a system of 
property rights. Alternative measures examined in searching for an 
efficient outcome will result in different distributions of gains and 
burdens among identifiable user groups. An FMP should demonstrate that 
management measures aimed at efficiency do not simply redistribute gains 
and burdens without an increase in efficiency.
    (ii) Management regimes that allow a fishery to operate at the 
lowest possible cost (e.g., fishing effort, administration, and 
enforcement) for a particular level of catch and initial stock size are 
considered efficient. Restrictive measures that unnecessarily raise any 
of those costs move the regime toward inefficiency. Unless the use of 
inefficient techniques or the creation of redundant fishing capacity 
contributes to the attainment of other social or biological objectives, 
an FMP may not contain management measures that impede the use of cost-
effective techniques of harvesting, processing, or marketing, and should 
avoid creating strong incentives for excessive investment in private 
sector fishing capital and labor.
    (c) Limited access. A ``system for limiting access,'' which is an 
optional measure under section 303(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, is a 
type of allocation of fishing privileges that may be considered to 
contribute to economic efficiency or conservation. For example, limited 
access may be used to combat overfishing, overcrowding, or 
overcapitalization in a fishery to achieve OY. In an unutilized or 
underutilized fishery, it may be used to reduce the chance that these 
conditions will adversely affect the fishery in the future, or to 
provide adequate economic return to pioneers in a new fishery. In some 
cases, limited entry is a

[[Page 33]]

useful ingredient of a conservation scheme, because it facilitates 
application and enforcement of other management measures.
    (1) Definition. Limited access (or limited entry) is a management 
technique that attempts to limit units of effort in a fishery, usually 
for the purpose of reducing economic waste, improving net economic 
return to the fishermen, or capturing economic rent for the benefit of 
the taxpayer or the consumer. Common forms of limited access are 
licensing of vessels, gear, or fishermen to reduce the number of units 
of effort, and dividing the total allowable catch into fishermen's 
quotas (a stock-certificate system). Two forms (i.e., Federal fees for 
licenses or permits in excess of administrative costs, and taxation) are 
not permitted under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, except for fees allowed 
under section 304(d)(2).
    (2) Factors to consider. The Magnuson-Stevens Act ties the use of 
limited access to the achievement of OY. An FMP that proposes a limited 
access system must consider the factors listed in section 303(b)(6) of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act and in Sec. 600.325(c)(3). In addition, it 
should consider the criteria for qualifying for a permit, the nature of 
the interest created, whether to make the permit transferable, and the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act's limitations on returning economic rent to the 
public under section 304(d). The FMP should also discuss the costs of 
achieving an appropriate distribution of fishing privileges.
    (d) Analysis. An FMP should discuss the extent to which 
overcapitalization, congestion, economic waste, and inefficient 
techniques in the fishery reduce the net benefits derived from the 
management unit and prevent the attainment and appropriate allocation of 
OY. It should also explain, in terms of the FMP's objectives, any 
restriction placed on the use of efficient techniques of harvesting, 
processing, or marketing. If, during FMP development, the Council 
considered imposing a limited-entry system, the FMP should analyze the 
Council's decision to recommend or reject limited access as a technique 
to achieve efficient utilization of the resources of the fishing 
industry.
    (e) Economic allocation. This standard prohibits only those measures 
that distribute fishery resources among fishermen on the basis of 
economic factors alone, and that have economic allocation as their only 
purpose. Where conservation and management measures are recommended that 
would change the economic structure of the industry or the economic 
conditions under which the industry operates, the need for such measures 
must be justified in light of the biological, ecological, and social 
objectives of the FMP, as well as the economic objectives.

<R05>
Sec. 600.335  National Standard 6--Variations and Contingencies.

    (a) Standard 6. Conservation and management measures shall take into 
account and allow for variations among, and contingencies in, fisheries, 
fishery resources, and catches.
    (b) Conservation and management. Each fishery exhibits unique 
uncertainties. The phrase ``conservation and management'' implies the 
wise use of fishery resources through a management regime that includes 
some protection against these uncertainties. The particular regime 
chosen must be flexible enough to allow timely response to resource, 
industry, and other national and regional needs. Continual data 
acquisition and analysis will help the development of management 
measures to compensate for variations and to reduce the need for 
substantial buffers. Flexibility in the management regime and the 
regulatory process will aid in responding to contingencies.
    (c) Variations. (1) In fishery management terms, variations arise 
from biological, social, and economic occurrences, as well as from 
fishing practices. Biological uncertainties and lack of knowledge can 
hamper attempts to estimate stock size and strength, stock location in 
time and space, environmental/habitat changes, and ecological 
interactions. Economic uncertainty may involve changes in foreign or 
domestic market conditions, changes in operating costs, drifts toward 
overcapitalization, and economic perturbations caused by changed fishing 
patterns.

[[Page 34]]

Changes in fishing practices, such as the introduction of new gear, 
rapid increases or decreases in harvest effort, new fishing strategies, 
and the effects of new management techniques, may also create 
uncertainties. Social changes could involve increases or decreases in 
recreational fishing, or the movement of people into or out of fishing 
activities due to such factors as age or educational opportunities.
    (2) Every effort should be made to develop FMPs that discuss and 
take into account these vicissitudes. To the extent practicable, FMPs 
should provide a suitable buffer in favor of conservation. Allowances 
for uncertainties should be factored into the various elements of an 
FMP. Examples are:
    (i) Reduce OY. Lack of scientific knowledge about the condition of a 
stock(s) could be reason to reduce OY.
    (ii) Establish a reserve. Creation of a reserve may compensate for 
uncertainties in estimating domestic harvest, stock conditions, or 
environmental factors.
    (iii) Adjust management techniques. In the absence of adequate data 
to predict the effect of a new regime, and to avoid creating unwanted 
variations, a Council could guard against producing drastic changes in 
fishing patterns, allocations, or practices.
    (iv) Highlight habitat conditions. FMPs may address the impact of 
pollution and the effects of wetland and estuarine degradation on the 
stocks of fish; identify causes of pollution and habitat degradation and 
the authorities having jurisdiction to regulate or influence such 
activities; propose recommendations that the Secretary will convey to 
those authorities to alleviate such problems; and state the views of the 
Council on unresolved or anticipated issues.
    (d) Contingencies. Unpredictable events--such as unexpected resource 
surges or failures, fishing effort greater than anticipated, disruptive 
gear conflicts, climatic conditions, or environmental catastrophes--are 
best handled by establishing a flexible management regime that contains 
a range of management options through which it is possible to act 
quickly without amending the FMP or even its regulations.
    (1) The FMP should describe the management options and their 
consequences in the necessary detail to guide the Secretary in 
responding to changed circumstances, so that the Council preserves its 
role as policy-setter for the fishery. The description should enable the 
public to understand what may happen under the flexible regime, and to 
comment on the options.
    (2) FMPs should include criteria for the selection of management 
measures, directions for their application, and mechanisms for timely 
adjustment of management measures comprising the regime. For example, an 
FMP could include criteria that allow the Secretary to open and close 
seasons, close fishing grounds, or make other adjustments in management 
measures.
    (3) Amendment of a flexible FMP would be necessary when 
circumstances in the fishery change substantially, or when a Council 
adopts a different management philosophy and objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 600.340  National Standard 7--Costs and Benefits.

    (a) Standard 7. Conservation and management measures shall, where 
practicable, minimize costs and avoid unnecessary duplication.
    (b) Necessity of Federal management--(1) General. The principle that 
not every fishery needs regulation is implicit in this standard. The 
Magnuson-Stevens Act requires Councils to prepare FMPs only for 
overfished fisheries and for other fisheries where regulation would 
serve some useful purpose and where the present or future benefits of 
regulation would justify the costs. For example, the need to collect 
data about a fishery is not, by itself, adequate justification for 
preparation of an FMP, since there are less costly ways to gather the 
data (see Sec. 600.320(d)(2). In some cases, the FMP preparation process 
itself, even if it does not culminate in a document approved by the 
Secretary, can be useful in supplying a basis for management by one or 
more coastal states.
    (2) Criteria. In deciding whether a fishery needs management through 
regulations implementing an FMP, the following general factors should be 
considered, among others:

[[Page 35]]

    (i) The importance of the fishery to the Nation and to the regional 
economy.
    (ii) The condition of the stock or stocks of fish and whether an FMP 
can improve or maintain that condition.
    (iii) The extent to which the fishery could be or is already 
adequately managed by states, by state/Federal programs, by Federal 
regulations pursuant to FMPs or international commissions, or by 
industry self-regulation, consistent with the policies and standards of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (iv) The need to resolve competing interests and conflicts among 
user groups and whether an FMP can further that resolution.
    (v) The economic condition of a fishery and whether an FMP can 
produce more efficient utilization.
    (vi) The needs of a developing fishery, and whether an FMP can 
foster orderly growth.
    (vii) The costs associated with an FMP, balanced against the 
benefits (see paragraph (d) of this section as a guide).
    (c) Alternative management measures. Management measures should not 
impose unnecessary burdens on the economy, on individuals, on private or 
public organizations, or on Federal, state, or local governments. 
Factors such as fuel costs, enforcement costs, or the burdens of 
collecting data may well suggest a preferred alternative.
    (d) Analysis. The supporting analyses for FMPs should demonstrate 
that the benefits of fishery regulation are real and substantial 
relative to the added research, administrative, and enforcement costs, 
as well as costs to the industry of compliance. In determining the 
benefits and costs of management measures, each management strategy 
considered and its impacts on different user groups in the fishery 
should be evaluated. This requirement need not produce an elaborate, 
formalistic cost/benefit analysis. Rather, an evaluation of effects and 
costs, especially of differences among workable alternatives, including 
the status quo, is adequate. If quantitative estimates are not possible, 
qualitative estimates will suffice.
    (1) Burdens. Management measures should be designed to give 
fishermen the greatest possible freedom of action in conducting business 
and pursuing recreational opportunities that are consistent with 
ensuring wise use of the resources and reducing conflict in the fishery. 
The type and level of burden placed on user groups by the regulations 
need to be identified. Such an examination should include, for example: 
Capital outlays; operating and maintenance costs; reporting costs; 
administrative, enforcement, and information costs; and prices to 
consumers. Management measures may shift costs from one level of 
government to another, from one part of the private sector to another, 
or from the government to the private sector. Redistribution of costs 
through regulations is likely to generate controversy. A discussion of 
these and any other burdens placed on the public through FMP regulations 
should be a part of the FMP's supporting analyses.
    (2) Gains. The relative distribution of gains may change as a result 
of instituting different sets of alternatives, as may the specific type 
of gain. The analysis of benefits should focus on the specific gains 
produced by each alternative set of management measures, including the 
status quo. The benefits to society that result from the alternative 
management measures should be identified, and the level of gain 
assessed.

<R05>
Sec. 600.345  National Standard 8--Communities.

    (a) Standard 8. Conservation and management measures shall, 
consistent with the conservation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of 
overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery 
resources to fishing communities in order to:
    (1) Provide for the sustained participation of such communities; and
    (2) To the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on 
such communities.
    (b) General. (1) This standard requires that an FMP take into 
account the importance of fishery resources to fishing

[[Page 36]]

communities. This consideration, however, is within the context of the 
conservation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Deliberations 
regarding the importance of fishery resources to affected fishing 
communities, therefore, must not compromise the achievement of 
conservation requirements and goals of the FMP. Where the preferred 
alternative negatively affects the sustained participation of fishing 
communities, the FMP should discuss the rationale for selecting this 
alternative over another with a lesser impact on fishing communities. 
All other things being equal, where two alternatives achieve similar 
conservation goals, the alternative that provides the greater potential 
for sustained participation of such communities and minimizes the 
adverse economic impacts on such communities would be the preferred 
alternative.
    (2) This standard does not constitute a basis for allocating 
resources to a specific fishing community nor for providing preferential 
treatment based on residence in a fishing community.
    (3) The term ``fishing community'' means a community that is 
substantially dependent on or substantially engaged in the harvest or 
processing of fishery resources to meet social and economic needs, and 
includes fishing vessel owners, operators, and crew, and fish processors 
that are based in such communities. A fishing community is a social or 
economic group whose members reside in a specific location and share a 
common dependency on commercial, recreational, or subsistence fishing or 
on directly related fisheries-dependent services and industries (for 
example, boatyards, ice suppliers, tackle shops).
    (4) The term ``sustained participation'' means continued access to 
the fishery within the constraints of the condition of the resource.
    (c) Analysis. (1) FMPs must examine the social and economic 
importance of fisheries to communities potentially affected by 
management measures. For example, severe reductions of harvests for 
conservation purposes may decrease employment opportunities for 
fishermen and processing plant workers, thereby adversely affecting 
their families and communities. Similarly, a management measure that 
results in the allocation of fishery resources among competing sectors 
of a fishery may benefit some communities at the expense of others.
    (2) An appropriate vehicle for the analyses under this standard is 
the fishery impact statement required by section 303(a)(9) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act. Qualitative and quantitative data may be used, 
including information provided by fishermen, dealers, processors, and 
fisheries organizations and associations. In cases where data are 
severely limited, effort should be directed to identifying and gathering 
needed data.
    (3) To address the sustained participation of fishing communities 
that will be affected by management measures, the analysis should first 
identify affected fishing communities and then assess their differing 
levels of dependence on and engagement in the fishery being regulated. 
The analysis should also specify how that assessment was made. The best 
available data on the history, extent, and type of participation of 
these fishing communities in the fishery should be incorporated into the 
social and economic information presented in the FMP. The analysis does 
not have to contain an exhaustive listing of all communities that might 
fit the definition; a judgment can be made as to which are primarily 
affected. The analysis should discuss each alternative's likely effect 
on the sustained participation of these fishing communities in the 
fishery.
    (4) The analysis should assess the likely positive and negative 
social and economic impacts of the alternative management measures, over 
both the short and the long term, on fishing communities. Any particular 
management measure may economically benefit some communities while 
adversely affecting others. Economic impacts should be considered both 
for individual communities and for the group of all affected communities 
identified in the FMP. Impacts of both consumptive and non-consumptive 
uses of fishery resources should be considered.
    (5) A discussion of social and economic impacts should identify 
those

[[Page 37]]

alternatives that would minimize adverse impacts on these fishing 
communities within the constraints of conservation and management goals 
of the FMP, other national standards, and other applicable law.

<R05>
Sec. 600.350  National Standard 9--Bycatch.

    (a) Standard 9. Conservation and management measures shall, to the 
extent practicable:
    (1) Minimize bycatch; and
    (2) To the extent bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize the mortality 
of such bycatch.
    (b) General. This national standard requires Councils to consider 
the bycatch effects of existing and planned conservation and management 
measures. Bycatch can, in two ways, impede efforts to protect marine 
ecosystems and achieve sustainable fisheries and the full benefits they 
can provide to the Nation. First, bycatch can increase substantially the 
uncertainty concerning total fishing-related mortality, which makes it 
more difficult to assess the status of stocks, to set the appropriate OY 
and define overfishing levels, and to ensure that OYs are attained and 
overfishing levels are not exceeded. Second, bycatch may also preclude 
other more productive uses of fishery resources.
    (c) Definition--Bycatch. The term ``bycatch'' means fish that are 
harvested in a fishery, but that are not sold or kept for personal use. 
Bycatch includes the discard of whole fish at sea or elsewhere, 
including economic discards and regulatory discards, and fishing 
mortality due to an encounter with fishing gear that does not result in 
capture of fish (i.e., unobserved fishing mortality). Bycatch does not 
include any fish that legally are retained in a fishery and kept for 
personal, tribal, or cultural use, or that enter commerce through sale, 
barter, or trade. Bycatch does not include fish released alive under a 
recreational catch-and-release fishery management program. A catch-and-
release fishery management program is one in which the retention of a 
particular species is prohibited. In such a program, those fish released 
alive would not be considered bycatch. Bycatch also does not include 
Atlantic highly migratory species harvested in a commercial fishery that 
are not regulatory discards and that are tagged and released alive under 
a scientific tag-and-release program established by the Secretary.
    (d) Minimizing bycatch and bycatch mortality. The priority under 
this standard is first to avoid catching bycatch species where 
practicable. Fish that are bycatch and cannot be avoided must, to the 
extent practicable, be returned to the sea alive. Any proposed 
conservation and management measure that does not give priority to 
avoiding the capture of bycatch species must be supported by appropriate 
analyses. In their evaluation, the Councils must consider the net 
benefits to the Nation, which include, but are not limited to: Negative 
impacts on affected stocks; incomes accruing to participants in directed 
fisheries in both the short and long term; incomes accruing to 
participants in fisheries that target the bycatch species; environmental 
consequences; non-market values of bycatch species, which include non-
consumptive uses of bycatch species and existence values, as well as 
recreational values; and impacts on other marine organisms. To evaluate 
conservation and management measures relative to this and other national 
standards, as well as to evaluate total fishing mortality, Councils 
must--
    (1) Promote development of a database on bycatch and bycatch 
mortality in the fishery to the extent practicable. A review and, where 
necessary, improvement of data collection methods, data sources, and 
applications of data must be initiated for each fishery to determine the 
amount, type, disposition, and other characteristics of bycatch and 
bycatch mortality in each fishery for purposes of this standard and of 
section 303(a)(11) and (12) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Bycatch should 
be categorized to focus on management responses necessary to minimize 
bycatch and bycatch mortality to the extent practicable. When 
appropriate, management measures, such as at-sea monitoring programs, 
should be developed to meet these information needs.
    (2) For each management measure, assess the effects on the amount 
and type of

[[Page 38]]

bycatch and bycatch mortality in the fishery. Most conservation and 
management measures can affect the amounts of bycatch or bycatch 
mortality in a fishery, as well as the extent to which further 
reductions in bycatch are practicable. In analyzing measures, including 
the status quo, Councils should assess the impacts of minimizing bycatch 
and bycatch mortality, as well as consistency of the selected measure 
with other national standards and applicable laws. The benefits of 
minimizing bycatch to the extent practicable should be identified and an 
assessment of the impact of the selected measure on bycatch and bycatch 
mortality provided. Due to limitations on the information available, 
fishery managers may not be able to generate precise estimates of 
bycatch and bycatch mortality or other effects for each alternative. In 
the absence of quantitative estimates of the impacts of each 
alternative, Councils may use qualitative measures. Information on the 
amount and type of bycatch should be summarized in the SAFE reports.
    (3) Select measures that, to the extent practicable, will minimize 
bycatch and bycatch mortality. (i) A determination of whether a 
conservation and management measure minimizes bycatch or bycatch 
mortality to the extent practicable, consistent with other national 
standards and maximization of net benefits to the Nation, should 
consider the following factors:
    (A) Population effects for the bycatch species.
    (B) Ecological effects due to changes in the bycatch of that species 
(effects on other species in the ecosystem).
    (C) Changes in the bycatch of other species of fish and the 
resulting population and ecosystem effects.
    (D) Effects on marine mammals and birds.
    (E) Changes in fishing, processing, disposal, and marketing costs.
    (F) Changes in fishing practices and behavior of fishermen.
    (G) Changes in research, administration, and enforcement costs and 
management effectiveness.
    (H) Changes in the economic, social, or cultural value of fishing 
activities and nonconsumptive uses of fishery resources.
    (I) Changes in the distribution of benefits and costs.
    (J) Social effects.
    (ii) The Councils should adhere to the precautionary approach found 
in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Article 6.5), which is 
available from the Director, Publications Division, FAO, Viale delle 
Terme di Caracalla, 00100 Rome, Italy, when faced with uncertainty 
concerning any of the factors listed in this paragraph (d)(3).
    (4) Monitor selected management measures. Effects of implemented 
measures should be evaluated routinely. Monitoring systems should be 
established prior to fishing under the selected management measures. 
Where applicable, plans should be developed and coordinated with 
industry and other concerned organizations to identify opportunities for 
cooperative data collection, coordination of data management for cost 
efficiency, and avoidance of duplicative effort.
    (e) Other considerations. Other applicable laws, such as the MMPA, 
the ESA, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, require that Councils 
consider the impact of conservation and management measures on living 
marine resources other than fish; i.e., marine mammals and birds.

<R05>
Sec. 600.355  National Standard 10--Safety of Life at Sea.

    (a) Standard 10. Conservation and management measures shall, to the 
extent practicable, promote the safety of human life at sea.
    (b) General. (1) Fishing is an inherently dangerous occupation where 
not all hazardous situations can be foreseen or avoided. The standard 
directs Councils to reduce that risk in crafting their management 
measures, so long as they can meet the other national standards and the 
legal and practical requirements of conservation and management. This 
standard is not meant to give preference to one method of managing a 
fishery over another.
    (2) The qualifying phrase ``to the extent practicable'' recognizes 
that regulation necessarily puts constraints on fishing that would not 
otherwise exist.

[[Page 39]]

These constraints may create pressures on fishermen to fish under 
conditions that they would otherwise avoid. This standard instructs the 
Councils to identify and avoid those situations, if they can do so 
consistent with the legal and practical requirements of conservation and 
management of the resource.
    (3) For the purposes of this national standard, the safety of the 
fishing vessel and the protection from injury of persons aboard the 
vessel are considered the same as ``safety of human life at sea. The 
safety of a vessel and the people aboard is ultimately the 
responsibility of the master of that vessel. Each master makes many 
decisions about vessel maintenance and loading and about the 
capabilities of the vessel and crew to operate safely in a variety of 
weather and sea conditions. This national standard does not replace the 
judgment or relieve the responsibility of the vessel master related to 
vessel safety. The Councils, the USCG, and NMFS, through the 
consultation process of paragraph (d) of this section, will review all 
FMPs, amendments, and regulations during their development to ensure 
they recognize any impact on the safety of human life at sea and 
minimize or mitigate that impact where practicable.
    (c) Safety considerations. The following is a non-inclusive list of 
safety considerations that should be considered in evaluating management 
measures under national standard 10.
    (1) Operating environment. Where and when a fishing vessel operates 
is partly a function of the general climate and weather patterns of an 
area. Typically, larger vessels can fish farther offshore and in more 
adverse weather conditions than smaller vessels. An FMP should try to 
avoid creating situations that result in vessels going out farther, 
fishing longer, or fishing in weather worse than they generally would 
have in the absence of management measures. Where these conditions are 
unavoidable, management measures should mitigate these effects, 
consistent with the overall management goals of the fishery.
    (2) Gear and vessel loading requirements. A fishing vessel operates 
in a very dynamic environment that can be an extremely dangerous place 
to work. Moving heavy gear in a seaway creates a dangerous situation on 
a vessel. Carrying extra gear can also significantly reduce the 
stability of a fishing vessel, making it prone to capsizing. An FMP 
should consider the safety and stability of fishing vessels when 
requiring specific gear or requiring the removal of gear from the water. 
Management measures should reflect a sensitivity to these issues and 
provide methods of mitigation of these situations wherever possible.
    (3) Limited season and area fisheries. Fisheries where time 
constraints for harvesting are a significant factor and with no 
flexibility for weather, often called ``derby'' fisheries, can create 
serious safety problems. To participate fully in such a fishery, 
fishermen may fish in bad weather and overload their vessel with catch 
and/or gear. Where these conditions exist, FMPs should attempt to 
mitigate these effects and avoid them in new management regimes, as 
discussed in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Consultation. During preparation of any FMP, FMP amendment, or 
regulation that might affect safety of human life at sea, the Council 
should consult with the USCG and the fishing industry as to the nature 
and extent of any adverse impacts. This consultation may be done through 
a Council advisory panel, committee, or other review of the FMP, FMP 
amendment, or regulations. Mitigation, to the extent practicable, and 
other safety considerations identified in paragraph (c) of this section 
should be included in the FMP.
    (e) Mitigation measures. There are many ways in which an FMP may 
avoid or provide alternative measures to reduce potential impacts on 
safety of human life at sea. The following is a list of some factors 
that could be considered when management measures are developed:
    (1) Setting seasons to avoid hazardous weather.
    (2) Providing for seasonal or trip flexibility to account for bad 
weather (weather days).
    (3) Allowing for pre- and post-season ``soak time'' to deploy and 
pick up fixed gear, so as to avoid overloading vessels with fixed gear.

[[Page 40]]

    (4) Tailoring gear requirements to provide for smaller or lighter 
gear for smaller vessels.
    (5) Avoiding management measures that require hazardous at-sea 
inspections or enforcement if other comparable enforcement could be 
accomplished as effectively.
    (6) Limiting the number of participants in the fishery.
    (7) Spreading effort over time and area to avoid potential gear and/
or vessel conflicts.
    (8) Implementing management measures that reduce the race for fish 
and the resulting incentives for fishermen to take additional risks with 
respect to vessel safety.

[[Page 41]]

in fishery conservation and management.
    (2) The state has entered into a written agreement between the 
Assistant Administrator and the head of the state's agency that manages 
marine and/or anadromous fisheries. The agreement shall contain a 
finding by the Assistant Administrator that the state has 
confidentiality protection authority comparable to the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act and that the state will exercise this authority to limit subsequent 
access and use of the data to fishery management and monitoring 
purposes.
    (d) Councils. Upon written request by the Council Executive 
Director, access to confidential data will be granted to:
    (1) Council employees who are responsible for FMP development and 
monitoring.
    (2) A Council for use by the Council for conservation and management 
purposes, with the approval of the Assistant Administrator. In addition 
to the information described in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Assistant Administrator will consider the following in deciding whether 
to grant access:
    (i) The possibility that Council members might gain personal or 
competitive advantage from access to the data.
    (ii) The possibility that the suppliers of the data would be placed 
at a competitive disadvantage by public disclosure of the data at 
Council meetings or hearings.
    (3) A contractor of the Council for use in such analysis or studies 
necessary for conservation and management purposes, with approval of the 
Assistant Administrator and execution of an agreement with NMFS as 
described by NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 216-100.
    (e) Prohibitions. Persons having access to these data are prohibited 
from unauthorized use or disclosure and are subject to the provisions of

<R05>
Sec. 600.420  Control system.

    (a) The Assistant Administrator maintains a control system to 
protect the identity of submitters of statistics required by an FMP. The 
control system:
    (1) Identifies those persons who have access to the statistics.
    (2) Contains procedures to limit access to confidential data to 
authorized users.
    (3) Provides for safeguarding the data.
    (b) This system requires that all persons who have authorized access 
to the data be informed of the confidentiality of the data. These 
persons are required to sign a statement that they:
    (1) Have been informed that the data are confidential.
    (2) Have reviewed and are familiar with the procedures to protect 
confidential statistics.


<R05>
Sec. 600.425  Release of statistics.

    (a) The Assistant Administrator will not release to the public any 
statistics required to be submitted under an FMP in a form that would 
identify the submitter, except as required by law.
    (b) All requests from the public for statistics submitted in 
response to a requirement of an FMP will be processed consistent with 
the NOAA FOIA regulations (15 CFR part 903), NAO 205-14, Department of 
Commerce Administrative Orders 205-12 and 205-14 and 15 CFR part 4.

<R04>
                       Subpart F--Foreign Fishing


<R05>
Sec. 600.501  Vessel permits.

    (a) General. (1) Each FFV fishing under the Magnuson-Stevens Act 
must have on board a permit issued under this section, unless it is 
engaged only in recreational fishing.
    (2) Permits issued under this section do not authorize FFV's or 
persons to harass, capture, or kill marine mammals. No marine mammals 
may be taken in the course of fishing unless that vessel has on board a 
currently valid Authorization Certificate under the MMPA. Regulations 
governing the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing 
operations are

[[Page 42]]

contained in 50 CFR part 229 of this title.
    (b) Responsibility of owners and operators. The owners and operators 
of each FFV are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the applicable GIFA, this subpart, and any 
permit issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act and this subpart. The 
owners and operators of each FFV bear civil responsibility for the acts 
of their employees and agents constituting violations, regardless of 
whether the specific acts were authorized or even forbidden by the 
employer or principal, and regardless of knowledge concerning the 
occurrence.
    (c) Activity codes. Permits to fish under a GIFA may be issued by 
the Assistant Administrator for the activities described in this 
paragraph, but the permits may be modified by regulations of this 
subpart, and by the conditions and restrictions attached to the permit 
(see paragraphs (e)(1)(v) and (l) of this section). The Assistant 
Administrator may issue a permit, as appropriate, for one or more of the 
activity codes listed below. The activity codes are described as 
follows:
    (1) Activity Code 1. Catching, scouting, processing, transshipping, 
and supporting foreign vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or 
to be harvested by foreign vessels in the EEZ.
    (2) Activity Code 2. Processing, scouting, transshipping, and 
supporting foreign vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or to 
be harvested by foreign vessels in the EEZ.
    (3) Activity Code 3. Transshipping, scouting, and supporting foreign 
vessels. Activity is limited to fish harvested or to be harvested by 
foreign vessels in the EEZ.
    (4) Activity Code 4. Processing, scouting, transshipping, and 
supporting U.S. vessels delivering fish to foreign vessels. Activity is 
limited to the receipt of unprocessed fish harvested or to be harvested 
by U.S. vessels.
    (5) Activity Code 5. Transshipping, scouting, and supporting foreign 
vessels. Transshipment limited to fish received or to be received from 
foreign vessels processing fish from U.S. harvesting vessels.
    (6) Activity Code 6. Transshipping, scouting, and supporting U.S. 
vessels. Transshipment limited to U.S.-harvested fish processed on board 
U.S. vessels.
    (7) Activity Code 7. Processing, transshipping, and supporting 
foreign vessels. Activity limited to fish harvested or to be harvested 
by foreign vessels seaward of the EEZ.
    (8) Activity Code 8. Transshipping and supporting foreign vessels. 
Activity is limited to fish harvested or to be harvested seaward of the 
EEZ by foreign vessels or fish duly authorized for processing in the 
internal waters of one of the states.
    (9) Activity Code 9. Supporting U.S. fishing vessels and U.S. fish 
processing vessels and any foreign fishing vessels authorized under any 
activity code under paragraph (c) of this subpart.
    (d) Application. (1) Applications for FFV permits must be submitted 
by each foreign nation to the DOS. Application forms are available from 
OES/OMC, DOS, Washington, DC. The applicant should allow 90 days for 
review and comment by the public, involved governmental agencies, and 
appropriate Councils, and for processing before the anticipated date to 
begin fishing. The permit application fee must be paid at the time of 
application according to Sec. 600.518.
    (2) Applicants must provide complete and accurate information 
requested on the permit application form.
    (3) Applicants for FFV's that will support U.S. vessels in joint 
ventures (Activity Code 4) must provide the additional information 
specified by the permit application form.
    (4) Each foreign nation may substitute one FFV for another by 
submitting a new vessel information form and a short explanation of the 
reason for the substitution to the DOS. Each substitution is considered 
a new application and a new application fee must be paid. NMFS will 
promptly process an application for a vessel replacing a permitted FFV 
that is disabled or decommissioned, once the DOS has notified the 
appropriate Council(s) of the substituted application.
    (e) Issuance. (1) Permits may be issued to an FFV by the Assistant 
Administrator through the DOS after--

[[Page 43]]

    (i) The Assistant Administrator determines that the fishing 
described in the application will meet the requirements of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act and approves the permit application.
    (ii) The foreign nation has paid the fees, including any surcharge 
fees and provided any assurances required by the Secretary in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 600.518.
    (iii) The foreign nation has appointed an agent.
    (iv) The foreign nation has identified a designated representative.
    (v) The general ``conditions and restrictions'' of receiving 
permits, as required by section 204(b)(7) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 
and any ``additional restrictions'' attached to the permit for the 
conservation and management of fishery resources or to prevent 
significant impairment of the national defense or security interests, 
have been accepted by the nation issuing the FFV's documents.
    (2) NMFS will distribute blank permit forms to the designated 
representative while the application is being processed. The designated 
representative must ensure that each FFV receives a permit form and must 
accurately transmit the permit form and the contents of the permit to 
the FFV when it is issued. NMFS may authorize the modification and use 
of the previous year's permit forms to be used on an interim basis in 
place of the current year's permit forms if the current forms were not 
made available to the designated representatives for timely 
distribution. The FFV owner or operator must accurately complete the 
permit form prior to fishing in the EEZ.
    (3) A completed permit form must contain--
    (i) The name and IRCS of the FFV and its permit number.
    (ii) The permitted fisheries and activity codes.
    (iii) The date of issuance and expiration date, if other than 
December 31.
    (iv) All conditions and restrictions, and any additional 
restrictions and technical modifications appended to the permit.
    (4) Permits are not issued for boats that are launched from larger 
vessels. Any enforcement action that results from the activities of a 
launched boat will be taken against the permitted vessel.
    (f) Duration. A permit is valid from its date of issuance to its 
date of expiration, unless it is revoked or suspended or the nation 
issuing the FFV's documents does not accept amendments to the permit 
made by the Assistant Administrator in accordance with the procedures of 
paragraph (l) of this section. The permit will be valid for no longer 
than the calendar year in which it was issued.
    (g) Transfer. Permits are not transferable or assignable. A permit 
is valid only for the FFV to which it is issued.
    (h) Display. Each FFV operator must have a properly completed permit 
form available on board the FFV when engaged in fishing activities and 
must produce it at the request of an authorized officer or observer.
    (i) Suspension and revocation. NMFS may apply sanctions to an FFV's 
permit by revoking, suspending, or imposing additional permit 
restrictions on the permit under 15 CFR part 904, if the vessel is 
involved in the commission of any violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 
the GIFA, or this subpart; if an agent and a designated representative 
are not maintained in the United States; if a civil penalty or criminal 
fine imposed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act has become overdue; or as 
otherwise specified in the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (j) Fees. Permit application fees are described in Sec. 600.518.
    (k) Change in application information. (1) The foreign nation must 
report, in writing, any change in the information supplied under 
paragraph (d) of this section to the Assistant Administrator within 15 
calendar days after the date of the change. Failure to report a change 
in the ownership from that described in the current application within 
the specified time frame voids the permit, and all penalties involved 
will accrue to the previous owner.
    (2) The Assistant Administrator may make technical modifications or 
changes in the permit application requested or reported by a Nation, 
such as a change in radio call sign, processing equipment, or tonnage, 
which will be effective immediately.

[[Page 44]]

    (3) If, in the opinion of the Assistant Administrator, a permit 
change requested by a Nation could significantly affect the status of 
any fishery resource, such request will be processed as an application 
for a new permit under this section.
    (4) The Assistant Administrator will notify the designated 
representative of any revision that must be made on the permit form as 
the result of a permit change.
    (5) The vessel owner or operator must record the modification on the 
permit form.
    (l) Permit amendments. (1) The Assistant Administrator may amend a 
permit by adding ``additional restrictions'' for the conservation and 
management of fishery resources covered by the permit, or for the 
national defense or security if the Assistant Administrator determines 
that such interests would be significantly impaired without such 
restrictions. Compliance with the added additional restrictions is a 
condition of the permit. Violations of added additional restrictions 
will be treated as violations of this subpart.
    (2) The Assistant Administrator may make proposed additional 
restrictions effective immediately, if necessary, to prevent substantial 
harm to a fishery resource of the United States, to allow for the 
continuation of ongoing fishing operations, or to allow for fishing to 
begin at the normal time for opening of the fishery.
    (3) The Assistant Administrator will send proposed additional 
restrictions to each Nation whose vessels are affected (via the 
Secretary of State), to the appropriate Councils, and to the Commandant 
of the Coast Guard. NMFS will, at the same time, publish a document of 
any significant proposed additional restrictions in the Federal 
Register. The document will include a summary of the reasons underlying 
the proposal, and the reasons that any proposed additional restrictions 
are made effective immediately.
    (4) The Nation whose vessels are involved, the owners of the 
affected vessels, their representatives, the agencies specified in 
paragraph (l)(3) of this section, and the public may submit written 
comments on the proposed additional restrictions within 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (5) The Assistant Administrator will make a final decision regarding 
the proposed additional restrictions as soon as practicable after the 
end of the comment period. The Assistant Administrator will provide the 
final additional restrictions to the Nation whose vessels are affected 
(via the Secretary of State) according to the procedures of paragraph 
(e) of this section. The Assistant Administrator will include with the 
final additional restrictions to the Nation, a response to comments 
submitted.
    (6) Additional restrictions may be modified by following the 
procedures of paragraphs (l)(2) through (l)(5) of this section.

Sec. 600.502  Vessel reports.

    (a) The operator of each FFV must report the FFV's activities within 
the EEZ to the USCG and NMFS as specified in this section.
    (b) All reports required by this section must be in English and in 
the formats specified in the permit additions and restrictions. Reports 
must be delivered via private or commercial communications facilities, 
facsimile, or other electronic means acceptable to NMFS and the USCG, 
directly to the appropriate NMFS Region or Center and USCG commander. 
Weekly reports must also be delivered directly to the appropriate NMFS 
Region or Center (see tables 1 and 2 of this section). (The required 
reports may be delivered to the closest USCG communication station as 
indicated in table 3 of this section or other USCG communication station 
only if adequate private or commercial communications facilities have 
not been successfully contacted.) Radio reports must be made via 
radiotelegraphy, Telex, or facsimile where available. For the purposes 
of this section, a message is considered ``transmitted'' when its 
receipt is acknowledged by a communications facility and considered 
``delivered'' upon its receipt by the offices of the appropriate USCG 
commander, NMFS Regional Office, or NMFS Center identified in table 2 of 
this section. Reports required

[[Page 45]]

by this section may be submitted by the vessel's designated 
representative; however, the operator of the FFV is responsible for the 
correct and timely filing of all required reports.
    (c) Activity reports. The operator of each FFV must report the FFV's 
movements and activities before or upon the event, as specified in this 
paragraph (c). Appropriate forms, instructions, codes, and examples are 
contained in the conditions and restrictions of the FFV's permit. Each 
FFV report must contain the following information: The message 
identifier ``VESREP'' to indicate it is a vessel activity report, FFV 
name, international radio call sign IRCS, date (month and day based on 
GMT), time (hour and minute GMT), position (latitude and longitude to 
the nearest degree and minute) where required, area (by fishing area 
code) where required, the appropriate action code, confirmation codes 
where required, and the other information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(11) of this section.
    (1) ``BEGIN''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will actually ``BEGIN'' fishing in the EEZ and the 
species (by species code), product (by product code), and quantity of 
all fish and fish products (by product weight to the nearest hundredth 
of a metric ton) on board when entering the EEZ (action code ``BEGIN''). 
The message must be delivered at least 24 hours before the vessel begins 
to fish.
    (2) ``DEPART''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will ``DEPART'' the EEZ to embark or debark an 
observer, to visit a U.S. port, to conduct a joint venture in internal 
waters, or to otherwise temporarily leave an authorized fishing area, 
but not depart the seaward limit of the EEZ (action code ``DEPART''). 
The message must be transmitted before the FFV departs the present 
fishing area and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal.
    (3) ``RETURN''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will ``RETURN'' to the EEZ following a temporary 
departure, and the species (by species code), product (by product code), 
and quantity of all fish and fish products (by product weight to the 
nearest hundredth of a metric ton) on board that were received in a 
joint venture in internal waters (action code ``RETURN''). The message 
must be transmitted before returning to the EEZ and delivered within 24 
hours of its transmittal.
    (4) ``SHIFT''. Each operator must report each SHIFT in fishing area 
(as described for each fishery) by specifying the date, time, and 
position the FFV will start fishing, and the new area (action code 
``SHIFT''). The message must be transmitted before leaving the original 
area and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal. If a foreign 
vessel operates within 20 nautical miles (37.04 km) of a fishing area 
boundary, its operator may submit in one message the shift reports for 
all fishing area shifts occurring during 1 fishing day (0001-2400 GMT). 
This message must be transmitted prior to the last shift expected to be 
made in the day and delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal.
    (5) ``JV OPS''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area at which the FFV will ``START'' joint venture operations 
(action code ``START JV OPS'') or ``END'' joint venture operations 
(action code ``END JV OPS''). These reports must be made in addition to 
other activity reports made under this section. Each message must be 
transmitted before the event and delivered within 24 hours of its 
transmittal.
    (6) ``TRANSFER''. The operator of each FFV that anticipates a 
transshipping operation in which the FFV will receive fish or fisheries 
products must specify the date, time, position and area the FFV will 
conduct the ``TRANSFER'' and the name and IRCS of the other FFV or U.S. 
vessel involved (action code ``TRANSFER''). The report must include the 
permit activity code under which the transfer will be made. The message 
must be transmitted prior to the transfer and delivered within 24 hours 
of its transmittal. The movement of raw fish from a permitted foreign 
catching vessel or, under an Activity Code 4, from a U.S. fishing vessel 
to the reporting processing vessel and the return of nets or codends is 
not considered a transfer.
    (7) ``OFFLOADED''. Each operator must specify the date, time, 
position,

[[Page 46]]

and area the FFV ``OFFLOADED'' fish or fisheries products TO another FFV 
or a U.S. vessel in a transfer, the other FFV's or U.S. vessel's name, 
IRCS, Permit Activity Code under which the transfer was made, species 
(by species code) and quantity of fish and fisheries products (by 
product code and by product weight, to the nearest hundredth of a metric 
ton) offloaded (action code ``OFFLOADED TO''). The message must be 
transmitted within 12 hours after the transfer is completed and 
delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal and before the FFV ceases 
fishing in the EEZ.
    (8) ``RECEIVED''. Each operator must specify the date, time, 
position and area the vessel ``RECEIVED'' fish or fisheries products 
FROM another FFV in a transfer, the other FFV's or U.S. vessel's name, 
IRCS, Permit Activity Code under which the receipt was made, species (by 
species code) and quantity of fish and fisheries products (by product 
code and by product weight, to the nearest hundredth of a metric ton) 
received (action code ``RECEIVED FROM''). The message must be 
transmitted within 12 hours after the transfer is completed and 
delivered within 24 hours of its transmittal and before the vessel 
ceases fishing in the EEZ.
    (9) ``CEASE''. Each operator must specify the date, time, position, 
and area the FFV will ``CEASE'' fishing in order to leave the EEZ 
(action code ``CEASE''). The message must be delivered at least 24 hours 
before the FFV's departure.
    (10) ``CHANGE''. Each operator must report any ``CHANGE'' TO the 
FFV's operations if the position or time of an event specified in an 
activity report will vary more than 5 nautical miles (9.26 km) or 4 
hours from that previously reported, by sending a revised message 
inserting the word ``CHANGE'' in front of the previous report, repeating 
the name, IRCS, date, and time of the previous report, adding the word 
``TO'' and the complete revised text of the new report (action code 
``CHANGE TO''). Changes to reports specifying an early beginning of 
fishing by an FFV or other changes to reports contained in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section must be transmitted and delivered 
as if the ``CHANGE'' report were the original message.
    (11) ``CANCEL''. Each operator wanting to ``CANCEL'' a previous 
report may do so by sending a revised message, and inserting the word 
``CANCEL'' in front of the previous report's vessel name, IRCS, date, 
time and action code canceled (action code ``CANCEL''). The message must 
be transmitted and delivered prior to the date and time of the event in 
the original message.
    (d) The operator of an FFV will be in violation of paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(9) of this section if the FFV does not pass within 5 
nautical miles (9.26 km) of the position given in the report within 4 
hours of the time given in the report.
    (e) The notices required by this section may be provided for 
individual or groups of FFV's (on a vessel-by-vessel basis) by 
authorized persons. An FFV operator may retransmit reports on the behalf 
of another FFV, if authorized by that FFV's operator. This does not 
relieve the individual vessel operator of the responsibility of filing 
required reports. In these cases, the message format should be modified 
so that each line of text under ``VESREP'' is a separate vessel report.
    (f) Weekly reports. (1) The operator of each FFV in the EEZ must 
submit appropriate weekly reports through the Nation's designated 
representative. The report must arrive at the address and time specified 
in paragraph (g) of this section. The reports may be sent by facsimile 
or Telex, but a completed copy of the report form must be mailed or hand 
delivered to confirm the Telex. Appropriate forms, instructions, codes, 
and examples are contained in the conditions and restrictions of the 
FFV's permit. Designated representatives may include more than one 
vessel report in a facsimile or Telex message, if the information is 
submitted on a vessel-by-vessel basis. Requests for corrections to 
previous reports must be submitted through the Nation's designated 
representative and mailed or hand-delivered, together with a written 
explanation of the reasons for the errors. The appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director may accept or reject any 
correction

[[Page 47]]

and initiate any appropriate civil penalty actions.
    (2) Weekly catch report (CATREP). The operator of each FFV must 
submit a weekly catch report stating any catch (Activity Code 1) in 
round weight of each species or species group allocated to that Nation 
by area and days fished in each area for the weekly period Sunday 
through Saturday, GMT, as modified by the fishery in which the FFV is 
engaged. Foreign vessels delivering unsorted, unprocessed fish to a 
processing vessel are not required to submit CATREP's, if that 
processing vessel (Activity Code 2) submits consolidated CATREP's for 
all fish received during each weekly period. No report is required for 
FFV's that do not catch or receive foreign-caught fish during the 
reporting period.
    (3) Weekly receipts report (RECREP). The operator of each FFV must 
submit a weekly report stating any receipts of U.S.-harvested fish in a 
joint venture (Activity Code 4) for the weekly period Sunday through 
Saturday, GMT, as modified by the fishery in which the FFV is engaged, 
for each fishing area, by authorized or prohibited species or species 
group; days fish received; round weight retained or returned to the U.S. 
fishing vessel; number of codends received; and number of vessels 
transferring codends. The report must also include the names of U.S. 
fishing vessels transferring codends during the week. No report is 
required for FFV's that do not receive any U.S.-harvested fish during 
the reporting period.
    (4) Marine mammal report (MAMREP). The operator of each FFV must 
submit a weekly report stating any incidental catch or receipt of marine 
mammals (Activity Codes 1 or 2 and/or 4), the geographical position 
caught, the condition of the animal, number caught (if more than one of 
the same species and condition), and nationality of the catching vessel 
for the period Sunday through Saturday, GMT, as modified by the fishery 
in which the vessel is engaged. Foreign catching vessels delivering 
unsorted, unprocessed fish to processing vessel are not required to 
submit MAMREP's, provided that the processing or factory vessel 
(Activity Code 2) submits consolidated MAMREP's for all fish received 
during each weekly period. FFV's receiving U.S.-harvested fish in a 
joint venture (Activity Code 4) must submit consolidated reports for 
U.S. vessels operating in the joint venture. No report is required for 
FFV's that do not catch or receive marine mammals during the reporting 
period.
    (g) Submission instructions for weekly reports. The designated 
representative for each FFV must submit weekly reports in the prescribed 
format to the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and Research 
Director of NMFS by 1900 GMT on the Wednesday following the end of the 
reporting period. However, by agreement with the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director, the designated 
representative may submit weekly reports to some other facility of NMFS.

<R05>
Sec. 600.503  Vessel and gear identification.

    (a) Vessel identification. (1) The operator of each FFV assigned an 
IRCS must display that call sign amidships on both the port and 
starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull, so that it is visible from an 
enforcement vessel, and on an appropriate weather deck so it is visible 
from the air.

[[Page 49]]

    (2) The operator of each FFV not assigned an IRCS, such as a small 
trawler associated with a mothership or one of a pair of trawlers, must 
display the IRCS of the associated vessel, followed by a numerical 
suffix. (For example, JCZM-1, JCZM-2, etc., would be displayed on small 
trawlers not assigned an IRCS operating with a mothership whose IRCS is 
JCZM; JANP-1 would be displayed by a pair trawler not assigned an IRCS 
operating with a trawler whose IRCS is JANP.)
    (3) The vessel identification must be in a color in contrast to the 
background and must be permanently affixed to the FFV in block Roman 
alphabet letters and Arabic numerals at least 1 m in height for FFV's 
over 20 m in length, and at least 0.5 m in height for all other FFV's.
    (b) Navigational lights and shapes. Each FFV must display the lights 
and shapes prescribed by the International Regulations for Preventing 
Collisions at Sea, 1972 (TIAS 8587, and 1981 amendment TIAS 10672), for 
the activity in which the FFV is engaged (as described at 33 CFR part 
81).
    (c) Gear identification. (1) The operator of each FFV must ensure 
that all deployed fishing gear that is not physically and continuously 
attached to an FFV:
    (i) Is clearly marked at the surface with a buoy displaying the 
vessel identification of the FFV (see paragraph (a) of this section) to 
which the gear belongs.
    (ii) Has attached a light visible for 2 nautical miles (3.70 km) at 
night in good visibility.
    (iii) Has a radio buoy.
    Trawl codends passed from one vessel to another are considered 
continuously attached gear and are not required to be marked.
    (2) The operator of each FFV must ensure that deployed longlines, 
strings of traps or pots, and gillnets are marked at the surface at each 
terminal end with: (see paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this 
section).
    (3) Additional requirements may be specified for the fishery in 
which the vessel is engaged.
    (4) Unmarked or incorrectly identified fishing gear may be 
considered abandoned and may be disposed of in accordance with 
applicable Federal regulations by any authorized officer.
    (d) Maintenance. The operator of each FFV must--
    (1) Keep the vessel and gear identification clearly legible and in 
good repair.
    (2) Ensure that nothing on the FFV obstructs the view of the 
markings from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (3) Ensure that the proper navigational lights and shapes are 
displayed for the FFV's activity and are properly functioning.


<R05>
Sec. 600.504  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) General. (1) The owner, operator, or any person aboard any FFV 
subject to this subpart must immediately comply with instructions and 
signals issued by an authorized officer to stop the FFV; to move the FFV 
to a specified location; and to facilitate safe boarding and inspection 
of the vessel, its gear, equipment, records, and fish and fish products 
on board for purposes of enforcing the Magnuson-Stevens Act and this 
subpart.
    (2) The operator of each FFV must provide vessel position or other 
information when requested by an authorized officer within the time 
specified in the request.
    (b) Communications equipment. (1) Each FFV must be equipped with a 
VHF-FM radiotelephone station located so that it may be operated from 
the wheelhouse. Each operator must maintain a continuous listening watch 
on channel 16 (156.8 mHz).
    (2) Each FFV must be equipped with a radiotelephone station capable 
of communicating via 2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephony and at least one set 
of working frequencies identified in table 3 to Sec. 600.502 appropriate 
to the fishery in which the FFV is operating. Each operator must monitor 
and be ready to communicate via 2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone each day 
from 0800 GMT to 0830 GMT and 2000 to 2030 GMT, and in preparation for 
boarding.
    (3) FFV's that are not equipped with processing facilities and that 
deliver all catches to a foreign processing vessel are exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) FFV's with no IRCS that do not catch fish and are used as 
auxiliary

[[Page 50]]

vessels to handle codends, nets, equipment, or passengers for a 
processing vessel are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (b)(2) of this section.
    (5) The appropriate Regional Administrator, with the agreement of 
the appropriate USCG commander, may, upon request by a foreign nation, 
accept alternatives to the radio requirements of this section to certain 
FFV's or types of FFV's operating in a fishery, provided they are 
adequate for the communications needs of the fishery.
    (c) Communications procedures. (1) Upon being approached by a USCG 
vessel or aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized 
officer aboard, the operator of any FFV subject to this subpart must be 
alert for communications conveying enforcement instructions. The 
enforcement unit may communicate by channel 16 VHF-FM radiotelephone, 
2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone, message block from an aircraft, flashing 
light or flag signals from the International Code of Signals, hand 
signal, placard, loudhailer, or other appropriate means. The following 
signals, extracted from the International Code of Signals, are among 
those that may be used.
    (i) ``AA, AA, AA, etc.'', which is the call for an unknown station. 
The signaled vessel should respond by identifying itself or by 
illuminating the vessel identification required by Sec. 600.505.
    (ii) ``RY-CY'', meaning ``You should proceed at slow speed, a boat 
is coming to you''.
    (iii) ``SQ3'', meaning ``You should stop or heave to; I am going to 
board you''.
    (iv) ``L'', meaning ``You should stop your vessel instantly.''
    (2) Failure of an FFV's operator to stop the vessel when directed to 
do so by an authorized officer using VHF-FM radiotelephone (channel 16), 
2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone (where required), message block from an 
aircraft, flashing light signal, flaghoist, or loudhailer constitutes a 
violation of this subpart.
    (3) The operator of or any person aboard an FFV who does not 
understand a signal from an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain 
clarification by radiotelephone or other means must consider the signal 
to be a command to stop the FFV instantly.
    (d) Boarding. The operator of an FFV signaled for boarding must--
    (1) Monitor 2182 kHz (SSB) radiotelephone and channel 16 (156.8 mHz) 
VHF-FM radiotelephone.
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or maneuver in such a way as to 
maintain the safety of the FFV and facilitate boarding by the authorized 
officer and the boarding party or an observer.
    (3) Provide the authorized officer, boarding party, or observer a 
safe pilot ladder. The operator must ensure the pilot ladder is securely 
attached to the FFV and meets the construction requirements of 
Regulation 17, Chapter V of the International Convention for the Safety 
of Life at Sea (SOLAS), 1974 (TIAS 9700 and 1978 Protocol, TIAS 10009), 
or a substantially equivalent national standard approved by letter from 
the Assistant Administrator, with agreement with the USCG. Safe pilot 
ladder standards are summarized below:
    (i) The ladder must be of a single length of not more than 9 m (30 
ft), capable of reaching the water from the point of access to the FFV, 
accounting for all conditions of loading and trim of the FFV and for an 
adverse list of 15 deg.. Whenever the distance from sea level to the 
point of access to the ship is more than 9 m (30 ft), access must be by 
means of an accommodation ladder or other safe and convenient means.
    (ii) The steps of the pilot ladder must be--
    (A) Of hardwood, or other material of equivalent properties, made in 
one piece free of knots, having an efficient non-slip surface; the four 
lowest steps may be made of rubber of sufficient strength and stiffness 
or of other suitable material of equivalent characteristics.
    (B) Not less than 480 mm (19 inches) long, 115 mm (4.5 inches) wide, 
and 25 mm (1 inch) in depth, excluding any non-slip device.
    (C) Equally spaced not less than 300 millimeters (12 inches) nor 
more than 380 mm (15 inches) apart and secured in such a manner that 
they will remain horizontal.
    (iii) No pilot ladder may have more than two replacement steps that 
are

[[Page 51]]

secured in position by a method different from that used in the original 
construction of the ladder.
    (iv) The side ropes of the ladder must consist of two uncovered 
manila ropes not less than 60 mm (2.25 inches) in circumference on each 
side (or synthetic ropes of equivalent size and equivalent or greater 
strength). Each rope must be continuous, with no joints below the top 
step.
    (v) Battens made of hardwood, or other material of equivalent 
properties, in one piece and not less than 1.80 m (5 ft 10 inches) long 
must be provided at such intervals as will prevent the pilot ladder from 
twisting. The lowest batten must be on the fifth step from the bottom of 
the ladder and the interval between any batten and the next must not 
exceed nine steps.
    (vi) Where passage onto or off the ship is by means of a bulwark 
ladder, two handhold stanchions must be fitted at the point of boarding 
or leaving the FFV not less than 0.70 m (2 ft 3 inches) nor more than 
0.80 m (2 ft 7 inches) apart, not less than 40 mm (2.5 inches) in 
diameter, and must extend not less than 1.20 m (3 ft 11 inches) above 
the top of the bulwark.
    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer or observer, provide a manrope, safety line, and 
illumination for the ladder; and
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to ensure the safety of the 
authorized officer and the boarding party and to facilitate the boarding 
and inspection.
    (e) Access and records. (1) The owner and operator of each FFV must 
provide authorized officers access to all spaces where work is conducted 
or business papers and records are prepared or stored, including but not 
limited to, personal quarters and areas within personal quarters.
    (2) The owner and operator of each FFV must provide to authorized 
officers all records and documents pertaining to the fishing activities 
of the vessel, including but not limited to, production records, fishing 
logs, navigation logs, transfer records, product receipts, cargo stowage 
plans or records, draft or displacement calculations, customs documents 
or records, and an accurate hold plan reflecting the current structure 
of the vessel's storage and factory spaces.
    (f) Product storage. The operator of each permitted FFV storing fish 
or fish products in a storage space must ensure that all non-fish 
product items are neither stowed beneath nor covered by fish products, 
unless required to maintain the stability and safety of the vessel. 
These items include, but are not limited to, portable conveyors, exhaust 
fans, ladders, nets, fuel bladders, extra bin boards, or other movable 
non-product items. These items may be in the space when necessary for 
safety of the vessel or crew or for storage of the product. Lumber, bin 
boards, or other dunnage may be used for shoring or bracing of product 
to ensure safety of crew and to prevent shifting of cargo within the 
space.

Sec. 600.506  Observers.

    (a) General. To carry out such scientific, compliance monitoring, 
and other functions as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
purposes of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director (see table 2 to 
Sec. 600.502) may assign U.S. observers to FFV's. Except as provided for 
in section 201(i)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, no FFV may conduct 
fishing operations within the EEZ unless a U.S. observer is aboard.
    (b) Effort plan. To ensure the availability of an observer as 
required by this section, the owners and operators of FFV's wanting to 
fish within the EEZ will submit to the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director; and also to the Chief, 
Office of Enforcement, NMFS, Silver Spring, MD, a schedule of fishing 
effort 30 days prior to the beginning of each quarter. A quarter is a 
time period of 3 consecutive months beginning January 1, April 1, July 
1, and October 1 of each year. The schedule will contain the name and 
IRCS of each FFV intending to fish within the EEZ during the upcoming 
quarter, and each FFV's expected date of arrival and expected date of 
departure.
    (1) The appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and Research 
Director must be notified immediately of any substitution of vessels or 
any cancellation of plans to fish in the EEZ for FFV's listed in the 
effort plan required by this section.
    (2) If an arrival date of an FFV will vary more than 5 days from the 
date listed in the quarterly schedule, the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director must be notified at least 
10 days in advance of the rescheduled date of arrival. If the notice 
required by this paragraph (b)(2) is not given, the FFV may not engage 
in fishing until an observer is available and has been placed aboard the 
vessel or the requirement has been waived by the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director.
    (c) Assistance to observers. To assist the observer in the 
accomplishment of his or her assigned duties, the owner and operator of 
an FFV to which an observer is assigned must--
    (1) Provide, at no cost to the observer or the United States, 
accommodations for the observer aboard the FFV that are equivalent to 
those provided to the officers of that vessel.
    (2) Cause the FFV to proceed to such places and at such times as may 
be designated by the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and 
Research Director for the purpose of embarking and debarking the 
observer.
    (3) Allow the observer to use the FFV's communications equipment and 
personnel upon demand for the transmission and receipt of messages.
    (4) Allow the observer access to and use of the FFV's navigation 
equipment and personnel upon demand to determine the vessel's position.
    (5) Allow the observer free and unobstructed access to the FFV's 
bridge, trawl, or working decks, holding bins, processing areas, freezer 
spaces, weight scales, cargo holds and any other space that may be used 
to hold, process, weigh, or store fish or fish products at any time.
    (6) Allow the observer to inspect and copy the FFV's daily log, 
communications log, transfer log, and any other log, document, notice, 
or record required by these regulations.
    (7) Provide the observer copies of any records required by these 
regulations upon demand.
    (8) Notify the observer at least 15 minutes before fish are brought 
on board or fish or fish products are transferred from the FFV to allow 
sampling the catch or observing the transfer, unless the observer 
specifically requests not to be notified.
    (9) Provide all other reasonable assistance to enable the observer 
to carry out his or her duties.
    (d) Health and safety standards. All foreign fishing vessels to 
which an observer is deployed must maintain, at all times that the 
vessel is in the EEZ, the following:
    (1) At least one working radar.

[[Page 54]]

    (2) Functioning navigation lights as required by international law.
    (3) A watch on the bridge by appropriately trained and experienced 
personnel while the vessel is underway.

capacity equal to or greater than the number of people aboard the 
vessel. Lifeboats and inflatable life rafts must be maintained in good 
working order and be readily available.
    (5) Life jackets equal or greater in number to the total number of 
persons aboard the vessel. Life jackets must be stowed in readily 
accessible and plainly marked positions throughout the vessel, and 
maintained in a state of good repair.
    (6) At least one ring life buoy for each 25 ft (7.6 m) of vessel 
length, equipped with automatic water lights. Ring life buoys must have 
an outside diameter of not more than 32 inches (81.3 cm) nor less than 
30 inches (76.2 cm), and must be maintained in a state of good repair. 
Ring life buoys must be readily available, but not positioned so they 
pose a threat of entanglement in work areas. They must be secured in 
such a way that they can be easily cast loose in the event of an 
emergency.
    (7) At least one VHF-FM radio with a functioning channel 16 (156.8 
mHz), International Distress, Safety and Calling Frequency, and one 
functioning AM radio (SSB-Single Side Band) capable of operating at 2182 
kHz (SSB). Radios will be maintained in a radio room, chartroom, or 
other suitable location.
    (8) At least one Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB), 
approved by the USCG for offshore commercial use, stowed in a location 
so as to make it readily available in the event of an emergency.
    (9) At least six hand-held, rocket-propelled, parachute, red-flare 
distress signals, and three orange-smoke distress signals stowed in the 
pilothouse or navigation bridge in portable watertight containers.

required by and maintained in accordance with the International 
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.
    (11) Clean and sanitary conditions in all living spaces, food 
service and preparation areas and work spaces aboard the vessel.
    (e) Observer transfers. (1) The operator of the FFV must ensure that 
transfers of observers at sea via small boat or raft are carried out 
during daylight hours as weather and sea conditions allow, and with the 
agreement of the observer involved. The FFV operator must provide the 
observer 3 hours advance notice of at-sea transfers, so that the 
observer may collect personal belongings, equipment, and scientific 
samples.
    (2) The FFV's involved must provide a safe pilot ladder and conduct 
the transfer according to the procedures of Sec. 600.504(d) to ensure 
the safety of the during the transfer.
    (3) An experienced crew member must assist the observer in the small 
boat or raft in which the transfer is made.
    (f) Supplementary observers. In the event funds are not available 
from Congressional appropriations of fees collected to assign an 
observer to a foreign fishing vessel, the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director will assign a 
supplementary observer to that vessel. The costs of supplementary 
observers will be paid for by the owners and operators of foreign 
fishing vessels as provided for in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (g) Supplementary observer authority and duties. (1) A supplementary 
observer aboard a foreign fishing vessel has the same authority and must 
be treated in all respects as an observer who is employed by NMFS, 
either directly or under contract.
    (2) The duties of supplementary observers and their deployment and 
work schedules will be specified by the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director.
    (3) All data collected by supplementary observers will be under the 
exclusive control of the Assistant Administrator.
    (h) Supplementary observer payment--(1) Method of payment. The 
owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels must pay directly to the 
contractor the costs of supplementary observer coverage. Payment must be 
made to the contractor supplying supplementary observer coverage either 
by letter of

[[Page 55]]

credit or certified check drawn on a federally chartered bank in U.S. 
dollars, or other financial institution acceptable to the contractor. 
The letter of credit used to pay supplementary observer fees to 
contractors must be separate and distinct from the letter of credit 
required by Sec. 600.518(b)(2). Billing schedules will be specified by 
the terms of the contract between NOAA and the contractors. Billings for 
supplementary observer coverage will be approved by the appropriate 
Regional Administrator or Science and Research Director and then 
transmitted to the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels by 
the appropriate designated representative. Each country will have only 
one designated representative to receive observer bills for all vessels 
of that country, except as provided for by the Assistant Administrator. 
All bills must be paid within 10 working days of the billing date. 
Failure to pay an observer bill will constitute grounds to revoke 
fishing permits. All fees collected under this section will be 
considered interim in nature and subject to reconciliation at the end of 
the fiscal year in accordance with paragraph (h)(4) of this section and 
Sec. 600.518(d).
    (2) Contractor costs. The costs charged for supplementary observer 
coverage to the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels may not 
exceed the costs charged to NMFS for the same or similar services, 
except that contractors may charge to the owners and operators of 
foreign fishing vessels an additional fee to cover the administrative 
costs of the program not ordinarily part of contract costs charged to 
NMFS. The costs charged foreign fishermen for supplementary observers 
may include, but are not limited to the following:
    (i) Salary and benefits, including overtime, for supplementary 
observers.
    (ii) The costs of post-certification training required by paragraph 
(j)(2) of this section.
    (iii) The costs of travel, transportation, and per diem associated 
with deploying supplementary observers to foreign fishing vessels 
including the cost of travel, transportation, and per diem from the 
supplementary observer's post of duty to the point of embarkation to the 
foreign fishing vessel, and then from the point of disembarkation to the 
post of duty from where the trip began. For the purposes of these 
regulations, the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and 
Research Director will designate posts of duty for supplementary 
observers.
    (iv) The costs of travel, transportation, and per diem associated 
with the debriefing following deployment of a supplementary observer by 
NMFS officials.
    (v) The administrative and overhead costs incurred by the contractor 
and, if appropriate, a reasonable profit.
    (3) NMFS costs. The owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels 
must also pay to NMFS as part of the surcharge required by section 
201(i)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the following costs:
    (i) The costs of certifying applicants for the position of 
supplementary observer.
    (ii) The costs of any equipment, including safety equipment, 
sampling equipment, operations manuals, or other texts necessary to 
perform the duties of a supplementary observer. The equipment will be 
specified by the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and 
Research Director according to the requirements of the fishery to which 
the supplementary observer will be deployed.
    (iii) The costs associated with communications with supplementary 
observers for transmission of data and routine messages.
    (iv) For the purposes of monitoring the supplementary observer 
program, the costs for the management and analysis of data.
    (v) The costs for data editing and entry.
    (vi) Any costs incurred by NMFS to train, deploy or debrief a 
supplementary observer.
    (vii) The cost for U.S. Customs inspection for supplementary 
observers disembarking after deployment.
    (4) Reconciliation. Fees collected by the contractor in excess of 
the actual costs of supplementary observer coverage will be refunded to 
the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels, or kept on deposit 
to defray the costs of future supplementary observer coverage. Refunds 
will be made within 60

[[Page 56]]

days after final costs are determined and approved by NMFS.
    (i) Supplementary observer contractors--(1) Contractor eligibility. 
Supplementary observers will be obtained by NMFS from persons or firms 
having established contracts to provide NMFS with observers. In the 
event no such contract is in place, NMFS will use established, 
competitive contracting procedures to select persons or firms to provide 
supplementary observers. The services supplied by the supplementary 
observer contractors will be as described within the contract and as 
specified below.
    (2) Supplementary observer contractors must submit for the approval 
of the Assistant Administrator the following:
    (i) A copy of any contract, including all attachments, amendments, 
and enclosures thereto, between the contractor and the owners and 
operators of foreign fishing vessels for whom the contractor will 
provide supplementary observer services.
    (ii) All application information for persons whom the contractor 
desires to employ as certified supplementary observers.
    (iii) Billing schedules and billings to the owners and operators of 
foreign fishing vessels for further transmission to the designated 
representative of the appropriate foreign nation.
    (iv) All data on costs.
    (j) Supplementary observers--certification, training--(1) 
Certification. The appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and 
Research Director will certify persons as qualified for the position of 
supplementary observer once the following conditions are met:
    (i) The candidate is a citizen or national of the United States.
    (ii) The candidate has education or experience equivalent to the 
education or experience required of persons used as observers by NMFS as 
either Federal personnel or contract employees. The education and 
experience required for certification may vary according to the 
requirements of managing the foreign fishery in which the supplementary 
observer is to be deployed. Documentation of U.S. citizenship or 
nationality, and education or experience will be provided from personal 
qualification statements on file with NMFS contractors who provide 
supplementary observer services, and will not require the submission of 
additional information to NMFS.
    (2) Training. Prior to deployment to foreign fishing vessels, 
certified supplementary observers must also meet the following 
conditions:
    (i) Each certified supplementary observer must satisfactorily 
complete a course of training approved by the appropriate Regional 
Administrator or Science and Research Director as equivalent to that 
received by persons used as observers by NMFS as either Federal 
personnel or contract employees. The course of training may vary 
according to the foreign fishery in which the supplementary observer is 
to be deployed.
    (ii) Each certified supplementary observer must agree in writing to 
abide by standards of conduct as set forth in Department of Commerce 
Administrative Order 202-735 (as provided by the contractor).
    (k) Supplementary observer certification suspension or revocation. 
(1) Certification of a supplementary observer may be suspended or 
revoked by the Assistant Administrator under the following conditions:
    (i) A supplementary observer fails to perform the duties specified 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (ii) A supplementary observer fails to abide by the standards of 
conduct described by Department of Commerce Administrative Order 202-
735.
    (2) The suspension or revocation of the certification of a 
supplementary observer by the Assistant Administrator may be based on 
the following:
    (i) Boarding inspection reports by authorized officers of the USCG 
or NMFS, or other credible information, that indicate a supplementary 
observer has failed to abide by the established standards of conduct; or
    (ii) An analysis by NMFS of the data collected by a supplementary 
observer indicating improper or incorrect data collection or recording. 
The failure to properly collect or record data is sufficient to justify 
decertification of supplementary observers; no intent to defraud need be 
demonstrated.

[[Page 57]]

    (3) The Assistant Administrator will notify the supplementary 
observer, in writing, of the Assistant Administrator's intent to suspend 
or revoke certification, and the reasons therefor, and provide the 
supplementary observer a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the 
Assistant Administrator determines that there are disputed questions of 
material fact, then the Assistant Administrator may in this respect 
appoint an examiner to make an informal fact-finding inquiry and prepare 
a report and recommendations.

Sec. 600.507  Recordkeeping.

    (a) General. The owner and operator of each FFV must maintain timely 
and accurate records required by this section as modified by the 
regulations for the fishery in which the FFV is engaged.
    (1) The owner and operator of each FFV must maintain all required 
records in English, based on Greenwich mean time (GMT) unless otherwise 
specified in the regulation, and make them immediately available for 
inspection upon the request of an authorized officer or observer.
    (2) The owner and operator of each FFV must retain all required 
records on board the FFV whenever it is in the EEZ, for 3 years after 
the end of the permit period.
    (3) The owner and operator of each FFV must retain the required 
records and make them available for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer at any time during the 3 years after the end of the 
permit period, whether or not such records are on board the vessel.
    (4) The owner and operator of each FFV must provide to the Assistant 
Administrator, in the form and at the times prescribed, any other 
information requested that the Assistant Administrator determines is 
necessary to fulfill the fishery conservation, management and 
enforcement purposes of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (b) Communications log. The owner and operator of each FFV must 
record in a separate communications log, at the time of transmittal, the 
time and content of each notification made under Sec. 600.504.
    (c) Transfer log. Except for the transfer of unsorted, unprocessed 
fish via codend from a catching vessel to a processing vessel (Activity 
Code 2 or 4), the owner and operator of each FFV must record, in a 
separate transfer log, each transfer or receipt of any fish or fishery 
product, including quantities transferred or offloaded outside the EEZ. 
The operator must record in the log within 12 hours of the completion of 
the transfer:
    (1) The time and date (GMT) and location (in geographic coordinates) 
the transfer began and was completed.
    (2) The product weight, by species and product (use species and 
product codes), of all fish transferred, to the nearest 0.01 mt.

fish and the FFV receiving the fish.
    (d) Daily fishing log. (1) The owner or operator of each FFV 
authorized to catch fish (Activity Code 1) must maintain a daily fishing 
log of the effort, catch and production of the FFV, as modified by 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section and the regulations for the fishery in 
which the FFV is engaged. The operator must maintain on a daily and 
cumulative basis for the permit period a separate log for each fishery 
(see table 2 to Sec. 600.502) in which the FFV is engaged according to 
this section and in the format specified in the instructions provided 
with the permit or other format authorized under paragraph (i) of this 
section. Daily effort entries are required for each day the vessel 
conducts fishing operations within the EEZ. Daily entries are not 
required whenever the FFV is in port or engaged in a joint venture in 
the internal waters of a state. Each page of log may contain entries 
pertaining to only one day's fishing operations or one gear set, 
whichever is longer.
    (2) The owner or operator of each FFV authorized to catch fish 
(Activity Code 1) and that delivers all catches to a processing vessel, 
must maintain only ``SECTION ONE-EFFORT'', of the daily fishing log, 
provided the processing vessel maintains a daily consolidated fishing 
log as described in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.

available to the vessel, either scale round weights or factory weights 
converted to round weights. Entries for daily and cumulative weights of 
discarded or returned fish (disposition ``D'' or ``R'') must be based on 
the most accurate method available to the vessel, either actual count, 
scale round weight, or estimated deck weights. Entries for product 
weights must be based on the number of production units (pans, boxes, 
blocks, trays, cans, or bags) and the average weight of the production 
unit, with reasonable allowances for water added. Allowances for water 
added cannot exceed 5 percent of the unit weight. Product weights cannot 
be based on the commercial or arbitrary wholesale weight of the product, 
but must be based on the total actual weight of the product as 
determined by representative samples.
    (3) The owner or operator must make all entries in indelible ink, 
with corrections to be accomplished by lining out and rewriting, rather 
than erasure.
    (i) Alternative log formats. As an alternative to the use of the 
specific formats provided, a Nation may submit a proposed log format for 
FFV's of that Nation for a general type of fishery operation in a 
fishery (i.e., joint venture operations) to the appropriate Regional 
Administrator and the USCG commander (see tables 1 and 2 to 
Sec. 600.502). With the agreement of the USCG commander, the Regional 
Administrator may authorize the use of that log format for vessels of 
the requesting Nation.

<R05>
Sec. 600.508  Fishing operations.

    (a) Catching. Each FFV authorized for activity code 1 may catch 
fish. An FFV may retain its catch of any species or species group for 
which there is an unfilled national allocation. All fish caught will be 
counted against the national allocation, even if the fish are discarded, 
unless exempted by the regulations of the fishery in which the FFV is 
engaged. Catching operations may be conducted as specified by the 
regulations of the fishery in which the FFV is engaged and as modified 
by the FFV's permit.
    (b) Scouting. Each FFV authorized for Activity Codes 1 through 6 may 
scout for fish. Scouting may be conducted only in the fisheries area 
authorized by the scouting vessel's permit and under such other 
circumstances as may be designated in this subpart or the permit.
    (c) Processing. Each FFV with Activity Code 1 or 2 may process fish. 
Processing may only be conducted whenever and wherever catching 
operations for FFV's of that Nation are permitted, whenever and wherever 
joint venture operations are authorized by an FFV's permit under 
Activity Code 4, and under such other circumstances as may be designated 
in this subpart or the permit.
    (d) Support. Each FFV with Activity Codes 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 may 
support other permitted FFV's. Each FFV with Activity Codes 4 or 6 may 
support U.S. vessels. Support operations may be conducted only in the 
fisheries areas authorized by the supporting vessel's permit, and under 
such other circumstances as may be designated in this subpart or the 
permit.
    (e) Joint ventures. Each FFV with Activity Code 4 in addition to 
Activity Codes 1 or 2 may also conduct operations with U.S. fishing 
vessels. These joint venture operations with U.S. fishing vessels may be 
conducted throughout the EEZ, and under such other circumstances as may 
be designated in these regulations or the permit. FFV's with activity 
code 4 may continue operations assisting U.S. fishing vessels, despite 
closures under Sec. 600.511(a).
    (f) Internal waters. For FFV's authorized under section 306(c) of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act:
    (1) Each FFV may engage in fish processing and support of U.S. 
fishing vessels within the internal waters of that state in compliance 
with terms and conditions set by the authorizing Governor.
    (2) The owner or operator of each FFV must submit weekly reports on

[[Page 61]]

the amount of fish received from vessels of the United States and the 
location(s) where such fish were harvested.
    (i) Reports must include:
    (A) Vessel identification information for the FFV.
    (B) Date of each receipt of fish.
    (C) Amount of fish received, by species.
    (D) Location(s) from which the fish received were harvested and the 
name and official number of the vessel of the United States that 
harvested the fish.
    (ii) Owners or operators of FFV's processing fish in internal waters 
under the provisions of this paragraph (f) must request, from the 
Regional Administrator, the requirements regarding timing and submission 
of the reports, at least 15 days prior to the first receipt of fish from 
a vessel of the United States. The Regional Administrator shall 
stipulate the timing and submission requirements in writing.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 27183, May 19, 1997; 62 
FR 34397, June 26, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 600.509  Prohibited species.

    (a) The owner or operator of each FFV must minimize its catch or 
receipt of prohibited species.
    (b) After allowing for sampling by an observer (if any), the owner 
or operator of each FFV must sort its catch of fish received as soon as 
possible and return all prohibited species and species parts to the sea 
immediately with a minimum of injury, regardless of condition, unless a 
different procedure is specified by the regulations for the fishery in 
which the FFV is engaged. All prohibited species must be recorded in the 
daily fishing log and other fishing logs as specified by the regulations 
for the fishery in which the FFV is engaged.
    (c) All species of fish that an FFV has not been specifically 
allocated or authorized under this subpart to retain, including fish 
caught or received in excess of any allocation or authorization, are 
prohibited species.
    (d) It is a rebuttable presumption that any prohibited species or 
species part found on board an FFV was caught and retained in violation 
of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 600.510  Gear avoidance and disposal.

    (a) Vessel and gear avoidance. (1) FFV's arriving on fishing grounds 
where fishing vessels are already fishing or have set their gear for 
that purpose must ascertain the position and extent of gear already 
placed in the sea and must not place themselves or their fishing gear so 
as to interfere with or obstruct fishing operations already in progress. 
Vessels using mobile gear must avoid fixed fishing gear.
    (2) The operator of each FFV must maintain on its bridge a current 
plot of broadcast fixed-gear locations for the area in which it is 
fishing, as required by the regulations for the fishery in which the FFV 
is engaged.
    (b) Gear conflicts. The operator of each FFV that is involved in a 
conflict or that retrieves the gear of another vessel must immediately 
notify the appropriate USCG commander identified in tables 1 and 2 to 
Sec. 600.502 and request disposal instructions. Each report must 
include:
    (1) The name of the reporting vessel.
    (2) A description of the incident and articles retrieved, including 
the amount, type of gear, condition, and identification markings.
    (3) The location of the incident.
    (4) The date and time of the incident.
    (c) Disposal of fishing gear and other articles. (1) The operator of 
an FFV in the EEZ may not dump overboard, jettison or otherwise discard 
any article or substance that may interfere with other fishing vessels 
or gear, or that may catch fish or cause damage to any marine resource, 
including marine mammals and birds, except in cases of emergency 
involving the safety of the ship or crew, or as specifically authorized 
by communication from the appropriate USCG commander or other authorized 
officer. These articles and substances include, but are not limited to, 
fishing gear, net scraps, bale straps, plastic bags, oil drums, 
petroleum containers, oil, toxic chemicals or any manmade items 
retrieved in an FFV's gear.
    (2) The operator of an FFV may not abandon fishing gear in the EEZ.
    (3) If these articles or substances are encountered, or in the event 
of accidental or emergency placement into the

[[Page 62]]

EEZ, the vessel operator must immediately report the incident to the 
appropriate USCG Commander indicated in tables 1 and 2 to Sec. 600.502, 
and give the information required in paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 600.511  Fishery closure procedures.

    (a) Activity Codes 1 and 2 for a fishery are automatically canceled 
in the following cases, unless otherwise specified by regulations 
specific to a fishery, when--
    (1) The OY for any allocated species or species group has been 
reached in that fishery;
    (2) The TALFF or catch allowance for any allocated species or 
species group has been reached in that fishery;
    (3) The foreign nation's allocation for any allocated species or 
species group has been reached; or
    (4) The letter of credit required in Sec. 600.518(b)(2) is not 
established and maintained.
    (b) Activity Code 4 is automatically canceled when--
    (1) The OY for a species with a JVP amount is reached;
    (2) The JVP amount for a species or species group is reached; or
    (3) The letter of credit required in Sec. 600.518(b)(2) is not 
established and maintained.
    (c) Notification. (1) The Regional Administrator is authorized to 
close a fishery on behalf of NMFS. The Regional Administrator will 
notify each FFV's designated representative of closures.
    (2) If possible, notice will be given 48 hours before the closure. 
However, each Nation and the owners and operators of all FFV's of that 
Nation are responsible for ending fishing operations when an allocation 
is reached.
    (d) Catch reconciliation. Vessel activity reports, U.S. surveillance 
observations, observer reports, and foreign catch and effort reports 
will be used to make the determination listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section. If NMFS estimates of catch or other values made during 
the season differ from those reported by the foreign fleets, efforts may 
be initiated by the designated representative of each Nation to resolve 
such differences with NMFS. If, however, differences still persist after 
such efforts have been made, NMFS estimates will be the basis for 
decisions and will prevail.
    (e) Duration. Any closure under this section will remain in effect 
until an applicable new or increased allocation or JVP becomes available 
or the letter of credit required by Sec. 600.518(b)(2) is reestablished.

<R05>
Sec. 600.512  Scientific research.

    (a) Scientific research activity. Persons planning to conduct 
scientific research activities in the EEZ that may be confused with 
fishing are encouraged to submit to the appropriate Regional 
Administrator, Director, or designee, 60 days or as soon as practicable 
prior to its start, a scientific research plan for each scientific 
cruise. The Regional Administrator, Director, or designee will 
acknowledge notification of scientific research activity by issuing to 
the operator or master of that vessel, or to the sponsoring institution, 
a letter of acknowledgment. This letter of acknowledgment is separate 
and distinct from any permit required under any other applicable law. If 
the Regional Administrator, Director, or designee, after review of a 
research plan, determines that it does not constitute scientific 
research activity, but rather fishing, the Regional Administrator, 
Director, or designee will inform the applicant as soon as practicable 
and in writing. The Regional Administrator, Director, or designee may 
also make recommendations to revise the research plan to make the cruise 
acceptable as scientific research activity. In order to facilitate 
identification of activity as scientific research, persons conducting 
scientific research activities are advised to carry a copy of the 
scientific research plan and the letter of acknowledgment on board the 
scientific research vessel. Activities conducted in accordance with a 
scientific research plan acknowledged by such a letter are presumed to 
be scientific research activities. The presumption may be overcome by 
showing that an activity does not fit the definition of scientific 
research activity or is outside the scope of the scientific research 
plan.

[[Page 63]]

    (b) Reports. Persons conducting scientific research are requested to 
submit a copy of any cruise report or other publication created as a 
result of the cruise, including the amount, composition, and disposition 
of their catch, to the appropriate Science and Research Director.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 7075, Feb. 12, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 600.513  Recreational fishing.

    (a) Foreign vessels conducting recreational fishing must comply only 
with this section, and Secs. 600.10, 600.504(a)(1), and 600.505 (as 
applicable). Such vessels may conduct recreational fishing within the 
EEZ and within the boundaries of a state. Any fish caught may not be 
sold, bartered, or traded.
    (b) The owners or operator and any other person aboard any foreign 
vessel conducting recreational fishing must comply with any Federal laws 
or regulations applicable to the domestic fishery while in the EEZ, and 
any state laws or regulations applicable while in state waters.


<R05>
Sec. 600.514  Relation to other laws.

    (a) Persons affected by these regulations should be aware that other 
Federal and state statutes may apply to their activities.
    (b) Fishing vessel operators must exercise due care in the conduct 
of fishing activities near submarine cables. Damage to submarine cables 
resulting from intentional acts or from the failure to exercise due care 
in the conduct of fishing operations subjects the fishing vessel 
operator to enforcement action under the International Convention for 
the Protection of Submarine Cables, and to the criminal penalties 
prescribed by the Submarine Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 21) and other laws that 
implement that Convention. Fishing vessel operators also should be aware 
that the Submarine Cable Act prohibits fishing operations at a distance 
of less than 1 nautical mile (1.85 km) from a vessel engaged in laying 
or repairing a submarine cable; or at a distance of less than 0.25 
nautical mile (0.46 km) from a buoy or buoys intended to mark the 
position of a cable when being laid, or when out of order, or broken.


<R05>
Sec. 600.515  Interpretation of 16 U.S.C. 1857(4).

    Section 307(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act prohibits any fishing 
vessel other than a vessel of the United States (foreign fishing vessel) 
from operating in the EEZ if all of the fishing gear on board the vessel 
is not stowed in compliance with that section ``unless such vessel is 
authorized to engage in fishing in the area in which the vessel is 
operating.'' If such a vessel has a permit authorization that is limited 
to fishing activities other than catching, taking or harvesting (such as 
support, scouting or processing activities), it must have all of its 
fishing gear stowed at all times while it is in the EEZ. If such a 
vessel has a permit authorization to engage in catching, taking or 
harvesting activities, but such authorization is limited to a specific 
area within the EEZ, and/or to a specific period of time, the vessel 
must have all of its fishing gear stowed while it is in the EEZ, except 
when it is in the specific area authorized, and/or during the specific 
period of time authorized.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 7075, Feb. 12, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 600.516  Total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF).

    (a) The TALFF, if any, with respect to any fishery subject to the 
exclusive fishery management authority of the United States, is that 
portion of the OY of such fishery that will not be caught by vessels of 
the United States.
    (b) Each specification of OY and each assessment of the anticipated 
U.S. harvest will be reviewed during each fishing season. Adjustments to 
TALFF's will be made based on updated information relating to status of 
stocks, estimated and actual performance of domestic and foreign fleets, 
and other relevant factors.
    (c) Specifications of OY and the initial estimates of U.S. harvests 
and TALFF's at the beginning of the relevant fishing year will be 
published in the Federal Register. Adjustments to those numbers will be 
published in the Federal Register upon occasion or as directed by 
regulations implementing FMPs. For current apportionments,

[[Page 64]]

contact the appropriate Regional Administrator or the Director.

<R05>
Sec. 600.517  Allocations.

    The Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, 
determines the allocation among foreign nations of fish species and 
species groups. The Secretary of State officially notifies each foreign 
nation of its allocation. The burden of ascertaining and accurately 
transmitting current allocations and status of harvest of an applicable 
allocation to fishing vessels is upon the foreign nation and the owner 
or operator of the FFV.


<R05>
Sec. 600.518  Fee schedule for foreign fishing.

    (a) Permit application fees. Each vessel permit application 
submitted under Sec. 600.501 must be accompanied by a fee of $354 per 
vessel, plus the surcharge, if required under paragraph (e) of this 
section, rounded to the nearest dollar. At the time the application is 
submitted to the DOS, a check for the fees, drawn on a U.S. bank, made 
out to ``Department of Commerce, NOAA,'' must be sent to the Director. 
The permit fee payment must be accompanied by a list of the vessels for 
which the payment is made.
    (b) Poundage fees--(1) Rates. If a Nation chooses to accept an 
allocation, poundage fees must be paid at the rate specified in the 
following table, plus the surcharge required by paragraph (c) of this 
section.

  2. Hake, red...............................................     163.97
  3. Hake, silver............................................     174.63
  4. Herring.................................................      61.76

  7. Squid, Illex............................................     103.98
  8. Squid, Loligo...........................................     245.73
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Method of payment of poundage fees, surcharges and observer 
fees. (i) If a Nation chooses to accept an allocation, a revolving 
letter of credit (L/C) must be established and maintained to cover the 
poundage fees for at least 25 percent of the previous year's total 
allocations at the rate in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or as 
determined by the Assistant Administrator, plus the surcharges and 
observer fees required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The L/
C must--
    (A) Be irrevocable.
    (B) Be with a bank subscribing to ICC Pub. 290.
    (C) Designate ``Department of Commerce, NOAA'' as beneficiary;
    (D) Allow partial withdrawals.
    (E) Be confirmed by a U.S. bank.
    (ii) The customer must pay all commissions, transmission, and 
service charges. No fishing will be allowed until the L/C is 
established, and authorized written notice of its issuance is provided 
to the Assistant Administrator.
    (3) Assessment of poundage fees. Poundage fees will be assessed 
quarterly for the actual catch during January through March, April 
through June, July through September, and October through December. The 
appropriate Regional Administrator will reconcile catch figures with 
each country following the procedures of Sec. 600.511(d). When the catch 
figures are agreed upon, NOAA will present a bill for collection as the 
documentary demand for payment to the confirming bank. If, after 45 days 
from the end of the quarter, catches have not been reconciled, the 
estimate of the Regional Administrator will stand and a bill will be 
issued for that amount. If necessary, the catch figures may be refined 
by the Regional Administrator during the next 60 days, and any 
modifications will be reflected in the next quarter's bill.
    (c) Surcharges. The owner or operator of each foreign vessel who 
accepts and pays permit application or poundage fees under paragraph (a) 
or (b) of this section must also pay a surcharge. The Assistant 
Administrator may reduce or waive the surcharge if it is determined that 
the Fishing Vessel and Gear Damage Compensation Fund is capitalized 
sufficiently. The Assistant Administrator also may increase the 
surcharge during the year to a maximum level of

[[Page 65]]

20 percent, if needed, to maintain capitalization of the fund. The 
Assistant Administrator has effectively waived the surcharge until 
further notice.
    (d) Observer fees. The Assistant Administrator will notify the 
owners or operators of FFV's of the estimated annual costs of placing 
observers aboard their vessels. The owners or operators of any such 
vessel must provide for repayment of those costs by including one-fourth 
of the estimated annual observer fee as determined by the Assistant 
Administrator in a L/C as prescribed in Sec. 600.518(b)(2). During the 
fiscal year, payment will be withdrawn from the L/C as required to cover 
anticipated observer coverage for the upcoming fishery. The Assistant 
Administrator will reconcile any differences between the estimated cost 
and actual costs of observer coverage within 90 days after the end of 
the fiscal year.
    (e) Financial assurances. (1) A foreign nation, or the owners and 
operators of certain vessels of that foreign nation, may be required by 
the Assistant Administrator to provide financial assurances. Such 
assurances may be required if--
    (i) Civil and criminal penalties assessed against fishing vessels of 
the Nation have not effectively deterred violations;
    (ii) Vessels of that Nation have engaged in fishing in the EEZ 
without proper authorization to conduct such activities;
    (iii) The Nation's vessel owners have refused to answer 
administrative charges or summons to appear in court; or
    (iv) Enforcement of Magnuson-Stevens Act civil or criminal judgments 
in the courts of a foreign nation is unattainable.
    (2) The level of financial assurances will be guided by the level of 
penalties assessed and costs to the U.S. Government.

<R05>
Sec. 600.520  Northwest Atlantic Ocean fishery.

    (a) Purpose. Sections 600.520 and 600.525 regulate all foreign 
fishing conducted under a GIFA within the EEZ in the Atlantic Ocean 
north of 35 deg.00' N. lat.
    (b) Authorized fishery--(1) Allocations. Foreign vessels may engage 
in fishing only in accordance with applicable national allocations.
    (2) Time and area restrictions. (i) Fishing, including processing, 
scouting, and support of foreign or U.S. vessels, is prohibited south of 
35 deg.00' N. lat., and north and east of a line beginning at the shore 
at 44 deg.22' N. lat., 67 deg.52' W. long. and intersecting the boundary 
of the EEZ at 44 deg.11'12" N. lat., 67 deg.16'46" W. long.
    (ii) The Regional Administrator will consult with the Council prior 
to giving notice of any area or time restriction. NMFS will also consult 
with the USCG if the restriction is proposed to reduce gear conflicts. 
If NMFS determines after such consultation that the restriction appears 
to be appropriate, NMFS will publish the proposed restriction in the 
Federal Register, together with a summary of the information on which 
the restriction is based. Following a 30-day comment period, NMFS will 
publish a final action.
    (iii) The Regional Administrator may rescind any restriction if he/
she determines that the basis for the restriction no longer exists.
    (iv) Any notice of restriction shall operate as a condition imposed 
on the permit issued to the foreign vessels involved in the fishery.
    (3) TALFF. The TALFFs for the fisheries of the Northwest Atlantic 
Ocean are published in the Federal Register. Current TALFFs are also 
available from the Regional Administrator.
    (4) Species definitions. The category ``other finfish'' used in 
TALFFs and in allocations includes all species except:
    (i) The other allocated species, namely: Short-finned squid, long-
finned squid, Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, river herring 
(includes alewife, blueback herring, and hickory shad), and butterfish.
    (ii) The prohibited species, namely: American plaice, American shad, 
Atlantic cod, Atlantic menhaden, Atlantic redfish, Atlantic salmon, all 
marlin, all spearfish, sailfish, swordfish, black sea bass, bluefish, 
croaker, haddock, ocean pout, pollock, red hake, scup, sea turtles, 
sharks (except

[[Page 66]]

dogfish), silver hake, spot, striped bass, summer flounder, tilefish, 
yellowtail flounder, weakfish, white hake, windowpane flounder, winter 
flounder, witch flounder, Continental Shelf fishery resources, and other 
invertebrates (except nonallocated squids).
    (5) Closures. The taking of any species for which a Nation has an 
allocation is permitted, provided that:
    (i) The vessels of the foreign nation have not caught the allocation 
of that Nation for any species or species group (e.g., ``other 
finfish''). When vessels of a foreign nation have caught an applicable 
allocation of any species, all further fishing other than scouting, 
processing, or support by vessels of that Nation must cease, even if 
other allocations have not been reached. Therefore, it is essential that 
foreign nations plan their fishing strategy to ensure that the reaching 
of an allocation for one species does not result in the premature 
closing of a Nation's fishery for other allocated species.
    (ii) The fishery has not been closed for other reasons under 
Sec. 600.511.
    (6) Allocation utilization. Foreign fishing vessels may elect to 
retain or discard allocated species; however, the computation of 
allocation utilization and fee refunds will be based on the total 
quantity of that species that was caught. Prohibited species must always 
be returned to the sea as required under Sec. 600.509.
    (c) Fishing areas. For the purposes of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean 
fishery, fishing areas are that portion of the EEZ shown inside the 
boundaries of the ``three digit statistical areas'' described in Figure 
1 to this section.

<R05>
Sec. 600.525  Atlantic herring fishery.

    (a) Initial specifications. The initial specifications of OY, DAH, 
DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserve (if any) have been established by the PMP 
for Atlantic herring approved on July 6, 1995. These annual 
specifications will remain in effect unless adjusted pursuant to the 
provisions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Procedures to adjust initial specifications. NMFS may adjust 
these initial specifications upward or downward to produce the greatest 
overall benefit to the United States at any time prior to or during the 
fishing years for which the initial specifications are set by publishing 
notification in the Federal Register with the reasons for such 
adjustments. Any notice of adjustment may provide for public comment. 
Adjustments to the initial specifications may take into account the 
following information:
    (1) The estimated domestic processing capacity and extent to which 
it will be used.;
    (2) Landings and catch statistics.;
    (3) Stock assessments.
    (4) Relevant scientific information.


<R04>
      Subpart G--Preemption of State Authority Under Section 306(b)


<R05>
Sec. 600.605  General policy.

    It is the policy of the Secretary that preemption proceedings will 
be conducted expeditiously. The administrative law judge and counsel or 
other representative for each party are encouraged to make every effort 
at each stage of the proceedings to avoid delay.


<R05>
Sec. 600.610  Factual findings for Federal preemption.

    (a) The two factual findings for Federal preemption of state 
management authority over a fishery are:
    (1) The fishing in a fishery that is covered by an FMP implemented 
under the Magnuson-Stevens Act is engaged in predominately within the 
EEZ and beyond such zone.
    (2) A state has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, the 
results of which will substantially and adversely affect the carrying 
out of such FMP.
    (b) Whether fishing is engaged in ``predominately'' within or beyond 
the EEZ will be determined after consideration of relevant factors, 
including but not limited to, the catch (based on numbers, value, or 
weight of fish caught, or other relevant factors) or fishing effort 
during the appropriate period, and in light of historical patterns of 
the distribution of catch or fishing effort for such stock or stocks of 
fish.
    (c) Whether relevant effects are substantial will be determined 
after consideration of the magnitude of such actual or potential 
effects. Relevant to this determination are various factors, including 
but not limited to, the proportion of the fishery (stock or stocks of 
fish and fishing for such stocks) that is subject to the effects of a 
particular state's action or omission, the characteristics and status 
(including migratory patterns and biological condition) of the stock or 
stocks of fish in the fishery, and the similarity or dissimilarity 
between the goals, objectives, or policies of the state's action or 
omission and the management goals or objectives specified in the FMP for 
the fishery or between the state and Federal conservation and management 
measures of the fishery.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 7075, Feb. 12, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 600.615  Commencement of proceedings.

    (a) Notice of proposed preemption. (1) If a proceeding under this 
part is deemed necessary, the Administrator must issue a notice of 
proposed preemption to the Attorney General of the State or States 
concerned. The notice will contain:
    (i) A recital of the legal authority and jurisdiction for 
instituting the proceeding.
    (ii) A concise statement of the Sec. 600.610 factual findings for 
Federal preemption upon which the notice is based.
    (iii) The time, place, and date of the hearing.

[[Page 69]]

    (2) The notice of proposed preemption will also be published in the 
Federal Register. This notification may be combined with any notice of 
proposed rulemaking published under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (b) Response. The state will have the opportunity to respond in 
writing to the notice of proposed preemption.
    (c) Amendment. The Administrator may, at any time prior to the 
Secretary's decision, withdraw the notice of proposed preemption. Upon 
motion of either party before the record is closed, the administrative 
law judge may amend the notice of proposed preemption.
    (d) Proposed regulations--(1) In general. If additional regulations 
are required to govern fishing within the boundaries of a state, the 
Administrator may publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register 
concurrently with issuing the notification indicated in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (2) Emergency actions. Nothing in this section will prevent the 
Secretary from taking emergency action under section 305(c) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 7075, Feb. 12, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 600.620  Rules pertaining to the hearing.

    (a) The civil procedure rules of the NOAA currently set forth in 15 
CFR part 904, subpart C (or as subsequently amended), apply to the 
proceeding after its commencement by service of notice (pursuant to 
Sec. 600.615) and prior to the Secretary's decision (Sec. 600.625), 
except that the following sections will not apply:
    (1) 15 CFR 904.201 (Definitions);
    (2) 15 CFR 904.206(a)(1) (Duties and powers of Judge); and
    (3) 15 CFR 904.272 (Administrative review of decision).
    (b) Additional duties and powers of judge--(1) Time periods. The 
administrative law judge is authorized to modify all time periods 
pertaining to the course of the hearing (under Secs. 600.615 and 
600.620) to expedite the proceedings, upon application and appropriate 
showing of need or emergency circumstances by a party.
    (2) Intervention. Intervention by persons not parties is not 
allowed.


<R05>
Sec. 600.625  Secretary's decision.

    (a) The Secretary will, on the basis of the hearing, record the 
administrative law judge's recommended decision:
    (1) Accept or reject any of the findings or conclusions of the 
administrative law judge and decide whether the factual findings exist 
for Federal preemption of a state's authority within its boundaries 
(other than in its internal waters) with respect to the fishery in 
question;
    (2) Reserve decision on the merits or withdraw the notice of 
proposed preemption; or
    (3) Remand the case to the administrative law judge for further 
proceedings as may be appropriate, along with a statement of reasons for 
the remand.
    (b) Notification. (1) If the factual findings for Federal preemption 
are determined to exist, the Secretary will notify in writing the 
Attorney General of that state and the appropriate Council(s) of the 
preemption of that state's authority. The Secretary will also direct the 
Administrator to promulgate appropriate regulations proposed under 
Sec. 600.615(d) and otherwise to begin regulating the fishery within the 
state's boundaries (other than in its internal waters).
    (2) If the factual findings for Federal preemption are determined 
not to exist, the Secretary will notify, in writing, the Attorney 
General of the state and the appropriate Council(s) of that 
determination. The Secretary will also direct the Administrator to issue 
a notice withdrawing any regulations proposed under Sec. 600.615(d).


<R05>
Sec. 600.630  Application for reinstatement of state authority.

    (a) Application or notice. (1) At any time after the promulgation of 
regulations under Sec. 600.625(b)(1) to regulate a fishery within a 
state's boundaries, the affected state may apply to the Secretary for 
reinstatement of state authority. The Secretary may also serve upon such 
state a notice of intent to terminate such Federal regulation. A state's 
application must include a clear and concise statement of:
    (i) The action taken by the State to correct the action or omission 
found to have substantially and adversely affected the carrying out of 
the FMP; or

[[Page 70]]

    (ii) Any changed circumstances that affect the relationship of the 
state's action or omission to take action to the carrying out of the FMP 
(including any amendment to such plan); and
    (iii) Any laws, regulations, or other materials that the state 
believes support the application.
    (2) Any such application received by the Secretary or notice issued 
to the State will be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Informal response. The Secretary has sole discretion to accept 
or reject the application or response. If the Secretary accepts the 
application or rejects any responses and finds that the reasons for 
regulation of the fishery within the boundaries of the state no longer 
prevail, the Secretary will promptly terminate such regulation and 
publish in the Federal Register any regulatory amendments necessary to 
accomplish that end.
    (c) Hearing. The Secretary has sole discretion to direct the 
Administrator to schedule hearings for the receipt of evidence by an 
administrative law judge. Hearings before the administrative law judge 
to receive such evidence will be conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 600.620. Upon conclusion of such hearings, the administrative law 
judge will certify the record and a recommended decision to the 
Secretary. If the Secretary, upon consideration of the state's 
application or any response to the notice published under 
Sec. 600.630(a)(2), the hearing record, the recommended decision, and 
any other relevant materials finds that the reasons for regulation of 
the fishery within the boundaries of the state no longer prevail, the 
Secretary will promptly terminate such regulation and publish in the 
Federal Register any regulatory amendments necessary to accomplish that 
end.


<R04>
          Subpart H--General Provisions for Domestic Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 600.705  Relation to other laws.

    (a) General. Persons affected by these regulations should be aware 
that other Federal and state statutes and regulations may apply to their 
activities. Vessel operators may wish to refer to USCG regulations found 
in the Code of Federal Regulations title 33--Navigation and Navigable 
Waters and 46--Shipping; 15 CFR part 904, subpart D--Permit Sanctions 
and Denials; and title 43--Public Lands (in regard to marine 
sanctuaries).
    (b) State responsibilities. Certain responsibilities relating to 
data collection and enforcement may be performed by authorized state 
personnel under a state/Federal agreement for data collection and a 
tripartite agreement among the state, the USCG, and the Secretary for 
enforcement.
    (c) Submarine cables. Fishing vessel operators must exercise due 
care in the conduct of fishing activities near submarine cables. Damage 
to the submarine cables resulting from intentional acts or from the 
failure to exercise due care in the conduct of fishing operations 
subjects the fishing vessel operator to the criminal penalties 
prescribed by the Submarine Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 21) which implements 
the International Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables. 
Fishing vessel operators also should be aware that the Submarine Cable 
Act prohibits fishing operations at a distance of less than 1 nautical 
mile (1.85 km) from a vessel engaged in laying or repairing a submarine 
cable; or at a distance of less than 0.25 nautical mile (0.46 km) from a 
buoy or buoys intended to mark the position of a cable when being laid 
or when out of order or broken.
    (d) Marine mammals. Regulations governing exemption permits and the 
recordkeeping and reporting of the incidental take of marine mammals are 
set forth in part 229 of this title.
    (e) Halibut fishing. Fishing for halibut is governed by regulations 
of the International Pacific Halibut Commission set forth at part 300 of 
this title.
    (f) Marine sanctuaries. All fishing activity, regardless of species 
sought, is prohibited under 15 CFR part 924 in the U.S.S. Monitor Marine 
Sanctuary, which is located approximately 15 miles southwest of Cape 
Hatteras off the coast of North Carolina.

receipt by such vessel of U.S.- harvested fish.
    (c) Fail to comply immediately with enforcement and boarding 
procedures specified in Sec. 600.730.
    (d) Refuse to allow an authorized officer to board a fishing vessel

    (e) Dispose of fish or parts thereof or other matter in any manner, 
after any communication or signal from an authorized officer, or after 
the approach by an authorized officer or an enforcement vessel or 
aircraft.
    (f) Assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, threaten, or 
interfere with any authorized officer in the conduct of any search, 
inspection, or seizure in connection with enforcement of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act or any other statute administered by NOAA.
    (g) Interfere with, delay, or prevent by any means, the apprehension 
of another person, knowing that such person has committed any act 
prohibited by the Magnuson-Stevens Act or any other statute administered 
by NOAA.
    (h) Resist a lawful arrest for any act prohibited under the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act or any other statute administered by NOAA.
    (i) Make any false statement, oral or written, to an authorized 
officer concerning the taking, catching, harvesting, landing, purchase, 
sale, offer of sale, possession, transport, import, export, or transfer 
of any fish, or attempts to do any of the above.
    (j) Interfere with, obstruct, delay, or prevent by any means an 
investigation, search, seizure, or disposition of seized property in 
connection with enforcement of the Magnuson-Stevens Act or any other 
statute administered by NOAA.
    (k) Fish in violation of the terms or conditions of any permit or 
authorization issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act or any other statute 
administered by NOAA.
    (l) Fail to report catches as required while fishing pursuant to an 
exempted fishing permit.
    (m) On a scientific research vessel, engage in fishing other than 
recreational fishing authorized by applicable state or Federal 
regulations.
    (n) Trade, barter, or sell; or attempt to trade, barter, or sell 
fish possessed or retained while fishing pursuant to an authorization 
for an exempted educational activity.
    (o) Harass or sexually harass an authorized officer or an observer.
    (p) Fail to submit to a USCG safety examination when required by 
NMFS pursuant to Sec. 600.746.
    (q) Fail to display a Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Examination 
decal or a valid certificate of compliance or inspection pursuant to 
Sec. 600.746.
    (r) Fail to provide to an observer, a NMFS employee, or a designated 
observer provider information that has been requested pursuant to 
Sec. 600.746, or

[[Page 72]]

fail to allow an observer, a NMFS employee, or a designated observer 
provider to inspect any item described at Sec. 600.746.
    (s) Fish without an observer when the vessel is required to carry an 
observer.
    (t) Assault, oppose, impede, intimidate, or interfere with a NMFS-
approved observer aboard a vessel.
    (u) Prohibit or bar by command, impediment, threat, coercion, or 
refusal of reasonable assistance, an observer from conducting his or her 
duties aboard a vessel.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 7075, Feb. 12, 1998; 63 
FR 27217; May 18, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 600.730  Facilitation of enforcement.

    (a) General. The operator of, or any other person aboard, any 
fishing vessel subject to parts 622 through 699 of this chapter must 
immediately comply with instructions and signals issued by an authorized 
officer to stop the vessel and with instructions to facilitate safe 
boarding and inspection of the vessel, its gear, equipment, fishing 
record (where applicable), and catch for purposes of enforcing the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act or any other statute administered by NOAA and this 
chapter.
    (b) Communications. (1) Upon being approached by a USCG vessel or 
aircraft, or other vessel or aircraft with an authorized officer aboard, 
the operator of a fishing vessel must be alert for communications 
conveying enforcement instructions.
    (2) VHF-FM radiotelephone is the preferred method for communicating 
between vessels. If the size of the vessel and the wind, sea, and 
visibility conditions allow, a loudhailer may be used instead of the 
radio. Hand signals, placards, high frequency radiotelephone, or voice 
may be employed by an authorized officer, and message blocks may be 
dropped from an aircraft.
    (3) If other communications are not practicable, visual signals may 
be transmitted by flashing light directed at the vessel signaled. USCG 
units will normally use the flashing light signal ``L'' as the signal to 
stop. In the International Code of Signals, ``L'' (.-..) means ``you 
should stop your vessel instantly.'' (Period (.) means a short flash of 
light; dash (-) means a long flash of light.)
    (4) Failure of a vessel's operator promptly to stop the vessel when 
directed to do so by an authorized officer using loudhailer, 
radiotelephone, flashing light signal, or other means constitutes prima 
facie evidence of the offense of refusal to permit an authorized officer 
to board.
    (5) The operator of a vessel who does not understand a signal from 
an enforcement unit and who is unable to obtain clarification by 
loudhailer or radiotelephone must consider the signal to be a command to 
stop the vessel instantly.
    (c) Boarding. The operator of a vessel directed to stop must:
    (1) Guard Channel 16, VHF-FM, if so equipped.
    (2) Stop immediately and lay to or maneuver in such a way as to 
allow the authorized officer and his/her party to come aboard.
    (3) Except for those vessels with a freeboard of 4 ft (1.2 m) or 
less, provide a safe ladder, if needed, for the authorized officer and 
his/her party to come aboard.
    (4) When necessary to facilitate the boarding or when requested by 
an authorized officer or observer, provide a manrope or safety line, and 
illumination for the ladder.
    (5) Take such other actions as necessary to facilitate boarding and 
to ensure the safety of the authorized officer and the boarding party.
    (d) Signals. The following signals, extracted from the International 
Code of Signals, may be sent by flashing light by an enforcement unit 
when conditions do not allow communications by loudhailer or 
radiotelephone. Knowledge of these signals by vessel operators is not 
required. However, knowledge of these signals and appropriate action by 
a vessel operator may preclude the necessity of sending the signal ``L'' 
and the necessity for the vessel to stop instantly. (Period (.) means a 
short flash of light; dash (-) means a long flash of light.)
    (1) ``AA'' repeated (.-.-) is the call to an unknown station. The 
operator of the signaled vessel should respond by

[[Page 73]]

identifying the vessel by radiotelephone or by illuminating the vessel's 
identification.
    (2) ``RY-CY'' (.-. -.-- -.-. -.--) means ``you should proceed at 
slow speed, a boat is coming to you.'' This signal is normally employed 
when conditions allow an enforcement boarding without the necessity of 
the vessel being boarded coming to a complete stop, or, in some cases, 
without retrieval of fishing gear which may be in the water.
    (3) ``SQ3'' (... --.- ...--) means ``you should stop or heave to; I 
am going to board you.''

Sec. 600.735  Penalties.

    Any person committing, or fishing vessel used in the commission of a 
violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act or any other statute administered 
by NOAA and/or any regulation issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, is 
subject to the civil and criminal penalty provisions and civil 
forfeiture provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, to this section, to 
15 CFR part 904 (Civil Procedures), and to other applicable law.

[61 FR 32540, June 24, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 7075, Feb. 12, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 600.740  Enforcement policy.

    (a) The Magnuson-Stevens Act provides four basic enforcement 
remedies for violations, in ascending order of severity, as follows:
    (1) Issuance of a citation (a type of warning), usually at the scene 
of the offense (see 15 CFR part 904, subpart E).
    (2) Assessment by the Administrator of a civil money penalty.
    (3) For certain violations, judicial forfeiture action against the 
vessel and its catch.
    (4) Criminal prosecution of the owner or operator for some offenses. 
It shall be the policy of NMFS to enforce vigorously and equitably the 
provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act by utilizing that form or 
combination of authorized remedies best suited in a particular case to 
this end.
    (b) Processing a case under one remedial form usually means that 
other remedies are inappropriate in that case. However, further 
investigation or later review may indicate the case to be either more or 
less serious than initially considered, or may otherwise reveal that the 
penalty first pursued is inadequate to serve the purposes of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act. Under such circumstances, the Agency may pursue 
other remedies either in lieu of or in addition to the action originally 
taken. Forfeiture of the illegal catch does not fall within this general 
rule and is considered in most cases as only the initial step in 
remedying a violation by removing the ill-gotten gains of the offense.
    (c) If a fishing vessel for which a permit has been issued under the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act is used in the commission of an offense prohibited 
by section 307 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NOAA may impose permit 
sanctions, whether or not civil or criminal action has been undertaken 
against the vessel or its owner or operator. In some cases, the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act requires permit sanctions following the assessment 
of a civil penalty or the imposition of a criminal fine. In sum, the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act treats sanctions against the fishing vessel permit 
to be the carrying out of a purpose separate from that accomplished by 
civil and criminal penalties against the vessel or its owner or 
operator.

<R05>
Sec. 600.745  Scientific research activity, exempted fishing, and exempted educational activity.

    (a) Scientific research activity. Nothing in this section is 
intended to inhibit or prevent any scientific research activity 
conducted by a scientific research vessel. Persons planning to conduct 
scientific research activities in the EEZ are encouraged to submit to 
the appropriate Regional Administrator, Director, or designee, 60 days 
or as soon as practicable prior to its start, a scientific research plan 
for each scientific cruise. The Regional Administrator, Director, or 
designee will acknowledge notification of scientific research activity 
by issuing to the operator or

[[Page 74]]

master of that vessel, or to the sponsoring institution, a letter of 
acknowledgment. This letter of acknowledgment is separate and distinct 
from any permit required by any other applicable law. If the Regional 
Administrator, Director, or designee, after review of a research plan, 
determines that it does not constitute scientific research but rather 
fishing, the Regional Administrator, Director, or designee will inform 
the applicant as soon as practicable and in writing. The Regional 
Administrator, Director, or designee may also make recommendations to 
revise the research plan to make the cruise acceptable as scientific 
research activity or recommend the applicant request an EFP. In order to 
facilitate identification of activity as scientific research, persons 
conducting scientific research activities are advised to carry a copy of 
the scientific research plan and the letter of acknowledgment on board 
the scientific research vessel. Activities conducted in accordance with 
a scientific research plan acknowledged by such a letter are presumed to 
be scientific research activity. The presumption may be overcome by 
showing that an activity does not fit the definition of scientific 
research activity or is outside the scope of the scientific research 
plan.
    (b) Exempted fishing.--(1) General. A NMFS Regional Administrator or 
Director may authorize, for limited testing, public display, data 
collection, exploratory, health and safety, environmental cleanup, and/
or hazard removal purposes, the target or incidental harvest of species 
managed under an FMP or fishery regulations that would otherwise be 
prohibited. Exempted fishing may not be conducted unless authorized by 
an EFP issued by a Regional Administrator or Director in accordance with 
the criteria and procedures specified in this section. The Regional 
Administrator or Director may charge a fee to recover the administrative 
expenses of issuing an EFP. The amount of the fee will be calculated, at 
least annually, in accordance with procedures of the NOAA Handbook for 
determining administrative costs of each special product or service; the 
fee may not exceed such costs. Persons may contact the appropriate 
Regional Administrator or Director to find out the applicable fee.
    (2) Application. An applicant for an EFP shall submit a completed 
application package to the appropriate Regional Administrator or 
Director, as soon as practicable and at least 60 days before the desired 
effective date of the EFP. Submission of an EFP application less than 60 
days before the desired effective date of the EFP may result in a 
delayed effective date because of review requirements. The application 
package must include payment of any required fee as specified by 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and a written application that 
includes, but is not limited to, the following information:
    (i) The date of the application.
    (ii) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.
    (iii) A statement of the purposes and goals of the exempted fishery 
for which an EFP is needed, including justification for issuance of the 
EFP.
    (iv) For each vessel to be covered by the EFP, as soon as the 
information is available and before operations begin under the EFP:
    (A) A copy of the USCG documentation, state license, or registration 
of each vessel, or the information contained on the appropriate 
document.
    (B) The current name, address, and telephone number of the owner and 
master, if not included on the document provided for the vessel.
    (v) The species (target and incidental) expected to be harvested 
under the EFP, the amount(s) of such harvest necessary to conduct the 
exempted fishing, the arrangements for disposition of all regulated 
species harvested under the EFP, and any anticipated impacts on marine 
mammals or endangered species.
    (vi) For each vessel covered by the EFP, the approximate time(s) and 
place(s) fishing will take place, and the type, size, and amount of gear 
to be used.
    (vii) The signature of the applicant.
    (viii) The Regional Administrator or Director, as appropriate, may 
request from an applicant additional information necessary to make the 
determinations required under this section. An

[[Page 75]]

incomplete application or an application for which the appropriate fee 
has not been paid will not be considered until corrected in writing and 
the fee paid. An applicant for an EFP need not be the owner or operator 
of the vessel(s) for which the EFP is requested.
    (3) Issuance. (i) The Regional Administrator or Director, as 
appropriate, will review each application and will make a preliminary 
determination whether the application contains all of the required 
information and constitutes an activity appropriate for further 
consideration. If the Regional Administrator or Director finds that any 
application does not warrant further consideration, both the applicant 
and the affected Council(s) will be notified in writing of the reasons 
for the decision. If the Regional Administrator or Director determines 
that any application warrants further consideration, notification of 
receipt of the application will be published in the Federal Register 
with a brief description of the proposal, and the intent of NMFS to 
issue an EFP. Interested persons will be given a 15- to 45-day 
opportunity to comment and/or comments will be requested during public 
testimony at a Council meeting. The notification may establish a cut-off 
date for receipt of additional applications to participate in the same, 
or a similar, exempted fishing activity. The Regional Administrator or 
Director also will forward copies of the application to the Council(s), 
the USCG, and the appropriate fishery management agencies of affected 
states, accompanied by the following information:
    (A) The effect of the proposed EFP on the target and incidental 
species, including the effect on any TAC.
    (B) A citation of the regulation or regulations that, without the 
EFP, would prohibit the proposed activity.
    (C) Biological information relevant to the proposal, including 
appropriate statements of environmental impacts, including impacts on 
marine mammals and threatened or endangered species.
    (ii) If the application is complete and warrants additional 
consultation, the Regional Administrator or Director may consult with 
the appropriate Council(s) concerning the permit application during the 
period in which comments have been requested. The Council(s) or the 
Administrator or Regional Administrator shall notify the applicant in 
advance of any meeting at which the application will be considered, and 
offer the applicant the opportunity to appear in support of the 
application.
    (iii) As soon as practicable after receiving responses from the 
agencies identified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, and/or after 
the consultation, if any, described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section, the Regional Administrator or Director shall notify the 
applicant in writing of the decision to grant or deny the EFP, and, if 
denied, the reasons for the denial. Grounds for denial of an EFP 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (A) The applicant has failed to disclose material information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with his or her application; or
    (B) According to the best scientific information available, the 
harvest to be conducted under the permit would detrimentally affect the 
well-being of the stock of any regulated species of fish, marine mammal, 
or threatened or endangered species in a significant way; or
    (C) Issuance of the EFP would have economic allocation as its sole 
purpose; or
    (D) Activities to be conducted under the EFP would be inconsistent 
with the intent of this section, the management objectives of the FMP, 
or other applicable law; or
    (E) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit; or
    (F) The activity proposed under the EFP could create a significant 
enforcement problem.
    (iv) The decision of a Regional Administrator or Director to grant 
or deny an EFP is the final action of NMFS. If the permit, as granted, 
is significantly different from the original application, or is denied, 
NMFS may publish notification in the Federal Register describing the 
exempted fishing to be conducted under the EFP or the reasons for 
denial.

[[Page 76]]

    (v) The Regional Administrator or Director may attach terms and 
conditions to the EFP consistent with the purpose of the exempted 
fishing, including, but not limited to:
    (A) The maximum amount of each regulated species that can be 
harvested and landed during the term of the EFP, including trip 
limitations, where appropriate.
    (B) The number, size(s), name(s), and identification number(s) of 
the vessel(s) authorized to conduct fishing activities under the EFP.
    (C) The time(s) and place(s) where exempted fishing may be 
conducted.
    (D) The type, size, and amount of gear that may be used by each 
vessel operated under the EFP.
    (E) The condition that observers, a vessel monitoring system, or 
other electronic equipment be carried on board vessels operated under an 
EFP, and any necessary conditions, such as predeployment notification 
requirements.
    (F) Reasonable data reporting requirements.
    (G) Other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance with 
the purposes of the EFP, consistent with the objectives of the FMP and 
other applicable law.
    (H) Provisions for public release of data obtained under the EFP 
that are consistent with NOAA confidentiality of statistics procedures 
at set out in subpart E. An applicant may be required to waive the right 
to confidentiality of information gathered while conducting exempted 
fishing as a condition of an EFP.
    (4) Duration. Unless otherwise specified in the EFP or a superseding 
notice or regulation, an EFP is effective for no longer than 1 year, 
unless revoked, suspended, or modified. EFPs may be renewed following 
the application procedures in this section.
    (5) Alteration. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (6) Transfer. EFPs issued under this section are not transferable or 
assignable. An EFP is valid only for the vessel(s) for which it is 
issued.
    (7) Inspection. Any EFP issued under this section must be carried on 
board the vessel(s) for which it was issued. The EFP must be presented 
for inspection upon request of any authorized officer.
    (8) Sanctions. Failure of a permittee to comply with the terms and 
conditions of an EFP may be grounds for revocation, suspension, or 
modification of the EFP with respect to all persons and vessels 
conducting activities under the EFP. Any action taken to revoke, 
suspend, or modify an EFP for enforcement purposes will be governed by 
15 CFR part 904, subpart D.
    (c) Reports. (1) Persons conducting scientific research activity are 
requested to submit a copy of any cruise report or other publication 
created as a result of the cruise, including the amount, composition, 
and disposition of their catch, to the appropriate Science and Research 
Director.
    (2) Persons fishing under an EFP are required to report their 
catches to the appropriate Regional Administrator or Director, as 
specified in the EFP.
    (d) Exempted educational activities--(1) General. A NMFS Regional 
Administrator or Director may authorize, for educational purposes, the 
target or incidental harvest of species managed under an FMP or fishery 
regulations that would otherwise be prohibited. The decision of a 
Regional Administrator or Director to grant or deny an exempted 
educational activity authorization is the final action of NMFS. Exempted 
educational activities may not be conducted unless authorized in writing 
by a Regional Administrator or Director in accordance with the criteria 
and procedures specified in this section. Such authorization will be 
issued without charge.
    (2) Application. An applicant for an exempted educational activity 
authorization shall submit to the appropriate Regional Administrator or 
Director, at least 15 days before the desired effective date of the 
authorization, a written application that includes, but is not limited 
to, the following information:
    (i) The date of the application.
    (ii) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.
    (iii) A brief statement of the purposes and goals of the exempted 
educational

[[Page 77]]

activity for which authorization is requested, including a general 
description of the arrangements for disposition of all species 
collected.
    (iv) Evidence that the sponsoring institution is a valid educational 
institution, such as accreditation by a recognized national or 
international accreditation body.
    (v) The scope and duration of the activity.
    (vi) For each vessel to be covered by the authorization:
    (A) A copy of the U.S. Coast Guard documentation, state license, or 
registration of the vessel, or the information contained on the 
appropriate document.
    (B) The current name, address, and telephone number of the owner and 
master, if not included on the document provided for the vessel.
    (vii) The species and amounts expected to be caught during the 
exempted educational activity.
    (viii) For each vessel covered by the authorization, the approximate 
time(s) and place(s) fishing will take place, and the type, size, and 
amount of gear to be used.
    (ix) The signature of the applicant.
    (x) The Regional Administrator or Director may request from an 
applicant additional information necessary to make the determinations 
required under this section. An incomplete application will not be 
considered until corrected in writing.
    (3) Issuance. (i) The Regional Administrator or Director, as 
appropriate, will review each application and will make a determination 
whether the application contains all of the required information, is 
consistent with the goals, objectives, and requirements of the FMP or 
regulations and other applicable law, and constitutes a valid exempted 
educational activity. The applicant will be notified in writing of the 
decision within 5 working days of receipt of the application.
    (ii) The Regional Administrator or Director may attach terms and 
conditions to the authorization, consistent with the purpose of the 
exempted educational activity, including, but not limited to:
    (A) The maximum amount of each regulated species that may be 
harvested.
    (B) The time(s) and place(s) where the exempted educational activity 
may be conducted.
    (C) The type, size, and amount of gear that may be used by each 
vessel operated under the authorization.
    (D) Reasonable data reporting requirements.
    (E) Such other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance 
with the purposes of the authorization, consistent with the objectives 
of the FMP or regulations.
    (F) Provisions for public release of data obtained under the 
authorization, consistent with NOAA confidentiality of statistics 
procedures in subpart E. An applicant may be required to waive the right 
to confidentiality of information gathered while conducting exempted 
educational activities as a condition of the authorization.
    (iii) The authorization will specify the scope of the authorized 
activity and will include, at a minimum, the duration, vessel(s), 
species and gear involved in the activity, as well as any additional 
terms and conditions specified under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section.
    (4) Duration. Unless otherwise specified, authorization for an 
exempted educational activity is effective for no longer than 1 year, 
unless revoked, suspended, or modified. Authorizations may be renewed 
following the application procedures in this section.
    (5) Alteration. Any authorization that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (6) Transfer. Authorizations issued under this paragraph (d) are not 
transferable or assignable.
    (7) Inspection. Any authorization issued under this paragraph (d) 
must be carried on board the vessel(s) for which it was issued or be in 
possession of the applicant to which it was issued while the exempted 
educational activity is being conducted. The authorization must be 
presented for inspection upon request of any authorized officer. 
Activities that meet the definition of fishing, despite an educational 
purpose, are fishing. An authorization may

[[Page 78]]

allow covered fishing activities; however, fishing activities conducted 
outside the scope of an authorization for exempted educational 
activities are illegal.

<R05>
Sec. 600.746  Observers.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to any fishing vessel 
required to carry an observer as part of a mandatory observer program or 
carrying an observer as part of a voluntary observer program under the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), the ATCA (16 U.S.C. 
971 et seq.), the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 973 et 
seq.), or any other U.S. law.
    (b) Observer requirement. An observer is not required to board, or 
stay aboard, a vessel that is unsafe or inadequate as described in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Inadequate or unsafe vessels. (1) A vessel is inadequate or 
unsafe for purposes of carrying an observer and allowing operation of 
normal observer functions if it does not comply with the applicable 
regulations regarding observer accommodations (see 50 CFR parts 229, 
285, 300, 600, 622, 648, 660, 678, and 679) or if it has not passed a 
USCG safety examination or inspection. A vessel that has passed a USCG 
safety examination or inspection must display one of the following:
    (i) A current Commercial Fishing Vessel Safety Examination decal, 
issued within the last 2 years, that certifies compliance with 
regulations found in 33 CFR, chapter I and 46 CFR, chapter I;
    (ii) A certificate of compliance issued pursuant to 46 CFR 28.710; 
or
    (iii) A valid certificate of inspection pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 3311.
    (2) Upon request by an observer, a NMFS employee, or a designated 
observer provider, a vessel owner/operator must provide correct 
information concerning any item relating to any safety or accommodation 
requirement prescribed by law or regulation. A vessel owner or operator 
must also allow an observer, a NMFS employee, or a designated observer 
provider to visually examine any such item.
    (3) Pre-trip safety check. Prior to each observed trip, the observer 
is encouraged to briefly walk through the vessel's major spaces to 
ensure that no obviously hazardous conditions exist. In addition, the 
observer is encouraged to spot check the following major items for 
compliance with applicable USCG regulations:
    (i) Personal flotation devices/immersion suits;
    (ii) Ring buoys;
    (iii) Distress signals;
    (iv) Fire extinguishing equipment;
    (v) Emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), when 
required; and
    (vi) Survival craft, when required.
    (d) Corrective measures. If a vessel is inadequate or unsafe for 
purposes of carrying an observer and allowing operation of normal 
observer functions, NMFS may require the vessel owner or operator either 
to:
    (1) Submit to and pass a USCG safety examination or inspection; or
    (2) Correct the deficiency that is rendering the vessel inadequate 
or unsafe (e.g., if the vessel is missing one personal flotation device, 
the owner or operator could be required to obtain an additional one), 
before the vessel is boarded by the observer.
    (e) Timing. The requirements of this section apply both at the time 
of the observer's boarding, at all times the observer is aboard, and at 
the time the observer is disembarking from the vessel.
    (f) Effect of inadequate or unsafe status. A vessel that would 
otherwise be required to carry an observer, but is inadequate or unsafe 
for purposes of carrying an observer and for allowing operation of 
normal observer functions, is prohibited from fishing without observer 
coverage.

<R05>
Sec. 600.751  Determination of need for a fishery negotiation panel.

    A Council or NMFS may establish an FNP to assist in the development 
of specific fishery conservation and management measures. In determining 
whether to establish an FNP, NMFS or the Council, as appropriate, shall 
consider whether:
    (a) There is a need for specific fishery conservation and management 
measures.
    (b) There are a limited number of identifiable interests that will 
be significantly affected by the conservation and management measure.
    (c) There is a reasonable likelihood that an FNP can be convened 
with a balanced representation of persons who:
    (1) Can adequately represent the interests identified under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Are willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus on a 
report regarding the issues presented.
    (d) There is a reasonable likelihood that an FNP will reach
    a consensus on a report regarding the issues presented within 1 year 
from date of establishment of the FNP.
    (e) The use of an FNP will not unreasonably delay Council or NMFS 
fishery management plan development or rulemaking procedures.
    (f) The costs of establishment and operation of an FNP are 
reasonable when compared to fishery management plan development or 
rulemaking procedures that do not use FNP procedures.
    (g) The Council or NMFS has adequate resources and is willing to 
commit such resources, including technical assistance, to an FNP.
    (h) The use of an FNP is in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 600.752  Use of conveners and facilitators.

    (a) Purposes of conveners. A Council or NMFS may use the services of 
a trained convener to assist the Council or NMFS in: (1) Conducting 
discussions to identify the issues of concern, and to ascertain whether 
the establishment of an FNP regarding such matter is feasible and 
appropriate.
    (2) Identifying persons who will be significantly affected by the 
issues presented in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Duties of conveners. The convener shall report findings under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and shall make recommendations to the 
Council or NMFS. Upon request of the Council or NMFS, the convener shall 
ascertain the names of persons who are willing and qualified to 
represent interests that will be significantly affected by the potential 
conservation and management measures relevant to the issues to be 
negotiated. The report and any recommendations of the convener shall be 
made available to the public upon request.
    (c) Selection of facilitator. Notwithstanding section 10(e) of the 
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), a Council or NMFS may nominate a 
person trained in facilitation either from the Federal Government or 
from outside the Federal Government to serve as an impartial, neutral 
facilitator for the negotiations of the FNP, subject to the approval of 
the FNP, by consensus. The facilitator may be the same person as the 
convener used under paragraph (a) of this section. If the FNP does not 
approve the nominee of the Council or NMFS for facilitator, the FNP 
shall submit a substitute nomination. If an

[[Page 80]]

FNP does not approve any nominee of the Council or NMFS for facilitator, 
the FNP shall select, by consensus, a person to serve as facilitator. A 
person designated to represent the Council or NMFS in substantive issues 
may not serve as facilitator or otherwise chair the FNP.
    (d) Roles and duties of facilitator. A facilitator shall:
    (1) Chair the meetings of the FNP in an impartial manner.
    (2) Impartially assist the members of the FNP in conducting 
discussions and negotiations.
    (3) Manage the keeping of minutes and records as required under 
section 10(b) and (c) of FACA.


<R05>
Sec. 600.753  Notice of intent to establish a fishery negotiation panel.

    (a) Publication of notice. If, after considering the report of a 
convener or conducting its own assessment, a Council or NMFS decides to 
establish an FNP, NMFS shall publish in the Federal Register and, as 
appropriate, in trade or other specialized publications, a document that

Sec. 600.754  Decision to establish a fishery negotiation panel.

    (a) Determination to establish an FNP. If, after considering 
comments and applications submitted under Sec. 600.753, the Council or 
NMFS determines that an FNP can adequately represent the interests that 
will be significantly affected and that it is feasible and appropriate 
in the particular case, the Council or NMFS may establish an FNP.
    (b) Determination not to establish FNP. If, after considering such 
comments and applications, the Council or NMFS decides not to establish 
an FNP, the Council or NMFS shall promptly publish notification of such 
decision and the reasons therefor in the Federal Register and, as 
appropriate, in trade or other specialized publications, a

[[Page 81]]

copy of which shall be sent to any person who applied for, or nominated 
another person for membership on the FNP to represent such interests 
with respect to the issues of concern.


<R05>
Sec. 600.755  Establishment of a fishery negotiation panel.

    (a) General authority. (1) A Council may establish an FNP to assist 
in the development of specific conservation and management measures for 
a fishery under its authority.
    (2) NMFS may establish an FNP to assist in the development of 
specific conservation and management measures required for:
    (i) A fishery for which the Secretary has authority under section 
304(e)(5) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, regarding rebuilding of 
overfished fisheries;
    (ii) A fishery for which the Secretary has authority under 16 U.S.C. 
section 304(g), regarding highly migratory species; or
    (iii) Any fishery with the approval of the appropriate Council.
    (b) Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) In establishing and 
administering such an FNP, the Council or NMFS shall comply with the 
FACA with respect to such FNP.
    (c) Balance. Each potentially affected organization or individual 
does not necessarily have to have its own representative, but each 
interest must be adequately represented. The intent is to have a group 
that as a whole reflects a proper balance and mix of interests. 
Representatives must agree, in writing, to negotiate in good faith.
    (d) Membership. The Council or NMFS shall limit membership on an FNP 
to no more than 25 members, unless the Council or NMFS determines that a 
greater number of members is necessary for the functioning of the FNP or 
to achieve balanced membership. Each FNP shall include at least one 
person representing the Council in addition to at least one person 
representing NMFS.


<R05>
Sec. 600.756  Conduct and operation of a fishery negotiation panel.

    (a) Roles and duties of an FNP. Each FNP shall consider the issue 
proposed by the Council or NMFS for consideration and shall attempt to 
reach a consensus concerning a report to assist in the development of a 
conservation and management measure with respect to such matter and any 
other matter the FNP determines is relevant to the development of a 
conservation and management measure. An FNP may adopt procedures for the 
operation of the FNP.
    (b) Roles and duties of representative of the council or NMFS. The 
person or persons representing the Council or NMFS on an FNP shall 
participate in the deliberations and activities of the FNP with the same 
rights and responsibilities as other members of the FNP, and shall be 
authorized to fully represent the Council or NMFS in the discussions and 
negotiations of the FNP.


<R05>
Sec. 600.757  Operational protocols.

    (a) Services of conveners and facilitators. A Council or NMFS may 
employ or enter into contracts for the services of an individual or 
organization to serve as a convener or facilitator for an FNP 
established under Sec. 600.755, or may use the services of a government 
employee to act as a convener or a facilitator for such an FNP.
    (b) Councils. For an FNP proposed and established by one or more 
Councils approved expenses shall be paid out of the Council's operating 
budget.
    (c) Expenses of FNP members. Members of an FNP shall be responsible 
for their own expenses of participation in such an FNP, except that NMFS 
or the Council may, in accordance with section 7(d) of FACA, pay for a 
member's reasonable travel and per diem expenses, and a reasonable rate 
of compensation, if:
    (1) Such member certifies a lack of adequate financial resources to 
participate in the FNP.

                 Subpart J--Essential Fish Habitat (EFH)

    Source: 62 FR 66551, Dec. 19, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 600.805  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Purpose. This subpart provides guidelines for Councils and the 
Secretary to use in adding the required provision on EFH to an FMP, 
i.e., description and identification of essential fish habitat (EFH), 
adverse impacts on EFH (including minimizing, to the extent practicable, 
adverse impacts from fishing), and actions to conserve and enhance EFH.
    (b) Scope--(1) Species covered. An EFH provision in an FMP must 
include all fish species in the FMU. A Council may describe, identify, 
and protect the habitat of species not in an FMU; however, such habitat 
may not be considered EFH for the purposes of sections 303(a)(7) and 
305(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (2) Geographic. EFH may be described and identified in waters of the 
United States, as defined in 33 CFR 328.3 and the exclusive economic 
zone, as defined in Sec. 600.10. Councils may describe, identify, and 
protect habitats of managed species beyond the exclusive economic zone; 
however, such habitat may not be considered EFH for the purposes of 
section 303(a)(7) and 305(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Activities 
that may adversely impact such habitat can be addressed through any 
process conducted in accordance with international agreements between 
the United States and the foreign nation(s) undertaking or authorizing 
the action.


<R05>
Sec. 600.810  Definitions and word usage.

    (a) Definitions. In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson-
Stevens Act and Sec. 600.10, the terms in this subpart have the 
following meanings:
    Adverse effect means any impact which reduces quality and/or 
quantity of EFH. Adverse effects may include direct (e.g., contamination 
or physical disruption), indirect (e.g., loss of prey, or reduction in 
species' fecundity), site-specific or habitat-wide impacts, including 
individual, cumulative, or synergistic consequences of actions.
    Council includes the Secretary, as applicable, when preparing 
Secretarial FMPs or amendments under sections 304(c) and (g) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    Ecosystem means communities of organisms interacting with one 
another and with the chemical and physical factors making up their 
environment.
    Habitat areas of particular concern means those areas of EFH 
identified pursuant to Sec. 600.815(a)(9).

[[Page 83]]

    Healthy ecosystem means an ecosystem where ecological productive 
capacity is maintained, diversity of the flora and fauna is preserved, 
and the ecosystem retains the ability to regulate itself. Such an 
ecosystem should be similar to comparable, undisturbed, ecosystems with 
regard to standing crop, productivity, nutrient dynamics, trophic 
structure, species richness, stability, resilience, contamination 
levels, and the frequency of diseased organisms.
    Overfished means any stock or stock complex, the status of which is 
reported as overfished by the Secretary pursuant to Sec. 304(e)(1) of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (b) Word usage. The terms ``must'', ``shall'', ``should'', ``may'', 
``may not'', ``will'', ``could'', and ``can'', are used in the same 
manner as in Sec. 600.305(c).


<R05>
Sec. 600.815  Contents of Fishery Management Plans.

    (a) Mandatory contents--(1) Habitat requirements by life history 
stage. FMPs must describe EFH in text and with tables that provide 
information on the biological requirements for each life history stage 
of the species. These tables should summarize all available information 
on environmental and habitat variables that control or limit 
distribution, abundance, reproduction, growth, survival, and 
productivity of the managed species. Information in the tables should be 
supported with citations.
    (2) Description and identification of EFH--(i) Information 
requirements. (A) An initial inventory of available environmental and 
fisheries data sources relevant to the managed species should be used in 
describing and identifying EFH. This inventory should also help to 
identify major species-specific habitat data gaps. Deficits in data 
availability (i.e., accessibility and application of the data) and in 
data quality (including considerations of scale and resolution; 
relevance; and potential biases in collection and interpretation) should 
be identified.
    (B) To identify EFH, basic information is needed on current and 
historic stock size, the geographic range of the managed species, the 
habitat requirements by life history stage, and the distribution and 
characteristics of those habitats. Information is also required on the 
temporal and spatial distribution of each major life history stage 
(defined by developmental and functional shifts). Since EFH should be 
identified for each major life history stage, data should be collected 
on, but not limited to, the distribution, density, growth, mortality, 
and production of each stage within all habitats occupied, or formerly 
occupied, by the species. These data should be obtained from the best 
available information, including peer-reviewed literature, data reports 
and ``gray'' literature, data files of government resource agencies, and 
any other sources of quality information.
    (C) The following approach should be used to gather and organize the 
data necessary for identifying EFH. Information from all levels should 
be used to identify EFH. The goal of this procedure is to include as 
many levels of analysis as possible within the constraints of the 
available data. Councils should strive to obtain data sufficient to 
describe habitat at the highest level of detail (i.e., Level 4).
    (1) Level 1: Presence/absence distribution data are available for 
some or all portions of the geographic range of the species. At this 
level, only presence/absence data are available to describe the 
distribution of a species (or life history stage) in relation to 
potential habitats. Care should be taken to ensure that all potential 
habitats have been sampled adequately. In the event that distribution 
data are available for only portions of the geographic area occupied by 
a particular life history stage of a species, EFH can be inferred on the 
basis of distributions among habitats where the species has been found 
and on information about its habitat requirements and behavior.
    (2) Level 2: Habitat-related densities of the species are available. 
At this level, quantitative data (i.e., density or relative abundance) 
are available for the habitats occupied by a species or life history 
stage. Because the efficiency of sampling methods is often affected by 
habitat characteristics, strict quality assurance criteria should be 
used to ensure that density estimates are comparable among methods and 
habitats.

[[Page 84]]

Density data should reflect habitat utilization, and the degree that a 
habitat is utilized is assumed to be indicative of habitat value. When 
assessing habitat value on the basis of fish densities in this manner, 
temporal changes in habitat availability and utilization should be 
considered.
    (3) Level 3: Growth, reproduction, or survival rates within habitats 
are available. At this level, data are available on habitat-related 
growth, reproduction, and/or survival by life history stage. The 
habitats contributing the most to productivity should be those that 
support the highest growth, reproduction, and survival of the species 
(or life history stage).
    (4) Level 4: Production rates by habitat are available. At this 
level, data are available that directly relate the production rates of a 
species or life history stage to habitat type, quantity, quality, and 
location. Essential habitats are those necessary to maintain fish 
production consistent with a sustainable fishery and the managed 
species' contribution to a healthy ecosystem.
    (ii) EFH determination. (A) The information obtained through the 
analysis in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section will allow Councils to 
assess the relative value of habitats. Councils should interpret this 
information in a risk-averse fashion, to ensure adequate areas are 
protected as EFH of managed species. Level 1 information, if available, 
should be used to identify the geographic range of the species. Level 2 
through 4 information, if available, should be used to identify the 
habitats valued most highly within the geographic range of the species. 
If only Level 1 information is available, presence/absence data should 
be evaluated (e.g., using a frequency of occurrence or other appropriate 
analysis) to identify those habitat areas most commonly used by the 
species. Areas so identified should be considered essential for the 
species. However, habitats of intermediate and low value may also be 
essential, depending on the health of the fish population and the 
ecosystem. Councils must demonstrate that the best scientific 
information available was used in the identification of EFH, consistent 
with national standard 2, but other data may also be used for the 
identification.
    (B) If a species is overfished, and habitat loss or degradation may 
be contributing to the species being identified as overfished, all 
habitats currently used by the species should be considered essential in 
addition to certain historic habitats that are necessary to support 
rebuilding the fishery and for which restoration is technologically and 
economically feasible. Once the fishery is no longer considered 
overfished, the EFH identification should be reviewed, and the FMP 
amended, if appropriate.
    (C) EFH will always be greater than or equal to aquatic areas that 
have been identified as ``critical habitat'' for any managed species 
listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.
    (D) Where a stock of a species is considered to be healthy, then EFH 
for the species should be a subset of all existing habitat for the 
species.
    (E) Ecological relationships among species and between the species 
and their habitat require, where possible, that an ecosystem approach be 
used in determining the EFH of a managed species or species assemblage. 
The extent of the EFH should be based on the judgment of the Secretary 
and the appropriate Council(s) regarding the quantity and quality of 
habitat that is necessary to maintain a sustainable fishery and the 
managed species' contribution to a healthy ecosystem.
    (F) If degraded or inaccessible aquatic habitat has contributed to 
the reduced yields of a species or assemblage, and in the judgment of 
the Secretary and the appropriate Council(s), the degraded conditions 
can be reversed through such actions as improved fish passage techniques 
(for fish blockages), improved water quality or quantity measures 
(removal of contaminants or increasing flows), and similar measures that 
are technologically and economically feasible, then EFH should include 
those habitats that would be essential to the species to obtain 
increased yields.
    (iii) EFH Mapping Requirements. The general distribution and 
geographic limits of EFH for each life history stage should be presented 
in FMPs in

[[Page 85]]

the form of maps. Ultimately, these data should be incorporated into a 
geographic information system (GIS) to facilitate analysis and 
presentation. These maps may be presented as fixed in time and space, 
but they should encompass all appropriate temporal and spatial 
variability in the distribution of EFH. If the geographic boundaries of 
EFH change seasonally, annually, or decadally, these changing 
distributions need to be represented in the maps. Different types of EFH 
should be identified on maps along with areas used by different life 
history stages of the species. The type of information used to identify 
EFH should be included in map legends, and more detailed and informative 
maps should be produced as more complete information about population 
responses (e.g., growth, survival, or reproductive rates) to habitat 
characteristics becomes available. Where the present distribution or 
stock size of a species or life history stage is different from the 
historical distribution or stock size, then maps of historical habitat 
boundaries should be included in the FMP, if known. The EFH maps are a 
means to visually present the EFH described in the FMP. If the maps 
identifying EFH and the information in the description of EFH differ, 
the description is ultimately determinative of the limits of EFH.
    (3) Fishing activities that may adversely affect EFH. (i) Adverse 
effects from fishing may include physical, chemical, or biological 
alterations of the substrate, and loss of, or injury to, benthic 
organisms, prey species and their habitat, and other components of the 
ecosystem.
    (ii) FMPs must include management measures that minimize adverse 
effects on EFH from fishing, to the extent practicable, and identify 
conservation and enhancement measures. The FMP must contain an 
assessment of the potential adverse effects of all fishing equipment 
types used in waters described as EFH. This assessment should consider 
the relative impacts of all fishing equipment types used in EFH on 
different types of habitat found within EFH. Special consideration 
should be given to equipment types that will affect habitat areas of 
particular concern. In completing this assessment, Councils should use 
the best scientific information available, as well as other appropriate 
information sources, as available. Included in this assessment should be 
consideration of the establishment of research closure areas and other 
measures to evaluate the impact of any fishing activity that physically 
alters EFH.
    (iii) Councils must act to prevent, mitigate, or minimize any 
adverse effects from fishing, to the extent practicable, if there is 
evidence that a fishing practice is having an identifiable adverse 
effect on EFH, based on the assessment conducted pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this section and/or the cumulative impacts analysis 
conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) In determining whether it is practicable to minimize an adverse 
effect from fishing, Councils should consider whether, and to what 
extent, the fishing activity is adversely impacting EFH, including the 
fishery; the nature and extent of the adverse effect on EFH; and whether 
the management measures are practicable, taking into consideration the 
long and short-term costs as well as benefits to the fishery and its 
EFH, along with other appropriate factors, consistent with national 
standard 7.
    (4) Options for managing adverse effects from fishing. Fishery 
management options may include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Fishing equipment restrictions. These options may include, but 
are not limited to: Seasonal and area restrictions on the use of 
specified equipment; equipment modifications to allow escapement of 
particular species or particular life stages (e.g., juveniles); 
prohibitions on the use of explosives and chemicals; prohibitions on 
anchoring or setting equipment in sensitive areas; and prohibitions on 
fishing activities that cause significant physical damage in EFH.
    (ii) Time/area closures. These actions may include, but are not 
limited to: Closing areas to all fishing or specific equipment types 
during spawning, migration, foraging, and nursery activities; and 
designating zones for use as

[[Page 86]]

marine protected areas to limit adverse effects of fishing practices on 
certain vulnerable or rare areas/species/life history stages, such as 
those areas designated as habitat areas of particular concern.
    (iii) Harvest limits. These actions may include, but are not limited 
to, limits on the take of species that provide structural habitat for 
other species assemblages or communities, and limits on the take of prey 
species.
    (5) Identification of Non-fishing related activities that may 
adversely affect EFH. FMPs must identify activities that have the 
potential to adversely affect EFH quantity or quality, or both. Broad 
categories of activities which can adversely affect EFH include, but are 
not limited to: Dredging, fill, excavation, mining, impoundment, 
discharge, water diversions, thermal additions, actions that contribute 
to non-point source pollution and sedimentation, introduction of 
potentially hazardous materials, introduction of exotic species, and the 
conversion of aquatic habitat that may eliminate, diminish, or disrupt 
the functions of EFH. An FMP should describe the EFH most likely to be 
adversely affected by these or other activities. For each activity, the 
FMP should describe known and potential adverse impacts to EFH. The 
descriptions should explain the mechanisms or processes that may cause 
the adverse effects and how these may affect habitat function. A GIS or 
other mapping system should be used to support analyses of data. Maps 
geographically depicting impacts identified in this paragraph should be 
included in an FMP.
    (6) Cumulative impacts analysis--(i) Analysis. To the extent 
feasible and practicable, FMPs should analyze how fishing and non-
fishing activities influence habitat function on an ecosystem or 
watershed scale. This analysis should describe the ecosystem or 
watershed, the dependence of the managed species on the ecosystem or 
watershed, especially EFH; and how fishing and non-fishing activities, 
individually or in combination, impact EFH and the managed species, and 
how the loss of EFH may affect the ecosystem. An assessment of the 
cumulative and synergistic effects of multiple threats, including the 
effects of natural stresses (such as storm damage or climate-based 
environmental shifts), and an assessment of the ecological risks 
resulting from the impact of those threats on the managed species' 
habitat should also be included. For the purposes of this analysis, 
cumulative impacts are impacts on the environment that result from the 
incremental impact of an action when added to other past, present, and 
reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of who undertakes such 
actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor, but 
collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.
    (ii) Cumulative impacts from fishing. In addressing the impacts of 
fishing on EFH, Councils should also consider the cumulative impacts of 
multiple fishing practices and non-fishing activities on EFH, 
especially, on habitat areas of particular concern. Habitats that are 
particularly vulnerable to specific fishing equipment types should be 
identified for possible designation as habitat areas of particular 
concern.
    (iii) Mapping cumulative impacts. A GIS or other mapping system 
should be used to support analyses of data. Maps depicting data 
documenting cumulative impacts identified in this paragraph should be 
included in an FMP.
    (iv) Research needs. If completion of these analyses is not feasible 
or practicable for every ecosystem or watershed within an area 
identified as EFH, Councils should, in consultation with NMFS, identify 
in the FMP priority research areas to allow these analyses to be 
completed. Councils should include a schedule for completing such 
research. Such schedule of priority research areas should be combined 
with the research needs identified pursuant to paragraph (a)(10) of this 
section.
    (7) Conservation and enhancement--(i) Contents of FMPs. FMPs must 
describe options to avoid, minimize, or compensate for the adverse 
effects identified pursuant to paragraphs (a) (5) and (6) of this 
section and promote the conservation and enhancement of EFH, especially 
in habitat areas of particular concern.
    (ii) General conservation and enhancement recommendations. 
Generally, non-

[[Page 87]]

water dependent actions should not be located in EFH if such actions may 
have adverse impacts on EFH. Activities that may result in significant 
adverse affects on EFH, should be avoided where less environmentally 
harmful alternatives are available. If there are no alternatives, the 
impacts of these actions should be minimized. Environmentally sound 
engineering and management practices should be employed for all actions 
which may adversely affect EFH. Disposal or spillage of any material 
(dredge material, sludge, industrial waste, or other potentially harmful 
materials) which would destroy or degrade EFH should be avoided. If 
avoidance or minimization is not possible, or will not adequately 
protect EFH, compensatory mitigation to conserve and enhance EFH should 
be recommended. FMPs may recommend proactive measures to conserve or 
enhance EFH. When developing proactive measures, Councils may develop a 
priority ranking of the recommendations to assist Federal and state 
agencies undertaking such measures.
    (iii) Conservation and enhancement options. FMPs should provide a 
variety of options to conserve or enhance EFH, which may include, but 
are not limited to:
    (A) Enhancement of rivers, streams, and coastal areas. EFH located 
in, or influenced by, rivers, streams, and coastal areas may be enhanced 
by reestablishing endemic trees or other appropriate native vegetation 
on adjacent riparian areas; restoring natural bottom characteristics; 
removing unsuitable material from areas affected by human activities; or 
adding gravel or substrate to stream areas to promote spawning. Adverse 
effects stemming from upland areas that influence EFH may be avoided or 
minimized by employing measures such as, but not limited to, erosion 
control, road stabilization, upgrading culverts, removal or modification 
of operating procedures of dikes or levees to allow for fish passage, 
structural and operation measures at dams for fish passage and habitat 
protection, or improvement of watershed management. Initiation of 
Federal, state, or local government planning processes to restore 
watersheds associated with such rivers, streams, or coastal areas may 
also be recommended.
    (B) Water quality and quantity. This category of options may include 
use of best land management practices for ensuring compliance with water 
quality standards at state and Federal levels, improved treatment of 
sewage, proper disposal of waste materials, and providing appropriate 
in-stream flow.
    (C) Watershed analysis and planning. This may include encouraging 
local and state efforts to minimize destruction/degradation of wetlands, 
restore and maintain the ecological health of watersheds, and encourage 
restoration of native species. Any analysis of options should consider 
natural variability in weather or climatic conditions.
    (D) Habitat creation. Under appropriate conditions, habitat creation 
(converting non-EFH to EFH) may be considered as a means of replacing 
lost or degraded EFH. However, habitat conversion at the expense of 
other naturally functioning systems must be justified within an 
ecosystem context.
    (8) Prey species. Loss of prey is an adverse effect on EFH and a 
managed species, because one component of EFH is that it be necessary 
for feeding. Therefore, actions that reduce the availability of a major 
prey species, either through direct harm or capture, or through adverse 
impacts to the prey species' habitat that are known to cause a reduction 
in the population of the prey species may be considered adverse effects 
on a managed species and its EFH. FMPs should identify the major prey 
species for the species in the FMU and generally describe the location 
of prey species' habitat. Actions that cause a reduction of the prey 
species population, including where there exists evidence that adverse 
effects to habitat of prey species is causing a decline in the 
availability of the prey species, should also be described and 
identified. Adverse effects on prey species and their habitats may 
result from fishing and non-fishing activities.
    (9) Identification of habitat areas of particular concern. FMPs 
should identify habitat areas of particular concern within EFH. In 
determining whether a type, or area of EFH is a habitat area

[[Page 88]]

of particular concern, one or more of the following criteria must be 
met:
    (i) The importance of the ecological function provided by the 
habitat.
    (ii) The extent to which the habitat is sensitive to human-induced 
environmental degradation.
    (iii) Whether, and to what extent, development activities are, or 
will be, stressing the habitat type.
    (iv) The rarity of the habitat type.
    (10) Research and information needs. Each FMP should contain 
recommendations, preferably in priority order, for research efforts that 
the Councils and NMFS view as necessary for carrying out their EFH 
management mandate. The need for additional research is to make 
available sufficient information to support a higher level of 
description and identification of EFH under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section. Additional research may also be necessary to identify and 
evaluate actual and potential adverse effects on EFH, including, but not 
limited to, direct physical alteration; impaired habitat quality/
functions; cumulative impacts from fishing; or indirect adverse effects 
such as sea level rise, global warming and climate shifts; and non-
equipment related fishery impacts. The Magnuson-Stevens Act specifically 
identifies the effects of fishing as a concern. The need for additional 
research on the effects of fishing equipment on EFH and a schedule for 
obtaining that information should be included in this section of the 
FMP. If an adverse effect on EFH is identified and determined to be an 
impediment to maintaining a sustainable fishery and the managed species' 
contribution to a healthy ecosystem, then the research needed to 
quantify and mitigate that effect should be identified in this section.
    (11) Review and revision of EFH components of FMPs. Councils and 
NMFS should periodically review the EFH components of FMPs, including an 
update of the equipment assessment originally conducted pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. Each EFH FMP amendment should 
include a provision requiring review and update of EFH information and 
preparation of a revised FMP amendment if new information becomes 
available. The schedule for this review should be based on an assessment 
of both the existing data and expectations when new data will become 
available. This information should be reviewed as part of the annual 
Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report prepared pursuant 
to Sec. 600.315(e). A complete review of information should be conducted 
as recommended by the Secretary, but at least once every 5 years.
    (b) Optional components. An FMP may include a description and 
identification of the habitat of species under the authority of the 
Council, even if not contained in the FMU. However, such habitat may not 
be EFH. This subpart does not change a Council's ability to implement 
management measures for a managed species for the protection of another 
species.
    (c) Development of EFH recommendations. After reviewing the best 
available scientific information, as well as other appropriate 
information, and in consultation with the Councils, participants in the 
fishery, interstate commissions, Federal agencies, state agencies, and 
other interested parties, NMFS will develop written recommendations for 
the identification of EFH for each FMP. In recognition of the different 
approaches to FMP development taken by each Council, the NMFS EFH 
recommendations may constitute a review of a draft EFH document 
developed by a Council, or may include suggestions for a draft EFH FMP 
amendment and may precede the Council's development of such documents, 
as appropriate. In both cases, prior to submitting a written EFH 
identification recommendation to a Council for an FMP, the draft 
recommendation will be made available for public review and at least one 
public meeting will be held. NMFS will work with the affected Council(s) 
to conduct this review in association with scheduled public Council 
meetings whenever possible. The review may be conducted at a meeting of 
the Council committee responsible for habitat issues or as a part of a 
full Council meeting. After receiving public comment, NMFS will revise 
its draft recommendations, as appropriate, and forward a final written 
recommendation and comments to the Council(s).

[[Page 89]]

    (d) Relationship to other fishery management authorities. Councils 
are encouraged to coordinate with state and interstate fishery 
management agencies where Federal fisheries affect state and interstate 
managed fisheries or where state or interstate fishery regulations 
affect the management of Federal fisheries. Where a state or interstate 
fishing activity adversely impacts EFH, NMFS will consider that action 
to be an adverse effect on EFH pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section and will provide EFH conservation recommendations to the 
appropriate state or interstate fishery management agency on that 
activity.

     Subpart K--EFH Coordination, Consultation, and Recommendations

    Source: 62 FR 66555, Dec. 19, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 600.905  Purpose and scope and NMFS/Council cooperation.

    (a) Purpose. These procedures address the coordination, 
consultation, and recommendation requirements of sections 305(b)(1)(D) 
and 305(b)(2-4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The purpose of these 
procedures is to promote the protection of EFH in the review of Federal 
and state actions that may adversely affect EFH.
    (b) Scope. Section 305(b)(1)(D) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act requires 
the Secretary to coordinate with, and provide information to, other 
Federal agencies regarding the conservation and enhancement of EFH. 
Section 305(b)(2) requires all Federal agencies to consult with the 
Secretary on all actions, or proposed actions, authorized, funded, or 
undertaken by the agency, that may adversely affect EFH. Sections 305(b) 
(3) and (4) direct the Secretary and the Councils to provide comments 
and EFH conservation recommendations to Federal or state agencies on 
actions that affect EFH. Such recommendations may include measures to 
avoid, minimize, mitigate, or otherwise offset adverse effects on EFH 
resulting from actions or proposed actions authorized, funded, or 
undertaken by that agency. Section 305(b)(4)(B) requires Federal 
agencies to respond in writing to such comments. The following 
procedures for coordination, consultation, and recommendations allow all 
parties involved to understand and implement the requirements of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (c) Cooperation between Councils and NMFS. The Councils and NMFS 
should cooperate as closely as possible to identify actions that may 
adversely affect EFH, to develop comments and EFH conservation 
recommendations to Federal and state agencies, and to provide EFH 
information to Federal or state agencies. The Secretary will seek to 
develop agreements with each Council to facilitate sharing information 
on actions that may adversely affect EFH and in coordinating Council and 
NMFS comments and recommendations on those actions. However, NMFS and 
the Councils also have the authority to act independently.


<R05>
Sec. 600.910  Definitions and word usage.

    (a) Definitions. In addition to the definitions in the Magnuson-
Stevens Act and Sec. 600.10, the terms in this subpart have the 
following meanings:
    Adverse effect means any impact which reduces quality and/or 
quantity of EFH. Adverse effects may include direct (e.g., contamination 
or physical disruption), indirect (e.g., loss of prey, reduction in 
species' fecundity), site-specific or habitatwide impacts, including 
individual, cumulative, or synergistic consequences of actions.
    Council includes the Secretary, as applicable, when preparing FMPs 
or amendments under section 304 (c) and (g) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act; 
and when commenting and making recommendations under the authority of 
section 305(b)(3) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act to any Federal or state 
agency on actions that may affect the habitat of fishery resources 
managed under such FMPs.
    Federal action means any action authorized, funded, or undertaken, 
or proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken by a Federal agency.
    Habitat areas of particular concern means those areas of EFH 
identified pursuant to Sec. 600.815(a)(9).

[[Page 90]]

    State action means any action authorized, funded, or undertaken, or 
proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken by a state agency.
    (b) Word usage. The terms ``must'', ``shall'', ``should'', ``may'', 
``may not'', ``will'', ``could'', and ``can'', are used in the same 
manner as in Sec. 600.305(c).


<R05>
Sec. 600.915  Coordination for the conservation and enhancement of EFH.

    To further the conservation and enhancement of EFH in accordance 
with section 305(b)(1)(D) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, NMFS will compile 
and make available to other Federal and state agencies, information on 
the locations of EFH, including maps and/or narrative descriptions. NMFS 
will also provide information on ways to improve ongoing Federal 
operations to promote the conservation and enhancement of EFH. Federal 
and state agencies empowered to authorize, fund, or undertake actions 
that may adversely affect EFH are encouraged to contact NMFS and the 
Councils to become familiar with areas designated as EFH, and potential 
threats to EFH, as well as opportunities to promote the conservation and 
enhancement of such habitat.


<R05>
Sec. 600.920  Federal agency consultation with the Secretary.

    (a) Consultation generally--(1) Actions requiring consultation. 
Pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, Federal 
agencies must consult with NMFS regarding any of their actions 
authorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to be authorized, funded, 
or undertaken that may adversely affect EFH. EFH consultation is not 
required for completed actions, e.g., issued permits. Consultation is 
required for renewals, reviews, or substantial revisions of actions. 
Consultation on Federal programs delegated to non-Federal entities is 
required at the time of delegation, review, and renewal of the 
delegation. EFH consultation is required for any Federal funding of 
actions that may adversely affect EFH. NMFS and Federal agencies 
responsible for funding actions that may adversely affect EFH should 
consult on a programmatic level, if appropriate, with respect to these 
actions.
    (2) Appropriate level of consultation. (i) NMFS and other Federal 
agencies may conduct consultation at either a programmatic or project-
specific level. Federal actions may be evaluated at a programmatic level 
if sufficient information is available to develop EFH conservation 
recommendations and address all reasonably foreseeable adverse effects 
to EFH. Project-specific consultations are more appropriate when 
critical decisions are made at the project implementation stage, or when 
sufficiently detailed information for the development of EFH 
conservation recommendations does not exist at the programmatic level.
    (ii) If, after a Federal agency requests programmatic consultation, 
NMFS determines that all concerns about adverse effects on EFH can be 
addressed at a programmatic level, NMFS will develop EFH conservation 
recommendations that cover all projects implemented under that program, 
and no further EFH consultation will be required. Alternatively, NMFS 
may determine that project-specific consultation is needed for part or 
all of the program's activities, in which case NMFS may develop some EFH 
conservation recommendations at a programmatic level, but will also 
recommend that project-specific consultation will be needed to complete 
the EFH consultation requirements. NMFS may also determine that 
programmatic consultation is not appropriate, in which case all EFH 
conservation recommendations will be deferred to project-specific 
consultations.
    (b) Designation of lead agency. If more than one Federal agency is 
responsible for a Federal action, the consultation requirements of 
sections 305(b)(2-4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act may be fulfilled 
through a lead agency. The lead agency must notify NMFS in writing that 
it is representing one or more additional agencies.
    (c) Designation of non-Federal representative. A Federal agency may 
designate a non-Federal representative to conduct an abbreviated 
consultation or prepare an EFH Assessment by giving written notice of 
such designation to NMFS. If a non-Federal representative

[[Page 91]]

is used, the Federal action agency remains ultimately responsible for 
compliance with sections 305(b)(2) and 305(b)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act.
    (d) Best available information. The Federal action agency and NMFS 
must use the best scientific information available regarding the effects 
of the proposed action on EFH. Other appropriate sources of information 
may also be considered.
    (e) Use of existing consultation/environmental review procedures--
(1) Criteria. Consultation and commenting under sections 305(b)(2) and 
305(b)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act should be consolidated, where 
appropriate, with interagency consultation, coordination, and 
environmental review procedures required by other statutes, such as the 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Fish and Wildlife Coordination 
Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act (ESA), and Federal Power 
Act. The consultation requirements of section 305(b)(2) of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act can be satisfied using existing or modified procedures 
required by other statutes if such processes meet the following 
criteria:
    (i) The existing process must provide NMFS with timely notification 
of actions that may adversely affect EFH. The Federal action agency 
should notify NMFS according to the same timeframes for notification (or 
for public comment) as in the existing process. However, NMFS should 
have at least 60 days notice prior to a final decision on an action, or 
at least 90 days if the action would result in substantial adverse 
impacts. NMFS and the action agency may agree to use shorter timeframes 
if they allow sufficient time for NMFS to develop EFH conservation 
recommendations.
    (ii) Notification must include an assessment of the impacts of the 
proposed action on EFH that meets the requirements for EFH Assessments 
contained in paragraph (g) of this section. If the EFH Assessment is 
contained in another document, that section of the document must be 
clearly identified as the EFH Assessment.
    (iii) NMFS must have made a finding pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section that the existing process satisfies the requirements of 
section 305(b)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (2) EFH conservation recommendation requirements. If an existing 
consultation process is used to fulfill the EFH consultation 
requirements, then the comment deadline for that process should apply to 
the submittal of NMFS conservation recommendations under section 
305(b)(4)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, unless a different deadline is 
agreed to by NMFS and the Federal agency. The Federal agency must 
respond to these recommendations within 30 days pursuant to section 
305(b)(4)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. NMFS may request the further 
review of any Federal agency decision that is inconsistent with a NMFS 
EFH recommendation, in accordance with paragraph (j)(2) of this section. 
If NMFS EFH conservation recommendations are combined with other NMFS or 
NOAA comments on a Federal action, such as NOAA comments on a draft 
Environmental Impact Statement, the EFH conservation recommendations 
shall be clearly identified as such (e.g., a section in the comment 
letter entitled ``EFH conservation recommendations'') and a response 
pursuant to section 305(b)(4)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act is required 
for only the identified portion of the comments.
    (3) NMFS finding. A Federal agency with an existing consultation 
process should contact NMFS at the appropriate level (regional offices 
for regional processes, headquarters office for national processes) to 
discuss how the existing process, with or without modifications, can be 
used to satisfy the EFH consultation requirements. If, at the conclusion 
of these discussions, NMFS determines that the existing process meets 
the criteria of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, NMFS will make a 
finding that the existing or modified process can satisfy the EFH 
consultation requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. If NMFS does not 
make such a finding, or if there are no existing consultation processes 
relevant to the Federal agency's actions, the action agency and NMFS 
should follow the consultation process in the following sections.

[[Page 92]]

    (f) General Concurrence--(1) Purpose. The General Concurrence 
process identifies specific types of Federal actions that may adversely 
affect EFH, but for which no further consultation is generally required 
because NMFS has determined, through an analysis of that type of action, 
that it will likely result in no more than minimal adverse effects 
individually and cumulatively. General Concurrences may be national or 
regional in scope.
    (2) Criteria. (i) For Federal actions to qualify for General 
Concurrence, NMFS must determine, after consultation with the 
appropriate Council(s), that the actions meet all of the following 
criteria:
    (A) The actions must be similar in nature and similar in their 
impact on EFH.
    (B) The actions must not cause greater than minimal adverse effects 
on EFH when implemented individually.
    (C) The actions must not cause greater than minimal cumulative 
adverse effects on EFH.
    (ii) Actions qualifying for General Concurrence must be tracked to 
ensure that their cumulative effects are no more than minimal. In most 
cases, tracking will be the responsibility of the Federal action agency, 
but NMFS also may agree to track actions for which General Concurrence 
has been authorized. Tracking should include numbers of actions, amount 
of habitat adversely affected, type of habitat adversely affected, and 
the baseline against which the action will be tracked. The agency 
responsible for tracking such actions should make the information 
available to NMFS, the Councils, and to the public on an annual basis.
    (iii) Categories of Federal actions may also qualify for General 
Concurrence if they are modified by appropriate conditions that ensure 
the actions will meet the criteria in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section. For example, NMFS may provide General Concurrence for 
additional actions contingent upon project size limitations, seasonal 
restrictions, or other conditions.
    (iv) If a General Concurrence is developed for actions affecting 
habitat areas of particular concern, the General Concurrence should be 
subject to a higher level of scrutiny than a General Concurrence not 
involving a habitat area of particular concern.
    (3) General Concurrence development. A Federal agency may request a 
General Concurrence for a category of its actions by providing NMFS with 
a written description of the nature and approximate number of the 
proposed actions, an analysis of the effects of the actions on EFH and 
associated species and their life history stages, including cumulative 
effects, and the Federal agency's conclusions regarding the magnitude of 
such effects. If NMFS agrees that the actions fit the criteria in 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, NMFS, after consultation with the 
appropriate Council(s), will provide the Federal agency with a written 
statement of General Concurrence that further consultation is not 
required, and that preparation of EFH Assessments for individual actions 
subject to the General Concurrence is not necessary. If NMFS does not 
agree that the actions fit the criteria in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, NMFS will notify the Federal agency that a General Concurrence 
will not be issued and that abbreviated or expanded consultation will be 
required. If NMFS identifies specific types of Federal actions that may 
meet the requirements for a General Concurrence, NMFS may initiate and 
complete a General Concurrence.
    (4) Notification and further consultation. NMFS may request 
notification for actions covered under a General Concurrence if NMFS 
concludes there are circumstances under which such actions could result 
in more than a minimal impact on EFH, or if it determines that there is 
not a process in place to adequately assess the cumulative impacts of 
actions covered under the General Concurrence. NMFS may require further 
consultation for these actions on a case-by case basis. Each General 
Concurrence should establish specific procedures for further 
consultation, if appropriate.
    (5) Public review. Prior to providing any Federal agency with a 
written statement of General Concurrence for a category of Federal 
actions, NMFS will

[[Page 93]]

provide an opportunity for public review through the appropriate 
Council(s), or other reasonable opportunity for public review.
    (6) Revisions. NMFS will periodically review and revise its findings 
of General Concurrence, as appropriate.
    (g) EFH Assessments--(1) Preparation requirement. For any Federal 
action that may adversely affect EFH, except for those activities 
covered by a General Concurrence, Federal agencies must provide NMFS 
with a written assessment of the effects of that action on EFH. Federal 
agencies may incorporate an EFH Assessment into documents prepared for 
other purposes such as ESA Biological Assessments pursuant to 50 CFR 
part 402 or NEPA documents and public notices pursuant to 40 CFR part 
1500. If an EFH Assessment is contained in another document, it must 
include all of the information required in paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section and be clearly identified as an EFH Assessment. The procedure 
for combining an EFH consultation with other consultation of 
environmental reviews is set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Mandatory contents. The assessment must contain:
    (i) A description of the proposed action.
    (ii) An analysis of the effects, including cumulative effects, of 
the proposed action on EFH, the managed species, and associated species, 
such as major prey species, including affected life history stages.
    (iii) The Federal agency's views regarding the effects of the action 
on EFH.
    (iv) Proposed mitigation, if applicable.
    (3) Additional information. If appropriate, the assessment should 
also include:
    (i) The results of an on-site inspection to evaluate the habitat and 
the site-specific effects of the project.
    (ii) The views of recognized experts on the habitat or species that 
may be affected.
    (iii) A review of pertinent literature and related information.
    (iv) An analysis of alternatives to the proposed action. Such 
analysis should include alternatives that could avoid or minimize 
adverse effects on EFH, particularly when an action is non-water 
dependent.
    (v) Other relevant information.
    (4) Incorporation by reference. The assessment may incorporate by 
reference a completed EFH Assessment prepared for a similar action, 
supplemented with any relevant new project specific information, 
provided the proposed action involves similar impacts to EFH in the same 
geographic area or a similar ecological setting. It may also incorporate 
by reference other relevant environmental assessment documents. These 
documents must be provided to NMFS with an EFH Assessment.
    (h) Abbreviated consultation procedures--(1) Purpose and criteria. 
Abbreviated consultation allows NMFS to quickly determine whether, and 
to what degree, a Federal action may adversely affect EFH. Federal 
actions that may adversely affect EFH should be addressed through the 
abbreviated consultation procedures when those actions do not qualify 
for a General Concurrence, but do not have the potential to cause 
substantial adverse effects on EFH. For example, the abbreviated 
consultation procedures should be used when the adverse effect(s) of an 
action or proposed action could be alleviated through minor 
modifications.
    (2) Notification by agency. The Federal agency should notify NMFS 
and, if NMFS so requests, the appropriate Council(s), in writing as 
early as practicable regarding proposed actions that may adversely 
affect EFH. Notification will facilitate discussion of measures to 
conserve the habitat. Such early consultation should occur during pre-
application planning for projects subject to a Federal permit or 
license, and during preliminary planning for projects to be funded or 
undertaken directly by a Federal agency.
    (3) Submittal of EFH Assessment. The Federal agency must submit a 
completed EFH Assessment, prepared in accordance with paragraph (g) of 
this section, to NMFS for review. Federal agencies will have fulfilled 
their consultation requirement under paragraph (a) of this section after 
notification and submittal of a complete EFH Assessment.

[[Page 94]]

    (4) NMFS response to Federal agency. NMFS must respond in writing as 
to whether it concurs with the findings of the EFH Assessment. If NMFS 
believes that the proposed action may result in substantial adverse 
effects on EFH, or that additional analysis is needed to accurately 
assess the effects of the proposed action, NMFS will request that the 
Federal agency initiate expanded consultation. Such request will explain 
why NMFS believes expanded consultation is needed and will specify any 
new information needed. If additional consultation is not necessary, 
NMFS will respond by commenting and recommending measures that may be 
taken to conserve EFH, pursuant to section 305(b)(4)(A) of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act. NMFS will send a copy of its response to the appropriate 
Council.
    (5) Timing. The Federal action agency must submit its complete EFH 
Assessment to NMFS as soon as practicable, but NMFS must receive it at 
least 60 days prior to a final decision on the action. NMFS must respond 
in writing within 30 days. NMFS and the Federal action agency may agree 
to use a compressed schedule in cases where regulatory approvals or 
emergency situations cannot accommodate 30 days for consultation, or to 
conduct consultation earlier in the planning cycle for proposed actions 
with lengthy approval processes.
    (i) Expanded consultation procedures--(1) Purpose and criteria. 
Expanded consultation allows maximum opportunity for NMFS and the 
Federal agency to work together in the review of the action's impacts on 
EFH and the development of EFH conservation recommendations. Expanded 
consultation procedures must be used for Federal actions that would 
result in substantial adverse effects to EFH. Federal agencies are 
encouraged to contact NMFS at the earliest opportunity to discuss 
whether the adverse effect of a proposed action makes expanded 
consultation appropriate.
    (2) Initiation. Expanded consultation begins when NMFS receives from 
the Federal agency an EFH Assessment completed in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section and a written request for expanded 
consultation. Federal action agencies are encouraged to provide in the 
EFH Assessment the additional information identified under paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section. Subject to NMFS's approval, any request for 
expanded consultation may encompass a number of similar individual 
actions within a given geographic area.
    (3) NMFS response to Federal agency. NMFS will:
    (i) Review the EFH Assessment, any additional information furnished 
by the Federal agency, and other relevant information.
    (ii) Conduct a site visit, if appropriate, to assess the quality of 
the habitat and to clarify the impacts of the Federal agency action. 
Such a site visit should be coordinated with the Federal agency and 
appropriate Council(s), if feasible.
    (iii) Coordinate its review of the proposed action with the 
appropriate Council(s).
    (iv) Discuss EFH conservation recommendations with the Federal 
agency and provide recommendations to the Federal action agency, 
pursuant to section 305(b)(4)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. NMFS will 
also provide a copy of the recommendations to the appropriate 
Council(s).
    (4) Timing. The Federal action agency must submit its complete EFH 
Assessment to NMFS as soon as practicable, but at least 90 days prior to 
a final decision on the action. NMFS must respond within 60 days of 
submittal of a complete EFH Assessment unless consultation is extended 
by agreement between NMFS and the Federal action agency. NMFS and 
Federal action agencies may agree to use a compressed schedule in cases 
where regulatory approvals or emergency situations cannot accommodate a 
60-day consultation period.
    (5) Extension of consultation. If NMFS determines that additional 
data or analysis would provide better information for development of EFH 
conservation recommendations, NMFS may request additional time for 
expanded consultation. If NMFS and the Federal action agency agree to an 
extension, the Federal action agency should provide the additional 
information to NMFS, to the extent practicable. If NMFS and the Federal 
action agency do not agree to extend consultation,

[[Page 95]]

NMFS must provide EFH conservation recommendations to the Federal action 
agency using the best scientific information available to NMFS.
    (j) Responsibilities of Federal action agency following receipt of 
EFH conservation recommendations--(1) Federal action agency response. As 
required by section 305(b)(4)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the 
Federal action agency must provide a detailed response in writing to 
NMFS and the appropriate Council within 30 days after receiving an EFH 
conservation recommendation. Such a response must be provided at least 
10 days prior to final approval of the action, if a decision by the 
Federal agency is required in fewer than 30 days. The response must 
include a description of measures proposed by the agency for avoiding, 
mitigating, or offsetting the impact of the activity on EFH. In the case 
of a response that is inconsistent with NMFS conservation 
recommendations, the Federal action agency must explain its reasons for 
not following the recommendations, including the scientific 
justification for any disagreements with NMFS over the anticipated 
effects of the proposed action and the measures needed to avoid, 
minimize, mitigate, or offset such effects.
    (2) Further review of decisions inconsistent with NMFS or Council 
recommendations. If a Federal action agency decision is inconsistent 
with a NMFS EFH conservation recommendation, the Assistant Administrator 
for Fisheries may request a meeting with the head of the Federal action 
agency, as well as any other agencies involved, to discuss the proposed 
action and opportunities for resolving any disagreements. If a Federal 
action agency decision is also inconsistent with a Council 
recommendation made pursuant to section 305(b)(3) of the Magnuson-
Stevens Act, the Council may request that the Assistant Administrator 
initiate further review of the Federal agency's decision and involve the 
Council in any interagency discussion to resolve disagreements with the 
Federal agency. The Assistant Administrator will make every effort to 
accommodate such a request. Memoranda of agreement or other written 
procedures will be developed to further define such review processes 
with Federal action agencies.
    (k) Supplemental consultation. A Federal action agency must 
reinitiate consultation with NMFS if the agency substantially revises 
its plans for an action in a manner that may adversely affect EFH or if 
new information becomes available that affects the basis for NMFS' EFH 
conservation recommendations.


<R05>
Sec. 600.925  NMFS EFH conservation recommendations to Federal and state agencies.

    (a) General. Under section 305(b)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 
NMFS is required to provide EFH conservation recommendations to Federal 
and state agencies for actions that would adversely affect EFH. NMFS EFH 
conservation recommendations will not suggest that state or Federal 
agencies take actions beyond their statutory authority.
    (b) Recommendations to Federal agencies. For Federal actions, EFH 
conservation recommendations will be provided to Federal action agencies 
as part of EFH consultations conducted pursuant to Sec. 600.920. These 
recommendations fulfill the requirements of section 305(b)(4)(A) of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act. If NMFS becomes aware of a Federal action that 
would adversely affect EFH, but for which a Federal agency has not 
completed an EFH consultation, NMFS may request that the Federal agency 
initiate EFH consultation or NMFS will provide EFH conservation 
recommendations based on the information available. NMFS will provide a 
copy of such recommendation to the appropriate Council(s).
    (c) Recommendations to state agencies--(1) Establishment of 
procedures. Each NMFS Region should use existing coordination procedures 
under statutes such as the Coastal Zone Management Act or establish new 
procedures to identify state actions that may adversely affect EFH, and 
for determining the most appropriate method for providing EFH 
conservation recommendations to the state agency. NMFS will provide a 
copy of such recommendation to the appropriate Council(s).

[[Page 96]]

    (2) Coordination with states on recommendations to Federal agencies. 
When an action that would adversely affect EFH requires authorization or 
funding by both Federal and state agencies, NMFS will provide the 
appropriate state agencies with copies of EFH conservation 
recommendations developed as part of the Federal consultation procedures 
in Sec. 600.920. NMFS will also seek agreements on sharing information 
and copies of recommendations with Federal or state agencies conducting 
similar consultation and recommendation processes to ensure coordination 
of such efforts.


<R05>
Sec. 600.930  Council comments and recommendations to Federal and state agencies.

    (a) Establishment of procedures. Each Council should establish 
procedures for reviewing Federal or state actions that may adversely 
affect the EFH of a species managed under its authority. Each Council 
may receive information on actions of concern by methods such as: 
Directing Council staff to track proposed actions; recommending that the 
Council's habitat committee identify actions of concern; or entering 
into an agreement with NMFS to have the appropriate Regional 
Administrator notify the Council of actions that may adversely impact 
EFH. Federal and state actions often follow specific timetables which 
may not coincide with Council meetings. Therefore, Councils should 
consider establishing abbreviated procedures for the development of 
Council recommendations.
    (b) Early involvement. Councils should provide comments and 
recommendations on proposed state and Federal actions of concern as 
early as practicable in project planning to ensure thorough 
consideration of Council concerns by the action agency. Copies of 
Council comments and recommendations should be provided to NMFS.
    (c) Anadromous fishery resources. For the purposes of the commenting 
requirement of section 305(b)(3)(B) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, an 
``anadromous fishery resource under a Council's authority'' is an 
anadromous species that inhabits waters under the Council's authority at 
some time during its life cycle.

    (a) The relation of this part to other laws is set forth in 
Sec. 600.705 of this chapter and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Except for regulations on allowable octocoral, Gulf and South 
Atlantic prohibited coral, and live rock, this part is intended to apply 
within the EEZ portions of applicable National Marine Sanctuaries and 
National Parks, unless the regulations governing such Sanctuaries or 
Parks prohibit their application. Regulations on allowable octocoral, 
Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral, and live rock do not apply 
within the EEZ portions of the following National Marine Sanctuaries and 
National Parks:
    (1) Everglades National Park (36 CFR 7.45).

Sec. 622.4  Permits and fees.

    (a) Permits required. To conduct activities in fisheries governed in 
this part, valid permits, licenses, and endorsements are required as 
follows:
    (1) Charter vessel/headboat permits. For a person aboard a vessel 
that is operating as a charter vessel or headboat to fish for or possess 
coastal migratory pelagic fish, Gulf reef fish, or South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper in or from the EEZ, a charter vessel/headboat permit for 
coastal migratory pelagic fish, Gulf reef fish, or South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper, respectively, must have been issued to the vessel and 
must be on board. A charter vessel or headboat may have both a charter 
vessel/headboat permit and a commercial vessel permit. However, when a 
vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, a person aboard 
must adhere to the bag limits.
    (2) Commercial vessel permits, licenses, and endorsements--(i) Fish 
traps in the Gulf. For a person to possess or use a fish trap in the EEZ 
in the Gulf of Mexico, a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish 
with a fish trap endorsement must have been issued to the vessel and 
must be on board. See paragraph (n) of this section regarding fish trap 
endorsements.
    (ii) Gillnets for king mackerel in the Florida west coast subzone. 
For a person aboard a vessel to use a run-around gillnet for king 
mackerel in the Florida west coast subzone (see 
Sec. 622.42(c)(1)(i)(A)(3)), a commercial vessel permit for king and 
mackerel with a gillnet endorsement must have been issued to the vessel 
and must be on board. See paragraph (o) of this section for restrictions 
on addition or deletion of a gillnet endorsement.
    (iii) King mackerel. For a person aboard a vessel to be eligible for 
exemption from the bag limits and to fish under a quota for king 
mackerel in or from the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ, a 
commercial vessel permit for king mackerel must have been issued to the 
vessel and must be on board. To obtain or renew a commercial vessel 
permit for king mackerel

[[Page 103]]

valid through April 30, 1999, at least 10 percent of the applicant's 
earned income must have been derived from commercial fishing (i.e., 
harvest and first sale of fish) during one of the 3 calendar years 
preceding the application. To obtain or renew a commercial vessel permit 
for king mackerel valid after April 30, 1999, at least 25 percent of the 
applicant's earned income, or at least $10,000, must have been derived 
from commercial fishing (i.e., harvest and first sale of fish) or from 
charter fishing during one of the 3 calendar years preceding the 
application. See paragraph (q) of this section regarding a moratorium on 
commercial vessel permits for king mackerel, initial permits under the 
moratorium, transfers of permits during the moratorium, and limited 
exceptions to the earned income or gross sales requirement for a permit.
    (iv) Spanish mackerel. For a person aboard a vessel to be eligible 
for exemption from the bag limits and to fish under a quota for Spanish 
mackerel in or from the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ, a 
commercial vessel permit for Spanish mackerel must have been issued to 
the vessel and must be on board. To obtain or renew a commercial vessel 
permit for Spanish mackerel valid through April 30, 1999, at least 10 
percent of the applicant's earned income must have been derived from 
commercial fishing (i.e., harvest and first sale of fish) during one of 
the 3 calendar years preceding the application. To obtain or renew a 
commercial vessel permit for Spanish mackerel valid after April 30, 
1999, at least 25 percent of the applicant's earned income, or at least 
$10,000, must have been derived from commercial fishing (i.e., harvest 
and first sale of fish) or from charter fishing during one of the 3 
calendar years preceding the application.
    (v) Gulf reef fish. For a person aboard a vessel to be eligible for 
exemption from the bag limits, to fish under a quota, or to sell Gulf 
reef fish in or from the Gulf EEZ, a commercial vessel permit for Gulf 
reef fish must have been issued to the vessel and must be on board. To 
obtain or renew a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, more than 
50 percent of the applicant's earned income must have been derived from 
commercial fishing (i.e., harvest and first sale of fish) or from 
charter fishing during either of the 2 calendar years preceding the 
application. See paragraph (m) of this section regarding a moratorium on 
commercial vessel permits for Gulf reef fish and limited exceptions to 
the earned income requirement for a permit.
    (vi) South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For a person aboard a vessel to 
be eligible for exemption from the bag limits for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, to engage in the 
directed fishery for tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ, to use a 
longline to fish for South Atlantic snapper-grouper in the South 
Atlantic EEZ, or to use a sea bass pot in the South Atlantic EEZ between 
35 deg.15.3' N. lat. (due east of Cape Hatteras Light, NC) and 
28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, 
Cape Canaveral, FL), a commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper must have been issued to the vessel and must be on 
board. A vessel with longline gear and more than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of 
tilefish on board is considered to be in the directed fishery for 
tilefish. It is a rebuttable presumption that a fishing vessel with more 
than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of tilefish on board harvested such tilefish in 
the EEZ. See Sec. 622.18 for limitations on the use, transfer, and 
renewal of a commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper.
    (vii) Wreckfish. For a person aboard a vessel to fish for wreckfish 
in the South Atlantic EEZ, possess wreckfish in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ, offload wreckfish from the South Atlantic EEZ, or sell 
wreckfish in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, a commercial vessel permit 
for wreckfish must have been issued to the vessel and must be on board. 
To obtain a commercial vessel permit for wreckfish, the applicant must 
be a wreckfish shareholder; and either the shareholder must be the 
vessel owner or the owner or operator must be an employee, contractor, 
or agent of the shareholder. (See Sec. 622.15 for information on 
wreckfish shareholders.)
    (viii) South Atlantic rock shrimp. For a person aboard a vessel to 
fish for rock

[[Page 104]]

shrimp in the South Atlantic EEZ or possess rock shrimp in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ, a commercial vessel permit for rock shrimp must be 
issued to the vessel and must be on board.
    (ix) Gulf red snapper. For a person aboard a vessel for which a 
commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish has been issued to retain 
red snapper under the trip limits specified in Sec. 622.44(e)(1) or (2), 
a Class 1 or Class 2 Gulf red snapper license must have been issued to 
the vessel and must be on board. See paragraph (p) of this section 
regarding initial issue of red snapper licenses.
    (3) Coral permits--(i) Allowable chemical. For an individual to take 
or possess fish or other marine organisms with an allowable chemical in 
a coral area, other than fish or other marine organisms that are landed 
in Florida, a Federal allowable chemical permit must have been issued to 
the individual. Such permit must be available when the permitted 
activity is being conducted and when such fish or other marine organisms 
are possessed, through landing ashore.
    (ii) Allowable octocoral. For an individual to take or possess 
allowable octocoral in the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ, other than 
allowable octocoral that is landed in Florida, a Federal allowable 
octocoral permit must have been issued to the individual. Such permit 
must be available for inspection when the permitted activity is being 
conducted and when allowable octocoral is possessed, through landing 
ashore.
    (iii) Aquacultured live rock. For a person to take or possess 
aquacultured live rock in the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ, a Federal 
aquacultured live rock permit must have been issued for the specific 
harvest site. Such permit, or a copy, must be on board a vessel 
depositing or possessing material on an aquacultured live rock site or 
harvesting or possessing live rock from an aquacultured live rock site.
    (iv) Prohibited coral. A Federal permit may be issued to take or 
possess Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral or Caribbean prohibited 
coral only as scientific research activity, exempted fishing, or 
exempted educational activity. See Sec. 600.745 of this chapter for the 
procedures and limitations for such activities and fishing.
    (v) Florida permits. Appropriate Florida permits and endorsements 
are required for the following activities, without regard to whether 
they involve activities in the EEZ or Florida's waters:
    (A) Landing in Florida fish or other marine organisms taken with an 
allowable chemical in a coral area.
    (B) Landing allowable octocoral in Florida.
    (C) Landing live rock in Florida.
    (vi) Wild live rock permits. A Federal permit is required for a 
vessel to take or possess wild live rock in or from the Gulf EEZ. To be 
eligible for a wild live rock vessel permit, the current owner of the 
vessel for which the permit is requested must have had the required 
Florida permit and endorsements for live rock on or before February 3, 
1994, and a record of landings of live rock on or before February 3, 
1994, as documented on trip tickets received by the Florida Department 
of Environmental Protection before March 15, 1994. For landings other 
than in Florida, equivalent state permits/endorsements, if required, and 
landing records may be substituted for the Florida permits/endorsements 
and trip tickets. An owner will not be issued permits in numbers 
exceeding the number of vessels for which the owning entity had the 
requisite reported landings. An owner of a permitted vessel may transfer 
the vessel permit to another vessel owned by the same person by 
returning the existing permit with an application for a vessel permit 
for the replacement vessel. No wild live rock vessel permits will be 
issued after the quota for wild live rock in the Gulf, as specified in 
Sec. 622.42(b)(2), is reached or after December 31, 1996.
    (4) Dealer permits. For a dealer to receive Gulf reef fish, golden 
crab harvested from the South Atlantic EEZ, South Atlantic snapper-
grouper, rock shrimp harvested from the South Atlantic EEZ, or 
wreckfish, a dealer permit for Gulf reef fish, golden crab, South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper, rock shrimp, or wreckfish, respectively, must 
be issued to the dealer. To obtain a dealer permit, the applicant must 
have a valid state wholesaler's license

[[Page 105]]

in the state(s) where the dealer operates, if required by such state(s), 
and must have a physical facility at a fixed location in such state(s).
    (b) Applications for permits. Application forms for all permits are 
available from the RD. Completed application forms and all required 
supporting documents must be submitted to the RD at least 30 days prior 
to the date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made 
effective. All vessel permits are mailed to owners, whether the 
applicant is an owner or an operator.
    (1) Coral permits. (i) The applicant for a coral permit must be the 
individual who will be conducting the activity that requires the permit. 
In the case of a corporation or partnership that will be conducting live 
rock aquaculture activity, the applicant must be the principal 
shareholder or a general partner.
    (ii) An applicant must provide the following:
    (A) Name, address, telephone number, and other identifying

specification of the port of landing of aquacultured live rock, and a 
site evaluation report prepared pursuant to generally accepted industry 
standards that--
    (1) Provides accurate coordinates of the proposed harvesting site so 
that it can be located using LORAN or Global Positioning System 
equipment;
    (2) Shows the site on a chart in sufficient detail to determine its 
size and allow for site inspection;
    (3) Discusses possible hazards to safe navigation or hindrance to 
vessel traffic, traditional fishing operations, or other public access 
that may result from aquacultured live rock at the site;
    (4) Describes the naturally occurring bottom habitat at the site; 
and
    (5) Specifies the type and origin of material to be deposited on the 
site and how it will be distinguishable from the naturally occurring 
substrate.
    (2) Dealer permits. (i) The application for a dealer permit must be 
submitted by the owner (in the case of a corporation, an officer or 
shareholder; in the case of a partnership, a general partner).
    (ii) An applicant must provide the following:
    (A) A copy of each state wholesaler's license held by the dealer.
    (B) Name, address, telephone number, date the business was formed, 
and other identifying information of the business.
    (C) The address of each physical facility at a fixed location where

showing that applicable eligibility requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section have been met.
    (G) If a fish trap or sea bass pot will be used, the number, 
dimensions, and estimated cubic volume of the traps/pots that will be 
used and the applicant's desired color code for use in identifying his 
or her vessel and buoys (white is not an acceptable color code).
    (c) Change in application information. The owner or operator of a 
vessel with a permit or a dealer with a permit must notify the RD within 
30 days after any change in the application information specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section. The permit is void if any change in the 
information is not reported within 30 days.
    (d) Fees. A fee is charged for each application for a permit, 
license, or endorsement submitted under this section, for each request 
for transfer or replacement of such permit, license, or endorsement, and 
for each fish trap or sea bass pot identification tag required under 
Sec. 622.6(b)(1)(i)(B). The amount of each fee is calculated in 
accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available 
from the RD, for determining the administrative costs of each special 
product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified 
with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each 
application, request for transfer or replacement, or request for fish 
trap/sea bass pot identification tags.
    (e) Initial issuance. (1) The RD will issue an initial permit at any 
time to an applicant if the application is complete and the specific 
requirements for the requested permit have been met. An application is 
complete when all requested forms, information, and documentation have 
been received.
    (2) Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the RD will notify 
the applicant of the deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days of the date of the RD's letter of 
notification, the application will be considered abandoned.
    (f) Duration. A permit remains valid for the period specified on it 
unless it is revoked, suspended, or modified pursuant to subpart D of 15 
CFR part 904 or the vessel or dealership is sold.
    (g) Transfer. A vessel permit, license, or endorsement or dealer 
permit issued under this section is not transferable or assignable, 
except as provided in paragraph (m) of this section for a commercial 
vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, in paragraph (n) of this section for a 
fish trap endorsement, in paragraph (p) of this section for a red 
snapper license, in paragraph (q) of this section for a king mackerel 
permit, in Sec. 622.17(i) for a commercial vessel permit for golden 
crab, or in Sec. 622.18(e) for a commercial vessel permit for South 
Atlantic snapper-grouper. A person who acquires a vessel or dealership 
who desires to conduct activities for which a permit or endorsement is 
required must apply for a permit or endorsement in accordance with the 
provisions of this section. If the acquired vessel or dealership is 
currently permitted, the application must be accompanied by the original 
permit and a copy of a signed bill of sale or equivalent acquisition 
papers.
    (h) Renewal. Although a permit required by this section is issued on 
an annual basis, an application for permit renewal is required only 
every 2 years. In the interim years, a permit is renewed automatically 
(without application) for a vessel owner or dealer who has met the 
specific requirements for the requested permit, who has submitted all 
reports required under the Magnuson Act, and who is not subject to a 
permit sanction or denial under paragraph (j) of this section. An owner 
or dealer whose permit is expiring will be mailed a notification by the 
RD approximately 2 months prior to expiration of the current permit. 
That notification will advise the status of the renewal of the permit. 
That is, the notification will advise that the renewed permit will be 
issued without further

[[Page 107]]

action by the owner or dealer, that the permit is not eligible for 
automatic renewal, or that a new application is required. A notification 
that a permit is not eligible for automatic renewal will specify the 
reasons and will provide an opportunity for correction of any 
deficiencies. A notification that a new application is required will 
include a preprinted renewal application. An automatically renewed 
permit will be mailed by the RD approximately 1 month prior to 
expiration of the old permit. A vessel owner or dealer who does not 
receive a notification of status of renewal of a permit by 45 days prior 
to expiration of the current permit must contact the RD.
    (i) Display. A vessel permit, license, or endorsement issued under 
this section must be carried on board the vessel. A dealer permit issued 
under this section, or a copy thereof, must be available on the dealer's 
premises. In addition, a copy of the dealer's permit must accompany each 
vehicle that is used to pick up from a fishing vessel reef fish 
harvested from the Gulf EEZ. The operator of a vessel must present the 
permit, license, or endorsement for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer. A dealer or a vehicle operator must present the 
permit or a copy for inspection upon the request of an authorized 
officer.
    (j) Sanctions and denials. A permit, license, or endorsement issued 
pursuant to this section may be revoked, suspended, or modified, and a 
permit, license, or endorsement application may be denied, in accordance 
with the procedures governing enforcement-related permit sanctions and 
denials found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.
    (k) Alteration. A permit, license, or endorsement that is altered, 
erased, or mutilated is invalid.
    (l) Replacement. A replacement permit, license, or endorsement may 
be issued. An application for a replacement permit, license, or 
endorsement is not considered a new application.
    (m) Moratorium on commercial vessel permits for Gulf reef fish. The 
provisions of this paragraph (m) are applicable through December 31, 
2000.
    (1) No applications for additional commercial vessel permits for 
Gulf reef fish will be accepted. Existing vessel permits may be renewed, 
are subject to the restrictions on transfer or change in paragraphs 
(m)(2) through (5) of this section, and are subject to the requirement 
for timely renewal in paragraph (m)(6) of this section.
    (2) An owner of a permitted vessel may transfer the commercial 
vessel permit for Gulf reef fish to another vessel owned by the same 
entity.
    (3) An owner whose earned income qualified for the commercial vessel 
permit for Gulf reef fish may transfer the permit to the owner of 
another vessel, or to the new owner when he or she transfers ownership 
of the permitted vessel. Such owner of another vessel, or new owner, may 
receive a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish for his or her 
vessel, and renew it through April 15 following the first full calendar 
year after obtaining it, without meeting the earned income requirement 
of paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section. However, to further renew the 
commercial vessel permit, the owner of the other vessel, or new owner, 
must meet the earned income requirement not later than the first full 
calendar year after the permit transfer takes place.
    (4) An owner of a permitted vessel, the permit for which is based on 
an operator's earned income and, thus, is valid only when that person is 
the operator of the vessel, may transfer the permit to the income 
qualifying operator when such operator becomes an owner of a vessel.
    (5) An owner of a permitted vessel, the permit for which is based on 
an operator's earned income and, thus, is valid only when that person is 
the operator of the vessel, may have the operator qualification on the 
permit removed, and renew it without such qualification through April 15 
following the first full calendar year after removing it, without 
meeting the earned income requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this 
section. However, to further renew the commercial vessel permit, the 
owner must meet the earned income requirement not later than the first 
full

[[Page 108]]

calendar year after the operator qualification is removed. To have an 
operator qualification removed from a permit, the owner must return the 
original permit to the RD with an application for the changed permit.
    (6) A commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish that is not 
renewed or that is revoked will not be reissued. A permit is considered 
to be not renewed when an application for renewal is not received by the 
RD within 1 year of the expiration date of the permit.
    (n) Endorsements for fish traps in the Gulf. The provisions of this 
paragraph (n) are applicable through February 7, 2007. After February 7, 
2007, no fish trap endorsements are valid.
    (1) Only those fish trap endorsements that are valid on February 7, 
1997, may be renewed. Such endorsements are subject to the restrictions 
on transfer in paragraphs (n)(2) and (3) of this section and are subject 
to the requirement for timely renewal in paragraph (n)(5) of this 
section.
    (2) Through February 7, 1999, a fish trap endorsement may be 
transferred only to a vessel that has a commercial permit for reef fish.
    (3) After February 7, 1999, a fish trap endorsement is not 
transferable except as follows:
    (i) An owner of a vessel with a fish trap endorsement may transfer 
the endorsement to another vessel owned by the same entity.
    (ii) A fish trap endorsement is transferable upon a change of 
ownership of a permitted vessel with such endorsement from one to 
another of the following: Husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, 
mother, or father.
    (iii) When a change of ownership of a vessel with a fish trap 
endorsement is directly related to the disability or death of the owner, 
the RD may issue such endorsement, temporarily or permanently, with the 
commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish that is issued for the 
vessel under the new owner. Such new owner will be the person specified 
by the owner or his/her legal guardian, in the case of a disabled owner, 
or by the will or executor/administrator of the estate, in the case of a 
deceased owner. (Paragraphs (m)(3) and (4) of this section apply for the 
transfer of a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish upon 
disability or death of an owner.)
    (iv) A fish trap endorsement may be transferred to a vessel with a 
commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish whose owner has a record of 
landings of reef fish from fish traps in the Gulf EEZ, as reported on 
fishing vessel logbooks received by the SRD, from November 20, 1992, 
through February 6, 1994, and who was unable to obtain a fish trap 
endorsement for the vessel with the reported landings.
    (4) The owner of a vessel that is to receive a transferred 
endorsement must return the originals of the endorsed commercial vessel 
permit for Gulf reef fish and the unendorsed permit to the RD with an 
application for a fish trap endorsement for his or her vessel.
    (5) A fish trap endorsement that is not renewed or that is revoked 
will not be reissued. Such endorsement is considered to be not renewed 
when an application for renewal is not received by the RD within 1 year 
of the expiration date of the permit.
    (o) Endorsements for the use of gillnets for king mackerel in the 
Florida west coast subzone. Other paragraphs of this section 
notwithstanding--
    (1) An owner of a vessel that has a commercial vessel permit for 
king mackerel may add or delete a gillnet endorsement on a permit by 
returning to the RD the vessel's existing permit with a written request 
for addition or deletion of the gillnet endorsement. Such request must 
be postmarked or hand delivered during June, each year.
    (2) A gillnet endorsement may not be added or deleted from July 1 
through May 31 each year, any renewal of the permit during that period 
notwithstanding. From July 1 through May 31, a permitted vessel that is 
sold, if permitted by the new owner for king mackerel, will receive a 
permit with or without the gillnet endorsement as was the case for the 
vessel under the previous owner. From July 1 through May 31, the initial 
commercial vessel permit for king mackerel issued for a vessel new to 
the fishery will be issued without a gillnet endorsement.
    (p) Gulf red snapper licenses--(1) Class 1 licenses. To be eligible 
for the 2,000-lb (907-kg) trip limit for Gulf red snapper specified in 
Sec. 622.44(e)(1), a vessel must

[[Page 109]]

have been issued both a valid commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef 
fish and a valid Class 1 Gulf red snapper license, and such permit and 
license must be on board.
    (2) Class 2 licenses. To be eligible for the 200-lb (91-kg) trip 
limit for Gulf red snapper specified in Sec. 622.44(e)(2), a vessel must 
have been issued both a valid commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef 
fish and a valid Class 2 Gulf red snapper license, and such permit and 
license must be on board.
    (3) Operator restriction. An initial Gulf red snapper license that 
is issued for a vessel based on the qualification of an operator or 
historical captain is valid only when that operator or historical 
captain is the operator of the vessel. When applicable, this operator 
restriction is shown on the license.
    (4) Transfer of Gulf red snapper licenses. A red snapper license may 
be transferred independently of a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef 
fish. To request the transfer of a red snapper license, complete the 
transfer information on the reverse of the license and return it to the 
RD.
    (5) Initial issue of Gulf red snapper licenses--(i) Class 1 
licenses. (A) An initial Class 1 license will be issued for the vessel 
specified by the holder of a valid red snapper endorsement on March 1, 
1997, and to a historical captain. In the event of death or disability 
of such holder between March 1, 1997, and the date Class 1 licenses are 
issued, a Class 1 license will be issued for the vessel specified by the 
person to whom the red snapper endorsement was transferred.
    (B) Status as a historical captain is based on information collected 
under Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish 
Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) (59 FR 39301, August 2, 1994). A 
historical captain is an operator who--
    (1) From November 6, 1989, through 1993, fished solely under verbal 
or written share agreements with an owner, and such agreements provided 
for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, who was paid 
from the share under his or her control;
    (2) Landed from that vessel at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of red 
snapper per year in 2 of the 3 years 1990, 1991, and 1992;
    (3) Derived more than 50 percent of his or her earned income from 
commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch, in each of the years 
1989 through 1993; and
    (4) Landed red snapper prior to November 7, 1989.
    (ii) Class 2 licenses. (A) An initial Class 2 license will be issued 
for the vessel specified by an owner or operator whose income qualified 
for a commercial vessel permit for reef fish that was valid on March 1, 
1997, and such owner or operator was the person whose earned income 
qualified for a commercial vessel permit for reef fish that had a 
landing of red snapper during the period from January 1, 1990, through 
February 28, 1997.
    (B) For the purpose of paragraph (p)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, 
landings of red snapper are as recorded in the information collected 
under Amendment 9 to the FMP (59 FR 39301, August 2, 1994) for the 
period 1990 through 1992 and in fishing vessel logbooks, as required 
under Sec. 622.5(a)(1)(ii), received by the SRD not later than March 31, 
1997, for the period from January 1, 1993, through February 28, 1997.
    (C) A vessel's red snapper landings record during the period from 
January 1, 1990, through February 28, 1997, is retained by the owner at 
the time of the landings if the vessel's permit was transferred to 
another vessel owned by him or her. When a vessel has had a change of 
ownership and concurrent transfer of its permit, the vessel's red 
snapper landings record is credited to the owner of that vessel on March 
1, 1997, unless there is a legally binding agreement under which a 
previous owner retained the landings record. An owner who claims such 
retention of a landings record must submit a copy of the agreement to 
the RD postmarked or hand delivered not later than January 30, 1998. 
However, an owner who submits a copy of such agreement after January 6, 
1998, is not assured that a red snapper license will be issued before 
the opening of the commercial fishery for red snapper on February 1, 
1998.
    (6) Implementation procedures--(i) Initial notification. The RD will 
notify

[[Page 110]]

each owner of a vessel that had a valid permit for Gulf reef fish on 
March 1, 1997, each operator whose earned income qualified for a valid 
permit on that date, and each potential historical captain of his or her 
eligibility for a Class 1 or Class 2 red snapper license. Initial 
determinations of eligibility will be based on NMFS' records of red 
snapper endorsements, red snapper landings during the period from 
January 1, 1990, through February 28, 1997, and applications for 
historical captain status under Amendment 9 to the FMP (59 FR 39301, 
August 2, 1994). An owner, operator, or potential historical captain who 
concurs with NMFS' initial determination of eligibility need take no 
further action. Each owner, operator, and historical captain who is 
initially determined to be eligible will be issued an appropriate 
license not later than January 23, 1998.
    (ii) Reconsideration. (A) An owner, operator, or potential 
historical captain who does not concur with NMFS' initial determination 
of eligibility for historical captain status or for a Class 2 red 
snapper license may request reconsideration of that initial 
determination by the RD.
    (B) A written request for reconsideration must be submitted to the 
RD postmarked or hand delivered not later than February 10, 1998, and 
must provide written documentation supporting the basis for 
reconsideration. However, an owner who submits such request after 
January 13, 1998, is not assured that a red snapper license will be 
issued before the opening of the commercial fishery for red snapper on 
February 1, 1998. Upon request by the owner, operator, or potential 
historical captain, the RD will forward the initial determination, the 
request for reconsideration, and pertinent records to a committee 
consisting of the principal state officials who are members of the 
GMFMC, or their designees. An owner, operator, or potential historical 
captain may request to make a personal appearance before the committee 
in his or her request for reconsideration. If an owner, operator, or 
potential historical captain requests that his or her request be 
forwarded to the committee, such a request constitutes the applicant's 
written authorization under section 402(b)(1)(F) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) for the 
RD to make available to the committee members such confidential catch 
and other records as are pertinent to the matter under reconsideration.
    (C) Members of the committee will provide their individual 
recommendations for each application for reconsideration referred to the 
committee to the RD. The committee may only deliberate whether the 
eligibility criteria specified in paragraph (p)(5) of this section were 
applied correctly in the applicant's case, based solely on the available 
record, including documentation submitted by the applicant. Neither the 
committee nor the RD may consider whether a person should have been 
eligible for historical captain status or a Class 2 license because of 
hardship or other factors. The RD will make a final decision based on 
the initial eligibility criteria in paragraph (p)(5) of this section and 
the available record, including documentation submitted by the 
applicant, and, if the request is considered by the committee, the 
recommendations and comments from each member of the committee. The RD 
will notify the applicant of the decision and the reason therefore, in 
writing, within 15 days of receiving the recommendations of the 
committee members. If the application is not considered by the 
committee, the RD will provide such notification within 15 days of the 
RD's receipt of the request for reconsideration. The RD's decision will 
constitute the final administrative action by NMFS on an application for 
reconsideration.
    (q) Moratorium on commercial vessel permits for king mackerel. This 
paragraph (q) is effective through October 15, 2000.
    (1) Effective March 4, 1998, an initial commercial vessel permit for 
king mackerel will be issued only if the vessel owner was the owner of a 
vessel with a commercial vessel permit for king mackerel on or before 
October 16, 1995. A king mackerel permit for a vessel whose owner does 
not meet this moratorium criterion may be renewed only through April 30, 
1999.
    (2) To obtain a commercial vessel permit for king mackerel under the

[[Page 111]]

moratorium, an owner or operator of a vessel that does not have a valid 
king mackerel permit on March 4, 1998, must submit an application to the 
RD postmarked or hand delivered not later than June 2, 1998. Other than 
applications for renewals of commercial vessel permits for king 
mackerel, no applications for commercial vessel permits for king 
mackerel will be accepted after June 2, 1998. Application forms are 
available from the RD.
    (3) An owner will not be issued initial commercial vessel permits 
for king mackerel under the moratorium in numbers exceeding the number 
of vessels permitted in the king mackerel fishery that he/she owned 
simultaneously on or before October 16, 1995. If a vessel with a 
commercial vessel permit for king mackerel on or before October 16, 
1995, has been sold since that date, the owner on or before that date 
retains the right to the commercial vessel permit for king mackerel 
unless there is a written agreement that such right transfers to the new 
owner.
    (4) An owner of a permitted vessel may transfer the commercial 
vessel permit for king mackerel issued under this moratorium to another 
vessel owned by the same entity.
    (5) An owner whose percentage of earned income or gross sales 
qualified him/her for the commercial vessel permit for king mackerel 
issued under the moratorium may request that NMFS transfer that permit 
to the owner of another vessel, or to the new owner when he or she 
transfers ownership of the permitted vessel. Such owner of another 
vessel, or new owner, may receive a commercial vessel permit for king 
mackerel for his or her vessel, and renew it through April 15 following 
the first full calendar year after obtaining it, without meeting the 
percentage of earned income or gross sales requirement of paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section. However, to further renew the commercial 
vessel permit, the owner of the other vessel, or new owner, must meet 
the earned income or gross sales requirement not later than the first 
full calendar year after the permit transfer takes place.
    (6) An owner of a permitted vessel, the permit for which is based on 
an operator's earned income and, thus, is valid only when that person is 
the operator of the vessel, may request that NMFS transfer the permit to 
the income-qualifying operator when such operator becomes an owner of a 
vessel.
    (7) An owner of a permitted vessel, the permit for which is based on 
an operator's earned income and, thus, is valid only when that person is 
the operator of the vessel, may have the operator qualification on the 
permit removed, and renew it without such qualification through April 15 
following the first full calendar year after removing it, without 
meeting the earned income or gross sales requirement of paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section. However, to further renew the commercial 
vessel permit, the owner must meet the earned income or gross sales 
requirement not later than the first full calendar year after the 
operator qualification is removed. To have an operator qualification 
removed from a permit, the owner must return the original permit to the 
RD with an application for the changed permit.
    (8) NMFS will not reissue a commercial vessel permit for king 
mackerel if the permit is revoked or if the RD does not receive an 
application for renewal within 1 year of the permit's expiration date.

with the permit. This reporting requirement is waived for aquacultured 
live rock that is landed in Florida.
    (e) Additional data and inspection. Additional data will be 
collected by authorized statistical reporting agents and by authorized 
officers. A person who fishes for or possesses species in or from the 
EEZ governed in this part is required to make the applicable fish or 
parts thereof available for inspection by the SRD or an authorized 
officer upon request.
    (f) Commercial vessel, charter vessel, and headboat inventory. The

Sec. 622.6  Vessel and gear identification.

    (a) Vessel identification--(1) Applicability--(i) Official number. A 
vessel for which a permit has been issued under Sec. 622.4 or 
Sec. 622.17, and a vessel that fishes for or possesses shrimp in the 
Gulf EEZ, must display its official number--
    (A) On the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull and, 
for vessels over 25 ft (7.6 m) long, on an appropriate weather deck, so 
as to be clearly visible from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (B) In block arabic numerals permanently affixed to or painted on 
the vessel in contrasting color to the background.
    (C) At least 18 inches (45.7 cm) in height for vessels over 65 ft 
(19.8 m) long; at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) in height for vessels over 
25 ft (7.6 m) long; and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in height for vessels 
25 ft (7.6 m) long or less.
    (ii) Official number and color code. The following vessels must 
display their official number as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 
this section and, in addition, must display their assigned color code: A 
vessel for which a fish trap endorsement has been issued, as required 
under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(i); a vessel for which a permit has been issued 
to fish with a sea bass pot, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vi); a 
vessel in the commercial Caribbean reef fish fishery fishing with traps; 
and a vessel in the Caribbean spiny lobster fishery. Color codes 
required for the Caribbean reef fish fishery and Caribbean spiny lobster 
fishery are assigned by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
whichever is applicable; color codes required in all other fisheries are 
assigned by the RD. The color code must be displayed--
    (A) On the port and starboard sides of the deckhouse or hull and, 
for vessels over 25 ft (7.6 m) long, on an appropriate weather deck, so 
as to be clearly visible from an enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (B) In the form of a circle permanently affixed to or painted on the 
vessel.
    (C) At least 18 inches (45.7 cm) in diameter for vessels over 65 ft 
(19.8 m) long; at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) in diameter for vessels over 
25 ft (7.6 m) long; and at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter for 
vessels 25 ft (7.6 m) long or less.
    (2) Duties of operator. The operator of a vessel specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section must keep the official number and the 
color code, if applicable, clearly legible and in good repair

[[Page 116]]

and must ensure that no part of the fishing vessel, its rigging, fishing 
gear, or any other material on board obstructs the view of the official 
number or the color code, if applicable, from an enforcement vessel or 
aircraft.
    (b) Gear identification--(1) Traps/pots and associated buoys--(i) 
Traps or pots--(A) Caribbean EEZ. A fish trap or spiny lobster trap used 
or possessed in the Caribbean EEZ must display the official number 
specified for the vessel by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands so as 
to be easily identified.
    (B) Gulf and South Atlantic EEZ. A fish trap used or possessed in 
the Gulf EEZ and a sea bass pot used or possessed in the South Atlantic 
EEZ between 35 deg.15.3' N. lat. (due east of Cape Hatteras Light, NC) 
and 28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly 
Building, Cape Canaveral, FL), or a fish trap or sea bass pot on board a 
vessel with a commercial permit for Gulf reef fish or South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper, must have a valid identification tag issued by the RD 
attached. A golden crab trap used or possessed in the South Atlantic EEZ 
or on board a vessel with a commercial permit for golden crab must have 
the commercial vessel permit number permanently affixed so as to be 
easily distinguished, located, and identified; an identification tag 
issued by the RD may be used for this purpose but is not required.
    (ii) Associated buoys. A buoy that is attached to a trap or pot must 
display the official number and assigned color code so as to be easily 
distinguished, located, and identified as follows:
    (A) Caribbean EEZ. Each buoy must display the official number and 
color code assigned to the vessel by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, whichever is applicable.
    (B) Gulf and South Atlantic EEZ. Each buoy must display the official 
number and color code assigned by the RD. In the Gulf EEZ, a buoy must 
be attached to each trap, or each end trap if traps are connected by a 
line. In the South Atlantic EEZ, buoys are not required to be used, but, 
if used, each buoy must display the official number and color code. 
However, no color code is required on a buoy attached to a golden crab 
trap.
    (iii) Presumption of ownership. A Caribbean spiny lobster trap, a 
fish trap, a golden crab trap, or a sea bass pot in the EEZ will be 
presumed to be the property of the most recently documented owner. This 
presumption will not apply with respect to such traps and pots that are 
lost or sold if the owner reports the loss or sale within 15 days to the 
RD.
    (iv) Unmarked traps, pots, or buoys. An unmarked Caribbean spiny 
lobster trap, a fish trap, a golden crab trap, a sea bass pot, or a buoy 
deployed in the EEZ where such trap, pot, or buoy is required to be 
marked is illegal and may be disposed of in any appropriate manner by 
the Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer.
    (2) Gillnet buoys. On board a vessel with a valid Spanish mackerel 
permit that is fishing for Spanish mackerel in, or that possesses 
Spanish mackerel in or from, the South Atlantic EEZ off Florida north of 
25 deg.20.4' N. lat., which is a line directly east from the Dade/Monroe 
County, FL, boundary, the float line of each gillnet possessed, 
including any net in use, must have a maximum of nine distinctive 
floats, i.e., different from the usual net buoys, spaced uniformly at a 
distance of 100 yd (91.4 m) or less. Each such distinctive float must 
display the official number of the vessel.

                      Subpart B--Effort Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 622.15  Wreckfish individual transferable quota (ITQ) system.

    The provisions of this section apply to wreckfish in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ.
    (a) Percentage shares. (1) In accordance with the procedure 
specified in the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery 
of the South Atlantic Region, percentage shares of the quota for 
wreckfish have been assigned. Each person has been notified by the RD of 
his or her percentage share and shareholder certificate number.
    (2) All or a portion of a person's percentage shares may be 
transferred to another person. Transfer of shares must be reported on a 
form available from the RD. The RD will confirm, in writing, each 
transfer of shares. The effective date of each transfer is the 
confirmation date provided by the RD. The confirmation date will 
normally be not later than 3 working days after receipt of a properly 
completed transfer form. A fee is charged for each transfer of shares. 
The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of 
the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the RD, for determining the 
administrative costs of each special product or service provided by NOAA 
to non-Federal recipients. The fee may not exceed such costs and is 
specified with each transfer form. The appropriate fee must accompany 
each transfer form.
    (b) Lists of wreckfish shareholders and permitted vessels. Annually, 
on or about March 1, the RD will provide each wreckfish shareholder with 
a list of all wreckfish shareholders and their percentage shares, 
reflecting share transactions on forms received through February 15. 
Annually by April 15, the RD will provide each dealer who holds a dealer 
permit for wreckfish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4), with a list of 
vessels for which wreckfish permits have been issued, as required under 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vii). Annually, by April 15, the RD will provide each 
wreckfish shareholder with a list of dealers who have been issued dealer 
permits for wreckfish. From April 16 through January 14, updated lists 
will be provided when required. Updated lists may be obtained at other 
times or by a person who is not a wreckfish shareholder or wreckfish 
dealer permit holder by written request to the RD.
    (c) ITQs. (1) Annually, as soon after March 1 as the TAC for 
wreckfish for the fishing year that commences April 16 is known, the RD 
will calculate each wreckfish shareholder's ITQ. Each ITQ is the product 
of the wreckfish TAC, in round weight, for the ensuing fishing

[[Page 120]]

year, the factor for converting round weight to eviscerated weight, and 
each wreckfish shareholder's percentage share, reflecting share 
transactions reported on forms received by the RD through February 15. 
Thus, the ITQs will be in terms of eviscerated weight of wreckfish.
    (2) The RD will provide each wreckfish shareholder with ITQ coupons 
in various denominations, the total of which equals his or her ITQ, and 
a copy of the calculations used in determining his or her ITQ. Each 
coupon will be coded to indicate the initial recipient.
    (3) An ITQ coupon may be transferred from one wreckfish shareholder 
to another by completing the sale endorsement thereon (that is, the 
signature and shareholder certificate number of the buyer). An ITQ 
coupon may be possessed only by the shareholder to whom it has been 
issued, or by the shareholder's employee, contractor, or agent, unless 
the ITQ coupon has been transferred to another shareholder. An ITQ 
coupon that has been transferred to another shareholder may be possessed 
only by the shareholder whose signature appears on the coupon as the 
buyer, or by the shareholder's employee, contractor, or agent, and with 
all required sale endorsements properly completed.
    (4) Wreckfish may not be possessed on board a fishing vessel--
    (i) In an amount exceeding the total of the ITQ coupons on board the 
vessel;
    (ii) That does not have on board a commercial vessel permit for 
wreckfish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vii); or
    (iii) That does not have on board logbook forms for that fishing 
trip, as required under Sec. 622.5(a)(1)(iv)(B).
    (5) Prior to termination of a trip, a signature and date signed must 
be affixed in ink to the ``Fisherman'' part of ITQ coupons in 
denominations equal to the eviscerated weight of the wreckfish on board. 
The ``Fisherman'' part of each such coupon must be separated from the 
coupon and submitted with the logbook forms required by 
Sec. 622.5(a)(1)(iv)(B) for that fishing trip.
    (6) The ``Fish House'' part of each such coupon must be given to the 
dealer to whom the wreckfish are transferred in amounts totaling the 
eviscerated weight of the wreckfish transferred to that dealer. A 
wreckfish may be transferred only to a dealer who holds a dealer permit 
for wreckfish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4).
    (7) A dealer may receive a wreckfish only from a vessel for which a 
commercial permit for wreckfish has been issued, as required under 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vii). A dealer must receive the ``Fish House'' part of 
ITQ coupons in amounts totaling the eviscerated weight of the wreckfish 
received; enter the permit number of the vessel from which the wreckfish 
were received, enter the date the wreckfish were received, enter the 
dealer's permit number, and sign each such ``Fish House'' part; and 
submit all such parts with the dealer reports required by 
Sec. 622.5(c)(5)(i).
    (8) An owner or operator of a vessel and a dealer must make 
available to an authorized officer all ITQ coupons in his or her 
possession upon request.
    (d) Wreckfish limitations. (1) A wreckfish taken in the South 
Atlantic EEZ may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where the 
transfer takes place; and a wreckfish may not be transferred in the 
South Atlantic EEZ.
    (2) A wreckfish possessed by a fisherman or dealer shoreward of the 
outer boundary of the South Atlantic EEZ or in a South Atlantic coastal 
state will be presumed to have been harvested from the South Atlantic 
EEZ unless accompanied by documentation that it was harvested from other 
than the South Atlantic EEZ.
    (3) A wreckfish may be offloaded from a fishing vessel only between 
8 a.m. and 5 p.m., local time.
    (4) If a wreckfish is to be offloaded at a location other than a 
fixed facility of a dealer who holds a dealer permit for wreckfish, as 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4), the wreckfish shareholder or the vessel 
operator must advise the NMFS, Office of Enforcement, Southeast Region, 
St. Petersburg, FL, by telephone (1-800-853-1964), of the location not 
less than 24 hours prior to offloading.

<R05>
Sec. 622.16  Red snapper individual transferable quota (ITQ) system.

    The ITQ system established by this section will remain in effect 
through March 31, 2000, during which time NMFS and the GMFMC will 
evaluate the effectiveness of the system. Based on the evaluation, the 
system may be modified, extended, or terminated.
    (a) Percentage shares. (1) Initial percentage shares of the annual 
quota of red snapper are assigned to persons in accordance with the 
procedure specified in Amendment 8 to the Fishery Management Plan for 
the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) and in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. Each person is notified by the RD 
of his or her initial percentage shares. If additional shares become 
available to NMFS, such as by forfeiture pursuant to subpart F of 15 CFR 
part 904 for rule violations, such shares will be proportionately 
reissued to shareholders based on their shares as of November 1, after 
the additional shares become available. If NMFS is required to issue 
additional shares, such as may be required in the resolution of 
disputes, existing shares will be proportionately reduced. This 
reduction of shares will be based on shares as of November 1 after the 
required addition of shares.
    (2) All or a portion of a person's percentage shares may be 
transferred to another person who is a U.S. citizen or permanent 
resident alien. (See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for restrictions 
on the transfer of shares in the initial months under the ITQ system.) 
Transfer of shares must be reported on a form available from the RD. The 
RD will confirm, in writing, the registration of each transfer. The 
effective date of each transfer is the confirmation date provided by the 
RD. The confirmation of registration date will normally be not later 
than 3 working days after receipt of a properly completed transfer form. 
However, reports of share transfers received by the RD from November 1 
through December 31 will not be recorded or confirmed until after 
January 1. A fee is charged for each transfer of percentage shares. The 
amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of the 
NOAA Finance Handbook for determining the administrative costs of each 
special product or service provided by NOAA to non-Federal recipients. 
The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each transfer 
form. The appropriate fee must accompany each transfer form.
    (3) On or about January 1 each year, the RD will provide each red 
snapper shareholder with a list of all red snapper shareholders and 
their percentage shares, reflecting share transfers as indicated on 
properly completed transfer forms received through October 31. Updated 
lists may be obtained at other times, and by persons who are not red 
snapper shareholders, by written request to the RD.
    (b) ITQs. (1) Annually, as soon after November 15 as the following 
year's red snapper quota is established, the RD will calculate each red 
snapper shareholder's ITQ in terms of eviscerated weight. Each ITQ is 
the product of the red snapper quota, in round weight, for the ensuing 
fishing year, the factor for converting round weight to eviscerated 
weight, and each red snapper shareholder's percentage share, reflecting 
share transfers reported on forms received by the RD through October 31.
    (2) The RD will provide each red snapper shareholder with ITQ 
coupons in various denominations, the total of which equals his or her 
ITQ, and a copy of the calculations used in determining his or her ITQ. 
Each coupon will be coded to indicate the initial recipient.
    (3) An ITQ coupon may be transferred. If the transfer is by sale, 
the seller must enter the sale price on the coupon.
    (4) Except when the red snapper bag limit applies, red snapper in or 
from the EEZ or on board a vessel that has been issued a commercial 
permit for Gulf reef fish, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(v), may 
not be possessed in an amount, in eviscerated weight, exceeding the 
total of ITQ coupons on board. (See Sec. 622.39(a) for applicability of 
the bag limit.)
    (5) Prior to termination of a trip, the operator's signature and the 
date signed must be written in ink on the ``Vessel'' part of ITQ coupons 
totaling at least the eviscerated weight of the red snapper on board. An 
owner or operator of a vessel must separate the

[[Page 122]]

``Vessel'' part of each such coupon, enter thereon the permit number of 
the dealer to whom the red snapper are transferred, and submit the 
``Vessel'' parts with the logbook forms for that fishing trip. An owner 
or operator of a vessel must make available to an authorized officer all 
ITQ coupons in his or her possession upon request.
    (6) Red snapper harvested from the EEZ or possessed by a vessel with 
a commercial permit for Gulf reef fish, as required under 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(v), may be transferred only to a dealer with a Gulf 
reef fish permit, as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4). The ``Fish House'' 
part of each ITQ coupon must be given to such dealer, or the agent or 
employee of such dealer, in amounts totaling at least the eviscerated 
weight of the red snapper transferred to that dealer.
    (7) A dealer with a Gulf reef fish permit may receive red snapper 
only from a vessel that has on board a commercial permit for Gulf reef 
fish. A dealer, or the agent or employee of a dealer, must receive the 
``Fish House'' part of ITQ coupons totaling at least the eviscerated 
weight of the red snapper received. Immediately upon receipt of red 
snapper, the dealer, or the agent or employee of the dealer, must enter 
the permit number of the vessel received from and date and sign each 
such ``Fish House'' part. The dealer must submit all such parts as 
required by paragraph (d)(6) of this section. A dealer, agent, or 
employee must make available to an authorized officer all ITQ coupons in 
his or her possession upon request.
    (c) Procedures for implementation--(1) Initial shareholders. The 
following persons are initial shareholders in the red snapper ITQ 
system:
    (i) Either the owner or operator of a vessel with a valid permit on 
August 29, 1995, provided such owner or operator had a landing of red 
snapper during the period 1990 through 1992. If the earned income of an 
operator was used to qualify for the permit that is valid on August 29, 
1995, such operator is the initial shareholder rather than the owner. In 
the case of an owner, the term ``person'' includes a corporation or 
other legal entity; and
    (ii) A historical captain. A historical captain means an operator 
who meets all of the following qualifications:
    (A) From November 6, 1989, through 1993, fished solely under verbal 
or written share agreements with an owner, and such agreements provided 
for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, who was paid 
from the share under his or her control.
    (B) Landed from that vessel at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of red 
snapper per year in 2 of the 3 years 1990, 1991, and 1992.
    (C) Derived more than 50 percent of his or her earned income from 
commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch, in each of the years 
1989 through 1993.
    (D) Landed red snapper prior to November 7, 1989.
    (2) Initial shares. (i) Initial shares are apportioned to initial 
shareholders based on each shareholder's average of the top 2 years' 
landings in 1990, 1991, and 1992. However, no person who is an initial 
shareholder under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will receive an 
initial percentage share that will amount to less than 100 lb (45.36 
kg), round weight, of red snapper (90 lb (41 kg), eviscerated weight).
    (ii) The percentage shares remaining after the minimum shares have 
been calculated under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section are 
apportioned based on each remaining shareholder's average of the top 2 
years' landings in 1990, 1991, and 1992. In a case where a landing is 
associated with an owner and a historical captain, such landing is 
apportioned between the owner and historical captain in accordance with 
the share agreement in effect at the time of the landing.
    (iii) The determinations of landings of red snapper during the 
period 1990 through 1992 and historical captain status are made in 
accordance with the data collected under Amendment 9 to the FMP. Those 
data identify each red snapper landing during the period 1990 through 
1992. Each landing is associated with an owner and, when an operator's 
earned income was used to qualify for the vessel permit at the time of 
the landing, with such operator. Where appropriate, a landing is also 
associated with a historical captain. However, a red snapper landings 
record during that period that is associated solely with an owner may be 
retained by that owner or transferred as follows:

[[Page 123]]

    (A) An owner of a vessel with a valid commercial permit for Gulf 
reef fish on August 29, 1995, who transferred a vessel permit to another 
vessel owned by him or her will retain the red snapper landings record 
for the previous vessel.
    (B) An owner of a vessel with a valid commercial permit for Gulf 
reef fish on August 29, 1995, will retain the landings record of a 
permitted vessel if the vessel had a change of ownership to another 
entity without a substantive change in control of the vessel. It will be 
presumed that there was no substantive change in control of a vessel if 
a successor in interest received at least a 50 percent interest in the 
vessel as a result of the change of ownership whether the change of 
ownership was--
    (1) From a closely held corporation to its majority shareholder;
    (2) From an individual who became the majority shareholder of a 
closely held corporation receiving the vessel;
    (3) Between closely held corporations with a common majority 
shareholder; or
    (4) From one to another of the following: Husband, wife, son, 
daughter, brother, sister, mother, or father.
    (C) In other cases of transfer of a permit through change of 
ownership of a vessel, an owner of a vessel with a valid commercial 
permit for Gulf reef fish on August 29, 1995, will receive credit for 
the landings record of the vessel before his or her ownership only if 
there is a legally binding agreement for transfer of the landings 
record.
    (iv) Requests for transfers of landings records must be submitted to 
the RD and must be postmarked not later than December 14, 1995. The RD 
may require documentation supporting such request. After considering 
requests for transfers of landings records, the RD will advise each 
initial shareholder or applicant of his or her tentative allocation of 
shares.
    (3) Notification of status. The RD will advise each owner, operator, 
and historical captain for whom NMFS has a record of a red snapper 
landing during the period 1990 through 1992, including those who 
submitted such record under Amendment 9 to the FMP, of his or her 
tentative status as an initial shareholder and the tentative landings 
record that will be used to calculate his or her initial share.
    (4) Appeals. (i) A special advisory panel, appointed by the GMFMC to 
function as an appeals board, will consider written requests from 
persons who contest their tentative status as an initial shareholder, 
including historical captain status, or tentative landings record. In 
addition to considering written requests, the board may allow personal 
appearances by such persons before the board.
    (ii) The panel is only empowered to consider disputed calculations 
or determinations based on documentation submitted under Amendment 9 to 
the FMP regarding landings of red snapper during the period 1990 through 
1992, including transfers of such landings records, or regarding 
historical captain status. In addition, the panel may consider 
applications and documentation of landings not submitted under Amendment 
9 if, in the board's opinion, there is justification for the late 
application and documentation. The board is not empowered to consider an 
application from a person who believes he or she should be eligible 
because of hardship or other factors.
    (iii) A written request for consideration by the board must be 
submitted to the RD, postmarked not later than December 27, 1995, and 
must contain documentation supporting the allegations that form the 
basis for the request.
    (iv) The board will meet as necessary to consider each request that 
is submitted in a timely manner. Members of the appeals board will 
provide their individual recommendations for each appeal to the GMFMC, 
which will in turn submit its recommendation to the RD. The board and 
the GMFMC will recommend whether the eligibility criteria, specified in 
Amendment 8 to the FMP and paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, 
were correctly applied in each case, based solely on the available 
record including documentation submitted by the applicant. The GMFMC 
will also base its recommendation on the recommendations of the board. 
The RD will decide the appeal based on the above criteria and the 
available record, including documentation submitted by the applicant and 
the recommendation

[[Page 124]]

of the GMFMC. The RD will notify the appellant of his decision and the 
reason therefor, in writing, normally within 45 days of receiving the 
GMFMC's recommendation. The RD's decision will constitute the final 
administrative action by NMFS on an appeal.
    (v) Upon completion of the appeal process, the RD will issue share 
certificates to initial shareholders.
    (5) Transfers of shares. The following restrictions apply to the 
transfer of shares:
    (i) The transfer of shares is prohibited through September 30, 1996.
    (ii) From October 1, 1996, through September 30, 1997, shares may be 
transferred only to other persons who are initial shareholders and are 
U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens.
    (d) Exceptions/additions to general measures. Other provisions of 
this part notwithstanding--
    (1) Management of the red snapper ITQ system extends to adjoining 
state waters in the manner stated in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of 
this section.
    (2) For a dealer to receive red snapper harvested from state waters 
adjoining the Gulf EEZ by or possessed on board a vessel with a 
commercial permit for Gulf reef fish, the dealer permit for Gulf reef 
fish specified in Sec. 622.4(a)(4) must have been issued to the dealer.
    (3) A copy of the dealer's permit must accompany each vehicle that 
is used to pick up from a fishing vessel red snapper from adjoining 
state waters harvested by or possessed on board a vessel with a 
commercial permit for Gulf reef fish.
    (4) As a condition of a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, 
without regard to where red snapper are harvested or possessed, a vessel 
with such permit must comply with the red snapper ITQ requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section; may not transfer or receive red snapper 
at sea; and must maintain red snapper with head and fins intact through 
landing, and the exceptions to that requirement contained in 
Sec. 622.38(d) do not apply to red snapper. Red snapper may be 
eviscerated, gilled, and scaled but must otherwise be maintained in a 
whole condition.
    (5) As a condition of a dealer permit for Gulf reef fish, as 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(4) or under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, without regard to where red snapper are harvested or possessed, 
a permitted dealer must comply with the red snapper ITQ requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (6) In any month that a red snapper is received, a dealer must 
submit the report required under Sec. 622.5(c)(3)(ii). The ``Fish 
House'' parts of red snapper individual transferable coupons, received 
during the month in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must 
be submitted to the SRD with the report.
    (7) It is unlawful for a person to do any of the following:
    (i) Receive red snapper from a fishing vessel without a dealer 
permit for Gulf reef fish.
    (ii) Fail to carry a copy of the dealer's permit, as specified in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (iii) Fail to comply with a condition of a permit, as specified in 
paragraph (d)(4) or (d)(5) of this section.
    (iv) Fail to report red snapper received, as specified in paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section.

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 48415, Sept. 13, 1996, Sec. 622.16 was 
stayed indefinitely.


<R05>
Sec. 622.17  South Atlantic golden crab controlled access.

    (a) Applicability. For a person aboard a vessel to fish for golden 
crab in the South Atlantic EEZ, possess golden crab in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ, off-load golden crab from the South Atlantic EEZ, or sell 
golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ, a commercial vessel 
permit for golden crab must be issued to the vessel and must be on 
board. It is a rebuttable presumption that a golden crab on board or 
off-loaded from a vessel in the South Atlantic was harvested from the 
South Atlantic EEZ.
    (b) Initial eligibility. A vessel is eligible for an initial 
commercial vessel permit for golden crab if the owner meets the 
documentation requirements described in paragraph (c) of this section 
substantiating his or her landings of golden crab harvested from the 
South Atlantic EEZ in quantities of at least 600 lb (272 kg) by April 7, 
1995, or at least 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) by September 1, 1995. Only the 
owner of a vessel at the time landings occurred may use those landings 
to meet the eligibility

[[Page 125]]

requirements described in this paragraph, except if that owner 
transferred the right to use those landings to a subsequent owner in 
writing as part of the vessel's sales agreement. If evidence of such 
agreement is provided to the RD, the subsequent owner may use those 
landings to meet the eligibility requirements instead of the owner of 
the vessel at the time the landings occurred.
    (c) Documentation of eligibility. The documentation requirements 
described in this paragraph are the only acceptable means for an owner 
to establish a vessel's eligibility for an initial permit. Failure to 
meet the documentation requirements, including submission of data as 
required, will result in failure to qualify for an initial commercial 
vessel permit. Acceptable sources of documentation include: Landings 
documented by the trip ticket systems of Florida or South Carolina as 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and data substantiating 
landings that occurred prior to establishment of the respective trip 
ticket systems or landings that occurred in North Carolina or Georgia as 
described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (1) Trip ticket data. NMFS has access to records of golden crab 
landings reported under the trip ticket systems in Florida and South 
Carolina. No further documentation or submission of these records is 
required if the applicant was the owner of the harvesting vessel at the 
time of the landings documented by these records. An applicant will be 
given printouts of trip ticket records for landings made when the 
applicant owned the harvesting vessel, and an applicant will have an 
opportunity to submit records of landings he or she believes should have 
been included on such printouts or to clarify allocation of landings 
shown on such printouts. Landings reported under these trip ticket 
systems and received by the respective states prior to December 31, 
1995, with such adjustments/clarifications for landings for which there 
is adequate documentation that they should have been included on the 
printouts, are conclusive as to landings in the respective states during 
the period that landing reports were required or voluntarily submitted 
by a vessel. For such time periods, landings data from other sources 
will not be considered for landings in these states.
    (2) Additional landings data. (i) An owner of a vessel that does not 
meet the criteria for initial eligibility for a commercial vessel permit 
based on landings documented by the trip ticket systems of Florida or 
South Carolina may submit documentation of required landings that either 
occurred prior to the implementation of the respective trip ticket 
systems or occurred in North Carolina or Georgia. Acceptable 
documentation of such landings consists of trip receipts or dealer 
records that definitively show the species known as golden crab; the 
vessel's name, official number, or other reference that clearly 
identifies the vessel; and dates and amounts of South Atlantic golden 
crab landings. In addition, a sworn affidavit may be submitted to 
document landings. A sworn affidavit is a notarized written statement 
wherein the individual signing the affidavit affirms under penalty of 
perjury that the information presented is accurate to the best of his or 
her knowledge, information, and belief.
    (ii) Documentation by a combination of trip receipts and dealer 
records is acceptable, but duplicate records for the same landings will 
not result in additional credit.
    (iii) Additional data submitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section must be attached to a Golden Crab Landings Data form, which is 
available from the RD.
    (3) Verification. Documentation of golden crab landings from the 
South Atlantic EEZ and other information submitted under this section 
are subject to verification by comparison with state, Federal, and other 
records and information. Submission of false documentation or 
information may disqualify a person from initial participation under the 
South Atlantic golden crab controlled access program.
    (d) Application procedure. Permit application forms are available 
from the RD. An application for an initial commercial vessel permit that 
is postmarked or hand-delivered after September 26, 1996, will not be 
accepted.
    (1) An application for a commercial vessel permit must be submitted 
and

[[Page 126]]

signed by the vessel owner (in the case of a corporate-owned vessel, an 
officer or shareholder who meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section; in the case of a partnership-owned vessel, a general 
partner who meets these requirements).
    (2) An owner must provide the following:
    (i) A copy of the vessel's valid U.S. Coast Guard certificate of 
documentation or, if not documented, a copy of its valid state 
registration certificate.
    (ii) Vessel name and official number.
    (iii) Name, address, telephone number, and other identifying 
information of the vessel owner.
    (iv) Documentation of initial eligibility, as specified in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (v) The fishing zone in which the vessel will fish, as specified in 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (vi) Any other information concerning the vessel, gear 
characteristics, principal fisheries engaged in, or fishing areas, as 
specified on the application form.
    (vii) Any other information that may be necessary for the issuance 
or administration of the permit, as specified on the application form.
    (e) Issuance. (1) The RD will mail an initial commercial vessel 
permit to an applicant no later than October 28, 1996, if the 
application is complete and the eligibility requirements specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section are met.
    (2) Upon receipt of an incomplete application that is postmarked or 
hand-delivered on or before September 26, 1996, the RD will notify the 
applicant of the deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days of the date of the RD's notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (3) The RD will notify an applicant, in writing, no later than 
October 28, 1996, if the RD determines that the applicant fails to meet 
the eligibility requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) Appeals. (1) An appeal of the RD's decision regarding initial 
permit eligibility may be submitted to an ad hoc appeals committee 
appointed by the SAFMC.
    (2) The appeals committee is empowered only to deliberate whether 
the eligibility criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section were 
applied correctly to the appellant's application. In making that 
determination, the appeals committee members will consider only disputed 
calculations and determinations based on documentation provided as 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section, including transfers of 
landings records. The appeals committee is not empowered to consider 
whether a person should have been eligible for a commercial vessel 
permit because of hardship or other factors.
    (3) A written request for consideration of an appeal must be 
submitted within 30 days of the date of the RD's notification denying 
permit issuance and must provide written documentation supporting the 
basis for the appeal. Such a request must contain the appellant's 
acknowledgment that the confidentiality provisions of the Magnuson Act 
at 16 U.S.C. 1853(d) and subpart E of part 600 of this chapter are 
waived with respect to any information supplied by the RD to the SAFMC 
and its advisory bodies for purposes of receiving the recommendations of 
the appeals committee members on the appeal. An appellant may also make 
a personal appearance before the appeals committee.
    (4) The appeals committee will meet only once to consider appeals 
submitted within the time period specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section. Members of the appeals committee will provide their individual 
recommendations for each appeal to the RD. Members of the appeals 
committee may comment upon whether the eligibility criteria, specified 
in the FMP and in paragraph (b) of this section, were correctly applied 
in each case, based solely on the available record, including 
documentation submitted by the appellant. The RD will decide the appeal 
based on the initial eligibility criteria in paragraph (b) of this 
section and the available record, including documentation submitted by 
the appellant and the recommendations and comments from members of the 
appeals committee. The RD will notify the appellant of the decision and 
the reason therefore, in

[[Page 127]]

writing, normally within 30 days of receiving the recommendation from 
the appeals committee members. The RD's decision will constitute the 
final administrative action by NMFS on an appeal.
    (g) Display. A commercial vessel permit issued under this section 
must be carried on board the vessel. The operator of a vessel must 
present the permit for inspection upon the request of an authorized 
officer.
    (h) Fishing zones. (1) The South Atlantic EEZ is divided into three 
fishing zones for golden crab. A vessel owner must indicate on the 
initial application for a commercial vessel permit the zone in which the 
vessel will fish. A permitted vessel may fish for golden crab only in 
the zone shown on its permit. A vessel may possess golden crab only in 
that zone, except that other zones may be transited if the vessel 
notifies NMFS, Office of Enforcement, Southeast Region, St. Petersburg, 
FL, by telephone (813-570-5344) in advance and does not fish in an 
unpermitted zone. The designated fishing zones are as follows:
    (i) Northern zone--the South Atlantic EEZ north of 28 deg. N. lat.
    (ii) Middle zone--the South Atlantic EEZ from 25 deg. N. lat. to 
28 deg. N. lat.
    (iii) Southern zone--the South Atlantic EEZ south of 25 deg. N. lat.
    (2) An owner of a permitted vessel may have the zone specified on a 
permit changed only when the change is from the middle or southern zone 
to the northern zone. A request for such change must be submitted to the 
RD with the existing permit.
    (i) Transfer. (1) A valid golden crab permit may be transferred for 
use by another vessel by returning the existing permit(s) to the RD 
along with an application for a permit for the replacement vessel.
    (2) To obtain a commercial vessel permit via transfer, the owner of 
the replacement vessel must submit to the RD a valid permit for a vessel 
with a documented length overall, or permits for vessels with documented 
aggregate lengths overall, of at least 90 percent of the documented 
length overall of the replacement vessel.
    (j) Renewal. (1) In addition to the procedures and requirements of 
Sec. 622.4(h) for commercial vessel permit renewals, for a golden crab 
permit to be renewed, the SRD must have received reports for the 
permitted vessel, as required by Sec. 622.5(a)(1)(v), documenting that 
at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of golden crab were landed from the South 
Atlantic EEZ by the permitted vessel during at least one of the two 12-
month periods immediately prior to the expiration date of the vessel 
permit.
    (2) An existing permit for a vessel meeting the minimum golden crab 
landing requirement specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section may be 
renewed by following the procedure specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section. However, documentation of the vessel's initial eligibility need 
not be resubmitted.

[61 FR 43957, 43959, Aug. 27, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 622.18  South Atlantic snapper-grouper limited access.

    (a) Applicability. Beginning December 14, 1998, the only valid 
commercial vessel permits for South Atlantic snapper-grouper are those 
that have been issued under the limited access criteria in this section. 
A vessel may have either a transferable commercial permit or a trip-
limited commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper.
    (b) Initial eligibility. A vessel is eligible for an initial limited 
access commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper if the owner 
owned a vessel with a commercial vessel permit for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper at any time from February 11, 1996, through February 11, 
1997, and owned a permitted vessel that had at least one landing of 
snapper-grouper from the South Atlantic from January 1, 1993, through 
August 20, 1996, as reported on fishing vessel logbooks received by the 
SRD on or before August 20, 1996. An owner whose permitted vessels had 
landings of snapper-grouper from the South Atlantic of at least 1,000 lb 
(453.6 kg), whole weight, in any one of the years 1993, 1994, or 1995, 
or in 1996 through August 20, as reported on fishing vessel logbooks 
received by the SRD on or before August 20, 1996, is eligible for an 
initial transferable permit. All other qualifying owners are eligible 
for an initial trip-limited permit.

[[Page 128]]

    (c) Determinations of eligibility--(1) Permit history. The sole 
basis for determining whether a vessel had a commercial vessel permit 
for South Atlantic snapper-grouper at any time from February 11, 1996, 
through February 11, 1997, is NMFS' permit records. An owner of a 
currently permitted vessel who believes he/she meets the February 11, 
1996, through February 11, 1997, permit history criterion based on 
ownership of a vessel under a different name, as may have occurred when 
ownership has changed from individual to corporate or vice versa, must 
document his/her continuity of ownership. No more than one owner of a 
currently permitted vessel will be credited with meeting the permit 
history criterion based on a vessel's permit history.
    (2) Landings. (i) Landings of snapper-grouper from the South 
Atlantic during the qualifying period are determined from fishing vessel 
logbooks received by the SRD on or before August 20, 1996. State trip 
ticket data may be considered in support of claimed landings provided 
such trip ticket data were received by the state on or before September 
20, 1996.
    (ii) Only landings when a vessel had a valid commercial permit for 
snapper-grouper and only landings that were harvested, landed, and sold 
in compliance with state and Federal regulations may be used to 
establish eligibility.
    (iii) For the purpose of eligibility for a limited access commercial 
permit for snapper-grouper, the owner of a vessel that had a commercial 
snapper-grouper permit during the qualifying period retains the snapper-
grouper landings record of that vessel during the time of his/her 
ownership unless a sale of the vessel included a written agreement that 
credit for such landings was transferred to the new owner. Such transfer 
of credit must be for the vessel's entire record of landings of snapper-
grouper from the South Atlantic.
    (d) Implementation procedures--(1) Notification of status. On or 
about July 27, 1998, the RD will notify each owner of a vessel that had 
a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper at any time from 
February 11, 1996, through February 11, 1997, and each owner of a vessel 
that has a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper on July 
16, 1998, of NMFS' initial determination of eligibility for either a 
transferable or a trip-limited, limited access commercial permit for 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper. Each notification will include an 
application for such permit. Addresses for such notifications will be 
based on NMFS' permit records. A vessel owner who believes he/she 
qualifies for a limited access commercial permit for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper and who does not receive such notification must obtain 
an application from the RD.
    (2) Applications. (i) An owner of a vessel who desires a limited 
access commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper must submit 
an application for such permit postmarked or hand-delivered not later 
than October 14, 1998. Failure to apply in a timely manner will preclude 
permit issuance even when the vessel owner meets the eligibility 
criteria for such permit.
    (ii) A vessel owner who agrees with NMFS' initial determination of 
eligibility, including type of permit (transferable or trip-limited), 
need provide no documentation of eligibility with his/her application.
    (iii) A vessel owner who disagrees with the initial determination of 
eligibility or type of permit must specify the type of permit applied 
for and provide documentation of eligibility. Documentation and other 
information submitted on or with an application are subject to 
verification by comparison with state, Federal, and other records and 
information. Submission of false documentation or information may 
disqualify an owner from initial participation in the limited access 
commercial South Atlantic snapper-grouper fishery and is a violation of 
the regulations in this part.
    (iv) If an application that is postmarked or hand delivered in a 
timely manner is incomplete, the RD will notify the vessel owner of the 
deficiency. If the owner fails to correct the deficiency within 20 days 
of the date of the RD's notification, the application will be considered 
abandoned.
    (3) Issuance. (i) If a complete application is submitted in a timely 
manner and the eligibility requirements specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section are

[[Page 129]]

met, the RD will issue an initial commercial vessel permit, transferable 
or trip-limited, as appropriate, and mail it to the vessel owner not 
later than December 3, 1998.
    (ii) If the eligibility requirements specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section are not met, the RD will notify the vessel owner, in 
writing, not later than November 13, 1998 of such determination and the 
reasons for it.
    (4) Reconsideration. (i) A vessel owner may request reconsideration 
of the RD's determination regarding initial permit eligibility by 
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the RD. Such request 
must be postmarked or hand delivered within 20 days of the date of the 
RD's notification denying initial permit issuance and must provide 
written documentation supporting permit eligibility.
    (ii) Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration, the RD will 
forward the initial application, the RD's response to that application, 
the request for reconsideration, and pertinent records to an Application 
Oversight Board consisting of state directors (or their designees) from 
each state in the Council's area of jurisdiction. Upon request, a vessel 
owner may make a personal appearance before the Application Oversight 
Board.
    (iii) If reconsideration by the Application Oversight Board is 
requested, such request constitutes the vessel owner's written 
authorization under section 402(b)(1)(F) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act for 
the RD to make available to the Application Oversight Board members such 
confidential catch and other records as are pertinent to the matter 
under reconsideration.
    (iv) The Application Oversight Board may only deliberate whether the 
eligibility criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section were 
applied correctly in the vessel owner's case, based solely on the 
available record, including documentation submitted by the owner. The 
Application Oversight Board may not consider whether an owner should 
have been eligible for a commercial vessel permit because of hardship or 
other factors. The Application Oversight Board members will provide 
individual recommendations for each application for reconsideration to 
the RD.
    (v) The RD will make a final decision based on the eligibility 
criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section and the available 
record, including documentation submitted by the vessel owner, and the 
recommendations and comments from members of the Application Oversight 
Board. The RD may not consider whether a vessel owner should have been 
eligible for a commercial vessel permit because of hardship or other 
factors. The RD will notify the owner of the decision and the reason for 
it, in writing, within 15 days of receiving the recommendations from the 
Application Oversight Board members. The RD's decision will constitute 
the final administrative action by NMFS.
    (e) Transfers of permits. A snapper-grouper limited access permit is 
valid only for the vessel and owner named on the permit. To change 
either the vessel or the owner, an application for transfer must be 
submitted to the RD.
    (1) Transferable permits. (i) An owner of a vessel with a 
transferable permit may request that the RD transfer the permit to 
another vessel owned by the same entity.
    (ii) A transferable permit may be transferred upon a change of 
ownership of a permitted vessel with such permit from one to another of 
the following: Husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, mother, or 
father.
    (iii) A transferable permit may be transferred to a vessel whose 
owner had, as of August 20, 1996, a written contract for the purchase of 
a vessel that included a provision transferring to the new owner the 
rights to any limited access permit to which the former owner might 
become entitled under the provisions for initial issue of limited access 
permits. To be considered, any such written contract must be submitted 
to the RD postmarked or hand-delivered on or before December 14, 1998.
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of 
this section, a person desiring to acquire a limited access, 
transferable permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper must obtain and 
exchange two such permits for one new permit.

[[Page 130]]

    (v) A transfer of a permit that is undertaken under paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(iii), or (e)(1)(iv) of this section will constitute a 
transfer of the vessel's entire catch history to the new owner.
    (2) Trip-limited permits. An owner of a vessel with a trip-limited 
permit may request that the RD transfer the permit to another vessel 
owned by the same entity provided the length and gross tonnage of the 
replacement vessel are equal to or less than the length and gross 
tonnage of the replaced vessel.
    (f) Renewal. NMFS will not reissue a commercial vessel permit for 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper if the permit is revoked or if the RD 
does not receive an application for renewal within 60 days of the 
permit's expiration date.

Sec. 622.30  Fishing years.

    The fishing year for species or species groups governed in this part 
is January 1 through December 31 except for the following:
    (a) Allowable octocoral-- October 1 through September 30.
    (b) King and Spanish mackerel. The fishing year for the king and 
Spanish mackerel bag limits specified in Sec. 622.39(c)(1) is January 1 
through December 31. The following fishing years apply only for the king 
and Spanish mackerel quotas specified in Sec. 622.42(c):
    (1) Gulf migratory group king mackerel-- July 1 through June 30.
    (2) All other migratory groups of king and Spanish mackerel-- April 
1 through March 31.
    (c) Wreckfish-- April 16 through April 15.


<R05>
Sec. 622.31  Prohibited gear and methods.

    In addition to the prohibited gear/methods specified in this 
section, see Secs. 622.33, 622.34, and 622.35 for seasonal/area 
prohibited gear/methods and Sec. 622.41 for species specific authorized 
and unauthorized gear/methods.
    (a) Explosives. An explosive (except an explosive in a powerhead) 
may not be used to fish in the Caribbean, Gulf, or South Atlantic EEZ. A 
vessel fishing in the EEZ for a species governed in this part, or a 
vessel for which a permit has been issued under Sec. 622.4 or 
Sec. 622.17, may not have on board any dynamite or similar explosive 
substance.
    (b) Chemicals and plants. A toxic chemical may not be used or 
possessed in a coral area, and a chemical, plant, or plant-derived toxin 
may not be used to harvest a Caribbean coral reef resource in the 
Caribbean EEZ.
    (c) Fish traps. (1) A fish trap may not be used in the South 
Atlantic EEZ.
    (2) A fish trap may not be used or possessed in the Gulf EEZ west of 
85 deg.30' W. long. and, after February 7, 2007, may not be used or 
possessed in the Gulf EEZ.
    (3) A fish trap used other than where authorized in paragraph (c) 
(1) or (2) of this section may be disposed of in any appropriate manner 
by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer.
    (d) Longlines for wreckfish. A bottom longline may not be used to 
fish for wreckfish in the South Atlantic EEZ. A person aboard a vessel 
that has a longline on board may not retain a wreckfish in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ. For the purposes of this paragraph, a vessel is 
considered to have a longline on board when a power-operated longline 
hauler, a cable of diameter suitable for use in the longline fishery 
longer than 1.5 mi (2.4 km) on any reel, and gangions are on board. 
Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of a 
longline.
    (e) Poisons. (1) A poison, drug, or other chemical may not be used 
to fish for Caribbean reef fish in the Caribbean EEZ.
    (2) A poison may not be used to take Gulf reef fish in the Gulf EEZ.
    (3) A poison may not be used to fish for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper in the South Atlantic EEZ.
    (f) Power-assisted tools. A power-assisted tool may not be used in 
the Caribbean EEZ to take a Caribbean coral reef resource or in the Gulf 
or South Atlantic EEZ to take allowable octocoral, prohibited coral, or 
live rock.
    (g) Powerheads. A powerhead may not be used in the Caribbean EEZ to 
harvest Caribbean reef fish or in the EEZ

[[Page 131]]

off South Carolina to harvest South Atlantic snapper-grouper. The 
possession of a mutilated Caribbean reef fish in or from the Caribbean 
EEZ, or a mutilated South Atlantic snapper-grouper in or from the EEZ 
off South Carolina, and a powerhead is prima facie evidence that such 
fish was harvested by a powerhead.
    (h) Rebreathers and spearfishing gear. In the South Atlantic EEZ, a 
person using a rebreather may not harvest South Atlantic snapper-grouper 
with spearfishing gear. The possession of such snapper-grouper while in 
the water with a rebreather is prima facie evidence that such fish was 
harvested with spearfishing gear while using a rebreather.
    (i) Sea bass pots. A sea bass pot may not be used in the South 
Atlantic EEZ south of 28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle 
Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, FL). A sea bass pot deployed in the 
EEZ south of 28 deg.35.1' N. lat. may be disposed of in any appropriate 
manner by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer.
    (j) Spears and hooks. A spear, hook, or similar device may not be 
used in the Caribbean EEZ to harvest a Caribbean spiny lobster. The 
possession of a speared, pierced, or punctured Caribbean spiny lobster 
in or from the Caribbean EEZ is prima facie evidence of violation of 
this section.

FR 10567, Mar. 4, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 622.32  Prohibited and limited-harvest species.

    (a) General. The harvest and possession restrictions of this section 
apply without regard to whether the species is harvested by a vessel 
operating under a commercial vessel permit. The operator of a vessel 
that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for the limit applicable to that 
vessel.
    (b) Prohibited species. Prohibited species, by geographical area, 
are as follows:
    (1) Caribbean. (i) Caribbean prohibited coral may not be fished for 
or possessed in or from the Caribbean EEZ. The taking of Caribbean 
prohibited coral in the Caribbean EEZ is not considered unlawful 
possession provided it is returned immediately to the sea in the general 
area of fishing.
    (ii) Foureye, banded, and longsnout butterflyfish; jewfish; Nassau 
grouper; and seahorses may not be harvested or possessed in or from the 
Caribbean EEZ. Such fish caught in the Caribbean EEZ must be released 
immediately with a minimum of harm.
    (iii) Egg-bearing spiny lobster in the Caribbean EEZ must be 
returned to the water unharmed. An egg-bearing spiny lobster may be 
retained in a trap, provided the trap is returned immediately to the 
water. An egg-bearing spiny lobster may not be stripped, scraped, 
shaved, clipped, or in any other manner molested, in order to remove the 
eggs.
    (2) Gulf. (i) Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral taken as 
incidental catch in the Gulf EEZ must be returned immediately to the sea 
in the general area of fishing. In fisheries where the entire catch is 
landed unsorted, such as the scallop and groundfish fisheries, unsorted 
prohibited coral may be landed ashore; however, no person may sell or 
purchase such prohibited coral.
    (ii) Jewfish may not be harvested or possessed in or from the Gulf 
EEZ.
    (iii) Red drum and Nassau grouper may not be harvested or possessed 
in or from the Gulf EEZ. Such fish caught in the Gulf EEZ must be 
released immediately with a minimum of harm.
    (3) Mid-Atlantic. Red drum may not be harvested or possessed in or 
from the Mid-Atlantic EEZ south of a line extending in a direction of 
115 deg. from true north commencing at a point at 40 deg.29.6' N. lat., 
73 deg.54.1' W. long., such point being the intersection of the New 
Jersey/New York boundary with the 3- nm line denoting the seaward limit 
of state waters. Red drum caught in such portion of the Mid-Atlantic EEZ 
must be released immediately with a minimum of harm.
    (4) South Atlantic. (i) Gulf and South Atlantic prohibited coral 
taken as incidental catch in the South Atlantic EEZ must be returned 
immediately to the sea in the general area of fishing. In fisheries 
where the entire catch is landed unsorted, such as the scallop and

[[Page 132]]

groundfish fisheries, unsorted prohibited coral may be landed ashore; 
however, no person may sell or purchase such prohibited coral.
    (ii) Jewfish and Nassau grouper may not be harvested or possessed in 
or from the South Atlantic EEZ. Jewfish and Nassau grouper taken in the 
South Atlantic EEZ incidentally by hook-and-line must be released 
immediately by cutting the line without removing the fish from the 
water.
    (iii) Red drum may not be harvested or possessed in or from the 
South Atlantic EEZ. Red drum caught in the South Atlantic EEZ must be 
released immediately with a minimum of harm.
    (iv) Wild live rock may not be harvested or possessed in the South 
Atlantic EEZ.
    (v) It is intended that no female golden crabs in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ be retained on board a vessel and that any female golden 
crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ be released in a manner that will 
ensure maximum probability of survival. However, to accommodate 
legitimate incidental catch and retention, the number of female golden 
crabs in or from the South Atlantic EEZ retained on board a vessel may 
not exceed 0.5 percent, by number, of all golden crabs on board. See 
Sec. 622.45(f)(1) regarding the prohibition of sale of female golden 
crabs.
    (vi) South Atlantic snapper-grouper may not be possessed in whole, 
gutted, or filleted form by a person aboard a vessel fishing for or 
possessing golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ or possessing a 
golden crab trap in the South Atlantic. Only the head, fins, and 
backbone (collectively the ``rack'') of South Atlantic snapper-grouper 
may be possessed for use as bait.
    (c) Limited-harvest species. A person who fishes in the EEZ may not 
combine a harvest limitation specified in this paragraph (c) with a 
harvest limitation applicable to state waters. A species subject to a 
harvest limitation specified in this paragraph (c) taken in the EEZ may 
not be transferred at sea, regardless of where such transfer takes 
place, and such species may not be transferred in the EEZ.
    (1) Cobia. No person may possess more than two cobia per day in or 
from the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ, regardless of the 
number of trips or duration of a trip.
    (2) Cubera snapper. No person may harvest more than two cubera 
snapper measuring 30 inches (76.2 cm), TL, or larger, per day in the 
South Atlantic EEZ off Florida and no more than two such cubera snapper 
in or from the South Atlantic EEZ off Florida may be possessed on board 
a vessel at any time.
    (3) Speckled hind and warsaw grouper. The possession of speckled 
hind and warsaw grouper in or from the South Atlantic EEZ is limited to 
one of each per vessel per trip.

    (g) Reef fish stressed area. The stressed area is that part of the 
Gulf EEZ shoreward of rhumb lines connecting, in order, the points 
listed in Table 2, in Appendix B of this part.
    (1) A powerhead may not be used in the stressed area to take Gulf 
reef fish. Possession of a powerhead and a mutilated Gulf reef fish in 
the stressed area or after having fished in the stressed area 
constitutes prima facie evidence that such reef fish was taken with a 
powerhead in the stressed area. The provisions of this paragraph do not 
apply to the following species: dwarf sand perch, hogfish, queen 
triggerfish, and sand perch.
    (2) A roller trawl may not be used in the stressed area. Roller 
trawl means a trawl net equipped with a series of large, solid rollers 
separated by several smaller spacer rollers on a separate cable or line 
(sweep) connected to the footrope, which makes it possible to fish the 
gear over rough bottom, that is, in areas unsuitable for fishing 
conventional shrimp trawls. Rigid framed trawls adapted for shrimping 
over uneven bottom, in wide use along the

[[Page 135]]

west coast of Florida, and shrimp trawls with hollow plastic rollers for 
fishing on soft bottoms, are not considered roller trawls.
    (3) A fish trap may not be used in the stressed area. A fish trap 
used in the stressed area will be considered unclaimed or abandoned 
property and may be disposed of in any appropriate manner by the 
Assistant Administrator (including an authorized officer).
    (h) Texas closure. (1) From 30 minutes after sunset on May 15 to 30 
minutes after sunset on July 15, trawling, except trawling for royal red 
shrimp beyond the 100-fathom (183-m) depth contour, is prohibited in the 
Gulf EEZ off Texas.
    (2) In accordance with the procedures and restrictions of the 
Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico, 
the RD may adjust the closing and/or opening date of the Texas closure 
to provide an earlier, later, shorter, or longer closure, but the 
duration of the closure may not exceed 90 days or be less than 45 days. 
Notification of the adjustment of the closing or opening date will be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (i) Tortugas shrimp sanctuary. (1) The Tortugas shrimp sanctuary is 
closed to trawling. The Tortugas shrimp sanctuary is that part of the 
EEZ off Florida shoreward of rhumb lines connecting, in order, the 
following points:

    (2) The provisions of paragraph (i)(1) of this section 
notwithstanding--
    (i) Effective from April 11 through September 30, each year, that 
part of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary seaward of rhumb lines connecting 
the following points is open to trawling: From point T at 24 deg.47.8' 
N. lat., 82 deg.01.0' W. long. to point U at 24 deg.43.83' N. lat., 
82 deg.01.0' W. long. (on the line denoting the seaward limit of 
Florida's waters); thence along the seaward limit of Florida's waters, 
as shown on the current edition of NOAA chart 11439, to point V at 
24 deg.42.55' N. lat., 82 deg.15.0' W. long.; thence north to point W at 
24 deg.43.6' N. lat., 82 deg.15.0' W. long.
    (ii) Effective from April 11 through July 31, each year, that part 
of the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary seaward of rhumb lines connecting the 
following points is open to trawling: From point W to point V, both 
points as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, to point G, 
as specified in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Effective from May 26 through July 31, each year, that part of 
the Tortugas shrimp sanctuary seaward of rhumb lines connecting the 
following points is open to trawling: From point F, as specified in 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section, to point Q at 24 deg.46.7' N. lat., 
81 deg.52.2' W. long. (on the line denoting the seaward limit of 
Florida's waters); thence along the seaward limit of Florida's waters, 
as shown on the current edition of NOAA chart 11439, to point U and 
north to point T, both points as specified in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of 
this section.
    (j) West and East Flower Garden Banks HAPC. Fishing with a bottom 
longline, bottom trawl, dredge, pot, or trap is prohibited year-round in 
the HAPC. The West and East Flower Garden Banks are geographically 
centered at 27 deg.52'14.21" N. lat., 93 deg.48'54.79" W. long. and 
27 deg.55'07.44" N. lat., 93 deg.36'08.49" W. long., respectively. The 
HAPC extends from these centers to the 50-fathom (300-ft) (91.4-m) 
isobath.
    (k) Wild live rock area closures. No person may harvest or possess 
wild live rock in the Gulf EEZ--
    (1) North and west of a line extending in a direction of 235 deg. 
from true north from a point at the mouth of the Suwannee River at 
29 deg.17.25' N. lat., 83 deg.09.9' W. long. (the Levy/Dixie County, FL, 
boundary); or
    (2) South of 25 deg.20.4' N. lat. (due west from the Monroe/Collier 
County, FL, boundary).
    (l) Closures of the commercial fishery for red snapper. The 
commercial fishery for red snapper in or from the Gulf EEZ is closed 
from January 1 to noon on February 1 and thereafter from noon on the 
15th of each month to noon on the first of each succeeding month. All

[[Page 136]]

times are local times. During these closed periods, the possession of 
red snapper in or from the Gulf EEZ and in the Gulf on board a vessel 
for which a commercial permit for Gulf reef fish has been issued, as 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(v), without regard to where such red 
snapper were harvested, is limited to the bag and possession limits, as 
specified in Sec. 622.39(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2), respectively, and such 
red snapper are subject to the prohibition on sale or purchase of red 
snapper possessed under the bag limit, as specified in 
Sec. 622.45(c)(1). However, when the recreational quota for red snapper 
has been reached and the bag and possession limit has been reduced to 
zero, such possession during a closed period is zero.

    (m) Closures of the commercial fishery for red snapper. The 
commercial fishery for red snapper in or from the Gulf EEZ is closed 
from January 1 to noon on February 1 and thereafter from noon on the 
15th of each month to noon on the first of each succeeding month. All 
times are local times. During these closed periods, the possession of 
red snapper in or from the Gulf EEZ and in the Gulf on board a vessel 
for which a commercial permit for Gulf reef fish has been issued, as 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(v), without regard to where such red 
snapper were harvested, is limited to the bag and possession limits, as 
specified in Sec. 622.39(b)(1)(vi) and (b)(2), respectively, and such 
red snapper are subject to the prohibition on sale or purchase of red 
snapper possessed under the bag limit, as specified in 
Sec. 622.45(c)(1). However, when the recreational quota for red snapper 
has been reached and the bag and possession limit has been reduced to 
zero, such possession during a closed period is zero.


<R05>
Sec. 622.35  South Atlantic EEZ seasonal and/or area closures.

    (a) Allowable octocoral closed area. No person may harvest or 
possess allowable octocoral in the South Atlantic EEZ north of 
28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, 
Cape Canaveral, FL).
    (b) Longline closed areas. A longline may not be used to fish in the 
EEZ for South Atlantic snapper-grouper south of 27 deg.10' N. lat. (due 
east of the entrance to St. Lucie Inlet, FL); or north of 27 deg.10' N. 
lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 m), as shown 
on the latest edition of the largest scale NOAA chart of the location. A 
person aboard a vessel with a longline on board that fishes on a trip in 
the South Atlantic EEZ south of 27 deg.10' N. lat., or north of 
27 deg.10' N. lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 
m), is limited on that trip to the bag limit for South Atlantic snapper-
grouper for which a bag limit is specified in Sec. 622.39(d)(1), and to 
zero for all other South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For the purpose of 
this paragraph, a vessel is considered to have a longline on board when 
a power-operated longline hauler, a cable or monofilament of diameter 
and length suitable for use in the longline fishery, and gangions are on 
board. Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of 
a longline.
    (c) Oculina Bank HAPC. The Oculina Bank HAPC is bounded on the north 
by 27 deg.53' N. lat., on the south by 27 deg.30' N. lat., on the east 
by 79 deg.56' W. long., and on the west by 80 deg.00' W. long. In the 
Oculina Bank HAPC:
    (1) Fishing with a bottom longline, bottom trawl, dredge, pot, or 
trap is prohibited.
    (2) A fishing vessel may not anchor, use an anchor and chain, or use 
a grapple and chain.
    (3) No fishing for South Atlantic snapper-grouper is allowed, and 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper may not be retained, in or from the HAPC. 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper taken incidentally in the HAPC by hook-
and-line gear must be released immediately by

[[Page 137]]

cutting the line without removing the fish from the water.
    (d) South Atlantic shrimp cold weather closure. (1) Pursuant to the 
procedures and criteria established in the FMP for the Shrimp Fishery of 
the South Atlantic Region, when Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, or 
South Carolina closes all or a portion of its waters of the South 
Atlantic to the harvest of brown, pink, and white shrimp, the Assistant 
Administrator may concurrently close the South Atlantic EEZ adjacent to 
the closed state waters by filing a notification of closure with the 
Office of the Federal Register. Closure of the adjacent EEZ will be 
effective until the ending date of the closure in state waters, but may 
be ended earlier based on the state's request. In the latter case, the 
Assistant Administrator will terminate a closure of the EEZ by filing a 
notification to that effect with the Office of the Federal Register.
    (2) During a closure, as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section--
    (i) No person may trawl for brown shrimp, pink shrimp, or white 
shrimp in the closed portion of the EEZ (closed area); and no person may 
possess on board a fishing vessel brown shrimp, pink shrimp, or white 
shrimp in or from a closed area, except as authorized in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) No person aboard a vessel trawling in that part of a closed 
area that is within 25 nm of the baseline from which the territorial sea 
is measured may use or have on board a trawl net with a mesh size less 
than 4 inches (10.2 cm), as measured between the centers of opposite 
knots when pulled taut.
    (iii) Brown shrimp, pink shrimp, or white shrimp may be possessed on 
board a fishing vessel in a closed area, provided the vessel is in 
transit and all trawl nets with a mesh size less than 4 inches (10.2 
cm), as measured between the centers of opposite knots when pulled taut, 
are stowed below deck while transiting the closed area. For the purpose 
of this paragraph, a vessel is in transit when it is on a direct and 
continuous course through a closed area.

(e)(1) (xxii) through (xxix) of this section, a powerhead may not be 
used to take

[[Page 139]]

South Atlantic snapper-grouper. Possession of a powerhead and a 
mutilated South Atlantic snapper-grouper in one of the specified SMZs, 
or after having fished in one of the SMZs, constitutes prima facie 
evidence that such fish was taken with a powerhead in the SMZ.
    (f) Golden crab trap closed areas. In the golden crab northern zone, 
a golden crab trap may not be deployed in waters less than 900 ft (274 
m) deep. In the golden crab middle and southern zones, a golden crab

Sec. 622.38  Landing fish intact.

    The operator of a vessel that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for 
ensuring that fish on that vessel in the EEZ are maintained intact and, 
if taken from the EEZ, are maintained intact through offloading ashore, 
as specified in this section.
    (a) The following must be maintained with head and fins intact: 
Cobia, king mackerel, and Spanish mackerel in or from the Gulf, Mid-
Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ, except as specified for king mackerel 
in paragraph (h) of this section; South Atlantic snapper-grouper in or 
from the South Atlantic EEZ, except as specified in paragraphs (e) and 
(i) of this section; yellowtail snapper in or from the Caribbean EEZ; 
and finfish in or from the Gulf EEZ, except as specified in paragraphs

[[Page 141]]

this section. Such fish may be eviscerated, gilled, and scaled, but must 
otherwise be maintained in a whole condition.
    (b) A Caribbean spiny lobster in or from the Caribbean EEZ must be 
maintained with head and carapace intact.
    (c) Shark, swordfish, and tuna species are exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) In the Gulf EEZ:
    (1) Bait is exempt from the requirement to be maintained with head 
and fins intact.
    (i) For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(1), bait means--
    (A) Packaged, headless fish fillets that have the skin attached and 
are frozen or refrigerated;
    (B) Headless fish fillets that have the skin attached and are held 
in brine; or
    (C) Small pieces no larger than 3 in\3\ (7.6 cm\3\) or strips no 
larger than 3 inches by 9 inches (7.6 cm by 22.9 cm) that have the skin 
attached and are frozen, refrigerated, or held in brine.
    (ii) Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section notwithstanding, a finfish 
or part thereof possessed in or landed from the Gulf EEZ that is 
subsequently sold or purchased as a finfish species, rather than as 
bait, is not bait.
    (2) Legal-sized finfish possessed for consumption at sea on the 
harvesting vessel are exempt from the requirement to have head and fins 
intact, provided--
    (i) Such finfish do not exceed any applicable bag limit;
    (ii) Such finfish do not exceed 1.5 lb (680 g) of finfish parts per 
person aboard; and
    (iii) The vessel is equipped to cook such finfish on board.
    (e) In the South Atlantic EEZ, a greater amberjack on or offloaded 
ashore from a vessel that has a permit specified in Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(vi) 
may be deheaded and eviscerated, but must otherwise be maintained in a 
whole condition through offloading ashore.
    (f) A golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ must be 
maintained in whole condition through landing ashore. For the purposes 
of this paragraph, whole means a crab that is in its natural condition 
and that has not been gutted or separated into component pieces, e.g., 
clusters.
    (g) A Caribbean conch resource in or from the Caribbean EEZ must be 
maintained with meat and shell intact.
    (h) A maximum of five cut-off (damaged) king mackerel may be 
possessed in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ on, and 
offloaded ashore from, a vessel that is operating under a trip limit for 
king mackerel specified in Sec. 622.44(a). Such cut-off (damaged) king 
mackerel are not counted against the trip limit and may not be sold or 
purchased.
    (i) In the South Atlantic EEZ, snapper-grouper lawfully harvested in 
Bahamian waters are exempt from the requirement that they be maintained 
with head and fins intact, provided valid Bahamian fishing and cruising 
permits are on board the vessel and the vessel is in transit through the 
South Atlantic EEZ. For the purpose of this paragraph (i), a vessel is 
in transit through the South Atlantic EEZ when it is on a direct and 
continuous course through the South Atlantic EEZ and no one aboard the 
vessel fishes in the EEZ.

Sec. 622.39  Bag and possession limits.

    (a) Applicability. (1) The bag and possession limits apply for 
species/species groups listed in this section in or from the EEZ. Bag 
limits apply to a person on a daily basis, regardless of the number of 
trips in a day. Possession limits apply to a person on a trip after the 
first 24 hours of that trip. The bag and possession limits apply to a 
person who fishes in the EEZ in any manner, except a person aboard a 
vessel in the EEZ that has on board the commercial vessel permit 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2) for the appropriate species/species 
group. However, see Sec. 622.32 for limitations on taking prohibited and 
limited-harvest species. The limitations in Sec. 622.32 apply without 
regard to whether the species is harvested by a vessel operating under a 
commercial vessel permit or by a person subject to the bag limits. The 
possession of a commercial vessel permit notwithstanding, the bag and 
possession limits apply when the vessel is operating as a

[[Page 142]]

charter vessel or headboat. A person who fishes in the EEZ may not 
combine a bag limit specified in this section with a bag or possession 
limit applicable to state waters. A species/species group subject to a 
bag limit specified in this section taken in the EEZ by a person subject 
to the bag limits may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where 
such transfer takes place, and such fish may not be transferred in the 
EEZ.
    (2) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section notwithstanding, bag and 
possession limits also apply for Gulf reef fish in or from the EEZ to a 
person aboard a vessel that has on board a commercial permit for Gulf 
reef fish--
    (i) When trawl gear or entangling net gear is on board. A vessel is 
considered to have trawl gear on board when trawl doors and a net are on 
board. Removal from the vessel of all trawl doors or all nets 
constitutes removal of trawl gear.
    (ii) When a longline or buoy gear is on board and the vessel is 
fishing or has fished on a trip in the reef fish longline and buoy gear 
restricted area specified in Sec. 622.34(c). A vessel is considered to 
have a longline on board when a power-operated longline hauler, a cable 
of diameter and length suitable for use in the longline fishery, and 
gangions are on board. Removal of any one of these three elements, in 
its entirety, constitutes removal of a longline.
    (iii) For a species/species group when its quota has been reached 
and closure has been effected.
    (iv) When the vessel has on board or is tending any trap other than 
a fish trap authorized under Sec. 622.40(a)(2), a stone crab trap, or a 
spiny lobster trap.
    (3) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section notwithstanding, the bag and 
other limits specified in Sec. 622.35(b) apply for South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper in or from the EEZ to a person aboard a vessel for which 
a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper has been issued 
that has on board a longline in the longline closed area.
    (b) Gulf reef fish--(1) Bag limits. (i) Greater amberjack--1.
    (ii) Groupers, combined, excluding jewfish and Nassau grouper--5.
    (iii) Red snapper--5.
    (iv) Snappers, combined, excluding red, lane, and vermilion 
snapper--10.
    (v) Gulf reef fish, combined, excluding those specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section and excluding dwarf 
sand perch and sand perch--20.
    (2) Possession limits. A person who is on a trip that spans more 
than 24 hours may possess no more than two daily bag limits, provided 
such trip is on a vessel that is operating as a charter vessel or 
headboat, the vessel has two licensed operators aboard, and each 
passenger is issued and has in possession a receipt issued on behalf of 
the vessel that verifies the length of the trip.
    (c) King and Spanish mackerel--(1) Bag limits. (i) Atlantic 
migratory group king mackerel--
    (A) Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic, other than off Florida--3.
    (B) Off Florida--2, which is the daily bag limit specified by 
Florida for its waters (Rule 46-12.004(1), Florida Administrative Code). 
If Florida changes its limit, the bag limit specified in this paragraph 
(c)(1)(i)(B) will be changed to conform to Florida's limit, provided 
such limit does not exceed 5.
    (ii) Gulf migratory group king mackerel--2.
    (iii) Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel--10.
    (iv) Gulf migratory group Spanish mackerel--
    (A) Off Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama--10.
    (B) Off Florida--10, which is the daily bag limit specified by 
Florida for its waters (Rule 46-23.005(1), Florida Administrative Code). 
If Florida changes its limit, the bag limit specified in this paragraph 
(c)(1)(iv)(B) will be changed to conform to Florida's limit, provided 
such limit does not exceed 10.
    (C) Off Texas--7, which is the daily bag limit specified by Texas 
for its waters (Rule 31-65.72(c)(4)(A), Texas Administrative Code). If 
Texas changes its limit, the bag limit specified in this paragraph 
(c)(1)(iv)(C) will be changed to conform to Texas' limit, provided such 
limit does not exceed 10.
    (2) Possession limits. A person who is on a trip that spans more 
than 24 hours may possess no more than two daily bag limits, provided 
such trip is on a

[[Page 143]]

vessel that is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, the vessel has 
two licensed operators aboard, and each passenger is issued and has in 
possession a receipt issued on behalf of the vessel that verifies the 
length of the trip.
    (d) South Atlantic snapper-grouper--(1) Bag limits. (i) Greater 
amberjack--3.
    (ii) Groupers, combined, excluding jewfish and Nassau grouper, and 
tilefishes--5.
    (iii) Hogfish in the South Atlantic off Florida--5.
    (iv) Snappers, combined, excluding cubera snapper measuring 30 
inches (76.2 cm), TL, or larger, in the South Atlantic off Florida, and 
excluding vermilion snapper--10, of which no more than 2 may be red 
snapper. (See Sec. 622.32(c)(2) for limitations on cubera snapper 
measuring 30 inches (76.2 cm), TL, or larger, in or from the South 
Atlantic EEZ off Florida.)
    (v) Vermilion snapper--10.
    (2) Possession limits. Provided each passenger is issued and has in 
possession a receipt issued on behalf of the vessel that verifies the 
duration of the trip--
    (i) A person aboard a charter vessel or headboat on a trip that 
spans more than 24 hours may possess no more than two daily bag limits.
    (ii) A person aboard a headboat on a trip that spans more than 48 
hours and who can document that fishing was conducted on at least 3 days 
may possess no more than three daily bag limits.
    (3) Longline bag limits. Other provisions of this paragraph (d) 
notwithstanding, a person on a trip aboard a vessel for which the bag 
limits apply that has a longline on board is limited on that trip to the 
bag limit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper for which a bag limit is 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and to zero for all other 
South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For the purpose of this paragraph 
(d)(3), a vessel is considered to have a longline on board when a power-
operated longline hauler, a cable or monofilament of diameter and length 
suitable for use in the longline fishery, and gangions are on board. 
Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of a 
longline.
    (e) Caribbean queen conch--(1) Applicability. Paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section notwithstanding, the bag limit of paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section does not apply to a fisherman who has a valid commercial fishing 
license issued by Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands. See 
Sec. 622.44 for the commercial daily trip limit.
    (2) Bag limit. The bag limit for queen conch in or from the 
Caribbean EEZ is 3 per person or, if more than 4 persons are aboard, 12 
per boat.

Sec. 622.40  Limitations on traps and pots.

    (a) Tending--(1) Caribbean EEZ. A fish trap or Caribbean spiny 
lobster trap in the Caribbean EEZ may be pulled or tended only by a 
person (other than an authorized officer) aboard the fish trap or spiny 
lobster trap owner's vessel, or aboard another vessel if such vessel has 
on board written consent of the trap owner, or if the trap owner is 
aboard and has documentation verifying his identification number and 
color code. An owner's written consent must specify the time period such 
consent is effective and the trap owner's gear identification number and 
color code.
    (2) Gulf EEZ. A fish trap in the Gulf EEZ may be pulled or tended 
only by a person (other than an authorized officer) aboard the vessel 
with the fish trap endorsement to fish such trap. If such vessel has a 
breakdown that prevents it from retrieving its traps, the owner or 
operator must immediately notify the nearest NMFS Office of Enforcement 
and must obtain authorization for another vessel to retrieve and land 
its traps. The request for such authorization must include the requested

[[Page 144]]

effective period for the retrieval and landing, the persons and vessel 
to be authorized to retrieve the traps, and the point of landing of the 
traps. Such authorization will be specific as to the effective period, 
authorized persons and vessel, and point of landing. Such authorization 
is valid solely for the removal of fish traps from the EEZ and for 
harvest of fish incidental to such removal.
    (3) South Atlantic EEZ. A sea bass pot or golden crab trap in the 
South Atlantic EEZ may be pulled or tended only by a person (other than 
an authorized officer) aboard the vessel permitted to fish such pot or 
trap or aboard another vessel if such vessel has on board written 
consent of the owner or operator of the vessel so permitted. For golden 
crab only, a vessel with written consent on board must also possess a 
valid commercial vessel permit for golden crab.
    (b) Escape mechanisms--(1) Caribbean EEZ. (i) A fish trap used or 
possessed in the Caribbean EEZ must have a panel located on each of two 
sides of the trap, excluding the top, bottom, and side containing the 
trap entrance. The opening covered by a panel must measure not less than 
8 by 8 inches (20.3 by 20.3 cm). The mesh size of a panel may not be 
smaller than the mesh size of the trap. A panel must be attached to the 
trap with untreated jute twine with a diameter not exceeding \1/8\ inch 
(3.2 mm). An access door may serve as one of the panels, provided it is 
on an appropriate side, it is hinged only at its bottom, its only other 
fastening is untreated jute twine with a diameter not exceeding \1/8\ 
inch (3.2 mm), and such fastening is at the top of the door so that the 
door will fall open when such twine degrades. Jute twine used to secure 
a panel may not be wrapped or overlapped.
    (ii) A spiny lobster trap used or possessed in the Caribbean EEZ 
must contain on any vertical side or on the top a panel no smaller in 
diameter than the throat or entrance of the trap. The panel must be made 
of or attached to the trap by one of the following degradable materials:
    (A) Untreated fiber of biological origin with a diameter not 
exceeding \1/8\ inch (3.2 mm). This includes, but is not limited to tyre 
palm, hemp, jute, cotton, wool, or silk.
    (B) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire with a diameter not exceeding 
\1/16\ inch (1.6 mm), that is, 16 gauge wire.
    (2) Gulf EEZ. A fish trap used or possessed in the Gulf EEZ must 
have at least two escape windows on each of two sides, excluding the 
bottom (a total of four escape windows), that are 2 by 2 inches (5.1 by 
5.1 cm) or larger. In addition, a fish trap must have a panel or access 
door located opposite each side of the trap that has a funnel. The 
opening covered by each panel or access door must be 144 in<SUP>2</SUP> 
(929 cm<SUP>2</SUP>) or larger, with one dimension of the area equal to 
or larger than the largest interior axis of the trap's throat (funnel) 
with no other dimension less than 6 inches (15.2 cm). The hinges and 
fasteners of each panel or access door must be constructed of one of the 
following degradable materials:
    (i) Untreated jute string with a diameter not exceeding \3/16\ inch 
(4.8 mm) that is not wrapped or overlapped.
    (ii) Magnesium alloy, time float releases (pop-up devices) or 
similar magnesium alloy fasteners.
    (3) South Atlantic EEZ. (i) A sea bass pot that is used or possessed 
in the South Atlantic EEZ between 35 deg.15.3' N. lat. (due east of Cape 
Hatteras Light, NC) and 28 deg.35.1' N. lat. (due east of the NASA 
Vehicle Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, FL) is required to have on at 
least one side, excluding top and bottom, a panel or door with an 
opening equal to or larger than the interior end of the trap's throat 
(funnel). The hinges and fasteners of each panel or door must be made of 
one of the following degradable materials:
    (A) Untreated hemp, jute, or cotton string with a diameter not 
exceeding \3/16\ inch (4.8 mm).
    (B) Magnesium alloy, timed float releases (pop-up devices) or 
similar magnesium alloy fasteners.
    (C) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire with a diameter not exceeding 
\1/16\ inch (1.6 mm), that is, 16 gauge wire.
    (ii) A golden crab trap that is used or possessed in the South 
Atlantic EEZ must have at least one escape gap or escape ring on each of 
two opposite vertical sides. The minimum allowable inside dimensions of 
an escape gap are

[[Page 145]]

2.75 by 3.75 inches (7.0 by 9.5 cm); the minimum allowable inside 
diameter of an escape ring is 4.5 inches (11.4 cm). In addition to the 
escape gaps--
    (A) A golden crab trap constructed of webbing must have an opening 
(slit) at least 1 ft (30.5 cm) long that may be closed (relaced) only 
with untreated cotton string no larger than \3/16\ inch (0.48 cm) in 
diameter.
    (B) A golden crab trap constructed of material other than webbing 
must have an escape panel or door measuring at least 12 by 12 inches 
(30.5 by 30.5 cm), located on at least one side, excluding top and 
bottom. The hinges or fasteners of such door or panel must be made of 
either ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire no larger than 19 gauge (0.04 
inch (1.0 mm) in diameter) or untreated cotton string no larger than \3/
16\ inch (4.8 mm) in diameter.
    (c) Construction requirements and mesh sizes--(1) Caribbean EEZ. A 
bare-wire fish trap used or possessed in the EEZ that has hexagonal mesh 
openings must have a minimum mesh size of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in the 
smallest dimension measured between centers of opposite strands. A bare-
wire fish trap used or possessed in the EEZ that has other than 
hexagonal mesh openings or a fish trap of other than bare wire, such as 
coated wire or plastic, used or possessed in the EEZ, must have a 
minimum mesh size of 2.0 inches (5.1 cm) in the smallest dimension 
measured between centers of opposite strands.
    (2) Gulf EEZ. A fish trap used or possessed in the Gulf EEZ must 
meet all of the following mesh size requirements (based on centerline 
measurements between opposite wires or netting strands):
    (i) A minimum of 2 in<SUP>2</SUP> (12.9 cm<SUP>2</SUP>) opening for 
each mesh.
    (ii) One-inch (2.5-cm) minimum length for the shortest side.
    (iii) Minimum distance of 1 inch (2.5 cm) between parallel sides of 
rectangular openings, and 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) between parallel sides of 
square openings and of mesh openings with more than four sides.
    (iv) One and nine-tenths inches (4.8 cm) minimum distance for 
diagonal measures of mesh.
    (3) South Atlantic EEZ. (i) A sea bass pot used or possessed in the 
South Atlantic EEZ must have mesh sizes as follows (based on centerline 
measurements between opposite, parallel wires or netting strands):
    (A) Hexagonal mesh (chicken wire)--at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) 
between the wrapped sides;
    (B) Square mesh--at least 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) between sides; or
    (C) Rectangular mesh--at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the longer 
sides and 2 inches (5.1 cm) between the shorter sides.
    (ii) A golden crab trap deployed or possessed in the South Atlantic 
EEZ may not exceed 64 ft<SUP>3</SUP> (1.8 m<SUP>3</SUP>) in volume in 
the northern zone or 48 ft<SUP>3</SUP> (1.4 m<SUP>3</SUP>) in volume in 
the middle and southern zones. See Sec. 622.17(h) for specification of 
the golden crab zones.
    (d) Area-specific restrictions--(1) Gulf EEZ. In the Gulf EEZ, a 
fish trap may be pulled or tended only from official sunrise to official 
sunset. The operator of a vessel from which a fish trap is deployed in 
the Gulf EEZ must retrieve all the vessel's fish traps and return them 
to port on each trip. A fish trap that is not returned to port on a 
trip, and its attached line and buoy, may be disposed of in any 
appropriate manner by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized 
officer. The owner of such trap and/or the operator of the responsible 
vessel is subject to appropriate civil penalties. A buoy that floats on 
the surface must be attached to each fish trap, or to each end trap of 
traps that are connected by a line, used in the Gulf EEZ. The maximum 
allowable size for a fish trap fished in the Gulf EEZ shoreward of the 
50-fathom (91.4-m) isobath is 33 ft<SUP>3</SUP> (0.9 m<SUP>3</SUP>) in 
volume. Fish trap volume is determined by measuring the external 
dimensions of the trap, and includes both the enclosed holding capacity 
of the trap and the volume of the funnel(s) within those dimensions. 
There is no size limitation for fish traps fished seaward of the 50-
fathom (91.4-m) isobath. The maximum number of traps that may be 
assigned to, possessed, or fished in the Gulf EEZ by a vessel is 100.
    (2) South Atlantic EEZ. (i) In the South Atlantic EEZ, sea bass pots 
may not be used or possessed in multiple configurations, that is, two or 
more

[[Page 146]]

pots may not be attached one to another so that their overall dimensions 
exceed those allowed for an individual sea bass pot. This does not 
preclude connecting individual pots to a line, such as a ``trawl'' or 
trot line.
    (ii) Rope is the only material allowed to be used for a mainline or 
buoy line attached to a golden crab trap, except that wire cable is 
allowed for these purposes through January 31, 1998.

Sec. 622.41  Species specific limitations.

    (a) Aquacultured live rock. In the Gulf or South Atlantic EEZ:
    (1) Aquacultured live rock may be harvested only under a permit, as 
required under Sec. 622.4(a)(3)(iii), and aquacultured live rock on a 
site may be harvested only by the person, or his or her employee, 
contractor, or agent, who has been issued the aquacultured live rock 
permit for the site. A person harvesting aquacultured live rock is 
exempt from the prohibition on taking prohibited coral for such 
prohibited coral as attaches to aquacultured live rock.
    (2) The following restrictions apply to individual aquaculture 
activities:
    (i) No aquaculture site may exceed 1 acre (0.4 ha) in size.
    (ii) Material deposited on the aquaculture site--
    (A) May not be placed over naturally occurring reef outcrops, 
limestone ledges, coral reefs, or vegetated areas.
    (B) Must be free of contaminants.
    (C) Must be nontoxic.
    (D) Must be placed on the site by hand or lowered completely to the 
bottom under restraint, that is, not allowed to fall freely.
    (E) Must be placed from a vessel that is anchored.
    (F) In the Gulf EEZ, must be distinguishable, geologically or 
otherwise (for example, be indelibly marked or tagged), from the 
naturally occurring substrate.
    (G) In the South Atlantic EEZ, must be geologically distinguishable 
from the naturally occurring substrate and, in addition, may be 
indelibly marked or tagged.
    (iii) A minimum setback of at least 50 ft (15.2 m) must be 
maintained from natural vegetated or hard bottom habitats.
    (3) Mechanically dredging or drilling, or otherwise disturbing, 
aquacultured live rock is prohibited, and aquacultured live rock may be 
harvested only by hand. In addition, the following activities are 
prohibited in the South Atlantic: Chipping of aquacultured live rock in 
the EEZ, possession of chipped aquacultured live rock in or from the 
EEZ, removal of allowable octocoral or prohibited coral from 
aquacultured live rock in or from the EEZ, and possession of prohibited 
coral not attached to aquacultured live rock or allowable octocoral, 
while aquacultured live rock is in possession. See the definition of 
``Allowable octocoral'' for clarification of the distinction between 
allowable octocoral and live rock. For the purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(3), chipping means breaking up reefs, ledges, or rocks into 
fragments, usually by means of a chisel and hammer.
    (4) Not less than 24 hours prior to harvest of aquacultured live 
rock, the owner or operator of the harvesting vessel must provide the 
following information to the NMFS Law Enforcement Office, Southeast 
Area, St. Petersburg, FL, telephone (813) 570-5344:
    (i) Permit number of site to be harvested and date of harvest.
    (ii) Name and official number of the vessel to be used in 
harvesting.
    (iii) Date, port, and facility at which aquacultured live rock will 
be landed.
    (b) Caribbean reef fish. A marine aquarium fish may be harvested in 
the Caribbean EEZ only by a hand-held dip net or by a hand-held slurp 
gun. For the purposes of this paragraph, a hand-held slurp gun is a 
device that rapidly draws seawater containing fish into a self-contained 
chamber, and a marine aquarium fish is a Caribbean reef fish that is 
smaller than 5.5 inches (14.0 cm), TL.
    (c) Coastal migratory pelagic fish--(1) Authorized gear. Subject to 
the prohibitions on gear/methods specified in Sec. 622.31, the following 
are the only fishing gears that may be used in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, 
and South Atlantic EEZ

[[Page 147]]

in directed fisheries for coastal migratory pelagic fish:
    (i) King mackerel, Atlantic migratory group--
    (A) North of 34 deg.37.3' N. lat., the latitude of Cape Lookout 
Light, NC--all gear except drift gillnet and long gillnet.
    (B) South of 34 deg.37.3' N. lat.--automatic reel, bandit gear, 
handline, and rod and reel.
    (ii) King mackerel, Gulf migratory group--hook-and-line gear and 
run-around gillnet.
    (iii) Spanish mackerel, Atlantic migratory group--automatic reel, 
bandit gear, handline, rod and reel, cast net, run-around gillnet, and 
stab net.
    (iv) Spanish mackerel, Gulf migratory group--all gear except drift 
gillnet, long gillnet, and purse seine.
    (v) Cobia in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic EEZ, dolphin in the 
South Atlantic EEZ, and little tunny in the South Atlantic EEZ south of 
34 deg.37.3' N. lat.--automatic reel, bandit gear, handline, rod and 
reel, and pelagic longline.
    (vi) Cero in the South Atlantic EEZ and little tunny in the South 
Atlantic EEZ north of 34 deg.37.3' N. lat.--all gear except drift 
gillnet and long gillnet.
    (vii) Bluefish, cero, cobia, dolphin, and little tunny in the Gulf 
EEZ--all gear except drift gillnet and long gillnet.
    (2) Unauthorized gear. Gear types other than those specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section are unauthorized gear and the following 
possession limitations apply:
    (i) Long gillnets. A vessel with a long gillnet on board in, or that 
has fished on a trip in, the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ 
may not have on board on that trip a coastal migratory pelagic fish.
    (ii) Drift gillnets. A vessel with a drift gillnet on board in, or 
that has fished on a trip in, the Gulf EEZ may not have on board on that 
trip a coastal migratory pelagic fish.
    (iii) Other unauthorized gear. Except as specified in paragraph 
(c)(2)(iv) of this section, a person aboard a vessel with unauthorized 
gear other than a drift gillnet in the Gulf EEZ or a long gillnet on 
board in, or that has fished in, the EEZ where such gear is not 
authorized in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, is subject to the bag 
limit for king and Spanish mackerel specified in Sec. 622.39(c)(1)(ii) 
and to the limit on cobia specified in Sec. 622.32(c)(1).
    (iv) Exception for king mackerel in the Gulf EEZ. The provisions of 
this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) apply to king mackerel taken in the Gulf EEZ 
and to such king mackerel possessed in the Gulf. Paragraph (c)(2)(iii) 
of this section notwithstanding, a person aboard a vessel that has a 
valid commercial permit for king mackerel is not subject to the bag 
limit for king mackerel when the vessel has on board on a trip 
unauthorized gear other than a drift gillnet in the Gulf EEZ or a long 
gillnet. Thus, the following applies to a vessel that has a commercial 
permit for king mackerel:
    (A) Such vessel may use in the Gulf EEZ no unauthorized gear in a 
directed fishery for king mackerel.
    (B) If such a vessel has a drift gillnet or a long gillnet on board, 
no king mackerel may be possessed.
    (C) If such a vessel has unauthorized gear on board other than a 
drift gillnet in the Gulf EEZ or a long gillnet, the possession of king 
mackerel taken incidentally is restricted only by the closure provisions 
of Sec. 622.43(a)(3) and the trip limits specified in Sec. 622.44(a). 
See also paragraph (c)(4) of this section regarding the purse seine 
incidental catch allowance of king mackerel.
    (3) Gillnets--(i) King mackerel. The minimum allowable mesh size for 
a gillnet used to fish in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ 
for king mackerel is 4.75 inches (12.1 cm), stretched mesh. A vessel in 
such EEZ, or having fished on a trip in such EEZ, with a gillnet on 
board that has a mesh size less than 4.75 (12.1 cm) inches, stretched 
mesh, may not possess on that trip an incidental catch of king mackerel 
that exceeds 10 percent, by number, of the total lawfully possessed 
Spanish mackerel on board.
    (ii) Spanish mackerel. (A) The minimum allowable mesh size for a 
gillnet used to fish in the Gulf, Mid-Atlantic, or South Atlantic EEZ 
for Spanish mackerel is 3.5 inches (8.9 cm), stretched mesh. A vessel in 
such EEZ, or having fished on a trip in such EEZ, with a gillnet on 
board that has a mesh size less than 3.5 inches (8.9 cm),

[[Page 148]]

stretched mesh, may not possess on that trip any Spanish mackerel.
    (B) On board a vessel with a valid Spanish mackerel permit that is 
fishing for Spanish mackerel in, or that possesses Spanish mackerel in 
or from, the South Atlantic EEZ off Florida north of 25 deg.20.4' N. 
lat., which is a line directly east from the Dade/Monroe County, FL, 
boundary--
    (1) No person may fish with, set, place in the water, or have on 
board a gillnet with a float line longer than 800 yd (732 m).
    (2) No person may fish with, set, or place in the water more than 
one gillnet at any one time.
    (3) No more than two gillnets, including any net in use, may be 
possessed at any one time; provided, however, that if two gillnets, 
including any net in use, are possessed at any one time, they must have 
stretched mesh sizes (as allowed under the regulations) that differ by 
at least .25 inch (.64 cm).
    (4) No person may soak a gillnet for more than 1 hour. The soak 
period begins when the first mesh is placed in the water and ends either 
when the first mesh is retrieved back on board the vessel or the 
gathering of the gillnet is begun to facilitate retrieval on board the 
vessel, whichever occurs first; providing that, once the first mesh is 
retrieved or the gathering is begun, the retrieval is continuous until 
the gillnet is completely removed from the water.
    (5) The float line of each gillnet possessed, including any net in 
use, must have the distinctive floats specified in Sec. 622.6(b)(2).
    (4) Purse seine incidental catch allowance. A vessel in the EEZ, or 
having fished in the EEZ, with a purse seine on board will not be 
considered as fishing, or having fished, for king or Spanish mackerel in 
violation of a prohibition of purse seines under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, in violation of the possession limits under paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section, or, in the case of king mackerel from the 
Atlantic migratory group, in violation of a closure effected in 
accordance with Sec. 622.43(a), provided the king mackerel on board does 
not exceed 1 percent, or the Spanish mackerel on board does not exceed 
10 percent, of all fish on board the vessel. Incidental catch will be 
calculated by number and/or weight of fish. Neither calculation may 
exceed the allowable percentage. Incidentally caught king or Spanish 
mackerel are counted toward the quotas provided for under Sec. 622.42(c) 
and are subject to the prohibition of sale under Sec. 622.43(a)(3)(iii).
    (d) South Atlantic snapper-grouper--(1) Authorized gear. Subject to 
the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 622.31, the following are the 
only gear types authorized in a directed fishery for snapper-grouper in 
the South Atlantic EEZ: Bandit gear, bottom longline, buoy gear, 
handline, rod and reel, sea bass pot, and spearfishing gear.
    (2) Unauthorized gear. All gear types other than those specified in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section are unauthorized gear and the following 
possession and transfer limitations apply.
    (i) A vessel with trawl gear on board that fishes in the EEZ on a 
trip may possess no more than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, in or from the EEZ on that trip. 
It is a rebuttable presumption that a vessel with more than 200 lb (90.7 
kg) of South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, on board 
harvested such fish in the EEZ.
    (ii) Except as specified in paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(5) of this 
section, a person aboard a vessel with unauthorized gear on board, other 
than trawl gear, that fishes in the EEZ on a trip is limited on that 
trip to:
    (A) South Atlantic snapper-grouper species for which a bag limit is 
specified in Sec. 622.39(d)(1)--the bag limit.
    (B) All other South Atlantic snapper-grouper--zero.
    (iii) South Atlantic snapper-grouper on board a vessel with 
unauthorized gear on board may not be transferred at sea, regardless of 
where such transfer takes place, and such snapper-grouper may not be 
transferred in the EEZ.
    (iv) No vessel may receive at sea any South Atlantic snapper-grouper 
from a vessel with unauthorized gear on board, as specified in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Possession allowance regarding sink nets off North Carolina. A 
vessel that has on board a commercial permit for

[[Page 149]]

South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, that fishes in the 
EEZ off North Carolina with a sink net on board, may retain, without 
regard to the limits specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, 
otherwise legal South Atlantic snapper-grouper taken with bandit gear, 
buoy gear, handline, rod and reel, or sea bass pot. For the purpose of 
this paragraph (d)(3), a sink net is a gillnet with stretched mesh 
measurements of 3 to 4.75 inches (7.6 to 12.1 cm) that is attached to 
the vessel when deployed.
    (4) Possession allowance regarding bait nets. A vessel that has on 
board a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding 
wreckfish, that fishes in the South Atlantic EEZ with no more than one 
bait net on board, may retain, without regard to the limits specified in 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, otherwise legal South Atlantic 
snapper-grouper taken with bandit gear, buoy gear, handline, rod and 
reel, or sea bass pot. For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(4), a bait 
net is a gillnet not exceeding 50 ft (15.2 m) in length or 10 ft (3.1 m) 
in height with stretched mesh measurements of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or 
smaller that is attached to the vessel when deployed.
    (5) Possession allowance regarding cast nets. A vessel that has on 
board a commercial permit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper, excluding 
wreckfish, that fishes in the South Atlantic EEZ with a cast net on 
board, may retain, without regard to the limits specified in paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section, otherwise legal South Atlantic snapper-
grouper taken with bandit gear, buoy gear, handline, rod and reel, or 
sea bass pot. For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(5), a cast net is a 
cone-shaped net thrown by hand and designed to spread out and capture 
fish as the weighted circumference sinks to the bottom and comes 
together when pulled by a line.
    (e) South Atlantic golden crab. Traps are the only fishing gear 
authorized in directed fishing for golden crab in the South Atlantic 
EEZ. Golden crab in or from the South Atlantic EEZ may not be retained 
on board a vessel possessing or using unauthorized gear.
    (f) Caribbean queen conch. In the Caribbean EEZ, no person may 
harvest queen conch by diving while using a device that provides a 
continuous air supply from the surface.
    (g) Shrimp in the South Atlantic--(1) BRD requirement. On a penaeid 
shrimp trawler in the South Atlantic EEZ, each trawl net that is rigged 
for fishing and has a mesh size less than 2.50 inches (6.35 cm), as 
measured between the centers of opposite knots when pulled taut, and 
each try net that is rigged for fishing and has a headrope length longer 
than 16.0 ft (4.9 m), must have a certified BRD installed. A trawl net, 
or try net, is rigged for fishing if it is in the water, or if it is 
shackled, tied, or otherwise connected to a sled, door, or other device 
that spreads the net, or to a tow rope, cable, pole, or extension, 
either on board or attached to a shrimp trawler.
    (2) Certified BRDs. The following BRDs are certified for use by 
penaeid shrimp trawlers in the South Atlantic EEZ. Specifications of 
these certified BRDs are contained in Appendix D of this part.
    (i) Extended funnel.
    (ii) Expanded mesh.
    (iii) Fisheye.
    (h) Shrimp in the Gulf--(1) BRD requirement. (i) Except as exempted 
in paragraphs (h)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section, on a shrimp 
trawler in the Gulf EEZ shoreward of the 100-fathom (183-m) depth 
contour west of 85 deg.30' W. long., each net that is rigged for fishing 
must have a certified BRD installed. A trawl net is rigged for fishing 
if it is in the water, or if it is shackled, tied, or otherwise 
connected to a sled, door, or other device that spreads the net, or to a 
tow rope, cable, pole, or extension, either on board or attached to a 
shrimp trawler.
    (ii) A shrimp trawler is exempt from the requirement to have a 
certified BRD installed in each net provided that at least 90 percent 
(by weight) of all shrimp on board or offloaded from such trawler are 
royal red shrimp.
    (iii) A shrimp trawler is exempt from the requirement to have a BRD 
installed in a single try net with a headrope length of 16 ft (4.9 m) or 
less provided the single try net is either pulled immediately in front 
of another net or is not connected to another net.

[[Page 150]]

    (iv) A shrimp trawler is exempt from the requirement to have a 
certified BRD installed in up to two rigid-frame roller trawls that are 
16 ft (4.9 m) or less in length used or possessed on board. A rigid-
frame roller trawl is a trawl that has a mouth formed by a rigid frame 
and a grid of rigid vertical bars; has rollers on the lower horizontal 
part of the frame to allow the trawl to roll over the bottom and any 
obstruction while being towed; and has no doors, boards, or similar 
devices attached to keep the mouth of the trawl open.
    (2) Certified BRDs. The fisheye BRD is certified for use by shrimp 
trawlers in the Gulf EEZ. Specifications of the fisheye BRD are 
contained in Appendix D of this part.

year, subject to the closure provisions of Secs. 622.34(m) and 
622.43(a)(1)(i).
    (B) The remainder is held in reserve.
    (C) The Assistant Administrator may release all or any portion of 
the reserve specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section 
effective September 1 by filing for publication a notification to that 
effect with the Office of the Federal Register. Determination of what 
portion, if any, of the reserve will be released will be based on the 
results of NMFS research regarding the effectiveness of BRDs in reducing 
shrimp trawl- induced mortality of juvenile red snapper. Release of 
reserve amounts will be determined as follows:
    (1) If BRDs reduce shrimp trawl-induced mortality of juvenile red 
snapper by 50 percent or less, none of the reserve specified in 
paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section will be released.
    (2) If BRDs reduce shrimp trawl-induced mortality of juvenile red 
snapper by 60 percent or greater, the entire reserve specified in 
paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section will be released, subject to the 
closure provisions of Secs. 622.34(m) and 622.43(a)(1)(i).
    (3) If BRDs reduce shrimp trawl-induced mortality of juvenile red 
snapper by more than 50 percent but less than 60 percent, for each one 
percentage point increase in bycatch mortality reduction within the 50 
to 60 percent range, an additional 0.159 million lb (0.072 million kg) 
of the reserve specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section will 
be released, subject to the closure provisions of Secs. 622.34(m) and 
622.43(a)(1)(i). Fractional percentage point increases in bycatch 
mortality reduction will be prorated accordingly.
    (ii) Deep-water groupers (i.e., yellowedge grouper, misty grouper, 
warsaw grouper, snowy grouper, and speckled hind), and, after the quota 
for shallow-water grouper is reached, scamp, combined--1.60 million lb 
(0.73 million kg), round weight.
    (iii) Shallow-water groupers (i.e., all groupers other than deep-
water groupers, jewfish, and Nassau grouper), including scamp before the 
quota for shallow-water groupers is reached, combined--9.80 million lb 
(4.45 million kg), round weight.
    (2) Recreational quota for red snapper. The following quota applies 
to persons who harvest red snapper other than under commercial vessel 
permits for Gulf reef fish and the commercial quota specified in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section--4.47 million lb (2.03 million kg), 
round weight, apportioned as follows:
    (i) 2.94 million lb (1.33 million kg) available January 1 each year, 
subject to the closure provisions of Sec. 622.43(a)(1)(ii).
    (ii) The remainder is held in reserve.
    (iii) The Assistant Administrator may release all or any portion of 
the reserve specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section effective 
September 1 by filing a notification for publication to that effect with 
the Office of the Federal Register. Determination of what portion, if 
any, of the reserve will be released will be based on the results of 
NMFS research regarding the effectiveness of BRDs in reducing shrimp 
trawl- induced mortality of juvenile red snapper. Release of reserve 
amounts will be determined as follows:
    (A) If BRDs reduce shrimp trawl-induced mortality of juvenile red 
snapper by 50 percent or less, none of the reserve specified in 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section will be released.
    (B) If BRDs reduce shrimp trawl-induced mortality of juvenile red 
snapper by 60 percent or greater, the entire reserve specified in 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section will be released, subject to the 
closure provisions of Sec. 622.43(a)(1)(ii).
    (C) If BRDs reduce shrimp trawl-induced mortality of juvenile red 
snapper by more than 50 percent but less than 60 percent, for each one 
percentage point increase in bycatch mortality reduction within the 50 
to 60 percent range, an additional 0.153 million lb (0.069 million kg) 
of the reserve specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section will be 
released, subject to the closure provisions of Sec. 622.43(a)(1)(ii). 
Fractional percentage point increases in bycatch mortality reduction 
will be prorated accordingly.

mackerel in or from the EEZ may be possessed on board or landed from a 
vessel with a commercial permit for king mackerel, as required by 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(iii), and operating under the hook-and-line gear quota 
in Sec. 622.42(c)(1)(i)(A)(2)(i):
    (1) From July 1 each fishing year, until 75 percent of the subzone's 
hook-and-line gear quota has been harvested--in amounts not exceeding 
1,250 lb (567 kg) per day.
    (2) From the date that 75 percent of the subzone's hook-and-line 
gear quota has been harvested, until a closure of the west coast 
subzone's fishery for vessels fishing with hook-and-line gear has been 
effected under Sec. 622.43(a)--in amounts not exceeding 500 lb (227 kg) 
per day.
    (iii) Notice of trip limit changes. The Assistant Administrator, by 
filing a notification of trip limit change with the Office of the 
Federal Register, will effect the trip limit changes specified in 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section when the 
requisite harvest level has been reached or is projected to be reached.
    (b) Spanish mackerel. (1) Commercial trip limits are established for 
Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel as follows:
    (i) North of 30 deg.42'45.6" N. lat., which is a line directly east 
from the Georgia/Florida boundary, Spanish mackerel in or from the EEZ 
may not be possessed on board or landed in a day from a vessel for which 
a permit for Spanish mackerel has been issued, as required under 
Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(iv), in amounts exceeding 3,500 lb (1,588 kg).
    (ii) South of 30 deg.42'45.6" N. lat., Spanish mackerel in or from 
the EEZ may not be possessed on board or landed in a day from a vessel 
for which a permit for Spanish mackerel has been issued, as required 
under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(iv)--
    (A) From April 1 through October 31, in amounts exceeding 1,500 lb 
(680 kg).

lb (680 kg).
    (D) After 100 percent of the adjusted quota is taken through the end 
of the fishing year, in amounts not exceeding 500 lb (227kg).
    (2) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the 
adjusted quota is 3.75 million lb (1.70 million kg). The adjusted quota 
is the quota for Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel reduced by an 
amount calculated to allow continued harvests of Atlantic migratory 
group Spanish mackerel at the rate of 500 lb (227 kg) per vessel per day 
for the remainder of the fishing year after the adjusted quota is 
reached. By filing a notification with the Office of the Federal 
Register, the Assistant Administrator will announce when 75 percent and 
100 percent of the adjusted quota is reached or is projected to be 
reached.
    (3) For the purpose of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a day 
starts at 6 a.m., local time, and extends for 24 hours. If a vessel 
terminates a trip prior to 6 a.m., but retains Spanish mackerel on board 
after that time, the Spanish mackerel retained on board will not be 
considered in possession during the succeeding day, provided the vessel 
is not underway between 6 a.m. and the time such Spanish mackerel are 
unloaded, and provided such Spanish mackerel are unloaded prior to 6 
p.m.
    (c) South Atlantic snapper-grouper. When a vessel fishes on a trip 
in the South Atlantic EEZ, the vessel trip limits specified in this

Gulf EEZ is reached in 1996, a daily vessel limit of twenty-five 5-
gallon (19-L) buckets, or volume equivalent (16.88 ft\3\ (478.0 L)), 
applies to the harvest or possession of wild live rock in or from the 
Gulf EEZ, regardless of the number or duration of trips.
    (e) Gulf red snapper. (1) The trip limit for red snapper in or from 
the Gulf for a vessel that has on board a valid commercial permit for 
Gulf reef fish and a valid Class 1 red snapper license is 2,000 lb (907

eviscerated weight.
    (3) The trip limit for red snapper in or from the Gulf for any other 
vessel for which a commercial permit for Gulf reef fish has been issued 
is zero.
    (4) As a condition of a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, 
as required under Sec. 622.4(a)(2)(v), without regard to where red 
snapper are harvested or possessed, a vessel that has been issued such 
permit--
    (i) May not possess red snapper in or from the Gulf in excess of the 
appropriate vessel trip limit, as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through 
(3) of this section.
    (ii) May not transfer or receive at sea red snapper in or from the

        Appendix D to Part 622--Specifications for Certified BRDs

    A. Extended Funnel.
    1. Description. The extended funnel BRD consists of an extension 
with large-mesh webbing in the center (the large-mesh escape section) 
and small-mesh webbing on each end held open by a semi-rigid hoop. A 
funnel of small-mesh webbing is placed inside the extension to form a 
passage for shrimp to the codend. It also creates an area of reduced 
water flow to allow for fish escapement through the large mesh. One side 
of the funnel is extended vertically to form a lead panel and area of 
reduced water flow. There are two sizes of extended funnel BRDs, a 
standard size and an inshore size for small trawls.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements for Standard 
Size.
    (a) Extension Material. The small-mesh sections used on both sides 
of the large-mesh escape section are constructed of 1\5/8\ inch (4.13 
cm), No. 30 stretched mesh, nylon webbing. The front section is 120 
meshes around by 6\1/2\ meshes deep. The back section is 120 meshes 
around by 23 meshes deep.
    (b) Large-Mesh Escape Section. The large-mesh escape section is 
constructed of 8 to 10 inch (20.3 to 25.4 cm), stretched mesh, webbing. 
This section is cut on the bar to form a section that is 15 inches (38.1 
cm) in length by 95 inches (241.3 cm) in circumference. The leading edge 
is attached to the 6\1/2\-mesh extension section and the rear edge is 
attached to the 23-mesh extension section.
    (c) Funnel. The funnel is constructed of 1\1/2\ inch (3.81 cm), 
stretched mesh, No. 30 depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene 
webbing. The circumference of the leading edge is 120 meshes and the 
back edge is 78 meshes. The short side of the funnel is 34 to 36 inches 
(86.4 to 91.4 cm) long and the opposite side of the funnel extends an 
additional 22 to 24 inches (55.9 to 61.0 cm). The circumference of the 
leading edge of the funnel is attached to the forward small-mesh section 
three meshes forward of the large-mesh escape section and is evenly 
sewn, mesh for mesh, to the small-mesh section. The after edge of the 
funnel is attached to the after small-mesh section at its top and bottom 
eight meshes back from the large-mesh escape panel. Seven meshes of the 
top and seven meshes of the bottom of the funnel are attached to eight 
meshes at the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, such eight 
meshes being located immediately adjacent to the top and bottom centers 
of the small-mesh section on the side of the funnel's extended side. The 
extended side of the funnel is sewn at its top and bottom to the top and 
bottom of the small-mesh section, extending at an angle toward the top 
and bottom centers of the small-mesh section.
    (d) Semi-Rigid Hoop. A 30-inch (76.2-cm) diameter hoop constructed 
of plastic-coated trawl cable, swaged together with a \3/8\-inch (9.53-
mm) micropress sleeve, is installed five meshes behind the trailing edge 
of the large-mesh escape section. The extension webbing must be laced to 
the ring around the entire circumference and must be equally distributed 
on the hoop, that is, 30 meshes must be evenly attached to each 
quadrant.
    (e) Installation. The extended funnel BRD is attached 8 inches (20.3 
cm) behind the posterior edge of the TED. If it is attached behind a 
soft TED, a second semi-rigid hoop, as prescribed in paragraph A.2.(d), 
must be installed in the front section of the BRD extension webbing at 
the leading edge of the funnel. The codend of the trawl net is attached 
to the trailing edge of the BRD.
    3. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements for Inshore 
Size.
    (a) Extension Material. The small-mesh sections used on both sides 
of the large-mesh escape section are constructed of 1\3/8\ inch (3.5 
cm), No. 18 stretched mesh, nylon webbing. The front section is 120 
meshes around by 6\1/2\ meshes deep. The back section is 120 meshes 
around by 23 meshes deep.
    (b) Large-Mesh Escape Section. The large-mesh escape section is 
constructed of 8 to 10 inch (20.3 to 25.4 cm), stretched mesh, webbing. 
This section is cut on the bar to form a section that is 15 inches (38.1 
cm) by 75 inches (190.5 cm) in circumference. The leading edge is 
attached to the 6\1/2\-mesh extension section and the rear edge is 
attached to the 23-mesh extension section.
    (c) Funnel. The funnel is constructed of 1\3/8\ inch (3.5 cm), 
stretched mesh, No. 18 depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene 
webbing. The circumference of the leading edge is 120 meshes and the 
back edge is 78 meshes. The short side of the funnel is 30 to 32 inches 
(76.2 to 81.3 cm) long and the opposite side of the funnel extends an 
additional 20 to 22 inches (50.8 to 55.9 cm). The circumference of the 
leading edge of the funnel is attached to the forward small-mesh section 
three meshes forward of the large-mesh escape section and is evenly 
sewn, mesh for mesh, to the small-mesh section. The after edge of the 
funnel is attached to the after small-mesh section at its top and bottom 
eight meshes back from the large-mesh escape panel. Seven meshes of the 
top and seven meshes of the bottom of the funnel are attached to eight 
meshes at the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, such eight 
meshes being located immediately adjacent to the top and bottom centers 
of the small-mesh section on the side of the funnel's extended side. The 
extended side of the funnel is sewn at its top and bottom to the top and 
bottom of the small-mesh section, extending at an angle toward the top 
and bottom centers of the small-mesh section.

[[Page 168]]

    (d) Semi-Rigid Hoop. A 24-inch (61.0-cm) diameter hoop constructed 
of plastic-coated trawl cable, swaged together with a \3/8\-inch (9.53-
mm) micropress sleeve, is installed five meshes behind the trailing edge 
of the large mesh section. The extension webbing must be laced to the 
ring around the entire circumference and must be equally distributed on 
the hoop, that is, 30 meshes must be evenly attached to each quadrant.
    (e) Installation. The extended funnel BRD is attached 8 inches (20.3 
cm) behind the posterior edge of the TED. If it is attached behind a 
soft TED, a second semi-rigid hoop, as prescribed in paragraph A.3.(d), 
must be installed in the front section of the BRD extension webbing at 
the leading edge of the funnel. The codend of the trawl net is attached 
to the trailing edge of the BRD.
    B. Expanded Mesh. The expanded mesh BRD is constructed and installed 
exactly the same as the standard size extended funnel BRD, except that 
one side of the funnel is not extended to form a lead panel.
    C. Fisheye.
    1. Description. The fisheye BRD is a cone-shaped rigid frame 
constructed from aluminum or steel rod of at least \1/4\ inch diameter, 
which is inserted into the codend to form an escape opening. Fisheyes of 
several different shapes and sizes have been tested in different 
positions in the codend.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The fisheye 
has a minimum opening dimension of 5 inches (12.7 cm) and a minimum 
total opening area of 36 square inches (91.4 square cm). The fisheye 
must be installed at the top center of the codend of the trawl to create 
an opening in the trawl facing in the direction of the mouth of the 
trawl no further forward than 11 ft (3.4 m) from the codend drawstring 
(tie-off rings) or 70 percent of the distance between the codend 
drawstring and the forward edge of the codend, excluding any extension, 
whichever is the shorter distance.

direction of the mouth of the trawl, no further forward than 12.5 ft 
(3.81 m) and no less than 8.5 ft (2.59 m) from the codend tie-off rings. 
The Gulf fisheye may not be offset more than 15 meshes perpendicular to 
the top center of the codend.
    E. Jones-Davis.
    1. Description. The Jones-Davis BRD is similar to the expanded mesh 
and the extended funnel BRDs except that the fish escape openings are 
windows cut around the funnel rather than large-mesh sections. In 
addition, a webbing cone fish deflector is installed behind the funnel.
    2. Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements. The Jones-
Davis BRD must contain all of the following.
    (a) Webbing extension. The webbing extension must be constructed 
from a single piece of 1 5/8-inch (3.5-cm) stretch mesh number 30 nylon

    (a) Fishing vessel reports. (1) The owner and operator of a vessel 
for which a vessel permit has been issued under Sec. 630.4 must ensure 
that a daily logbook form is maintained of the vessel's swordfishing 
effort, catch, and disposition on logbook forms available from the 
Science and Research Director. Such forms must be submitted to the 
Science and Research Director postmarked not later than the 7th day 
after sale of the swordfish off-loaded from a trip. If no fishing 
occurred during a month, a report so stating must be submitted in 
accordance with instructions provided with the logbook forms. Logbooks 
must be kept on board the vessel at all times.
    (2) The owner or operator of a vessel for which a vessel permit has 
been issued under Sec. 630.4 must insure that copies of tally sheets are 
submitted for all swordfish off-loaded and for other species off-loaded 
with the swordfish, including, but not limited to, shark,

[[Page 173]]

yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna, and albacore. Each tally sheet must show 
the dealer to whom swordfish and other species were transferred, the 
date transferred, and the carcass weight of each swordfish transferred 
and of each of the other species for which individual carcass weights 
are normally recorded, including, but not limited to, shark, yellowfin 
tuna, bigeye tuna, and albacore. For species not individually weighed, 
tally sheets must record total weights by market category. Copies of 
tally sheets must be submitted with the logbook forms required under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Dealer reports. (1) A dealer who has been issued a dealer permit 
under Sec. 630.4 must submit a report to the Science and Research 
Director twice each month. A report form is available from the Science 
and Research Director. The following information must be included in 
each report:
    (i) Name, address, and permit number of the dealer;
    (ii) Names and official numbers of fishing vessels from which 
swordfish were received;
    (iii) Dates of receipt of swordfish; and
    (iv) Listed by each port and county where swordfish were off-loaded 
from fishing vessels:
    (A) Total weight (pounds) by market category for swordfish, and for 
other species received with the swordfish, including, but not limited 
to, shark, yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna, and albacore; and
    (B) Price per pound or total value paid by market category for 
swordfish and other species, to the extent that such price information 
is known at the time of reporting.
    (2) A report of swordfish and other applicable species received by a 
dealer on the 1st through the 15th days of each month must be submitted 
to the Science and Research Director postmarked not later than the 20th 
day of that month. A report of swordfish received by a dealer on the 
16th through the last day of each month must be submitted to the Science 
and Research Director postmarked not later than the 5th day of the 
following month. If no swordfish were received during a reporting 
period, a report so stating must be submitted postmarked as specified 
for that respective reporting period.
    (3) The reporting requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
may be satisfied by providing a copy of each appropriate weigh-out sheet 
and/or sales record, provided such weigh-out sheet and/or sales record, 
by itself or combined with the form available from the Science and 
Research Director, includes all of the required information.
    (4) For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, for a 
swordfish off-loaded from a fishing vessel in an Atlantic coastal state 
from Maine through Virginia, Science and Research Director means the 
Science and Research Director, Northeast Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, 
Woods Hole, MA 02543, telephone 617-548-5123, or a designee. For a 
swordfish off-loaded from a fishing vessel in an Atlantic coastal state 
from Maine through Virginia, in lieu of providing a required report to 
the Science and Director by mail, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, a dealer may provide a report to a state or Federal 
fishery port agent designated by the Science and Research Director. 
Reports so provided must be delivered to such port agent not later than 
the prescribed post mark date for submitting each such report.

<R05>
Sec. 630.23  Harvest limitations.

    (a) Minimum size. The minimum allowable size for possession on board 
a fishing vessel for a swordfish taken from the north or south Atlantic 
swordfish stocks is 29 inches (73 cm) carcass length, measured along the 
body contour (i.e., a curved measurement) from the cleithrum to the 
anterior portion of the caudal keel (CK measurement) or, if swordfish 
are weighed, 33 lb (15 kg) dressed weight. The cleithrum is the 
semicircular bony structure that forms the posterior edge of the gill 
opening. Measurement must be made at the point on the cleithrum that 
provides the shortest possible CK measurement (Figure 1 to part 630).
    (b) Carcass condition. A swordfish possessed on board a fishing 
vessel of the United States in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of 
Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, must be in whole or dressed form, and a 
swordfish landed from a fishing vessel of the United States in an 
Atlantic coastal port, including the Gulf of Mexico or Caribbean Sea, 
must be maintained in whole or dressed form through offloading, except 
such swordfish as are damaged by shark bites. A shark-bit swordfish for 
which the remainder of the carcass is less than the minimum size limit 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section may not be landed.
    (c) Vessel trip limits. In 1996, vessels issued a swordfish permit 
under Sec. 630.4 may not land from, or possess during, a single trip 
more than 31,600 lb (14,334 kg) dressed weight of swordfish, unless a 
closure has been effected under Sec. 630.25.

Sec. 630.24  Quotas.

    (a) Applicability. (1) A swordfish harvested from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock by a vessel of the United States in other than the 
recreational fishery is counted against the directed-fishery gear quota 
or the by catch quota. A swordfish harvested by drift gillnet, longline, 
or harpoon and landed before the effective date of a closure for that 
gear, done pursuant to Sec. 630.25(a)(1), is counted against the 
applicable directed-fishery gear quota. After a gear closure, a 
swordfish landed by a vessel using or possessing gear for which a 
bycatch is allowed under Sec. 630.25(c) is counted against the bycatch 
allocation specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Notwithstanding 
the above, a swordfish harvested by a vessel using or possessing gear 
other than drift gillnet, longline, harpoon, or rod and reel is counted 
against the bycatch quota specified in paragraph (c) of this section at 
all times.
    (2) A swordfish harvested from the south Atlantic swordfish stock by 
a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is counted 
against the directed-fishery quota for the south Atlantic.
    (3) A swordfish possessed on board or offloaded from a vessel that 
used or had on board a driftnet during its current or most recent 
fishing trip in waters of the North and/or South Atlantic Oceans 
(including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea) will be deemed to have 
been harvested by a driftnet.

[[Page 177]]

    (b) Directed-fishery quotas. (1) The annual directed fishery quota 
for the North Atlantic swordfish stock for the period June 1, 1998, 
through May 31, 1999, is 2,098.6 mt dw, of which 2,057 mt dw is 
allocated for the longline/harpoon fishery and 41.6 mt dw is allocated 
for the driftnet fishery. The allocation for the longline/harpoon 
fishery is divided into two equal semiannual quotas of 1,028.5 mt dw, 
one for the period June 1 through November 30, 1998, and the other for 
the period December 1, 1998, through May 31, 1999.
    (2) The annual directed fishery quota for the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock for the period June 1, 1999, through May 31, 2000, is 
2,033.2 mt dw, of which 1,993 mt dw is allocated for the longline/
harpoon fishery and of which 40.2 mt dw is allocated for the drift 
gillnet fishery. The allocation for the longline/harpoon fishery is 
divided into two equal semiannualquotas of 996.5 mt dw, one for the 
period June 1 through November 30, 1999, and the other for the period 
December 1, 1999, through May 31, 2000.
    (3) The annual directed fishery quota for the South Atlantic 
swordfish stock for the period June 1, 1998, through May 31, 1999, is 
289 mt dw.
    (4) The annual directed fishery quota for the South Atlantic 
swordfish stock for the period June 1, 1999, through May 31, 2000, is 
289 mt dw.
    (5) The annual directed fishery quota for the South Atlantic 
swordfish stock for the period June 1, 2000, through May 31, 2001, is 
289 mt dw.
    (c) Incidental catch quota. The annual bycatch quota for the north 
Atlantic swordfish stock is 300 mt dw; no incidental harvest is 
authorized for the south Atlantic swordfish stock.
    (d) Annual adjustments. (1) As necessary, NMFS will reevaluate the 
annual directed fishery quotas for the North and South Atlantic 
swordfish stocks and the annual incidental catch quota for the North 
Atlantic swordfish stock. NMFS will consider the best available 
scientific information regarding the following factors:
    (i) Swordfish stock abundance assessments;
    (ii) Swordfish stock age and size composition;
    (iii) Catch and effort in the swordfish fishery; and
    (iv) Consistency with ICCAT recommendations.
    (2) Except for the carryover provisions of paragraph (d)(3), of this 
section, NMFS will announce any adjustments to the annual quotas by 
publication of a notice in the Federal Register, providing for a 30-day 
minimum comment period. NMFS will prepare a report of its evaluations, a 
regulatory impact review, and an environmental assessment; and such 
documents will be made available to the public. NMFS will take into 
consideration all information received during this comment period and 
will publish a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (3) If consistent with applicable ICCAT recommendations, total 
landings above or below the specific North Atlantic or South Atlantic 
swordfish annual quota will be subtracted from, or added to, the 
following year's quota for that management area. Any adjustments to the 
12-month directed fishery quota will be apportioned equally between the 
two semiannual periods. NMFS will publish notification in the Federal 
Register of any adjustment and of the apportionment made under this 
paragraph (d)(3).
    (e) Inseason adjustments. (1) NMFS may adjust the December 1 through 
May 31 semiannual directed fishery quota and gear quotas to reflect 
actual catches during the June 1 through November 30 semiannual period, 
provided that the 12-month directed fishery and gear quotas are not 
exceeded.
    (2) If NMFS determines that the annual incidental catch quota will 
not be taken before the end of the fishing year, the excess quota may be 
allocated to the directed fishery quotas.
    (3) If NMFS determines that it is necessary to close the directed 
fishery, any estimated overharvest or underharvest of the directed 
fishery quota available immediately prior to that closure will be used 
to adjust the annual incidental catch quota accordingly.
    (4) NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register of any 
inseason adjustment and its apportionment made under this paragraph (e).

[[Page 178]]

    (f) Gear allocations. If NMFS determines that the annual or 
semiannual directed fishery or incidental catch quotas must be adjusted 
pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, the annual or 
semiannual gear quotas will be adjusted so that the new gear quotas 
represent the same proportion (percentage) of the adjusted quota as they 
did of the quota before adjustment, provided such adjusted gear quotas 
are consistent with applicable requirements under the Endangered Species 
Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
    (g) Adjustments to gear quotas. If NMFS determines that the annual 
directed-fishery or bycatch quotas must be adjusted pursuant to 
paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, the annual or semi-annual gear 
quotas will be adjusted so that the new gear quotas represent the same 
proportion (percentage) of the adjusted quota as they did of the quota 
before adjustment.
    (h) Notice of adjustments. (1) NMFS will announce a proposed 
adjustment in management measures pursuant to paragraph (e), (f), or (g) 
of this section by publication of a proposed rule in the Federal

Sec. 630.24  Quotas.

                                * * * * *

    (b) Directed-fishery quotas. (1) The annual directed fishery quota 
for the North Atlantic swordfish stock for the period June 1, 1997, 
through May 31, 1998, is 2,164 mt dw, of which 2,121.2 mt dw is 
allocated for the longline/harpoon fishery and of which 42.8 mt dw is 
allocated for the drift gillnet fishery. The allocation for the 
longline/harpoon fishery is divided into two equal semiannual quotas of 
1,060.6 mt dw, one for the period June 1 through November 30, 1997, and 
the other for the period December 1, 1997, through May 31, 1998.
    (2) The annual directed fishery quota for the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock for the period June 1, 1998, through May 31, 1999, is 
2,098.6 mt dw, of which 2,057 mt dw is allocated for the longline/
harpoon fishery and of which 41.6 mt dw is allocated for the drift 
gillnet fishery. The allocation for the longline/harpoon fishery is 
divided into two equal semiannual quotas of 1,028.5 mt dw, one for the 
period June 1 through November 30, 1998, and the other for the period 
December 1, 1998, through May 31, 1999.
    (3) The annual directed fishery quota for the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock for the period June 1, 1999, through May 31, 2000, is 
2,033.2 mt dw, of which 1,993 mt dw is allocated for the longline/
harpoon fishery and of which 40.2 mt dw is allocated for the drift 
gillnet fishery. The allocation for the longline/harpoon fishery is 
divided into two equal semiannual quotas of 996.5 mt dw, one for the 
period June 1 through November 30, 1999, and the other for the period 
December 1, 1999, through May 31, 2000.
    (4) A swordfish will be deemed to have been harvested by a drift 
gillnet when it is aboard, or off-loaded in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, 
or Caribbean coastal state from, a vessel using or having aboard a drift 
gillnet or when it is aboard, or off-loaded in an Atlantic, Gulf of 
Mexico, or Caribbean coastal state from, a vessel which used or had 
aboard a drift gillnet during its current or most recent fishing trip.
    (5) The annual directed fishery quota for the south Atlantic 
swordfish stock for the period June 1, 1997, through May 31, 1998, is 
188 mt dw and is divided into two equal semiannual quotas of 94 mt dw, 
one for period June 1 through November 30, 1997, and the other for the 
period December 1, 1997, through May 31, 1998.

                                * * * * *

[[Page 179]]

    (d) Adjustments to annual quotas. (1) NMFS will reevaluate the 
annual total allowable catch, the annual directed-fishery quota, the 
annual bycatch quota, bycatch limits in the non-directed fishery, and 
the harpoon gear set-aside each year. For the purpose of this 
evaluation, NMFS will consider the best available scientific information 
regarding the following factors:
    (i) Swordfish stock abundance assessments;
    (ii) Swordfish stock age and size composition;
    (iii) Catch and effort in the swordfish fishery; and
    (iv) Consistency with ICCAT recommendations.
    (2) NMFS may, at its discretion, convene a panel of scientists with 
expertise in swordfish stock assessment for the purpose of providing 
recommendations for adjustments to annual quotas.
    (3) NMFS will prepare a report of its evaluations, a regulatory 
impact review, and an environmental assessment.
    (4) Total landings above or below the specific north Atlantic 
swordfish annual quota will be subtracted from, or added to, the 
following year's quota. Any adjustments to the 12-month directed-fishery 
quota will then be apportioned equally between the period June 1 through 
November 30 and the period December 1 through May 31.
    (5) NMFS will announce any adjustments to the annual quotas by 
publication of a proposed rule in the Federal Register, providing for a 
minimum of a 30-day comment period. The report of evaluations and any 
regulatory impact review and environmental assessment will be made 
available to the public. The Assistant Administrator will take into 
consideration all information received during this comment period and 
will publish a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (e) NMFS may adjust the December 1 through May 31 semiannual 
directed-fishery quota and gear quotas to reflect actual catches during 
the June 1 through November 30 semiannual period, provided that the 12-
month directed-fishery and gear quotas are not exceeded.
    (f) Inseason adjustments to the bycatch and directed fishery quotas. 
(1) If NMFS determines that the annual bycatch quota will not be taken 
before the end of the fishing year, the excess quota may be allocated to 
the directed-fishery quotas pursuant to the requirements and procedures 
in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
    (2) If NMFS determines that it is necessary to close the directed 
fishery, any estimated overharvest or underharvest directed-fishery 
quota available immediately prior to that closure will be applied to the 
annual bycatch quota and will be used to adjust the annual bycatch quota 
accordingly.

                                * * * * *


<R05>
Sec. 630.25  Closures and incidental limits.

    (a) Notice of closure. (1) When a directed-fishery annual, 
semiannual, or gear quota specified in Sec. 630.24 is reached, or is 
projected to be reached, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal 
Register closing the entire directed fishery for fish from the North 
Atlantic swordfish stock, the South Atlantic swordfish stock, the drift 
gillnet fishery, or the harpoon and longline fisheries, as appropriate. 
The effective date of such notification will be at least 14 days after 
the date such notification is filed at the Office of the Federal 
Register. The closure will remain in effect until an additional 
directed-fishery or gear quota becomes available.
    (2) When the bycatch quota specified in Sec. 630.24(c) is reached, 
or is projected to be reached, NMFS will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register to prohibit further possession or retention of Atlantic 
swordfish by vessels of the United States. The effective date of such 
notice will be at least 14 days after the date such notice is filed at 
the Office of the Federal Register. The closure will remain in effect 
until a new annual bycatch quota becomes available.
    (b) Special set-aside for harpoon gear. The procedures of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section notwithstanding, during the period June 1 through 
November 30, swordfish not exceeding 9,752 kg dw, may be set aside for 
the harpoon segment of the North Atlantic swordfish fishery. If NMFS 
determines that the harpoon and longline quota in this semi-annual 
period will be harvested before the harpoon segment of the fishery has 
had an opportunity to harvest the set-aside amount, the longline segment 
of the fishery will be closed and the harpoon segment will remain open 
until the set-aside amount is reached. The basis for such determination 
by NMFS will be published in the Federal Register in the closure notice.
    (c) Bycatch limits during a directed-fishery closure. (1) During a 
closure of

[[Page 180]]

the drift gillnet fishery, aboard a vessel using or having aboard a 
drift gillnet--
    (i) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock; and
    (ii) No more than two swordfish per trip may be possessed in the 
North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, 
north of 5 deg.N. latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or 
Caribbean coastal state.
    (2) During a closure of the longline fishery, aboard a vessel using 
or having aboard a longline and not having aboard harpoon gear--
    (i) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock; and
    (ii) No more than 15 swordfish per trip may be possessed in the 
North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, 
north of 5<SUP>O</SUP> N. lat., or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of 
Mexico, or Caribbean coastal state. The Assistant Administrator may 
modify or change the bycatch limits upon publication of notice in the 
Federal Register pursuant to the requirements and procedures in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. Changes in the bycatch 
limits will be based upon the length of the directed fishery closure as 
well as the estimated catch per vessel in the non-directed fishery.
    (3) During a closure of the harpoon fishery, aboard a vessel using 
or having aboard harpoon gear--
    (i) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock; and
    (ii) No swordfish may be possessed in the North Atlantic Ocean, 
including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5 deg.N. 
latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean coastal 
state.
    (d) Bycatch limits in the non-directed fishery. Aboard a vessel 
using or having aboard gear other than drift gillnet, harpoon, or 
longline, other than a vessel in the recreational fishery--
    (1) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock;
    (2) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, no more 
than two swordfish per trip may be possessed in the North Atlantic 
Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5  
deg.N. latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean 
coastal state; and
    (3) Aboard a vessel in the squid trawl fishery, no more than five 
swordfish per trip may be possessed in the North Atlantic Ocean, 
including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5  deg.N. 
latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean coastal 
state. For the purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), a vessel is considered 
to be in the squid trawl fishery when it has no commercial fishing gear 
other than trawl gear aboard and squid constitute not less than 75 
percent by weight of the total fish aboard or off-loaded from the 
vessel.
    (e) Limits during a bycatch closure. During a closure of the bycatch 
fishery under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the provisions of 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section notwithstanding, aboard a fishing 
vessel, other than a vessel in the recreational fishery--
    (1) A person may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic 
swordfish stock; and
    (2) No swordfish may be possessed in the North Atlantic Ocean, 
including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5 deg.N. 
latitude, or landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean coastal 
state.

                       Subpart D--Donation Program

    Source: 59 FR 55064, Nov. 3, 1994, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 630.50  Purpose.

    This subpart implements a program under which swordfish from the 
North Atlantic swordfish stock that are retained in excess of the trip 
allowance for undersized swordfish specified in Sec. 630.23(b) must be 
retained for donation through the Second Harvest National Foodbank 
Network to the needy. This program is intended to obtain additional 
information regarding the harvest, mortality, and biological 
characteristics of swordfish less than the minimum size limit and to 
avoid waste of swordfish that would otherwise be discarded dead.


<R05>
Sec. 630.51  Participation.

    (a) General. Owners of vessels and dealers permitted under 
Sec. 630.4 may volunteer to participate in the swordfish donation 
program by contacting the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, 
Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, NMFS, 1335 East-West 
Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910; telephone: (301) 713-2347, facsimile 
(301) 588-4967. The Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, will 
select owners of vessels and dealers who may participate in the donation 
program and will keep selected vessel owners advised of the selected 
dealers.
    (1) Factors that will be considered in the selection process 
include:
    (i) History of voluntary participation in NMFS cooperative 
scientific programs;
    (ii) Whether both vessel and dealer volunteers can be matched in an 
area throughout the year (including truck routes) to ensure distribution 
of donated fish;
    (iii) Representative coverage of the fishery, to the extent 
possible; and
    (iv) Compliance record of volunteers. Specifically, any person who 
has been issued a Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA) for 
violating any provision of the Magnuson Act (16 U.S.C. 1802 et seq.), 
the Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.), or the ATCA (16 U.S.C. 971 et 
seq.), or who is currently under investigation for such a violation, may 
be excluded from the program.
    (2) Selected dealers will also be advised of the selected vessel 
owners and of authorized Second Harvest recipients of donated swordfish.
    (3) Second Harvest is the Second Harvest National Foodbank Network, 
116 South Michigan Avenue, Suite 4, Chicago, IL 60603-6001. Second 
Harvest affiliates are Certified Affiliate Food Banks throughout the 
United States that have a contract with Second Harvest and are 
officially part of their National Foodbank Network. Agents of Second 
Harvest are the individual charities that distribute or serve food to 
the needy from the Affiliate Food Banks, or a business designated by 
letter from Second Harvest to transport donated food between the 
foodbank and the charity.
    (b) Vessels. The owner, or their operator, of a vessel that has been 
selected to participate in the donation program and so notified in 
writing by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, may retain 
swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock that are in excess of 
the trip allowance for undersized swordfish specified in Sec. 630.23(b) 
under the following terms and conditions. No person may land a swordfish 
in excess of the trip allowance for undersized swordfish other than in 
accordance with these terms and conditions; any such landing constitutes 
a violation of the prohibition specified in Sec. 630.7(q).
    (1) The vessel's selection letter from the Chief, Highly Migratory 
Species Division, must be carried on board the fishing vessel and the 
operator must present it for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer.
    (2) The vessel's owner or operator must release any swordfish that 
is less than the minimum allowable size specified in Sec. 630.23(a) and 
that is alive when brought aboard the vessel, in a manner that will 
ensure maximum probability of survival. If caught by hook, such fish 
must be released by cutting the line near the hook without removing the 
swordfish from the water. The

[[Page 182]]

owner or operator must make a reasonable effort to tag each swordfish 
released under this paragraph (b)(2). In addition, participants are 
encouraged to tag all released small bluefin tuna, big eye tuna, 
yellowfin tuna and sharks where possible. Tags will be provided by the 
Science and Research Director. A record of each tag and release must be 
maintained and submitted to the Science and Research Director on forms 
provided with the tags.
    (3) The vessel's owner or operator must retain any swordfish that is 
dead when brought aboard the vessel.
    (4) The vessel's owner or operator must tag any swordfish that is 
retained under the donation program of this subpart prior to its off-
loading from a vessel at the facility of a selected dealer, using a non-
reusable, individually numbered donation tag provided by the Chief, 
Highly Migratory Species Division. The donation tag is not to be removed 
by the vessel crew, dealer, or Second Harvest until the carcass is 
processed.
    (5) All tags assigned to a vessel by NMFS Highly Migratory Species 
Division, used or unused, must be accounted for by the owner/operator at 
the request of any authorized officer.
    (6) The vessel's owner or operator must off-load any swordfish that 
is retained under the donation program of this subpart only at a 
specified facility of a dealer who has been selected by the Chief, 
Highly Migratory Species Division, to participate in the donation 
program. Off-loading must begin between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. 
local time. An owner or operator must notify the Chief, NMFS Office of 
Enforcement, by telephone at numbers given in the vessel owner's 
selection letter, and a selected dealer, at least 24 hours prior to off-
loading swordfish under the donation program, unless stated otherwise in 
the vessel owner's selection letter.
    (7) The Assistant Administrator, upon consulting with industry 
representatives and NMFS Office of Enforcement, may change the 
requirements for off-loading by notification in the Federal Register.
    (8) All swordfish harvested during a trip by a vessel participating 
in this pilot program must be off-loaded at the same facility to a 
dealer participating in this donation program.
    (9) No vessel owner or operator may sell, trade, or barter, or 
attempt to sell, trade, or barter, any swordfish or any part thereof 
that is retained under the donation program of this subpart.
    (c) Dealers. A dealer who has been selected and so notified in 
writing by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, to participate 
in the donation program may receive and retain swordfish from the North 
Atlantic swordfish stock that are in excess of a vessel's trip allowance 
for undersized swordfish specified in Sec. 630.23(b) under the following 
terms and conditions. Possession of an undersized swordfish other than 
in accordance with these terms and conditions constitutes a violation of 
the prohibition specified in Sec. 620.7(a) of this chapter.
    (1) Dealers must have available on their premises, or facility, the 
dealer selection letter from the Chief, Highly Migratory Species 
Division, and must present it for inspection upon the request of an 
authorized officer.
    (2) A dealer may receive swordfish in excess of a vessel's trip 
allowance for undersized swordfish only from a vessel that has been 
selected by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, to participate 
in the donation program.
    (3) A swordfish that is received under the donation program must be 
kept separate from other swordfish possessed by the dealer. The donation 
tag on such swordfish may not be removed.
    (4) No dealer may sell, trade, or barter, or attempt to sell, trade, 
or barter, any swordfish, or any part thereof, that is retained under 
the donation program of this subpart.
    (5) A dealer may transfer any swordfish that is received under the 
donation program only to Second Harvest, and such swordfish may be 
transported only by Second Harvest or their designated agent. The dealer 
must obtain the receipt specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section 
from Second Harvest or their designated agent. A copy of the receipt 
must be furnished by the dealer to the harvesting vessel.
    (6) The dealer must include individual swordfish tag numbers along 
with the associated individual carcass weights of swordfish received 
under the

[[Page 183]]

donation program in the twice-monthly reports required by Sec. 630.5(b).
    (d) Second Harvest. Second Harvest, or its affiliates or agents, may 
receive and distribute swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock 
that are in excess of the trip allowance for undersized swordfish 
specified in Sec. 630.23(b) under the following terms and conditions. 
Possession of a swordfish other than in accordance with these terms and 
conditions constitutes a violation of the prohibition specified in 
Sec. 620.7(a) of this chapter.
    (1) Second Harvest may receive swordfish that are in excess of the 
trip allowance for undersized swordfish only from a dealer who has been 
selected by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, to participate 
in the donation program.
    (2) Second Harvest may receive only undersized swordfish with 
donation tags attached.
    (3) Upon receiving swordfish under the donation program, Second 
Harvest must provide a bill of lading receipt that shows, or has 
affixed, individual carcass weights and associated tag numbers of 
swordfish received, the names and permit number(s) of the vessel(s) that 
harvested the swordfish, the name and permit number of the dealer, and 
the date of receipt. Such receipt must be distributed as follows: 
Original and one copy (for the vessel owner or operator) to the dealer, 
one copy to the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, and one copy 
retained by Second Harvest to accompany the carcass shipment until it is 
processed.
    (4) All tags received by Second Harvest affiliates or agents must be 
returned to Second Harvest and accounted for by Second Harvest at the 
request of any authorized officer, or Chief, Highly Migratory Species 
Division.
    (5) Second Harvest, its affiliates or agents, may not sell, trade, 
or barter, or attempt to sell, trade, or barter, any swordfish or any 
part thereof that is retained under the donation program of this 
subpart.
    (e) Duration of selection. A selection letter remains valid for the 
period specified therein, provided the permit issued to the 
participating vessel or dealer under Sec. 630.4 remains valid, except 
that such selection letter may be revoked by the Chief, Highly Migratory 
Species Division--
    (1) Upon the request of the participating vessel owner or dealer;
    (2) Upon issuance of a Notice of Violation and Assessment against 
the participating vessel owner or dealer for a violation of the Magnuson 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1802 et seq.), the Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.), or

lobster, or part thereof, in or from the EEZ from which eggs, 
swimmerettes, or pleopods have been removed or stripped is prohibited.
    (b) Minimum size limits. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section--
    (i) No person may possess a spiny lobster in or from the EEZ with a 
carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less; and
    (ii) A spiny lobster, harvested in the EEZ by means other than 
diving, with a carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less must be 
returned immediately to the water unharmed.
    (2) No person may harvest or attempt to harvest a spiny lobster by 
diving in the EEZ unless he or she possesses, while in the water, a 
measuring device capable of measuring the carapace length. A spiny 
lobster captured by a

[[Page 192]]

diver must be measured in the water using such measuring device and, if 
the spiny lobster has a carapace length of 3.0 inches (7.62 cm) or less, 
it must be released unharmed immediately without removal from the water.
    (3) Aboard a vessel authorized under paragraph (d) of this section 
to possess a separated spiny lobster tail, no person may possess in or 
from the EEZ a separated spiny lobster tail with a tail length less than 
5.5 inches (13.97 cm).
    (c) Undersized attractants. A live spiny lobster under the minimum 
size limit specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that is 
harvested in the EEZ by a trap may be retained aboard the harvesting 
vessel for future use as an attractant in a trap provided it is held in 
a live well aboard the vessel. No more than fifty undersized spiny 
lobsters, or one per trap aboard the vessel, whichever is greater, may 
be retained aboard for use as attractants. The live well must provide a 
minimum of \3/4\ gallons (1.7 liters) of seawater per spiny lobster. An 
undersized spiny lobster so retained must be released to the water alive 
and unharmed immediately upon leaving the trap lines and prior to one 
hour after official sunset each day.
    (d) Tail separation. The possession aboard a fishing vessel of a 
separated spiny lobster tail in or from the EEZ is authorized only when 
the possession is incidental to fishing exclusively in the EEZ on a trip 
of 48 hours or more and a Federal tail-separation permit specified in 
Sec. 640.4(a)(2) has been issued to and is on board the vessel.

<R05>
Sec. 640.22  Gear and diving restrictions.

    (a) Prohibited gear and methods. (1) A spiny lobster may not be 
taken in the EEZ with a spear, hook, or similar device, or gear 
containing such devices. In the EEZ, the possession of a speared, 
pierced, or punctured spiny lobster is prima facie evidence that 
prohibited gear was used to take such lobster. Hook, as used in this 
paragraph (a)(1), does not include a hook in a hook-and-line fishery for 
species other than spiny lobster; and possession of a spiny lobster that 
has been speared, pierced, or punctured by such hook is not considered 
evidence that prohibited gear was used to take the spiny lobster, 
provided no prohibited gear is on board the vessel.
    (2) A spiny lobster may not be taken in a directed fishery by the 
use of a net or trawl. See Sec. 640.23(d) for the bycatch limits 
applicable to a vessel that uses or has on board a net or trawl.
    (3) Poisons and explosives may not be used to take a spiny lobster 
or slipper lobster in the EEZ. For the purposes of this paragraph 
(a)(3), chlorine, bleach, and similar substances, which are used to 
flush a spiny lobster out of rocks or coral, are poisons. A vessel in 
the spiny lobster or slipper lobster fishery may not possess on board in 
the EEZ any dynamite or similar explosive substance.
    (b) Traps. (1) In the EEZ, a spiny lobster trap may be no larger in 
dimension than 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet (91.4 cm by 61.0 cm by 61.0 
cm), or the volume equivalent. A trap constructed of material other than 
wood must have a panel constructed of wood, cotton, or other material 
that will degrade at the same rate as a wooden trap. Such panel must be 
located in the upper half of the sides or on top of the trap, so that, 
when removed, there will be an opening in the trap no smaller than the 
diameter found at the throat or entrance of the trap.
    (2) A spiny lobster trap in the EEZ may be pulled or tended during 
daylight hours only, that is, from 1 hour before official sunrise to 1 
hour after official sunset.
    (3) A spiny lobster trap in the EEZ may be pulled or tended only by 
the owner's vessel, or by a vessel for which permission to pull or work 
traps belonging to another person has been granted--
    (i) For traps in the EEZ off Florida, by the Florida Division of Law 
Enforcement, Department of Environmental Protection, in accordance with 
the procedures in Rule 46-24.006(7), Florida Administrative Code, in 
effect as of June 1, 1994. This incorporation by reference was approved 
by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register in accordance with 
5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the 
Florida Marine Fisheries Commission, 2540 Executive Center Circle West, 
Suite 106, Tallahassee,

Commercial and recreational fishing season. Except as specified in 
paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, during the commercial and 
recreational fishing season specified in Sec. 640.20(b)(1), the daily 
bag or possession limit of spiny lobster in or from the EEZ off Florida 
and off the Gulf states, other than Florida, is six per person.
    (2) Special recreational fishing seasons. During the special 
recreational fishing seasons specified in Sec. 640.20(b)(2), the daily 
bag or possession limit of spiny lobster--
    (i) In or from the EEZ off the Gulf states, other than Florida, is 
six per person;
    (ii) In or from the EEZ off Florida other than off Monroe County, 
Florida, is twelve per person; and
    (iii) In or from the EEZ off Monroe County, Florida, is six per 
person.
    (3) Exemption from the bag/possession limit. During the commercial 
and recreational fishing season specified in Sec. 640.20(b)(1), a person 
is exempt from the bag and possession limit specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section, provided--
    (i) The harvest of spiny lobsters is by diving, or by the use of a 
bully net, hoop net, or spiny lobster trap; and
    (ii) The vessel from which the person is operating has on board the 
required licenses, certificates, or permits, as specified in 
Sec. 640.4(a)(1).
    (4) Harvest by net or trawl. During the commercial and recreational 
fishing season specified in Sec. 640.20(b)(1), aboard a vessel with the 
required licenses, certificates, or permits specified in 
Sec. 640.4(a)(1) that harvests spiny lobster by net or trawl or has on 
board a net or trawl, the possession of spiny lobster in or from the EEZ 
off Florida and off the Gulf states, other than Florida, may not exceed 
at any time 5 percent, whole weight, of the total whole weight of all 
fish lawfully in possession on board such vessel. If such vessel 
lawfully possesses a separated spiny lobster tail, the possession of 
spiny lobster in or from the EEZ may not exceed at any time 1.6 percent, 
by weight of the spiny lobster or parts thereof, of the total whole 
weight of all fish lawfully in possession on board such vessel. For the 
purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), the term ``net or trawl'' does not 
include a hand-held net, a loading or dip net, a bully net, or a hoop 
net.
    (5) Diving at night. The provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section notwithstanding, a person who harvests spiny lobster in the EEZ 
by diving at night, that is, from 1 hour after official sunset to 1 hour 
before official sunrise, is limited to the bag limit specified in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, whether or not a Federal vessel permit 
specified in Sec. 640.4(a)(1) has been issued to and is on board the 
vessel from which the diver is operating.
    (c) Combination of bag/possession limits. A person who fishes for or 
possesses spiny lobster in or from the EEZ under a bag or possession 
limit specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may not combine 
the bag or possession limits of those paragraphs or combine such bag or 
possession limit with a bag or possession limit applicable to state 
waters.
    (d) Responsibility for bag/possession limits. The operator of a 
vessel that fishes for or possesses spiny lobster in or from the EEZ is 
responsible for the cumulative bag or possession limit specified in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section applicable to that vessel, based 
on the number of persons aboard.

[[Page 194]]

    (e) Transfer at sea. A person who fishes for or possesses spiny 
lobster in or from the EEZ under a bag or possession limit specified in 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may not transfer a spiny lobster at 
sea from a fishing vessel to any other vessel, and no person may receive 
at sea such spiny lobster.

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 52640, Oct. 1, 1998, Sec. 648.2 was 
amended by adding the definitions Dealer code, IVR system, and Quota-
managed species, effective Nov. 1, 1998.


<R05>
Sec. 648.3  Relation to other laws.

    (a) The relation of this part to other laws is set forth in 
Sec. 600.705.
    (b) Nothing in these regulations supersedes more restrictive state 
management measures for any of the species referenced in Sec. 648.1 and, 
for Atlantic salmon, more restrictive local management measures.


<R05>
Sec. 648.4  Vessel and individual commercial permits.

    (a) Fishery specific permit information. (1) NE multispecies 
vessels. Except for vessels that have been issued a valid High Seas 
Fishing Compliance permit, have declared their intent to fish, and fish 
exclusively in the NAFO Regulatory Area as provided in Sec. 648.17, any 
vessel of the United States, including a charter or party boat, must 
have been issued and have on board a valid multispecies permit to fish 
for, possess, or land multispecies finfish in or from the EEZ. 
Multispecies frames used as, or to be used as, bait on a vessel fishing 
exclusively with pot gear are deemed not to be multispecies finfish for 
purposes of this part provided that there is a receipt for the purchase 
of those frames on board the vessel.
    (i) Limited access multispecies permits--(A) Eligibility. To be 
eligible to apply for a limited access multispecies permit, as specified 
in Sec. 648.82, in 1996 and thereafter, a vessel must have been issued a 
limited access multispecies permit for the preceding year, must be 
replacing a vessel that was issued a limited access multispecies permit 
for the preceding year, or must qualify for a 1996 limited access 
multispecies hook-gear permit under this paragraph (a)(1)(i). Vessels 
qualifying for 1996 limited access multispecies hook-gear permits are 
qualified only for that limited access permit category. A vessel is 
eligible for a 1996 limited access multispecies hook-gear permit, 
provided:
    (1) The vessel was issued a 1995 open access multispecies hook-gear 
permit and the owner or operator of the vessel submitted to the Regional 
Administrator, no later than January 26, 1996, fishing log reports dated 
between June 1, 1994, and June 1, 1995, when fishing with hook gear 
under the open access hook-gear permit, documenting landings of at least 
500 lb (226.8 kg) of NE multispecies finfish, or its equivalent in 
numbers of fish; or
    (2) The vessel is replacing such a vessel.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. Owners of vessels must apply 
for a limited access multispecies hook-gear permit before September 1, 
1996, to receive an automatic mailing of an application to renew their 
permit in 1997 and to be assured that their permit application will be 
processed within 30 days. Vessel owners applying after December 31, 
1996, will be ineligible to apply for an initial limited access 
multispecies hook-gear permit. To renew or apply for a limited access 
multispecies permit, a completed application must be received by the 
Regional Administrator by the first day of the fishing

[[Page 207]]

year for which the permit is required. Failure to renew a limited access 
multispecies permit in any year bars the renewal of the permit in 
subsequent years.
    (C) Qualification restriction. Unless the Regional Administrator 
determines to the contrary, no more than one vessel may qualify, at any 
one time, for a limited access permit based on that or another vessel's 
fishing and permit history. If more than one vessel owner claims 
eligibility for a limited access permit, based on one vessel's fishing 
and permit history, the Regional Administrator will determine who is 
entitled to qualify for the permit and the DAS allocation according to 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (D) Change in ownership. The fishing and permit history of a vessel 
is presumed to transfer with the vessel whenever it is bought, sold, or 
otherwise transferred, unless there is a written agreement, signed by 
the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, or other credible written 
evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller is retaining the vessel's 
fishing and permit history for purposes of replacing the vessel.
    (E) Replacement vessels. To be eligible for a limited access permit 
under this section, the replacement vessel must meet the following 
criteria and any applicable criteria under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of 
this section:
    (1) The replacement vessel's horsepower may not exceed by more than 
20 percent the horsepower of the vessel that was initially issued a 
limited access permit as of the date the initial vessel applied for such 
permit.
    (2) The replacement vessel's length, GRT, and NT may not exceed by 
more than 10 percent the length, GRT, and NT of the vessel that was 
initially issued a limited access permit as of the date the initial 
vessel applied for such permit.
    (F) Upgraded vessel. A vessel may be upgraded, whether through 
refitting or replacement, and still be eligible for or be eligible to 
retain or renew a limited access permit, only if the upgrade complies 
with the following:
    (1) The vessel's horsepower may be increased, whether through 
refitting or replacement, only once. Such an increase may not exceed 20 
percent of the horsepower of the vessel initially issued a limited 
access permit as of the date the initial vessel applied for such permit.
    (2) The vessel's length, GRT, and NT may be increased, whether 
through refitting or replacement, only once. Any increase in any of 
these three specifications of vessel size may not exceed 10 percent of 
the respective specification of the vessel initially issued a limited 
access permit as of the date the initial vessel applied for such permit. 
If any of these three specifications is increased, any increase in the 
other two must be performed at the same time. This type of upgrade may 
be done separately from an engine horsepower upgrade.
    (G) Consolidation restriction. Limited access permits and DAS 
allocations may not be combined or consolidated.
    (H) Appeal of denial of permit. (1) Eligibility. Any applicant 
eligible to apply for an initial limited access multispecies hook-gear 
permit who is denied such permit may appeal the denial to the Regional 
Administrator within 30 days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal 
must be based on one or more of the following grounds, must be in 
writing, and must state the grounds for the appeal:
    (i) The information used by the Regional Administrator was based on 
mistaken or incorrect data.
    (ii) The applicant was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her 
control from meeting relevant criteria.
    (iii) The applicant has new or additional information.
    (2) Appeal review. The Regional Administrator will appoint a 
designee who will make the initial decision on the appeal. The appellant 
may request a review of the initial decision by the Regional 
Administrator by so requesting in writing within 30 days of the notice 
of the initial decision. If the appellant does not request a review of 
the initial decision within 30 days, the initial decision shall become 
the final administrative action of the Department of Commerce. Such 
review will be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the Regional 
Administrator. The hearing officer shall make findings and a 
recommendation to the Regional Administratorch shall be advisory

[[Page 208]]

only. Upon receiving the findings and a recommendation, the Regional 
Administrator will issue a final decision on the appeal. The Regional 
Administrator's decision is the final administrative action of the 
Department of Commerce.
    (3) Status of vessels pending appeal. A vessel denied a limited 
access multispecies hook-gear permit may fish under the limited access 
multispecies hook-gear category, provided that the denial has been 
appealed, the appeal is pending, and the vessel has on board a letter 
from the Regional Administrator authorizing the vessel to fish under the 
limited access hook-gear category. The Regional Administrator will issue 
such a letter for the pendency of any appeal. Any such decision is the 
final administrative action of the Department of Commerce on allowable 
fishing activity, pending a final decision on the appeal. The letter of 
authorization must be carried on board the vessel. If the appeal is 
finally denied, the Regional Administrator shall send a notice of final 
denial to the vessel owner; the authorizing letter becomes invalid 5 
days after receipt of the notice of denial.
    (I) Limited access permit restrictions. (1) A vessel may be issued a 
limited access multispecies permit in only one category during a fishing 
year. Vessels may not change limited access multispecies permit 
categories during the fishing year, except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(I)(2) of this section. A vessel issued a limited access 
multispecies hook-gear permit may not change its limited access permit 
category at any time.
    (2) The owner of a vessel issued a limited access multispecies 
permit may request a change in permit category, unless otherwise 
restricted by paragraph (a)(1)(i)(I)(1) of this section. In 1996, a 
vessel owner has one opportunity to request a change in permit category 
by submitting an application to the Regional Administrator by August 14, 
1996. If a complete application is not submitted by that date, the 
vessel must fish only in the DAS program assigned for the remainder of 
the 1996 fishing year. Any DAS that a vessel uses prior to a change in 
permit category will be counted against its allocation received under 
any subsequent permit category. For 1997 and beyond, the owner of a 
limited access multispecies vessel eligible to request a change in 
permit category must elect a category prior to the start of each fishing 
year and will have one opportunity to request a change in permit 
category by submitting an application to the Regional Administrator 
within 45 days of issuance of the vessel's permit. After that date, the 
vessel must remain in that permit category for the duration of the 
fishing year.
    (3) With the exception of combination vessels, sea scallop dredge 
vessels are not eligible for limited access multispecies permits.
    (J) Confirmation of Permit History. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this part, a person who does not currently own a fishing 
vessel, but who has owned a qualifying vessel that has sunk, been 
destroyed, or transferred to another person, may apply for and receive a 
Confirmation of Permit History (CPH) if the fishing and permit history 
of such vessel has been retained lawfully by the applicant. To be 
eligible to obtain a CPH, the applicant must show that the qualifying 
vessel meets the eligibility requirements, as applicable, in this part. 
Issuance of a valid and current CPH preserves the eligibility of the 
applicant to apply for or renew a limited access permit for a 
replacement vessel based on the qualifying vessel's fishing and permit 
history at a subsequent time, subject to the replacement provisions 
specified in this section. A CPH must be applied for and received on an 
annual basis in order for the applicant to preserve the fishing rights 
and limited access eligibility of the qualifying vessel. If fishing 
privileges have been assigned or allocated previously under this part, 
based on the qualifying vessel's fishing and permit history, the CPH 
also preserves such fishing privileges. Any decision regarding the 
issuance of a CPH for a qualifying vessel that has applied for or been 
issued previously a limited access permit is a final agency action 
subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 704. An application for a CPH 
must be received by the Regional Administrator by the beginning of the 
fishing year for which it is required. Information requirements for the 
CPH

[[Page 209]]

application are the same as those for a limited access permit with any 
request for information about the vessel being applicable to the 
qualifying vessel that has been sunk, destroyed, or transferred. Vessel 
permit applicants who have been issued a CPH and who wish to obtain a 
vessel permit for a replacement vessel based upon the previous vessel 
history may do so pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J).
    (K) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. If a 
vessel's limited access permit for a particular fishery is voluntarily 
relinquished to the Regional Administrator, or abandoned through failure 
to renew or otherwise, no limited access permit for that fishery may be 
re-issued or renewed based on that vessel's history or to any vessel 
relying on that vessel's history.
    (L) Restriction on permit splitting. A limited access multispecies 
permit may not be issued to a vessel or its replacement, or remain 
valid, if the vessel's permit or fishing history has been used to 
qualify another vessel for another Federal fishery.
    (ii) Open access permits. A vessel of the United States that has not 
been issued a limited access multispecies permit is eligible for and may 
be issued an open access multispecies handgear, charter/party or 
nonregulated multispecies permit and may fish for, possess and land 
multispecies finfish subject to the restrictions in Sec. 648.88. A 
vessel that has been issued a valid limited access scallop permit, but 
that has not been issued a limited access multispecies permit, is 
eligible for and may be issued an open access scallop multispecies 
possession limit permit and may fish for, possess and land multispecies 
finfish subject to the restrictions in Sec. 648.88. The owner of a 
vessel issued an open access permit may request a different open access 
permit category by submitting an application to the Regional 
Administrator at any time.
    (2) Atlantic sea scallop vessels-- Any vessel of the United States 
that fishes for, possesses, or lands Atlantic sea scallops in quantities 
greater than 40 lb (18.14 kg) shucked, or 5 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell 
scallops per trip, except vessels that fish exclusively in state waters 
for scallops, must have been issued and carry on board a valid scallop 
permit.
    (i) Limited access scallop permits. Any vessel of the United States 
that possesses or lands more than 400 lb (181.44 kg) of shucked, or the 
equivalent amount of in-shell scallops (50 bu (176.2 L)) per trip, 
except vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for scallops, must 
have been issued and carry on board a valid limited access scallop 
permit.
    (A) Eligibility. To be eligible to apply for a limited access 
scallop permit, a vessel must have been issued a limited access scallop 
permit for the preceding year, or the vessel must be replacing a vessel 
that has been issued a limited access scallop permit for the preceding 
year.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. To renew or apply for a 
limited access scallop permit, a completed application must be received 
by the Regional Administrator by the first day of the fishing year for 
which the permit is required. Failure to renew a limited access scallop 
permit in any year bars the renewal of the permit in subsequent years.
    (C) Qualification restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this 
section.
    (D) Change in ownership. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (E) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(E) of this section.
    (F) Upgraded vessel. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(F) of this section.
    (G) Consolidation restriction. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(G) of this 
section.
    (H) Percentage ownership restrictions. (1) For any vessel acquired 
after March 1, 1994, a vessel owner is not eligible to be issued a 
limited access scallop permit for the vessel if the issuance of the 
permit will result in the vessel owner, or any person who is a 
shareholder or partner of the vessel owner, having an ownership interest 
in limited access scallop vessels in excess of 5 percent of the number 
of all limited access scallop vessels at the time of permit application.
    (2) Vessel owners who were initially issued a 1994 limited access 
scallop permit, or were issued or renewed a limited access scallop 
permit for a vessel in 1995 and thereafter in compliance with the 
ownership restrictions in

[[Page 210]]

paragraph (a)(2)(i)(H)(1) of this section, are eligible to renew such 
permit(s), regardless of whether the renewal of the permits will result 
in the 5 percent ownership restriction being exceeded.
    (3) Having an ownership interest includes, but is not limited to, 
persons who are shareholders in a vessel owned by a corporation, who are 
partners (general or limited) to a vessel owner, or who, in any way, 
partly own a vessel.
    (I) Limited access permit restrictions. A vessel may be issued a 
limited access scallop permit in only one category during a fishing 
year. The owner of a vessel issued a limited access scallop permit must 
elect a permit category for that vessel prior to the start of each 
fishing year and will have one opportunity to request a change in permit 
category by submitting an application to the Regional Administrator 
within 45 days of issuance of the vessel's permit. After this date, the 
vessel must remain in that permit category for the duration of the 
fishing year. Any DAS that a vessel uses prior to a change in permit 
category will be counted against its allocation received under any 
subsequent permit category.
    (J) Confirmation of Permit History. See paragraph (a)(1)(i)(J) of 
this section.
    (K) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of permits. See 
paragraph (a)(1)(i)(K) of this section.
    (ii) General scallop permit. Any vessel of the United States that is 
not in possession of a limited access scallop permit, and that 
possesses, or lands per trip, more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) and less than 
or including 400 lb (181.44 kg) of shucked meats, or the equivalent 
amount of in-shell scallops (5 and 50 bu (176.2 L and 176.2 L), 
respectively), except vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for 
scallops, must carry on board a valid general scallop permit.
    (3) Summer flounder vessels. Any vessel of the United States that 
fishes for or retains summer flounder in the EEZ must have been issued 
and carry on board a valid summer flounder permit, except for vessels 
other than party or charter vessels that observe the possession limit 
set forth in Sec. 648.105.
    (i) Moratorium permits (applicable through 1997). (A) Eligibility. 
To be eligible to apply for a moratorium permit to fish for and retain 
summer flounder in excess of the possession limit in Sec. 648.105 in the 
EEZ, a vessel must have been issued a summer flounder moratorium permit 
in a previous year or be replacing a vessel that was issued a moratorium 
permit for a previous year.
    (B) Application/renewal restriction. No one may apply for a summer 
flounder moratorium permit for a vessel after:
    (1) The owner retires the vessel from the fishery.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (C) Replacement vessels. To be eligible for a moratorium permit, the 
replacement vessel must meet the following criteria:
    (1) The replacement vessel's horsepower may not exceed by more than 
20 percent the horsepower of the vessel that was initially issued a 
moratorium permit as of January 2, 1998.
    (2) The replacement vessel's length, GRT, and NT may not exceed by 
more than 10 percent the length, GRT, and NT of the vessel that was 
initially issued a moratorium permit as of January 2, 1998.
    (3) A vessel's horsepower may be increased through replacement only 
once. A vessel's length, GRT, and NT may be increased through 
replacement only once. If any of these specifications is increased, any 
increase in the other two must be performed at the same time. This type 
of increase may be done separately from a horsepower increase.
    (ii) Party and charter boat permits. Any party or charter boat is 
eligible for a permit to fish for summer flounder, other than a summer 
flounder moratorium permit, if it is carrying passengers for hire. Such 
vessel must observe the possession limits specified in Sec. 648.105.
    (iii) Exemption permits. Owners of summer flounder vessels seeking 
an exemption from the minimum mesh requirement under the provisions of 
Sec. 648.104(b)(1) must apply to the Regional Administrator under 
paragraph (c) of this section at least 7 days prior to the date they 
wish the permit to become effective. The applicant must mark ``Exemption 
Permit Request'' on the permit application at the top. A permit issued 
under this paragraph

[[Page 211]]

(a)(3)(iii) does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of 
this section, but is subject to the other provisions of this section. 
Persons issued an exemption permit must surrender it to the Regional 
Administrator at least 1 day prior to the date they wish to fish not 
subject to the exemption. The Regional Administrator may impose 
temporary additional procedural requirements by publishing a 
notification in the Federal Register.
    (4) Surf clam and ocean quahog vessels. Any vessel of the United 
States that fishes for surf clams or ocean quahogs, except vessels 
taking surf clams and ocean quahogs for personal use or fishing 
exclusively within state waters, must have been issued and carry on 
board a valid surf clam or ocean quahog permit, respectively.
    (i) Maine mahogany quahog permit. (A) A vessel is eligible for a 
Maine mahogany quahog permit to fish for ocean quahogs in the Maine 
mahogany quahog zone if it meets the following eligibility criteria:
    (1) The vessel was issued a Federal Maine Mahogany Quahog 
Experimental Permit during one of the experimental fisheries authorized 
by the Regional Administrator between September 30, 1990, and September 
30, 1997; and,
    (2) The vessel landed at least one Maine bushel of ocean quahogs 
from the Maine mahogany quahog zone as documented by fishing or 
shellfish logs submitted to the Regional Administrator prior to January 
1, 1998.
    (B) Application/renewal restriction. No one may apply for a Maine 
mahogany quahog permit for a vessel after May 19, 1999.
    (C) Replacement vessels. To be eligible for a Maine mahogany quahog 
permit, a replacement vessel must be replacing a vessel of substantially 
similar harvesting capacity that is judged unseaworthy by the USCG, for 
reasons other than lack of maintenance, or that involuntarily left the 
fishery. Both the entering and replaced vessels must be owned by the 
same person. Vessel permits issued to vessels that involuntarily leave 
the fishery may not be combined to create larger replacement vessels.
    (D) Appeal of denial of a permit. (1) Any applicant denied a Maine 
mahogany quahog permit may appeal to the Regional Administrator within 
30 days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal shall be in writing. 
The only ground for appeal is that the Regional Administrator's designee 
erred in concluding that the vessel did not meet the criteria in 
paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section. The appeal must set forth the 
basis for the applicant's belief that the decision of the Regional 
Administrator's designee was made in error.
    (2) The appeal may be presented, at the option of the applicant, at 
a hearing before an officer appointed by the Regional Administrator.
    (3) The hearing officer shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Administrator.
    (4) The Regional Administrator will make a final decision based on 
the criteria in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section and on the 
available record, including any relevant documentation submitted by the 
applicant and, if a hearing is held, the recommendation of the hearing 
officer. The decision on the appeal by the Regional Administrator is the 
final decision of the Department of Commerce.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (5) Mackerel, squid, and butterfish vessels. Any vessel of the 
United States, including party and charter vessels, must have been 
issued and carry on board a valid vessel permit to fish for, possess, or 
land Atlantic mackerel, squid, or butterfish in or from the EEZ.
    (i) Loligo squid and butterfish moratorium permit. (A) Eligibility. 
A vessel is eligible for a moratorium permit to fish for and retain 
Loligo squid or butterfish in excess of the incidental catch allowance 
specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, if it meets any of 
the following criteria:
    (1) The vessel landed and sold at least 20,000 lb (9.07 mt) of 
Loligo squid or butterfish in any 30 consecutive day period between 
August 13, 1981, and August 13, 1993.
    (2) The vessel is replacing such a vessel and the replacement vessel 
meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(i)(C) of this section.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. No one may apply for an 
initial Loligo squid and butterfish moratorium permit for a vessel 
after:

[[Page 212]]

    (1) August 31, 1998; or
    (2) The owner retires the vessel from the fishery.
    (C) Replacement vessels. To be eligible for a moratorium permit, the 
replacement vessel must be replacing a vessel of substantially similar 
harvesting capacity that is judged unseaworthy by the USCG, for reasons 
other than lack of maintenance, or that involuntarily left the fishery 
during the moratorium. Both the entering and replaced vessels must be 
owned by the same person. Vessel permits issued to vessels that 
involuntarily leave the fishery may not be combined to create larger 
replacement vessels.
    (D) Appeal of denial of permit. (1) Any applicant denied a 
moratorium permit may appeal to the Regional Administrator within 30 
days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal shall be in writing. The 
only ground for appeal is that the Regional Administrator erred in 
concluding that the vessel did not meet the criteria in paragraph 
(a)(5)(i)(A)(1) of this section. The appeal shall set forth the basis 
for the applicant's belief that the Regional Administrator's decision 
was made in error.
    (2) The appeal may be presented, at the option of the applicant, at 
a hearing before an officer appointed by the Regional Administrator.
    (3) The hearing officer shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Administrator.
    (4) The decision on the appeal by the Regional Administrator is the 
final decision of the Department of Commerce.
    (ii) Illex squid moratorium permit (Applicable from July 1, 1997, 
until July 1, 2002.)
    (A) Eligibility. A vessel is eligible for a moratorium permit to 
fish for and retain Illex squid in excess of the incidental catch 
allowance specified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, if it 
meets any of the following criteria:
    (1) The vessel landed and sold 5,000 lb (2.27 mt) or more of Illex 
squid on at least 5 separate trips between August 13, 1981, and August 
13, 1993; or
    (2) The vessel is replacing such a vessel and meets the requirements 
of paragraph (a)(5)(i)(C) of this section.
    (3) The vessel was under construction for, or was being rerigged 
for, use in the directed fishery for Illex squid on August 13, 1993, and 
the vessel landed and sold 5,000 lb (2.27 mt) or more of Illex squid on 
at least 5 separate trips prior to December 31, 1994.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. No one may apply for an 
initial Illex squid moratorium permit for a vessel after:
    (1) August 31, 1998; or
    (2) The owner retires the vessel from the fishery.
    (C) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(5)(i)(C) of this section.
    (D) Appeal of denial of permit. See paragraph (a)(3)(i)(D) of this 
section.
    (iii) Squid/butterfish incidental catch permit. Any vessel of the 
United States may obtain a permit to fish for or retain up to 2,500 lb 
(1.13 mt) of Loligo squid or butterfish, or up to 5,000 lb (2.27 mt) of 
Illex squid, as an incidental catch in another directed fishery. The 
incidental catch allowance may be revised by the Regional Administrator 
based upon a recommendation by the Council following the procedure set 
forth in Sec. 648.21.
    (iv) Atlantic mackerel permit. Any vessel of the United States may 
obtain a permit to fish for or retain Atlantic mackerel in or from the 
EEZ.
    (v) Party and charter boat permits. The owner of any party or 
charter boat must obtain a permit to fish for or retain in or from the 
EEZ mackerel, squid, or butterfish while carrying passengers for hire.
    (6) Scup vessels. Beginning on January 1, 1997, and subject to the 
eligibility requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and 
(a)(6)(ii) of this section, the owner of a vessel of the United States, 
including a party or charter vessel, must obtain a permit issued under 
this part to fish for or retain scup for sale, barter or trade, in or 
from the EEZ north of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat. Any vessel, other than a 
party or charter boat, that observes the possession limit restrictions 
established pursuant to, and the prohibition on sale specified in, 
Sec. 648.125 is exempt from the permit requirement.
    (i) Moratorium permit--(A) Eligibility. A vessel is eligible for a 
moratorium permit to fish for and retain scup for sale if it meets any 
of the following criteria:

[[Page 213]]

    (1) The vessel landed and sold scup between January 26, 1988, and 
January 26, 1993; or
    (2) The vessel is replacing such a vessel and meets the requirements 
of paragraph (a)(5)(i)(C) of this section.
    (3) The vessel was under construction for, or was being rerigged 
for, use in the directed fishery for scup on January 26, 1993, provided 
the vessel landed scup for sale by January 26, 1994.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. (1) No one may apply for an 
initial scup moratorium permit after August 31, 1998.
    (2) No one may apply for a scup moratorium permit after the owner 
retires the vessel from the fishery.
    (C) Replacement vessels. See paragraph (a)(5)(i)(C) of this section.
    (D) Appeal of denial of permit. (1) Any applicant denied a scup 
moratorium permit may appeal to the Regional Administrator within 30 
days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal shall be in writing. The 
only ground for appeal is that the Regional Administrator erred in 
concluding that the vessel did not meet the criteria in paragraph 
(a)(6)(i)(A)(1) of this section. The appeal shall set forth the basis 
for the applicant's belief that the Regional Administrator's decision 
was made in error.
    (2) The appeal may be presented, at the option of the applicant, at 
a hearing before an officer appointed by the Regional Administrator.
    (3) The hearing officer shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Administrator.
    (4) The decision on the appeal by the Regional Administrator is the 
final decision of the Department of Commerce.
    (ii) Party and charter boat permit. Any party or charter boat is 
eligible for a permit to fish for scup, other than a scup moratorium 
permit, if it is carrying passengers for hire. Such vessel must observe 
the possession limits established pursuant to, and the prohibitions on 
sale specified in, Sec. 648.125.
    (7) Black sea bass vessels. Beginning June 1, 1997, any vessel of 
the United States that fishes for or retains black sea bass in or from 
the EEZ north of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat., the latitude of Cape Hatteras 
Light, NC, must have been issued and carry on board a valid black sea 
bass moratorium permit, except for vessels other than party or charter 
vessels that observe the possession limit established pursuant to 
Sec. 648.145.
    (i) Moratorium permits--(A) Eligibility. A vessel is eligible to 
receive a permit to fish for and retain black sea bass in excess of the 
possession limit established pursuant to Sec. 648.145 in the EEZ north 
of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat., the latitude of Cape Hatteras Light, NC, if it 
meets any of the following criteria:
    (1) The vessel landed and sold black sea bass in the management unit 
between January 26, 1988, and January 26, 1993; or
    (2) The vessel was under construction for, or was being rerigged 
for, use in the directed fishery for black sea bass on January 26, 1993, 
provided the vessel landed black sea bass in the management unit for 
sale prior to January 26, 1994.
    (3) The vessel is replacing a vessel of substantially similar 
harvesting capacity that qualifies under the criteria in paragraphs 
(a)(7)(i)(A) (1) or (2) of this section, and both the entering and 
replaced vessels are owned by the same person. Vessel permits issued to 
vessels that leave the fishery may not be combined to create larger 
replacement vessels.
    (B) Application/renewal restrictions. No one may apply for an 
initial black sea bass moratorium permit after:
    (1) August 31, 1998; or
    (2) The owner retires the vessel from the fishery.
    (C) Qualification restriction. Unless the Regional Administrator 
determines to the contrary, no more than one vessel may qualify at any 
one time for a black sea bass moratorium permit based on that or another 
vessel's fishing and permit history. If more than one vessel owner 
claims eligibility for a black sea bass moratorium permit based on one 
vessel's fishing and permit history, the Regional Administrator will 
determine who is entitled to qualify for the permit according to 
paragraph (a)(7)(i)(D) of this section.
    (D) Change in ownership. The fishing and permit history of a vessel 
is presumed to transfer with the vessel

[[Page 214]]

whenever it is bought, sold, or otherwise transferred, unless there is a 
written agreement, signed by the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, 
or other credible written evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller 
is retaining the vessel's fishing and permit history for purposes of 
replacing the vessel. If the fishing and permit history of the vessel is 
transferred, the transferee/buyer must comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (h) of this section for the continuation of a moratorium 
permit for his or her benefit.
    (E) Replacement vessels. To be eligible for a moratorium permit 
under this section, the replacement vessel must be of substantially 
similar harvesting capacity as the vessel that initially qualified for 
the moratorium permit, and both vessels must be owned by the same 
person. Vessel permits issued to vessels that leave the fishery may not 
be combined to create larger replacement vessels.
    (F) Appeal of denial of permit. (1) Any applicant denied a 
moratorium permit may appeal to the Regional Administrator within 30 
days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal shall be in writing. The 
only ground for appeal is that the Regional Administrator erred in 
concluding that the vessel did not meet the criteria in paragraph 
(a)(7)(i)(A) (1) or (2) of this section. The appeal shall set forth the 
basis for the applicant's belief that the Regional Administrator's 
decision was made in error.
    (2) The appeal may be presented, at the option of the applicant, at 
a hearing before an officer appointed by the Regional Administrator.
    (3) The hearing officer shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Administrator.
    (4 ) The decision on the appeal by the Regional Administrator is the 
final decision of the Department of Commerce.
    (ii) Party and charter boat permit. The owner of any party or 
charter boat must obtain a permit to fish for or retain black sea bass 
in or from U.S. waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from 35 deg.15.3' 
N. lat., the latitude of Cape Hatteras Light, NC, northward to the U.S.-
Canada border, while carrying passengers for hire.
    (8) Atlantic bluefish individual permits. Any person selling 
bluefish harvested in the EEZ must have either a valid permit issued 
under this part or a valid State of landing permit to sell bluefish.
    (b) Permit conditions. Any person who applies for a fishing permit 
under this section must agree as a condition of the permit that the 
vessel and the vessel's fishing activity, catch, and pertinent gear 
(without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of 
the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, 
taken or landed), are subject to all requirements of this part, unless 
exempted from such requirements under this part. All such fishing 
activities, catch, and gear will remain subject to all applicable state 
requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this part, if a 
requirement of this part and a management measure required by a state or 
local law differ, any vessel owner permitted to fish in the EEZ for any 
species managed under this part must comply with the more restrictive 
requirement. Owners and operators of vessels fishing under the terms of 
a summer flounder moratorium, scup moratorium, or black sea bass 
moratorium permit must also agree not to land summer flounder, scup, or 
black sea bass, respectively, in any state after NMFS has published a 
notification in the Federal Register stating that the commercial quota 
for that state or period has been harvested and that no commercial quota 
is available for the respective species. A state not receiving an 
allocation of summer flounder, scup, or black sea bass, either directly 
or through a coastwide allocation, is deemed to have no commercial quota 
available. Owners or operators fishing for surf clams and ocean quahogs 
within waters under the jurisdiction of any state that requires cage 
tags are not subject to any conflicting Federal minimum size or tagging 
requirements. If a surf clam and ocean quahog requirement of this part 
differs from a surf clam and ocean quahog management measure required by 
a state that does not require cage tagging, any vessel owners or 
operators permitted to fish in the EEZ for surf clams and ocean quahogs 
must comply with the more restrictive requirement

[[Page 215]]

while fishing in state waters. However, surrender of a surf clam and 
ocean quahog vessel permit by the owner by certified mail addressed to 
the Regional Administrator allows an individual to comply with the less 
restrictive state minimum size requirement, as long as fishing is 
conducted exclusively within state waters. If the commercial black sea 
bass quota for a period is harvested and the coast is closed to the 
possession of black sea bass north of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat., any vessel 
owners that hold valid commercial permits for both the black sea bass 
and the NMFS Southeast Region Snapper-Grouper fisheries may surrender 
their moratorium Black Sea Bass permit by certified mail addressed to 
the Regional Administrator and fish pursuant to their Snapper-Grouper 
permit, as long as fishing is conducted exclusively in waters, and 
landings are made, south of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat. A moratorium permit for 
the black sea bass fishery that is voluntarily relinquished or 
surrendered will be reissued upon the receipt of the vessel owner's 
written request after a minimum period of 6 months from the date of 
cancellation.
    (c) Permit applications--(1) General. Applicants for a permit under 
this section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form 
obtained from the Regional Administrator. The application must be signed 
and submitted to the Regional Administrator at least 30 days before the 
date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. 
The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of any deficiency 
in the application pursuant to this section. Vessel owners who are 
eligible to apply for limited access or moratorium permits under this 
part shall provide information with the application sufficient for the 
Regional Administrator to determine whether the vessel meets the 
applicable eligibility requirements specified in this section.
    (2) Vessel permit information requirements. (i) With the exception 
of Atlantic bluefish permits, the requirements for which are described 
in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an application for a permit issued 
under this section, in addition to the information specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, also must contain at least the 
following information, and any other information required by the 
Regional Administrator: Vessel name, owner name or name of the owner's 
authorized representative, mailing address, and telephone number; USCG 
documentation number and a copy of the vessel's current USCG 
documentation or, for a vessel not required to be documented under title 
46 U.S.C., the vessel's state registration number and a copy of the 
current state registration; a copy of the vessel's current party/charter 
boat license (if applicable), home port and principal port of landing, 
length overall, GRT, NT, engine horsepower, year the vessel was built, 
type of construction, type of propulsion, approximate fish hold 
capacity, type of fishing gear used by the vessel, number of crew, 
number of party or charter passengers licensed to be carried (if 
applicable), permit category, if the owner is a corporation, a copy of 
the current Certificate of Incorporation or other corporate papers 
showing the date of incorporation and the names of the current officers 
of the corporation, and the names and addresses of all shareholders 
owning 25 percent or more of the corporation's shares; if the owner is a 
partnership, a copy of the current Partnership Agreement and the names 
and addresses of all partners; if there is more than one owner, the 
names of all owners having a 25-percent interest or more; and permit 
number of any current or, if expired, previous Federal fishery permit 
issued to the vessel.
    (ii) An application for an initial limited access multispecies hook-
gear permit must also contain the following information:
    (A) If the engine horsepower was changed or a contract to change the 
engine horsepower had been entered into prior to July 1, 1996, such that 
it is different from that stated in the vessel's most recent application 
for a Federal fisheries permit before July 1, 1996, sufficient 
documentation to ascertain the different engine horsepower. However, the 
engine replacement must be completed within 1 year of the date on which 
the contract was signed.
    (B) If the length, GRT, or NT was changed or a contract to change 
the length, GRT, or NT had been entered

[[Page 216]]

into prior to July 1, 1996, such that it is different from that stated 
in the vessel's most recent application for a Federal fisheries permit, 
sufficient documentation to ascertain the different length, GRT, or NT. 
However, the upgrade must be completed within 1 year from the date on 
which the contract was signed.
    (iii) An application for a limited access multispecies permit must 
also contain the following information:
    (A) If applying for a limited access multispecies Combination Vessel 
permit or Individual DAS category permit, or if opting to use a VTS, a 
copy of the vendor installation receipt from a NMFS-approved VTS vendor 
as described in Sec. 648.9.
    (B) For vessels fishing for NE multispecies with gillnet gear, with 
the exception of vessels under the Small Vessel permit category, an 
annual declaration as either a Day or Trip gillnet vessel designation as 
described in Sec. 648.82(k). Vessel owners electing a Day gillnet 
designation must indicate the number of gillnet tags that they are 
requesting and must include a check for the cost of the tags. A permit 
holder letter will be sent to all eligible gillnet vessels informing 
them of the costs associated with this tagging requirement and 
directions for obtaining tags. Once a vessel owner has elected this 
designation, he/she may not change the designation or fish under the 
other gillnet category for the remainder of the fishing year. Incomplete 
applications, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, will be 
considered incomplete for the purpose of obtaining authorization to fish 
in the NE multispecies gillnet fishery and will be processed without a 
gillnet authorization.
    (iv) An application for a limited access scallop permit must also 
contain the following information:
    (A) For every person named by applicants for limited access scallop 
permits pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the names of 
all other vessels in which that person has an ownership interest and for 
which a limited access scallop permit has been issued or applied for.
    (B) If applying for full-time or part-time limited access scallop 
permit, or if opting to use a VTS unit, though not required, a copy of 
the vendor installation receipt from a NMFS-approved VTS vendor as 
described in Sec. 648.9.
    (C) If applying to fish under the small dredge program set forth 
under Sec. 648.51(e), an annual declaration into the program.
    (v) An application for a surf clam and ocean quahog permit must also 
contain the pump horsepower.
    (3) Atlantic bluefish individual commercial permit information 
requirements. In addition to the information specified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, an application for an Atlantic bluefish 
individual commercial permit also must contain at least the following 
information, and any other information required by the Regional 
Administrator: The applicant's name; mailing address; telephone number; 
height; weight; hair color; and eye color; if the applicant represents a 
corporation, a copy of the current Certificate of Incorporation; and 
percentage of annual income derived from the sale of bluefish.
    (d) Fees. The Regional Administrator may charge a fee to recover 
administrative expenses of issuing a permit required under this section. 
The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of 
the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the Regional Administrator, 
for determining administrative costs of each special product or service. 
The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each application 
form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application; if it does 
not, the application will be considered incomplete for purposes of 
paragraph (e) of this section. Any fee paid by an insufficiently funded 
commercial instrument shall render any permit issued on the basis 
thereof null and void.
    (e) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 
904, the Regional Administrator shall issue a permit within 30 days of 
receipt of the application, unless the application is deemed incomplete 
for the following reasons:
    (i) The applicant has failed to submit a complete application. An 
application is complete when all requested forms, information, 
documentation, and fees, if applicable, have been received and

[[Page 217]]

the applicant has submitted all applicable reports specified in 
Sec. 648.7;
    (ii) The application was not received by the Regional Administrator 
by the applicable deadline set forth in this section;
    (iii) The applicant and applicant's vessel failed to meet all 
applicable eligibility requirements set forth in this section;
    (iv) The applicant applying for a limited access multispecies 
combination vessel or individual DAS permit, a full-time or part-time 
limited access scallop permit, or electing to use a VTS, has failed to 
meet all of the VTS requirements specified in Secs. 648.9 and 648.10; or
    (v) The applicant has failed to meet any other application 
requirements stated in this part.
    (2) Incomplete applications. Upon receipt of an incomplete or 
improperly executed application for any permit under this part, the 
Regional Administrator shall notify the applicant of the deficiency in 
the application. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 
30 days following the date of notification, the application will be 
considered abandoned.
    (f) Change in permit information. Any change in the information 
specified in paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section must be 
submitted by the applicant in writing to the Regional Administrator 
within 15 days of the change, or the permit is void.
    (g) Expiration. A permit expires upon the renewal date specified in 
the permit.
    (h) Duration. A permit will continue in effect unless it is revoked, 
suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part 904, or otherwise expires, or 
ownership changes, or the applicant has failed to report any change in 
the information on the permit application to the Regional Administrator 
as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. However, the Regional 
Administrator may authorize the continuation of a permit if the new 
owner so requests. Applications for permit continuations must be 
addressed to the Regional Administrator.
    (i) Alteration. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (j) Reissuance. A permit may be reissued by the Regional 
Administrator when requested in writing, stating the need for 
reissuance, the name of the vessel (if applicable), and the fishing 
permit number assigned. An application for the reissuance of a permit 
will not be considered a new application. The fee for a reissued permit 
shall be the same as for an initial permit.
    (k) Transfer. A permit issued under this part is not transferable or 
assignable. A permit will be valid only for the fishing vessel, owner 
and/or person for which it is issued.
    (l) Display. A vessel permit must be carried, at all times, on board 
the vessel for which it is issued and shall be subject to inspection 
upon request by any authorized officer. A person issued a permit under 
this section must be able to present the permit for inspection when 
requested by an authorized officer. Permits must be maintained in 
legible condition.
    (m) Sanctions. The Assistant Administrator may suspend, revoke, or 
modify, any permit issued or sought under this section. Procedures 
governing enforcement-related permit sanctions or denials are found at 
subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.

<R05>
Sec. 648.5  Operator permits.

    (a) General. Any operator of a vessel fishing for or possessing sea 
scallops in excess of 40 lb (18.1 kg), NE multispecies, and, as of 
January 1, 1997, mackerel, squid, or butterfish, or scup, and, as of 
June 1, 1997, black sea bass, harvested in or from the EEZ, or issued a 
permit for these species under this part, must have been issued under 
this section, and carry on board, a valid operator's permit. An operator 
permit issued pursuant to part 649 of this chapter satisfies the 
permitting requirement of this section. This requirement does not apply 
to operators of recreational vessels.

[[Page 218]]

    (b) Operator permit application. Applicants for a permit under this 
section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form 
provided by the Regional Administrator. The application must be signed 
by the applicant and submitted to the Regional Administrator at least 30 
days before the date upon which the applicant desires to have the permit 
made effective. The Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of 
any deficiency in the application, pursuant to this section.
    (c) Condition. Vessel operators who apply for an operator's permit 
under this section must agree as a condition of this permit that the 
operator and vessel's fishing, catch, crew size, and pertinent gear 
(without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of 
the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, 
taken, or landed) are subject to all requirements of this part while 
fishing in the EEZ or on board a vessel for which a permit is issued 
under Sec. 648.4, unless exempted from such requirements under 
Sec. 648.12. The vessel and all such fishing, catch, and gear will 
remain subject to all applicable state or local requirements. Further, 
such operators must agree, as a condition of this permit, that, if the 
permit is suspended or revoked pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, the operator 
cannot be aboard any fishing vessel issued a Federal fisheries permit or 
any vessel subject to Federal fishing regulations while the vessel is at 
sea or engaged in offloading. If a requirement of this part and a 
management measure required by state or local law differ, any operator 
issued a permit under this part must comply with the more restrictive 
requirement.
    (d) Information requirements. An applicant must provide at least all 
the following information and any other information required by the 
Regional Administrator: Name, mailing address, and telephone number; 
date of birth; hair color; eye color; height; weight; social security 
number (optional); and signature of the applicant. The applicant must 
also provide two recent (no more than 1 year old), color, passport-size 
photographs.
    (e) Fees. Same as Sec. 648.4(d).
    (f) Issuance. Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, 
the Regional Administrator shall issue an operator's permit within 30

Sec. 648.7  Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

    (a) Dealers--(1) Detailed weekly report. Federally permitted dealers 
must submit to the Regional Administrator or to the official designee a 
detailed

[[Page 220]]

weekly report, within the time periods specified in paragraph (f) of 
this section, on forms supplied by or approved by the Regional 
Administrator and a report of all fish purchases, except surf clam and 
ocean quahog dealers or processors who are required to report only surf 
clam and ocean quahog purchases. If authorized in writing by the 
Regional Administrator, dealers may submit reports electronically or 
through other media. The following information, and any other 
information required by the Regional Administrator, must be provided in 
the report:
    (i) Summer flounder, scup, black sea bass, Atlantic sea scallop, NE 
multispecies, Atlantic mackerel, squid and butterfish dealers must 
provide: Dealer name and mailing address; dealer permit number; name and 
permit number or name and hull number (USCG documentation number or 
state registration number, whichever is applicable) of vessels from 
which fish are landed or received; trip identifier for a trip from which 
fish are landed or received; dates of purchases; pounds by species (by 
market category, if applicable); price per pound by species (by market 
category, if applicable) or total value by species (by market category, 
if applicable); port landed; and any other information deemed necessary 
by the Regional Administrator. All report forms must be signed by the 
dealer or other authorized individual. If no fish are purchased during a 
reporting week, no written report is required to be submitted. If no 
fish are purchased during an entire reporting month, a report so stating 
on the required form must be submitted.
    (ii) Surf clam and ocean quahog processors and dealers must provide: 
Date of purchase or receipt; name, permit number and mailing address; 
number of bushels by species; cage tag numbers; allocation permit 
number; vessel name and permit number; price per bushel by species. 
Dealers must also report disposition of surf clams or ocean quahogs, 
including name and permit number of recipients. Processors must also 
report size distribution and meat yield per bushel by species.
    (2) Weekly IVR system reports. (i) Federally permitted dealers 
purchasing quota-managed species not deferred from coverage by the 
Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section 
must submit, within the time period specified in paragraph (f) of this 
section, the following information, and any other information required 
by the Regional Administrator, to the Regional Administrator or to an 
official designee, via the IVR system established by the Regional 
Administrator: Dealer permit number; dealer code; pounds purchased, by 
species; reporting week in which species were purchased; and state of 
landing for each species purchased. If no purchases of quota-managed 
species not deferred from coverage by the Regional Administrator 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section were made during the 
week, a report so stating must be submitted through the IVR system in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (ii) The Regional Administrator may defer any quota-managed species 
from the IVR system reporting requirements if landings are not expected 
to reach levels that would cause the applicable target exploitation rate 
corresponding to a given domestic annual harvest limit, target or actual 
TAC, or annual or seasonal quota specified for that species to be 
exceeded. The Regional Administrator shall base any such determination 
on the purchases reported, by species, in the comprehensive written 
reports submitted by dealers and other available information. If the 
Regional Administrator determines that any quota-managed species should 
be deferred from the weekly IVR system reporting requirements, the 
Regional Administrator shall publish notification so stating in the 
Federal Register. If data indicate that landing levels have increased to 
an extent that this determination ceases to be valid, the Regional 
Administrator shall terminate the deferral by publishing notification in 
the Federal Register.
    (3) Annual report. All persons required to submit reports under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section are required to submit the following 
information on an annual basis, on forms supplied by the Regional 
Administrator:

multispecies, Atlantic mackerel, squid, and butterfish dealers must 
complete the

[[Page 221]]

``Employment Data'' section of the Annual Processed Products Report; 
completion of the other sections of that form is voluntary. Reports must 
be submitted to the address supplied by the Regional Administrator.
    (ii) Surf clam and ocean quahog processors and dealers must provide 
the average number of processing plant employees during each month of 
the year just ended; average number of employees engaged in production 
of processed surf clam and ocean quahog products, by species, during 
each month of the year just ended; plant capacity to process surf clam 
and ocean quahog shellstock, or to process surf clam and ocean quahog 
meats into finished products, by species; an estimate, for the next 
year, of such processing capacities; and total payroll for surf clam and 
ocean quahog processing, by month. If the plant processing capacities 
required to be reported in this paragraph (a)(3)(ii) change more than 10 
percent during any year, the processor shall notify the Regional 
Administrator in writing within 10 days after the change.

Sec. 648.8  Vessel identification.

    (a) Vessel name and official number. Each fishing vessel subject to 
this part and over 25 ft (7.6 m) in registered length must:
    (1) Affix permanently its name on the port and starboard sides of 
the bow and, if possible, on its stern.
    (2) Display its official number on the port and starboard sides of 
the deckhouse or hull, and on an appropriate weather deck so as to be 
clearly visible from enforcement vessels and aircraft. The official 
number is the USCG documentation number or the vessel's state 
registration number for vessels not required to be documented under 
title 46 U.S.C.
    (b) Numerals. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, 
the official number must be displayed in block arabic numerals in 
contrasting color at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) in height for fishing 
vessels over 65 ft (19.8 m) in registered length, and at least 10 inches 
(25.4 cm) in height for all other vessels over 25 ft (7.6 m) in 
registered length. The registered length of a vessel, for purposes of 
this section, is that registered length set forth in USCG or state 
records.
    (c) Duties of owner. The owner of each vessel subject to this part 
shall ensure that--
    (1) The vessel's name and official number are kept clearly legible 
and in good repair.
    (2) No part of the vessel, its rigging, its fishing gear, or any 
other object obstructs the view of the official number from any 
enforcement vessel or aircraft.
    (d) Non-permanent marking. Vessels carrying recreational fishing 
parties on a per capita basis or by charter must use markings that meet 
the above requirements, except for the requirement that they be affixed 
permanently to the vessel. The non-permanent markings must be displayed 
in conformity with the above requirements.
    (e) New Jersey surf clam or ocean quahog vessels. Instead of 
complying with paragraph (a) of this section, surf clam or ocean quahog 
vessels licensed under New Jersey law may use the appropriate vessel 
identification markings established by that state.


<R05>
Sec. 648.9  VTS requirements.

    (a) Approval. The Regional Administrator will annually approve VTSs 
that meet the minimum performance criteria specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section. Any changes to the performance criteria will be published 
annually in the Federal Register and a list of approved VTSs will be 
published in the Federal Register upon addition or deletion of a VTS 
from the list. In the event that a VTS is deleted from the list, vessel 
owners that purchased a VTS unit that is part of that VTS prior to 
publication of the revised list will be considered to be in compliance 
with the requirement to have an approved unit, unless otherwise notified 
by the Regional Administrator.
    (b) Minimum VTS performance criteria. The basic required features of 
the VTS are as follows:
    (1) The VTS shall be tamper proof, i.e., shall not permit the input 
of false positions; furthermore, if a system uses satellites to 
determine position, satellite selection should be automatic to provide 
an optimal fix and should not be capable of being manually overridden by 
any person aboard a fishing vessel or by the vessel owner.
    (2) The VTS shall be fully automatic and operational at all times, 
regardless of weather and environmental conditions.
    (3) The VTS shall be capable of tracking vessels in all U.S. waters 
in the Atlantic Ocean from the shoreline of each coastal state to a line 
215 nm offshore and shall provide position accuracy to within 400 m 
(1,300 ft).
    (4) The VTS shall be capable of transmitting and storing information 
including vessel identification, date, time, and latitude/longitude.
    (5) The VTS shall provide accurate hourly position transmissions 
every day of the year. In addition, the VTS shall allow polling of 
individual vessels or any set of vessels at any time and receive 
position reports in real time. For the purposes of this specification, 
``real time'' shall constitute data that

[[Page 225]]

reflect a delay of 15 minutes or less between the displayed information 
and the vessel's actual position.
    (6) The VTS shall be capable of providing network message 
communications between the vessel and shore. The VTS shall allow NMFS to 
initiate communications or data transfer at any time.
    (7) The VTS vendor shall be capable of transmitting position data to 
a NMFS-designated computer system via a modem at a minimum speed of 9600 
baud. Transmission shall be in ASCII text in a file format acceptable to 
NMFS.
    (8) The VTS shall be capable of providing vessel locations relative 
to international boundaries and fishery management areas.
    (9) The VTS vendor shall be capable of archiving vessel position 
histories for a minimum of 1 year and providing transmission to NMFS of 
specified portions of archived data in response to NMFS requests and in 
a variety of media (tape, floppy, etc.).
    (c) Operating requirements. All required VTS units must transmit a 
signal indicating the vessel's accurate position at least every hour, 24 
hours a day, throughout the year.
    (d) Presumption. If a VTS unit fails to transmit an hourly signal of 
a vessel's position, the vessel shall be deemed to have incurred a DAS, 
or fraction thereof, for as long as the unit fails to transmit a signal, 
unless a preponderance of evidence shows that the failure to transmit 
was due to an unavoidable malfunction or disruption of the transmission 
that occurred while the vessel was declared out of the scallop fishery 
or NE multispecies fishery, as applicable, or was not at sea.
    (e) Replacement. Should a VTS unit require replacement, a vessel 
owner must submit documentation to the Regional Administrator, within 3 
days of installation and prior to the vessel's next trip, verifying that 
the new VTS unit is an operational, approved system as described under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (f) Access. As a condition to obtaining a limited access scallop or 
multispecies permit, all vessel owners must allow NMFS, the USCG, and 
their authorized officers or designees access to the vessel's DAS and 
location data obtained from its VTS at the time of or after its 
transmission to the vendor or receiver, as the case may be.
    (g) Tampering. Tampering with a VTS, a VTS unit, or a VTS signal, is 
prohibited. Tampering includes any activity that is likely to affect the 
unit's ability to operate properly, signal, or accuracy of computing the 
vessel's position fix.

    (b) VTS Notification. Multispecies vessels issued an Individual DAS 
or Combination Vessel permit, scallop vessels issued a full-time or 
part-time limited access scallop permit, or scallop vessels fishing 
under the small dredge program specified in Sec. 648.51(e), or vessels 
issued a limited access multispecies or scallop permit and whose owners 
elect to fish under the VTS notification of this paragraph (b), unless 
otherwise authorized or required by the Regional Administrator under 
Sec. 648.10(d), must have installed on board an operational VTS unit 
that meets the minimum performance criteria specified in Sec. 648.9(b) 
or as modified in Sec. 648.9(a). Owners of such vessels must provide 
documentation to the Regional Administrator at the time of application 
for a limited access permit that the vessel has an operational VTS unit 
that meets those criteria. If a vessel has already been issued a limited 
access permit without providing such documentation, the Regional 
Administrator shall allow at least 30 days for the vessel to install an 
operational VTS unit that meets the criteria and to provide 
documentation of such installation to the Regional Administrator. 
Vessels that are required to or have elected to use a VTS unit shall be 
subject to the following requirements and presumptions:
    (1) Vessels that have crossed the VTS Demarcation Line specified 
under paragraph (a) of this section are deemed to be fishing under the 
DAS program, unless the vessel's owner, or authorized representative 
declares the vessel out of the scallop or NE multispecies fishery, as 
applicable, for a specific time period by notifying the Regional 
Administrator through the VTS prior to the vessel leaving port.
    (2) Part-time scallop vessels may not fish in the DAS allocation 
program unless they declare into the scallop fishery for a specific time 
period by notifying the Regional Administrator through the VTS.
    (3) Notification that the vessel is not under the DAS program must 
be received prior to the vessel leaving port. A change in status of a 
vessel cannot be made after the vessel leaves port or

[[Page 227]]

before it returns to port on any fishing trip.
    (4) DAS for vessels that are under the VTS notification requirements 
of this paragraph (b) are counted beginning with the first hourly 
location signal received showing that the vessel crossed the VTS 
Demarcation Line leaving port. A trip concludes and accrual of DAS ends 
with the first hourly location signal received showing that the vessel 
crossed the VTS Demarcation Line upon its return to port.
    (5) If the VTS is not available or not functional, and if authorized 
by the Regional Administrator, a vessel owner must provide the 
notifications required by paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this 
section by using the call-in notification system described under 
paragraph (c) of this section, instead of using the VTS system.
    (c) Call-in notification. Owners of vessels issued limited access 
multispecies permits who are participating in a DAS program and who are 
not required to provide notification using a VTS, owners of scallop 
vessels qualifying for a DAS allocation under the occasional category 
and who have not elected to fish under the VTS notification requirements 
of paragraph (b) of this section, and vessels fishing pending an appeal 
as specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(H)(3) are subject to the following 
requirements:
    (1) Prior to the vessel leaving port, the vessel owner or authorized 
representative must notify the Regional Administrator that the vessel 
will be participating in the DAS program by calling the Regional 
Administrator and providing the following information: Owner and caller 
name and phone number, vessel's name and permit number, type of trip to 
be taken, port of departure, and that the vessel is beginning a trip. A 
DAS begins once the call has been received and a confirmation number is 
given by the Regional Administrator.
    (2) The vessel's confirmation numbers for the current and 
immediately prior multispecies fishing trip must be maintained on board 
the vessel and provided to an authorized officer upon request.
    (3) At the end of a vessel's trip, upon its return to port, the 
vessel owner or owner's representative must call the Regional 
Administrator and notify him/her that the trip has ended by providing 
the following information: Owner and caller name and phone number, 
vessel name, port of landing and permit number, and that the vessel has 
ended a trip. A DAS ends when the call has been received and 
confirmation has been given by the Regional Administrator.
    (4) The Regional Administrator will furnish a phone number for DAS 
notification call-ins upon request.
    (5) Any vessel that possesses or lands per trip more than 400 lb 
(181.44 kg) of scallops, and any vessel issued a limited access 
multispecies permit subject to the DAS program and call-in requirement 
that possesses or lands regulated species, except as provided in 
Secs. 648.17 and 648.89, shall be deemed in the DAS program for purposes 
of counting DAS, regardless of whether the vessel's owner or authorized 
representative provided adequate notification as required by this 
paragraph (c).
    (d) Temporary authorization for use of the call-in system. The 
Regional Administrator may authorize or require, on a temporary basis, 
the use of the call-in system of notification specified in paragraph (c) 
of this section. If use of the call-in system is authorized or required, 
the Regional Administrator shall notify affected permit holders through 
a letter, notification in the Federal Register, or other appropriate 
means. From May 1, 1998, through April 30, 1999, multispecies vessels 
issued an Individual DAS or Combination Vessel (regarding the 
multispecies fishery) permit are temporarily authorized to use the call-
in system of notification specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) Scallop vessels fishing under exemptions. Vessels fishing under 
the exemptions provided by Sec. 648.54 (a) and/or (b)(1) must notify the 
Regional Administrator by VTS notification or by call-in notification as 
follows:
    (1) VTS notification. (i) Notify the Regional Administrator, via 
their VTS, prior to the vessel's first trip under the state waters 
exemption program, that the vessel will be fishing exclusively in state 
waters; and

[[Page 228]]

    (ii) Notify the Regional Administrator, via their VTS, prior to the 
vessel's first planned trip in the EEZ, that the vessel is to resume 
fishing under the vessel's DAS allocation.
    (2) Call-in notification. (i) Notify the Regional Administrator by 
calling the Regional Administrator and providing the following 
information at least 7 days prior to fishing under the exemption: Owner 
and caller name and address, vessel name and permit number, and 
beginning and ending dates of the exemption period.
    (ii) Remain under the exemption for a minimum of 7 days.
    (iii) If, under the exemption for a minimum of 7 days and wishing to 
withdraw earlier than the designated end of the exemption period, notify 
the Regional Administrator of early withdrawal from the program by 
calling the Regional Administrator, providing the vessel's name and 
permit number and the name and phone number of the caller, and stating 
that the vessel is withdrawing from the exemption. The vessel may not 
leave port to fish in the EEZ until 48 hours after notification of early 
withdrawal is received by the Regional Administrator.
    (iv) The Regional Administrator will furnish a phone number for 
call-ins upon request.
    (f) Additional NE multispecies call-in requirements.--(1) Spawning 
season call-in. With the exception of vessels issued a valid Small 
Vessel category permit, vessels subject to the spawning season 
restriction described in Sec. 648.82 must notify the Regional 
Administrator of the commencement date of their 20-day period out of the 
NE multispecies fishery through either the VTS system or by calling and 
providing the following information: Vessel name and permit number, 
owner and caller name and phone number and the commencement date of the 
20-day period.
    (2) Gillnet call-in. Vessels subject to the gillnet restriction 
described in Sec. 648.82(k)(1)(iv) must notify the Regional 
Administrator of the commencement date of their time out of the NE 
multispecies gillnet fishery using the procedure described in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section.
    (3) Cod landing limit call-in. (i) A vessel subject to the cod 
landing limit restriction specified in Sec. 648.86(b)(1)(i), that has 
not exceeded the allowable limit of cod based on the duration of the 
trip, must enter port and call-out of the DAS program no later than 14 
DAS after starting a multispecies DAS trip.
    (ii) A vessel subject to the cod landing limit restriction specified 
in Sec. 648.86(b)(1)(i) that exceeds or is expected to exceed the 
allowable limit of cod based on the duration of the trip must enter port 
no later than 14 DAS after starting a multispecies DAS trip and must 
report, upon entering port and before offloading, its hailed weight of 
cod under the separate call-in system as specified in 
Sec. 648.86(b)(1)(ii)(B). Such vessel must remain in port, unless for 
transiting purposes as allowed in Sec. 648.86(b)(4), until sufficient 
time has elapsed to account for and justify the amount of cod on board 
in accordance with Sec. 648.86(b)(1)(ii), and may not begin its next 
fishing trip until such time that the vessel has called-out of the 
multispecies DAS program to end its trip.

Sec. 648.11  At-sea sea sampler/observer coverage.

    (a) The Regional Administrator may request any vessel holding a 
permit sea scallop; or NE multispecies; or a moratorium permit for 
summer flounder, or, as of January 1, 1997, mackerel, squid, or 
butterfish, or scup, or as of June 1, 1997, black sea bass fisheries to 
carry a NMFS-approved sea sampler/observer. If requested by the Regional 
Administrator to carry an observer or sea sampler, a vessel may not 
engage in any fishing operations in the respective fishery unless an 
observer or sea sampler is on board, or unless the requirement is 
waived.
    (b) If requested by the Regional Administrator to carry an observer 
or sea sampler, it is the responsibility of the vessel owner to arrange 
for and facilitate observer or sea sampler placement. Owners of vessels 
selected for sea sampler/observer coverage must notify the appropriate 
Regional or Science

[[Page 229]]

and Research Director, as specified by the Regional Administrator, 
before commencing any fishing trip that may result in the harvest of 
resources of the respective fishery. Notification procedures will be 
specified in selection letters to vessel owners.
    (c) The Regional Administrator may waive the requirement to carry a 
sea sampler or observer if the facilities on a vessel for housing the 
observer or sea sampler, or for carrying out observer or sea sampler 
functions, are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the 
observer or sea sampler, or the safe operation of the vessel, would be 
jeopardized.
    (d) An owner or operator of a vessel on which a NMFS-approved sea 
sampler/observer is embarked must:
    (1) Provide accommodations and food that are equivalent to those 
provided to the crew.
    (2) Allow the sea sampler/observer access to and use of the vessel's 
communications equipment and personnel upon request for the transmission 
and receipt of messages related to the sea sampler's/observer's duties.
    (3) Provide true vessel locations, by latitude and longitude or 
loran coordinates, as requested by the observer/sea sampler, and allow 
the sea sampler/observer access to and use of the vessel's navigation 
equipment and personnel upon request to determine the vessel's position.
    (4) Notify the sea sampler/observer in a timely fashion of when 
fishing operations are to begin and end.
    (5) Allow for the embarking and debarking of the sea sampler/
observer, as specified by the Regional Administrator, ensuring that 
transfers of observers/sea samplers at sea are accomplished in a safe 
manner, via small boat or raft, during daylight hours as weather and sea 
conditions allow, and with the agreement of the sea samplers/ observers 
involved.
    (6) Allow the sea sampler/observer free and unobstructed access to 
the vessel's bridge, working decks, holding bins, weight scales, holds, 
and any other space used to hold, process, weigh, or store fish.
    (7) Allow the sea sampler/observer to inspect and copy any the 
vessel's log, communications log, and records associated with the catch 
and distribution of fish for that trip.
    (e) The owner or operator of a vessel issued a summer flounder 
moratorium permit, or as of January 1, 1997, a scup moratorium permit 
or, as of June 1, 1997, a black sea bass moratorium permit, if requested 
by the sea sampler/observer also must:
    (1) Notify the sea sampler/observer of any sea turtles, marine 
mammals, summer flounder, scup, or black sea bass, or other specimens 
taken by the vessel.
    (2) Provide the sea sampler/observer with sea turtles, marine 
mammals, summer flounder, scup, or black sea bass, or other specimens 
taken by the vessel.
    (f) NMFS may accept observer coverage funded by outside sources if:
    (1) All coverage conducted by such observers is determined by NMFS 
to be in compliance with NMFS' observer guidelines and procedures.
    (2) The owner or operator of the vessel complies with all other 
provisions of this part.
    (3) The observer is approved by the Regional Administrator.

Sec. 648.12  Experimental fishing.

    The Regional Administrator may exempt any person or vessel from the 
requirements of subparts B (Atlantic mackerel, squid, and butterfish), D 
(sea scallop), E (surf clam and ocean quahog), F (NE multispecies), G 
(summer flounder), H (scup), or I (black sea bass), of this part for the 
conduct of experimental fishing beneficial to the management of the 
resources or fishery managed under that subpart. The Regional 
Administrator shall consult with the Executive Director of the Council 
regarding such exemptions for the Atlantic mackerel, squid, and 
butterfish, the summer flounder, the scup, and the black sea bass 
fisheries.
    (a) The Regional Administrator may not grant such an exemption 
unless he/she determines that the purpose, design, and administration of 
the exemption is consistent with the management objectives of the 
respective FMP,

[[Page 230]]

the provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law, 
and that granting the exemption will not:
    (1) Have a detrimental effect on the respective resources and 
fishery;
    (2) Cause any quota to be exceeded; or
    (3) Create significant enforcement problems.
    (b) Each vessel participating in any exempted experimental fishing 
activity is subject to all provisions of the respective FMP, except 
those necessarily relating to the purpose and nature of the exemption. 
The exemption will be specified in a letter issued by the Regional 
Administrator to each vessel participating in the exempted activity. 
This letter must be carried on board the vessel seeking the benefit of 
such exemption.
    (c) Experimental fishing for surf clams or ocean quahogs will not 
require an allocation permit.

be part of an individual's allocation, unless the vessel has a valid 
Maine mahogany quahog permit issued pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(4)(i) and 
is not fishing for an individual allocation under Sec. 648.70; or, 
unless the preponderance of available evidence demonstrates that he/she 
has surrendered his/her surf clam and ocean quahog permit issued under 
Sec. 648.4 and he/she conducted fishing operations exclusively within 
waters under the jurisdiction of any state. Surf clams and ocean quahogs 
in cages with a Federal tag or tags, issued and still valid pursuant to 
this section, affixed thereto are deemed to have been harvested by the 
individual allocation holder to whom the tags were issued or transferred 
under Sec. 648.(70) or Sec. 648.75(b).
    (2) Scallops. Scallops that are possessed or landed at or prior to 
the time when the scallops are received by a dealer, or scallops that 
are possessed by a dealer, are deemed to be harvested from the EEZ, 
unless the preponderance of all submitted evidence demonstrates that 
such scallops were harvested by a vessel without a scallop permit and 
fishing exclusively for scallops in state waters.

[[Page 245]]

    (3) Summer flounder. All summer flounder possessed aboard a party or 
charter boat issued a summer flounder permit are deemed to have been 
harvested from the EEZ.
    (4) NE multispecies. (i) Regulated species possessed for sale that 
do not meet the minimum sizes specified in Sec. 648.83 for sale are 
deemed to have been taken or imported in violation of these regulations, 
unless the preponderance of all submitted evidence demonstrates that 
such fish were harvested by a vessel not issued a permit under this part 
and fishing exclusively within state waters, or by a vessel that fished 
exclusively in the NAFO Regulatory Area. This presumption does not apply 
to fish being sorted on deck.
    (ii) Regulated species possessed for sale that do not meet the 
minimum sizes specified in Sec. 648.83 for sale are deemed taken from 
the EEZ or imported in violation of these regulations, unless the 
preponderance of all submitted evidence demonstrates that such fish were 
harvested by a vessel not issued a permit under this part and fishing 
exclusively within state waters, or by a vessel that fished exclusively 
in the NAFO Regulatory Area. This presumption does not apply to fish 
being sorted on deck.
    (5) Mackerel, squid, and butterfish. All mackerel and butterfish 
possessed on board a party or charter boat issued a mackerel, squid, and 
butterfish fishery permit are deemed to have been harvested from the

<R05>
Sec. 648.21  Procedures for determining initial annual amounts.

    (a) Initial recommended annual specifications. The Atlantic 
Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Monitoring Committee (Monitoring 
Committee) shall meet annually to develop and recommend the following 
specifications for consideration by the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish 
Committee of the MAFMC: (1) Initial OY (IOY), domestic annual harvest 
(DAH), and domestic annual processing (DAP) for the squids; (2) IOY, 
DAH, DAP, and bycatch level of the total allowable level of foreign 
fishing (TALFF), if any, for butterfish; and (3) IOY, DAH, DAP, joint 
venture processing (JVP), if any, and TALFF, if any, for mackerel. The 
Monitoring Committee may also recommend that certain ratios of TALFF, if 
any, for mackerel to purchases of domestic harvested fish and/or 
domestic processed fish be established in relation to the initial annual 
amounts.
    (b) Guidelines. As the basis for its recommendations under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the Monitoring Committee shall review available 
data pertaining to: Commercial and recreational landings, discards, 
current estimates of fishing mortality, stock status, the most recent 
estimates of recruitment, virtual population analysis results, levels of 
noncompliance by harvesters or individual states, impact of size/mesh 
regulations, results of a survey of domestic processors and joint 
venture operators of estimated mackerel processing capacity and intent 
to use that capacity, results of a survey of fishermen's trade 
associations of estimated mackerel harvesting capacity and intent to use 
that capacity, and any other relevant information. The specifications 
recommended pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must be consistent 
with the following:
    (1) Squid. (i) The ABC for any fishing year must be either the 
maximum OY specified in Sec. 648.20, or a lower amount, if stock 
assessments indicate that the potential yield is less than the maximum 
OY.
    (ii) IOY is a modification of ABC based on social and economic 
factors.
    (2) Mackerel. (i) Mackerel ABC must be calculated from the formula 
ABC = S - C - T, where C is the estimated catch of mackerel in Canadian 
waters for the upcoming fishing year; S is the mackerel spawning stock 
size at the beginning of the year for which quotas are specified; and T, 
which must be equal to or greater than 900,000 mt (1,984,050,000 lb), is 
the spawning stock size that must be maintained in the year following 
the year for which quotas are specified.
    (ii) IOY is a modification of ABC, based on social and economic 
factors, and must be less than or equal to ABC.
    (iii) IOY is composed of DAH and TALFF. DAH, DAP, and JVP must be 
projected by reviewing data from sources specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section and other relevant data, including past domestic landings, 
projected amounts of mackerel necessary for domestic processing and for 
joint ventures during the fishing year, projected recreational landings, 
and other data pertinent for such a projection. The JVP component of DAH 
is the portion of DAH that domestic processors either cannot or will not 
use. In addition, IOY is based on the criteria set forth in the Magnuson 
Act, specifically section 201(e), and on the following economic factors:
    (A) Total world export potential by mackerel producing countries.
    (B) Total world import demand by mackerel consuming countries.
    (C) U.S. export potential based on expected U.S. harvests, expected 
U.S. consumption, relative prices, exchange rates, and foreign trade 
barriers.
    (D) Increased/decreased revenues to the United States from foreign 
fees.
    (E) Increased/decreased revenues to U.S. harvesters (with/without 
joint ventures).
    (F) Increased/decreased revenues to U.S. processors and exporters.
    (G) Increases/decreases in U.S. harvesting productivity due to 
decreases/increases in foreign harvest.

[[Page 248]]

    (H) Increases/decreases in U.S. processing productivity.
    (I) Potential impact of increased/decreased TALFF on foreign 
purchases of U.S. products and services and U.S.-caught fish, changes in 
trade barriers, technology transfer, and other considerations.
    (3) Butterfish. (i) If the Monitoring Committee's review indicates 
that the stock cannot support a level of harvest equal to the maximum 
OY, the Monitoring Committee shall recommend establishing an ABC less 
than the maximum OY for the fishing year. This level represents the 
modification of maximum OY to reflect biological and ecological factors. 
If the stock is able to support a harvest level equivalent to the 
maximum OY, the ABC must be set at that level.
    (ii) IOY is a modification of ABC based on social and economic 
factors. The IOY is composed of a DAH and bycatch TALFF that is equal to 
0.08 percent of the allocated portion of the mackerel TALFF.
    (c) Recommended measures. Based on the review of the data described 
in paragraph (a) of this section, the Monitoring Committee will 
recommend to the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Committee the measures 
it determines are necessary to assure that the specifications are not 
exceeded from the following measures:
    (1) Commercial quotas.
    (2) The amount of Loligo and butterfish that may be retained, 
possessed and landed by vessels issued the incidental catch permit 
specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(5).
    (3) Commercial minimum fish sizes.
    (4) Commercial trip limits.
    (5) Commercial seasonal quotas/closures for Loligo and Illex.
    (6) Minimum mesh sizes.
    (7) Commercial gear restrictions.
    (8) Recreational harvest limit.
    (9) Recreational minimum fish size.
    (10) Recreational possession limits.
    (11) Recreational season.
    (d) Annual fishing measures. (1) The Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish 
Committee shall review the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee. 
Based on these recommendations and any public comment received thereon, 
the Squid, Mackerel, and Butterfish Committee shall recommend to the 
MAFMC appropriate specifications and any measures necessary to assure 
that the specifications will not be exceeded. The MAFMC shall review 
these recommendations and based on the recommendations and any public 
comment received thereon, the MAFMC shall recommend to the Regional 
Administrator appropriate specifications and any measures necessary to 
assure that the specifications will not be exceeded. The MAFMC's 
recommendations must include supporting documentation, as appropriate, 
concerning the environmental, economic, and social impacts of the 
recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review the 
recommendations, and on or about November 1 of each year, shall publish 
notification in the Federal Register proposing specifications and any 
measures necessary to assure that the specifications will not be 
exceeded and providing a 30-day public comment period. If the proposed 
specifications differ from those recommended by the MAFMC, the reasons 
for any differences shall be clearly stated and the revised 
specifications must satisfy the criteria set forth in this section. The 
MAFMC's recommendations shall be available for inspection at the office 
of the Regional Administrator during the public comment period.
    (2) On or about December 15 of each year, the Assistant 
Administrator will make a final determination concerning the 
specifications for each species and any measures necessary to assure 
that the specifications will not be exceeded contained in the Federal 
Register notification. After the Assistant Administrator considers all 
relevant data and any public comments, notification of the final 
specifications and any measures necessary to assure that the 
specifications will not be exceeded and responses to the public comments 
will be published in the Federal Register. If the final specification 
amounts differ from those recommended by the MAFMC, the reason(s) for 
the difference(s) must be clearly stated and the revised specifications 
must be consistent with the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (e) Inseason adjustments. The specifications established pursuant to 
this

[[Page 249]]

section may be adjusted by the Regional Administrator, in consultation 
with the MAFMC, during the fishing year by publishing notification in 
the Federal Register stating the reasons for such an action and 
providing a 30-day comment public comment period.

<R05>
Sec. 648.22  Closure of the fishery.

    (a) General. The Assistant Administrator shall close the directed 
mackerel fishery in the EEZ when U.S. fishermen have harvested 80 
percent of the DAH of that fishery if such closure is necessary to 
prevent the DAH from being exceeded. The closure shall remain in effect 
for the remainder of the fishing year, with incidental catches allowed 
as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, until the entire DAH is 
attained. When the Regional Administrator projects that DAH will be 
attained for mackerel, the Assistant Administrator shall close the 
mackerel fishery in the EEZ, and the incidental catches specified for 
mackerel in paragraph (c) of this section will be prohibited. The 
Assistant Administrator shall close the directed fishery in the EEZ for 
Loligo, Illex, or butterfish when 95 percent of DAH has been harvested. 
The closure of the directed fishery shall be in effect for the remainder 
of the fishing year with incidental catches allowed as specified in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Notification. Upon determining that a closure is necessary, the 
Assistant Administrator will notify, in advance of the closure, the 
Executive Directors of the MAFMC, NEFMC, and SAFMC; mail notification of 
the closure to all holders of mackerel, squid, and butterfish fishery 
permits at least 72 hours before the effective date of the closure; 
provide adequate notice of the closure to recreational participants in 
the fishery; and publish notification of closure in the Federal 
Register.
    (c) Incidental catches. During the closure of the directed fishery 
for mackerel, the trip limit for mackerel is 10 percent by weight of the 
total amount of fish on board. During a period of closure of the 
directed fishery for Loligo, Illex, or butterfish, the trip limit for 
Loligo and butterfish is 2,500 lb (1.13 mt) each, and the trip limit for 
Illex is 5,000 lb (2.27 mt).

Sec. 648.23  Gear restrictions.

    (a) Mesh restrictions and exemptions. Owners or operators of otter 
trawl vessels possessing Loligo harvested in or from the EEZ may only 
fish with nets having a minimum mesh size of 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm) 
diamond mesh, inside stretch measure, applied throughout the codend for 
at least 150 continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the net, or 
for codends with less than 150 meshes, the minimum mesh size codend 
shall be a minimum of one-third of the net measured from the terminus of 
the codend to the head rope, unless they are fishing during the months 
of June, July, August, and September for Illex seaward of the following 
coordinates (copies of a map depicting this area are available from the 
Regional Administrator upon request):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Vessels fishing under this exemption may not have available for 
immediate use, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, any net, or 
any piece of net, with a mesh size less than 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm) 
diamond mesh or any net, or any piece of net, with mesh that is rigged 
in a manner that is inconsistent with such minimum mesh size, when the 
vessel is landward of the specified coordinates.

[[Page 250]]

    (b) Definition of ``not available for immediate use.'' A net that 
can be shown not to have been in recent use and that is stowed in 
conformance with one of the following methods is considered to be not 
available for immediate use:
    (1) Below deck stowage. (i) It is stored below the main working deck 
from which it is deployed and retrieved;
    (ii) The towing wires, including the leg wires, are detached from 
the net; and
    (iii) It is fan-folded (flaked) and bound around its circumference.
    (2) On-deck stowage. (i) It is fan-folded (flaked) and bound around 
its circumference;
    (ii) It is securely fastened to the deck or rail of the vessel; and
    (iii) The towing wires, including the leg wires, are detached from 
the net.
    (3) On-reel stowage. (i) It is on a reel and its entire surface is 
covered with canvas or other similar material that is securely bound;
    (ii) The towing wires are detached from the net; and
    (iii) The codend is removed and stored below deck.
    (4) Other methods of stowage. Any other method of stowage authorized 
in writing by the Regional Administrator and subsequently published in 
the Federal Register.
    (c) Mesh obstruction or constriction. The owner or operator of a 
fishing vessel shall not use any combination of mesh or liners that 
effectively decreases the mesh size below the minimum mesh size, except 
that a liner may be used to close the opening created by the rings in 
the rearmost portion of the net, provided the liner extends no more than 
10 meshes forward of the rearmost portion of the net.
    (d) Net obstruction or constriction. The owner or operator of a 
fishing vessel shall not use any device, gear, or material, including, 
but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing 
gear, on the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net that results in 
an effective mesh opening of less than 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm) diamond 
mesh, inside stretch measure. Net strengtheners (covers), splitting 
straps and/or bull ropes or wire may be used, provided they do not 
constrict the top of the regulated portion of the net to less than an 
effective mesh opening of 1\7/8\ inches (48 mm), diamond mesh, inside 
stretch measure. Net strengtheners (covers) may not have an effective 
mesh opening of less than 4.5 inches (11.43 cm), diamond mesh, inside 
stretch measure. ``Top of the regulated portion of the net'' means the 
50 percent of the entire regulated portion of the net that (in a 
hypothetical situation) would not be in contact with the ocean bottom 
during a tow if the regulated portion of the net were laid flat on the 
ocean floor. For the purpose of this paragraph (d), head ropes are not 
to be considered part of the top of the regulated portion of a trawl 
net.

           Subpart C--Management Measures for Atlantic Salmon


<R05>
Sec. 648.40  Prohibition on possession.

    (a) Incidental catch. All Atlantic salmon caught incidental to a 
directed fishery for other species in the EEZ must be released in such a 
manner as to insure maximum probability of survival.
    (b) Presumption. The possession of Atlantic salmon is prima facie 
evidence that such Atlantic salmon were taken in violation of this 
regulation. Evidence that such fish were harvested in state waters, or 
from foreign waters, or from aquaculture enterprises, will be sufficient 
to rebut the presumption. This presumption does not apply to fish being 
sorted on deck.


<R04>
   Subpart D--Management Measures for the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery


<R05>
Sec. 648.50  Shell-height standard.

    (a) Minimum shell height. The minimum shell height for in-shell 
scallops that may be landed, or possessed at or after landing, is 3.5 
inches (89 mm). Shell height is a straight line measurement from the 
hinge to the outermost part of the shell, that is, the edge farthest 
away from the hinge.
    (b) Compliance and sampling. Compliance with the minimum shell-
height

[[Page 251]]

standard will be determined by inspection and enforcement at or after 
landing, including the time when the scallops are received or possessed 
by a dealer or person acting in the capacity of a dealer as follows: An 
authorized officer will take samples of 40 scallops each, at random, 
from the total amount of scallops in possession. The person in 
possession of the scallops may request that as many as 10 samples (400 
scallops) be examined as a sample group. A sample group fails to comply 
with the standard if more than 10 percent of all scallops sampled are 
less than the shell height specified. The total amount of scallops in 
possession will be deemed in violation of this subpart and subject to 
forfeiture, if the sample group fails to comply with the standard. All 
scallops will be subject to inspection and enforcement, in accordance 
with these compliance and sampling procedures, up to and including the 
time when a dealer receives or possesses scallops for a commercial 
purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 648.51  Gear and crew restrictions.

    (a) Trawl vessel gear restrictions. Trawl vessels in possession of 
more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) of shucked, or 5 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell 
scallops, trawl vessels fishing for scallops, and trawl vessels issued a 
limited access scallop permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(2), while fishing 
under or subject to the DAS allocation program for scallops and 
authorized to fish with or possess on board trawl nets pursuant to 
Sec. 648.51(f), must comply with the following:
    (1) Maximum sweep. The trawl sweep of nets in use by or available 
for immediate use, as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this 
section, shall not exceed 144 ft (43.9 m) as measured by the total 
length of the footrope that is directly attached to the webbing of the 
net.
    (2) Net requirements--(i) Minimum mesh size. The mesh size for any 
scallop trawl net in all areas shall not be smaller than 5.5 inches 
(13.97 cm).
    (ii) Mesh stowage. Same as Sec. 648.23(b).
    (iii) Measurement of mesh size. Mesh size is measured by using a 
wedge-shaped gauge having a taper of 2 cm in 8 cm and a thickness of 2.3 
mm, inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull of 5 kg. The mesh 
size is the average of the measurements of any series of 20 consecutive 
meshes for nets having 75 or more meshes, and 10 consecutive meshes for 
nets having fewer than 75 meshes. The mesh in the regulated portion of 
the net will be measured at least five meshes away from the lacings 
running parallel to the long axis of the net.
    (3) Chafing gear and other gear obstructions--(i) Net obstruction or 
constriction. A fishing vessel may not use any device or material, 
including, but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or 
chafing gear, on the top of a trawl net, except that one splitting strap 
and one bull rope (if present), consisting of line and rope no more than 
3 inches (7.62 cm) in diameter, may be used if such splitting strap and/
or bull rope does not constrict in any manner the top of the trawl net. 
``The top of the trawl net'' means the 50 percent of the net that (in a 
hypothetical situation) would not be in contact with the ocean bottom 
during a tow if the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the 
purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), head ropes shall not be considered 
part of the top of the trawl net.
    (ii) Mesh obstruction or constriction. A fishing vessel may not use 
any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in the 
top of the net, as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, if it 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (iii) A fishing vessel may not use or possess a net capable of 
catching scallops in which the bars entering or exiting the knots twist 
around each other.
    (b) Dredge vessel gear restrictions. All dredge vessels fishing for 
or in possession of more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) of shucked, or 5 bu 
(176.2 L) of in-shell scallops, and all dredge vessels issued a limited 
access scallop permit and fishing under the DAS Program, with the 
exception of hydraulic clam dredges and mahogany quahog dredges in 
possession of 400 lb (181.44 kg) of scallops, or less, must comply with 
the following restrictions:
    (1) Maximum dredge width. The combined dredge width in use by or in 
possession on board such vessels shall not exceed 31 ft (9.4 m) measured 
at the

[[Page 252]]

widest point in the bail of the dredge, except as provided under 
paragraph (e) of this section. However, component parts may be on board 
the vessel such that they do not conform with the definition of ``dredge 
or dredge gear'' in Sec. 648.2, i.e., the metal ring bag and the mouth 
frame, or bail, of the dredge are not attached, and such that no more 
than one complete spare dredge could be made from these components 
parts.
    (2) Minimum mesh size. (i) The mesh size of net material on the top 
of a scallop dredge in use by or in possession of such vessels shall not 
be smaller than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm).
    (ii) Mesh size is measured as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of 
this section.
    (3) Minimum ring size. (i) The inside ring size of a scallop dredge 
in use by or in possession of such vessels shall not be smaller than 3.5 
inches (89 mm).
    (ii) Ring size is determined by measuring the shortest straight line 
passing through the center of the ring from one inside edge to the 
opposite inside edge of the ring. The measurement shall not include 
normal welds from ring manufacturing or links. The rings to be measured 
will be at least five rings away from the mouth, and at least two rings 
away from other rigid portions of the dredge.
    (4) Chafing gear and other gear obstructions--(i) Chafing gear 
restrictions. No chafing gear or cookies shall be used on the top of a 
scallop dredge.
    (ii) Link restrictions. No more than double links between rings 
shall be used in or on all parts of the dredge bag, except the dredge 
bottom. No more than triple linking shall be used in or on the dredge 
bottom portion and the diamonds. Damaged links that are connected to 
only one ring, i.e., ``hangers,'' are allowed, unless they occur between 
two links that both couple the same two rings. Dredge rings may not be 
attached via links to more than four adjacent rings. Thus, dredge rings 
must be rigged in a configuration such that, when a series of adjacent 
rings are held horizontally, the neighboring rings form a pattern of 
horizontal rows and vertical columns. (A copy of a diagram showing a 
schematic of a legal dredge ring pattern is available upon request to 
the Office of the Regional Administrator).
    (iii) Dredge or net obstructions. No material, device, net, dredge, 
ring, or link configuration or design shall be used if it results in 
obstructing the release of scallops that would have passed through a 
legal sized and configured net and dredge, as described in this part, 
that did not have in use any such material, device, net, dredge, ring 
link configuration or design.
    (iv) Twine top restrictions. Vessels issued limited access scallop 
permits that are fishing for scallops under the DAS Program are also 
subject to the following restrictions:
    (A) If a vessel is rigged with more than one dredge, or if rigged 
with only one dredge, such dredge is greater than 8 ft (2.44 m) in 
width, there must be at least seven rows of non-overlapping steel rings 
unobstructed by netting or any other material, between the terminus of 
the dredge (club stick) and the net material on the top of the dredge 
(twine top).
    (B) For vessels rigged with only one dredge, and such dredge is less 
than 8 ft (2.44 m) in width, there must be at least four rows of non-
overlapping steel rings unobstructed by netting or any other material 
between the club stick and the twine top of the dredge. (A copy of a 
diagram showing a schematic of a legal dredge with twine top is 
available from the Regional Administrator upon request).
    (c) Crew restrictions. Limited access vessels participating in or 
subject to the scallop DAS allocation program may have no more than 
seven people aboard, including the operator, when not docked or moored 
in port, unless participating in the small dredge program specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section, or otherwise authorized by the Regional 
Administrator.
    (d) Sorting and shucking machines. (1) Shucking machines are 
prohibited on all limited access vessels fishing under the scallop DAS 
program or any vessel in possession of more than 400 lb (181.44 kg) of 
scallops, unless the vessel has not been issued a limited access scallop 
permit and fishes exclusively in state waters.
    (2) Sorting machines are prohibited on limited access vessels 
fishing under the scallop DAS program that shuck scallops at sea.

[[Page 253]]

    (e) Small dredge program restrictions. Any vessel owner whose vessel 
is assigned to either the part-time or occasional category may request, 
in the application for the vessel's annual permit, to be placed in one 
category higher. Vessel owners making such request will be placed in the 
appropriate category for the entire year, if they agree to comply with 
the following restrictions, in addition to and notwithstanding other 
restrictions of this part, when fishing under the DAS program described 
in Sec. 648.53, or in possession of more than 400 lb (181.44 kg) of 
shucked, or 50 bu (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops:
    (1) The vessel must fish exclusively with one dredge no more than 
10.5 ft (3.2 m) in width.
    (2) The vessel may not have more than one dredge on board or in use.
    (3) The vessel may have no more than five people, including the 
operator, on board.
    (f) Restrictions on use of trawl nets--(1) Prohibition on use of 
trawl nets. A vessel issued a limited access scallop permit fishing for 
scallops under the scallop DAS allocation program may not fish with, 
possess on board, or land scallops while in possession of, trawl nets 
unless such vessel has on board a valid letter of authorization or 
permit endorsed to fish for scallops with trawl nets.
    (2) Eligibility to use trawl nets. (i) A vessel is eligible for a 
letter of authorization or a permit endorsement to fish for scallops 
with trawl nets if the vessel:
    (A) Has not fished for scallops with a scallop dredge after December 
31, 1987, and, as of July 19, 1996, has a letter of authorization or 
permit endorsed to fish for scallops with trawl nets;
    (B) Has fished for scallops with a scallop dredge on no more than 10 
trips from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1994, has an engine 
horsepower no greater than 450, and is eligible for or has been issued a 
1996 limited access scallop permit (if the vessel does not obtain a 
letter of authorization or a permit endorsed to fish for scallops with 
trawl nets for the 1996-97 scallop fishing year, the vessel shall not be 
eligible under this provision for subsequent fishing years); or
    (C) Is a replacement vessel for a vessel described in paragraph 
(f)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (ii) NMFS will contact the owners of all vessels with limited access 
scallop permits that have not previously been issued a letter of 
authorization or permit endorsed to fish for scallops with trawl nets as 
to whether, based on information available to NMFS on July 19, 1996, 
their vessels are eligible under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section 
for a letter of authorization or permit endorsed to fish for scallops 
with trawl nets. If a vessel owner agrees with NMFS' determination that 
the vessel is eligible under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section to 
fish for scallops with trawl nets, the owner must, within 30 days of 
receipt of the determination, sign and submit to NMFS a declaration, 
provided by NMFS, stating that the vessel has fished for scallops with a 
scallop dredge on no more than 10 trips from January 1, 1988, through 
December 31, 1994, and has an engine with no greater than 450 
horsepower. The signed declaration shall serve as a rebuttable 
presumption that the vessel qualifies for a letter of authorization or 
permit endorsement to fish for scallops with trawl nets. Any replacement

dredges that the vessel it is replacing met. The letter of authorization 
or permit endorsement must be requested by the vessel owner at the time 
the vessel owner initially applies for a permit for the replacement 
vessel.

Sec. 648.52  Possession limits.

    (a) Owners or operators of vessels with a limited access scallop 
permit that have declared out of the DAS program as specified in 
Sec. 648.10, or that have used up their DAS allocations, and vessels 
possessing a General scallop permit, unless exempted under the state 
waters exemption program described under Sec. 648.54, are prohibited 
from possessing or landing per trip more than 400 lb (181.44 kg) of 
shucked, or 50 bu (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops with not more than one 
scallop trip allowable in any calendar day.

[[Page 254]]

    (b) Owners or operators of vessels without a scallop permit, except 
vessels fishing for scallops exclusively in state waters, are prohibited 
from possessing or landing per trip, more than 40 lb (18.14 kg) of 
shucked, or 5 bu (176.2 L) of in-shell scallops. Owners or operators of 
vessels without a scallop permit are prohibited from selling, bartering, 
or trading scallops harvested from Federal waters.

Sec. 648.53  DAS allocations.

    (a) Assignment to DAS categories. For each fishing year, each vessel 
issued a limited access scallop permit shall be assigned to the DAS 
category (full-time, part-time, or occasional) it was assigned to in the 
proceeding year. Limited access scallop permits will indicate which 
category the vessel is assigned to. Vessels are prohibited from fishing 
for, landing per trip, or possessing more than 400 lb (181.44 kg) of 
shucked, or 50 bu (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops once their allocated 
number of DAS, as specified under paragraph (b) of this section, are 
used up.
    (b) DAS allocations. Each vessel qualifying for one of the three 
categories specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
allocated, annually, the maximum number of DAS it may participate in the 
limited access scallop fishery, according to its category. A vessel 
whose owner/operator has declared it out of the scallop fishery, 
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 648.10, or has used up its allocated 
DAS may leave port without being assessed a DAS, as long as it does not 
possess or land more than 400 lb (181.44 kg) of shucked or 50 bu (17.62 
hl) of in-shell scallops and complies with the other requirements of 
this part. The annual allocations of DAS for each category of vessel for 
the fishing years indicated are as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              1995-96 and               1998-99 and
                        DAS category                             1996-97     1997-98      1999-2000     2000+
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full-time...................................................          182          164          142          120

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Adjustments in annual DAS allocations. Adjustments or changes in 
annual DAS allocations, if required to meet fishing mortality reduction 
goals, may be made following a reappraisal and analysis under the 
framework provisions specified in Sec. 648.55.
    (d) End-of-year carry-over. Limited access vessels with unused DAS 
on the last day of February of any year may carry over a maximum of 10 
DAS into the next year. At no time may more than 10 DAS be carried over. 
DAS sanctioned vessels will be credited with unused DAS based on their 
DAS allocation minus total DAS sanctioned.
    (e) Accrual of DAS. DAS shall accrue to the nearest minute.
    (f) Good Samaritan credit. Limited access vessels fishing under the 
DAS program and that spend time at sea assisting in a USCG search and 
rescue operation or assisting the USCG in towing a disabled vessel, and 
that can document the occurrence through the USCG, will not accrue DAS 
for the time documented.

Sec. 648.54  State waters exemption.

    (a) DAS exemption. Any vessel issued a limited access scallop permit 
is exempt from the DAS requirements specified in Sec. 648.53(b) while 
fishing exclusively landward of the outer boundary of a state's waters, 
provided the vessel complies with paragraphs (c) through (f) of this 
section.
    (b) Gear restriction exemption--(1) Limited access permits. Any 
vessel issued a limited access scallop permit that is exempt from the 
DAS requirements of Sec. 648.53(b) under paragraph (a) of this section 
is also exempt from the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 648.51 (a), 
(b), (e)(1) and (e)(2) while fishing exclusively landward of the outer 
boundary of the waters of a state that has been

[[Page 255]]

deemed by the Regional Administrator under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section to have a scallop fishery and a scallop conservation program 
that does not jeopardize the fishing mortality/effort reduction 
objectives of the Scallop FMP, provided the vessel complies with 
paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.
    (2) General permits. Any vessel issued a general scallop permit is 
exempt from the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 648.51 (a), (b), and 
(e)(1) and (2) while fishing exclusively landward of the outer boundary 
of the waters of a state that has been determined by the Regional 
Administrator under paragraph (b)(3) of this section to have a scallop 
fishery and a scallop conservation program that does not jeopardize the 
fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the Scallop FMP, 
provided the vessel complies with paragraphs (c) through (f) of this 
section.
    (3) State eligibility for gear exemption. (i) A state is eligible to 
have vessels fishing exclusively landward of the outer boundary of the 
waters of that state exempted from the gear requirements specified in 
Sec. 648.51 (a), (b), and (e) (1) and (e)(2), if it has a scallop 
fishery and a scallop conservation program that does not jeopardize the 
fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the Scallop FMP.
    (ii) The Regional Administrator shall determine which states have a 
scallop fishery and which of those states have a scallop conservation 
program that does not jeopardize the fishing mortality/effort reduction 
objectives of the Scallop FMP.
    (iii) Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts have been determined 
by the Regional Administrator to have scallop fisheries and scallop 
conservation programs that do not jeopardize the fishing mortality/
effort reduction objectives of the Scallop FMP. These states must 
immediately notify the Regional Administrator of any changes in their 
respective scallop conservation program. The Regional Administrator will 
review these changes and, if a determination is made that the state's 
conservation program jeopardizes the fishing mortality/effort reduction 
objectives of the Scallop FMP, or that the state no longer has a scallop 
fishery, the Regional Administrator shall publish a final rule in the 
Federal Register amending this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) to eliminate the 
exemption for that state. The Regional Administrator may determine that 
other states have scallop fisheries and scallop conservation programs 
that do not jeopardize the fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives 
of the Scallop FMP. In such case, the Regional Administrator shall 
publish a final rule in the Federal Register amending this paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) to provide the exemption for such states.
    (c) Notification requirements. Vessels fishing under the exemptions 
provided by paragraph(s) (a) and/or (b)(1) of this section must notify 
the Regional Administrator in accordance with the provisions of

under the exemptions provided by paragraphs (a) and/or (b) of this 
section remains subject to all other requirements of this part.
    (g) Possession restriction exemption. Any vessel issued a limited 
access permit that is exempt under paragraph (a) of this section from 
the DAS requirements of Sec. 648.53(b), or any vessel issued a general 
scallop permit is exempt from the possession restrictions specified in 
Sec. 648.52(a) while fishing exclusively landward of the outer boundary 
of the waters of a state that has been determined by the Regional 
Administrator under paragraph (b)(3) of this section to have a scallop 
fishery and a scallop conservation program that does not jeopardize the 
fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the Scallop FMP, 
provided the vessel complies with paragraphs (c) through (f) of this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 648.55  Framework specifications.

    (a) Annually, upon request from the NEFMC, but at a minimum in the 
years 1996 and 1999, the Regional Administrator will provide the NEFMC 
with information on the status of the scallop resource.
    (b) Within 60 days of receipt of that information, the NEFMC PDT 
shall assess the condition of the scallop resource to determine the 
adequacy of the total allowable DAS reduction schedule, described in 
Sec. 648.53(b), to achieve the target fishing mortality rate. In 
addition, the PDT shall make a determination whether other resource 
conservation issues exist that require a management response in order to 
meet the goals and objectives outlined in the Scallop FMP. The PDT shall 
report its findings and recommendations to the NEFMC. In its report to 
the NEFMC, the PDT shall provide the appropriate rationale and economic 
and biological analysis for its recommendation, utilizing the most 
current catch, effort, and other relevant data from the fishery.
    (c) After receiving the PDT findings and recommendations, the NEFMC 
shall determine whether adjustments to, or additional management 
measures are necessary to meet the goals and objectives of the Scallop 
FMP. After considering the PDT's findings and recommendations, or at any 
other time, if the NEFMC determines that adjustments to, or additional 
management measures are necessary, it shall develop and analyze 
appropriate management actions over the span of at least two NEFMC 
meetings. The NEFMC shall provide the public with advance notice of the 
availability of both the proposals and the analyses, and opportunity to 
comment on them prior to and at the second NEFMC meeting. The NEFMC's 
recommendation on adjustments or additions to management measures must 
come from one or more of the following categories:
    (1) DAS changes.
    (2) Shell height.
    (3) Offloading window reinstatement.
    (4) Effort monitoring.
    (5) Data reporting.
    (6) Trip limits.
    (7) Gear restrictions.
    (8) Permitting restrictions.
    (9) Crew limits.
    (10) Small mesh line.
    (11) Onboard observers.
    (12) Any other management measures currently included in the FMP.
    (d) The Council may make recommendations to the Regional 
Administrator to implement measures in accordance with the procedures 
described in this subpart to address gear conflict as defined under 50 
CFR 600.10. In developing such recommendation, the Council shall define 
gear management areas, each not to exceed 2700 mi<SUP>2</SUP> (5000.4 
km<SUP>2</SUP>), and seek industry comments by referring the matter to 
its standing industry advisory committee for gear conflict, or to any ad 
hoc industry advisory committee that may be formed. The standing 
industry advisory committee or ad hoc committee on gear conflict shall 
hold public meetings seeking comments from affected fishers and develop 
findings and recommendations on addressing the gear conflict. After 
receiving the industry advisory committee findings and recommendations, 
or at any other time, the Council shall determine whether it is 
necessary to adjust or add management measures to address gear conflicts 
and which FMPs must be modified to address such conflicts. If the 
Council determines that adjustments or additional measures are 
necessary, it shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions 
for the relevant FMPs over the span of at least two Council meetings. 
The Council shall provide the public with advance notice of the 
availability of the recommendation, the appropriate justification and 
economic and biological analyses, and opportunity to comment on them 
prior to and at the second or final Council meeting before submission to 
the Regional Administrator. The Council's recommendation on adjustments 
or additions to management measures for gear conflicts must come from 
one or more of the following categories:
    (1) Monitoring of a radio channel by fishing vessels.
    (2) Fixed gear location reporting and plotting requirements.
    (3) Standards of operation when gear conflict occurs.

[[Page 257]]

    (4) Fixed gear marking and setting practices.
    (5) Gear restrictions for specific areas (including time and area 
closures).
    (6) Vessel monitoring systems.
    (7) Restrictions on the maximum number of fishing vessels or amount 
of gear.
    (8) Special permitting conditions.
    (e) The measures shall be evaluated and approved by the relevant 
committees with oversight authority for the affected FMPs. If there is 
disagreement between committees, the Council may return the proposed 
framework adjustment to the standing or ad hoc gear conflict committee 
for further review and discussion.
    (f) After developing management actions and receiving public 
testimony, the NEFMC shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Administrator. The NEFMC's recommendation must include supporting 
rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of 
impacts and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator on whether to 
publish the management measures as a final rule. If the NEFMC recommends 
that the management measures should be published as a final rule, the 
NEFMC must consider at least the following factors and provide support 
and analysis for each factor considered:
    (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season.
    (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the NEFMC's recommended management measures.
    (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or to 
impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts.
    (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their promulgation as a final rule.
    (g) If the NEFMC's recommendation includes adjustments or additions 
to management measures, and if, after reviewing the NEFMC's 
recommendation and supporting information:
    (1) The Regional Administrator concurs with the NEFMC's recommended 
management measures and determines that the recommended management 
measures may be published as a final rule based on the factors specified 
in paragraph (d) of this section, the action will be published in the 
Federal Register as a final rule; or
    (2) The Regional Administrator concurs with the NEFMC's 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, the action will be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if the Regional Administrator concurs with the NEFMC 
recommendation, the action will be published as a final rule in the 
Federal Register; or
    (3) The Regional Administrator does not concur, the NEFMC will be 
notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (h) Nothing in this section is meant to derogate from the authority 
of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(e) of the 
Magnuson Act.

  Subpart E--Management Measures for the Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean 
                            Quahog Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 648.70  Annual individual allocations.

    (a) General. (1) For each fishing year, the Regional Administrator 
shall determine the allocation of surf clams and ocean quahogs for each 
vessel owner issued an allocation for the preceding fishing year, by 
multiplying the quotas specified for each species by the Regional 
Administrator under Sec. 648.71 by the allocation percentage, specified 
for that owner on the allocation permit for the preceding fishing year, 
adjusted to account for any transfer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section. These allocations shall be made in the form of an allocation 
permit specifying for each species the allocation percentage and the 
allocation in bushels. Such permits shall be issued on or before 
December 15, to the registered holders who were assigned an allocation 
by November 1. The total number of bushels of allocation shall be 
divided by 32 to determine the appropriate number of cage tags to be 
issued or acquired under Sec. 648.75. Amounts of allocation 0.5 or 
smaller created by this division shall be rounded downward to the 
nearest whole number and amounts of allocation greater than 0.5 created 
by this division shall be rounded upward to the nearest whole number so 
that allocations are specified in whole cages. An allocation permit is 
only valid for the entity for which it is issued.
    (2) The Regional Administrator may, after publication of a fee 
notification in the Federal Register, charge a permit fee before 
issuance of the permit to recover administrative expenses. Failure to 
pay the fee will preclude issuance of the permit.
    (b) Transfers--(1) Allocation percentage. Subject to the approval of 
the Regional Administrator, part or all of an allocation percentage may 
be transferred, in amounts equivalent to not less than 160 bu (8,500 L) 
(i.e., 5 cages) in the year in which the transfer is made, to any person 
eligible to own a documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 
12102(a). Approval of a transfer by the Regional Administrator and for a 
new allocation permit reflecting that transfer may be requested by 
submitting a written application for approval of the transfer and for 
issuance of a new allocation permit to the Regional Administrator at 
least 10 days before the date on which the applicant desires the 
transfer to be effective, in the form of a completed transfer log

[[Page 260]]

supplied by the Regional Administrator. The transfer is not effective 
until the new holder receives a new or revised annual allocation permit 
from the Regional Administrator. An application for transfer may not be 
made between October 15 and December 31 of each year.
    (2) Cage tags. Cage tags issued pursuant to Sec. 648.75 may be 
transferred in quantities of not less than 5 tags at any one time, 
subject to the restrictions and procedure specified in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section; provided that application for such cage tag transfers 
may be made at any time before December 10 of each year and the transfer 
is effective upon the receipt by the transferee of written authorization 
from the Regional Administrator.
    (3) Review. If the Regional Administrator determines that the 
applicant has been issued a Notice of Permit Sanction for a violation of 
the Magnuson Act that has not been resolved, he/she may decline to 
approve such transfer pending resolution of the matter.


<R05>
Sec. 648.71  Catch quotas.

    (a) Surf clams. The amount of surf clams that may be caught annually 
by fishing vessels subject to these regulations will be specified by the 
Assistant Administrator, on or about December 1 of each year, within the 
range of 1.85 to 3.4 million bu (98.5 to 181 million L).
    (1) Establishing quotas. (i) Prior to the beginning of each year, 
the MAFMC, following an opportunity for public comment, will recommend 
to the Assistant Administrator quotas and estimates of DAH and DAP 
within the ranges specified. In selecting the quota, the MAFMC shall 
consider current stock assessments, catch reports, and other relevant 
information concerning:
    (A) Exploitable and spawning biomass relative to the OY.
    (B) Fishing mortality rates relative to the OY.
    (C) Magnitude of incoming recruitment.
    (D) Projected effort and corresponding catches.
    (E) Geographical distribution of the catch relative to the 
geographical distribution of the resource.
    (F) Status of areas previously closed to surf clam fishing that are 
to be opened during the year and areas likely to be closed to fishing 
during the year.
    (ii) The quota shall be set at that amount that is most consistent 
with the objectives of the Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog FMP. The 
Assistant Administrator may set quotas at quantities different from the 
MAFMC's recommendations only if he/she can demonstrate that the MAFMC's 
recommendations violate the national standards of the Magnuson Act and 
the objectives of the Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog FMP.
    (2) Report. Prior to the beginning of each year, the Regional 
Administrator shall prepare a written report, based on the latest 
available stock assessment report prepared by NMFS, data reported by 
harvesters and processors according to these regulations, and other 
relevant data. The report will include consideration of:
    (i) Exploitable biomass and spawning biomass relative to OY.
    (ii) Fishing mortality rates relative to OY.
    (iii) Magnitude of incoming recruitment.
    (iv) Projected effort and corresponding catches.
    (v) Status of areas previously closed to surf clams fishing that are 
to be opened during the year and areas likely to be closed to fishing 
during the year.
    (vi) Geographical distribution of the catch relative to the 
geographical distribution of the resource.
    (3) Public review. Based on the information presented in the report, 
and in consultation with the MAFMC, the Assistant Administrator shall 
propose an annual surf clam quota and an annual ocean quahog quota and 
shall publish them in the Federal Register. Comments on the proposed 
annual quotas may be submitted to the Regional Administrator within 30 
days after publication. The Assistant Administrator shall consider all 
comments, determine the appropriate annual quotas, and publish the 
annual quotas in the Federal Register on or about December 1 of each 
year.
    (b) Ocean quahogs. The amount of ocean quahogs that may be caught by

[[Page 261]]

fishing vessels subject to these regulations shall be specified annually 
by the Assistant Administrator, on or about December 1, within the range 
of 4 to 6 million bu (213 to 319.4 million L), following the same 
procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section for surf clams.


<R05>
Sec. 648.72  Minimum surf clam size.

    (a) Minimum length. The minimum length for surf clams is 4.75 inches 
(12.065 cm).
    (b) Determination of compliance. No more than 50 surf clams in any 
cage may be less than 4.75 inches (12.065 cm) in length. If more than 50 
surf clams in any inspected cage of surf clams are less than 4.75 inches 
(12.065 cm) in length, all cages landed by the same vessel from the same 
trip are deemed to be in violation of the minimum size restriction.
    (c) Suspension. Upon the recommendation of the MAFMC, the Regional 
Administrator may suspend annually, by publication in the Federal 
Register, the minimum shell-height standard, unless discard, catch, and 
survey data indicate that 30 percent of the surf clams are smaller than 
4.75 inches (12.065 cm) and the overall reduced shell height is not 
attributable to beds where the growth of individual surf clams has been 
reduced because of density dependent factors.
    (d) Measurement. Length is measured at the longest dimension of the 
surf clam shell.


<R05>
Sec. 648.73  Closed areas.

    (a) Areas closed because of environmental degradation. Certain areas 
are closed to all surf clam and ocean quahog fishing because of adverse 
environmental conditions. These areas will remain closed until the 
Assistant Administrator determines that the adverse environmental 
conditions no longer exist. If additional areas are identified by the 
Assistant Administrator as being contaminated by the introduction or 
presence of hazardous materials or pollutants, they may be closed by the 
Assistant Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section. The areas closed are:
    (1) Boston Foul Ground. The waste disposal site known as the 
``Boston Foul Ground'' and located at 42 deg.2'36" N. lat., 
70 deg.35'00" W. long., with a radius of 1 nm in every direction from 
that point.
    (2) New York Bight. The polluted area and waste disposal site known 
as the ``New York Bight'' and located at 40 deg.25'04" N. lat., 
73 deg.42'38" W. long., and with a radius of 6 nm in every direction 
from that point, extending further northwestward, westward and 
southwestward between a line from a point on the arc at 40 deg.31'00" N. 
lat., 73 deg.43'38" W. long., directly northward toward Atlantic Beach 
Light in New York to the limit of the state territorial waters of New 
York; and a line from the point on the arc at 40 deg.19'48" N. lat., 
73 deg.45'42" W. long., to a point at the limit of the state territorial 
waters of New Jersey at 40 deg.14'00" N. lat., 73 deg.55'42" W. long.
    (3) 106 Dumpsite. The toxic industrial site known as the ``106 
Dumpsite" and located between 38 deg.40'00" and 39 deg.00'00" N. lat., 
and between 72 deg.00'00" and 72 deg.30'00" W. long.
    (b) Areas closed because of small surf clams. Areas may be closed 
because they contain small surf clams.
    (1) Closure. The Assistant Administrator may close an area to surf 
clams and ocean quahog fishing if he/she determines, based on logbook 
entries, processors' reports, survey cruises, or other information, that 
the area contains surf clams of which:
    (i) Sixty percent or more are smaller than the minimum size (4.5 
inches (11.43 cm)); and
    (ii) Not more than 15 percent are larger than 5.5 inches (13.97 cm) 
in size.
    (2) Reopening. The Assistant Administrator may reopen areas or parts 
of areas closed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if he/she 
determines, based on survey cruises or other information, that:
    (i) The average length of the dominant (in terms of weight) size 
class in the area to be reopened is equal to or greater than 4.75 inches 
(12.065 cm); or
    (ii) The yield or rate of growth of the dominant shell-height class 
in the area to be reopened would be significantly enhanced through 
selective, controlled, or limited harvest of surf clams in the area.
    (c) Procedure. (1) The Regional Administrator may hold a public 
hearing on the proposed closure or reopening of

[[Page 262]]

any area under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. The Assistant 
Administrator shall publish notification in the Federal Register of any 
proposed area closure or reopening, including any restrictions on 
harvest in a reopened area. Comments on the proposed closure or 
reopening may be submitted to the Regional Administrator within 30 days 
after publication. The Assistant Administrator shall consider all 
comments and publish the final notification of closure or reopening, and 
any restrictions on harvest, in the Federal Register. Any adjustment to 
harvest restrictions in a reopened area shall be made by notification in 
the Federal Register. The Regional Administrator shall send notice of 
any action under this paragraph (c)(1) to each surf clam and ocean 
quahog processor and to each surf clam and ocean quahog permit holder.
    (2) If the Regional Administrator determines, as the result of 
testing by state, Federal, or private entities, that a closure of an 
area under paragraph (a) of this section is necessary to prevent any 
adverse effects fishing may have on the public health, he/she may close 
the area for 60 days by publication of notification in the Federal 
Register, without prior comment or public hearing. If an extension of 
the 60-day closure period is necessary to protect the public health, the 
hearing and notice requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
shall be followed.
    (d) Areas closed due to the presence of paralytic shellfish 
poisoning toxin--(1) Maine mahogany quahog zone. The Maine mahogany 
quahog zone is closed to fishing for ocean quahogs except in those areas 
of the zone that are tested by the State of Maine and deemed to be 
within the requirements of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program and 
adopted by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference as acceptable 
limits for the toxin responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning. 
Harvesting is allowed in such areas during the periods specified by the 
Maine Department of Marine Resources during which quahogs are safe for 
human consumption. For information regarding these areas contact the 
State of Maine Division of Marine Resources at (207-624-6550).

<R05>
Sec. 648.74  Shucking at sea.

    (a) Observers. (1) The Regional Administrator may allow the shucking 
of surf clams or ocean quahogs at sea if he/she determines that an 
observer carried aboard the vessel can measure accurately the total 
amount of surf clams and ocean quahogs harvested in the shell prior to 
shucking.
    (2) Any vessel owner may apply in writing to the Regional 
Administrator to shuck surf clams or ocean quahogs at sea. The 
application shall specify: Name and address of the applicant, permit 
number of the vessel, method of calculating the amount of surf clams or 
ocean quahogs harvested in the shell, vessel dimensions and 
accommodations, and length of fishing trip.
    (3) The Regional Administrator shall provide an observer to any 
vessel owner whose application is approved. The owner shall pay all 
reasonable expenses of carrying the observer on board the vessel.
    (4) Any observer shall certify at the end of each trip the amount of 
surf clams or ocean quahogs harvested in the shell by the vessel. Such 
certification shall be made by the observer's signature on the daily 
fishing log required by Sec. 648.7.
    (b) Conversion factor. (1) Based on the recommendation of the MAFMC, 
the Regional Administrator may allow shucking at sea of surf clams or 
ocean quahogs, with or without an observer, if he/she determines a 
conversion factor for shucked meats to calculate accurately the amount 
of surf clams or ocean quahogs harvested in the shell.
    (2) The Regional Administrator shall publish notification in the 
Federal Register specifying a conversion factor together with the data 
used in its calculation for a 30-day comment period. After consideration 
of the public comments and any other relevant data, the Regional 
Administrator may publish final notification in the Federal Register 
specifying the conversion factor.
    (3) If the Regional Administrator makes the determination specified 
in

[[Page 263]]

paragraph (b)(1) of this section, he/she may authorize the vessel owner 
to shuck surf clams or ocean quahogs at sea. Such authorization shall be 
in writing and be carried aboard the vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 648.75  Cage identification.

    Except as provided in Sec. 648.76, the following cage identification 
requirements apply to all vessels issued a Federal fishing permit for 
surf clams and ocean quahogs:
    (a) Tagging. Before offloading, all cages that contain surf clams or 
ocean quahogs must be tagged with tags acquired annually under paragraph 
(b) of this section. A tag must be fixed on or as near as possible to 
the upper crossbar of the cage for every 60 ft \3\ (1,700 L), or portion 
thereof, of the cage. A tag or tags must not be removed until the cage 
is emptied by the processor, at which time the processor must promptly 
remove and retain the tag(s) for collection or disposal as specified by 
the Regional Administrator.
    (b) Issuance. The Regional Administrator will issue a supply of tags 
to each individual vessel owner qualifying for an allocation under 
Sec. 648.70 prior to the beginning of each fishing year or he/she may 
specify, in the Federal Register, a vendor from whom the tags shall be 
purchased. The number of tags will be based on the owner's allocation. 
Each tag represents 32 bu (1,700 L) of allocation.
    (c) Expiration. Tags will expire at the end of the fishing year for 
which they are issued, or if rendered null and void in accordance with 
15 CFR part 904.
    (d) Return. Tags that have been rendered null and void must be 
returned to the Regional Administrator, if possible.
    (e) Loss. Loss or theft of tags must be reported by the owner, 
numerically identifying the tags to the Regional Administrator by 
telephone as soon as the loss or theft is discovered and in writing 
within 24 hours. Thereafter, the reported tags shall no longer be valid 
for use under this part.
    (f) Replacement. Lost or stolen tags may be replaced by the Regional 
Administrator if proper notice of the loss is provided by the person to 
whom the tags were issued. Replacement tags may be purchased from the 
Regional Administrator or a vendor with a written authorization from the 
Regional Administrator.
    (g) Transfer. See Sec. 648.70(b)(2).
    (h) Presumptions. Surf clams and ocean quahogs found in cages 
without a valid state tag are deemed to have been harvested in the EEZ 
and to be part of an individual's allocation, unless the individual 
demonstrates that he/she has surrendered his/her Federal vessel permit 
issued under Sec. 648.4(a)(4) and conducted fishing operations 
exclusively within waters under the jurisdiction of any state. Surf 
clams and ocean quahogs in cages with a Federal tag or tags, issued and 
still valid pursuant to this section, affixed thereto are deemed to have 
been harvested by the individual allocation holder to whom the tags were 
issued under Sec. 648.75(b) or transferred under Sec. 648.70(b).

Sec. 648.76  Maine mahogany quahog zone.

    (a) Landing requirements. (1) A vessel issued a valid Maine mahogany 
quahog permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(4)(i), and fishing for or 
possessing ocean quahogs within the Maine mahogany quahog zone, must 
land its catch in the State of Maine.
    (2) A vessel fishing under an individual allocation permit, 
regardless of whether it has a Maine mahogany quahog permit, fishing for 
or possessing ocean quahogs within the zone, may land its catch in the 
State of Maine, or, consistent with applicable state law in any other 
state that utilizes food safety-based procedures including sampling and 
analyzing for PSP toxin consistent with those food safety-based 
procedures used by the State of Maine for such purpose, and must comply 
with all requirements in Secs. 648.70 and 648.75. Documentation required 
by the state and other laws and regulations applicable to food safety-
based procedures must be made available by federally-permitted dealers 
for inspection by NMFS .
    (b) Quota monitoring and closures--(1) Catch quota. (i) The annual 
quota for harvest of mahogany quahogs from within the Maine mahogany 
quahog zone is 100,000 Maine bushels (35,150

[[Page 264]]

hL). The quota may be revised annually within the range of 17,000 and 
100,000 Maine bushels (5,975 and 35,150 hL) following the procedures set 
forth in Sec. 648.71.
    (ii) All mahogany quahogs landed for sale in Maine by vessels issued 
a Maine mahogany quahog permit and not fishing for an individual 
allocation of ocean quahogs under Sec. 648.70 shall be applied against 
the Maine mahogany quahog quota, regardless of where the mahogany 
quahogs are harvested.
    (iii) All mahogany quahogs landed by vessels fishing in the Maine 
mahogany quahog zone for an individual allocation of quahogs under 
Sec. 648.70 will be counted against the ocean quahog allocation for 
which the vessel is fishing.
    (iv) The Regional Administrator will monitor the quota based on 
dealer reports and other available information and shall determine the 
date when the quota will be harvested. NMFS shall publish notification 
in the Federal Register advising the public that, effective upon a 
specific date, the Maine mahogany quahog quota has been harvested and 
notifying vessel and dealer permit holders that no Maine mahogany quahog 
quota is available for the remainder of the year.
    (2) Maine Mahogany Quahog Advisory Panel. The Council shall 
establish a Maine Mahogany Quahog Advisory Panel consisting of 
representatives of harvesters, dealers, and the Maine Department of 
Marine Resources. The Advisory Panel shall make recommendations, through 
the Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog Committee of the Council, regarding 
revisions to the annual quota and other management measures.

    (2) Gear restrictions. (i) Minimum mesh size. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (a)(2) (iii) and (i) of this section, and unless otherwise 
restricted under paragraphs (a) (2)(ii) and (5) of this section, the 
minimum mesh size for any trawl net, sink gillnet, Scottish seine, 
midwater trawl, or purse seine on a

[[Page 265]]

vessel or used by a vessel fishing under a DAS in the NE multispecies 
DAS program in the GOM/GB Regulated Mesh Area is 6-inch (15.24-cm) 
square or diamond mesh throughout the entire net. This restriction does 
not apply to nets or pieces of nets smaller than 3 ft (0.9 m) x 3 ft 
(0.9 m), (9 ft\2\ (0.81 m\2\)), or to vessels that have not been issued 
a multispecies permit and that are fishing exclusively in state waters.
    (ii) Large-mesh vessels. When fishing in the GOM/GB regulated mesh 
area, the minimum mesh size for any sink gillnet on a vessel or used by 
a vessel fishing under a DAS in the large-mesh DAS program specified in 
Sec. 648.82(b) (6) and (7) is 7-inch (17.78-cm) diamond mesh throughout 
the entire net. The minimum mesh size for any trawl net on a vessel or 
used by a vessel fishing under a DAS in the large-mesh DAS program is 8-
inch (20.32-cm) diamond mesh throughout the entire net. This restriction 
does not apply to nets or pieces of nets smaller than 3 ft (0.9 m) x 3 
ft (0.9 m), (9 ft\2\ (0.81 m\2\)), or to vessels that have not been 
issued a multispecies permit and that are fishing exclusively in state 
waters.
    (iii) Other restrictions and exemptions. Vessels are prohibited from 
fishing in the GOM/GB Regulated Mesh Area except if fishing with 
exempted gear (as defined under this part) or under the exemptions 
specified in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6), (a)(8) through (13), 
(d), (e), (h), and (i) of this section, if fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS, if fishing under the small vessel exemption specified 
in Sec. 648.82((b)(3), if fishing under the scallop state waters 
exemptions specified in Sec. 648.54 and (a)(10) of this section, or if 
fishing pursuant to a NE multispecies open access Charter/Party or 
Handgear permit. Any gear on a vessel, or used by a vessel, in this area 
must be authorized under one of these exemptions or must be stowed as 
specified in Sec. 648.81(e).
    (3) Small Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area. Vessels 
subject to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section may fish for, harvest, possess, or land northern 
shrimp in the Small Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area with

    (i) Restrictions on fishing for, possessing, or landing fish other 
than shrimp. A vessel fishing in the northern shrimp fishery described 
in this section under this exemption may not fish for, possess on board, 
or land any species of fish other than shrimp, except for the following, 
with the restrictions noted, as allowable bycatch species: Longhorn 
sculpin; silver hake--up to an amount equal to the total weight of 
shrimp landed; and American lobster--up to 10 percent, by weight, of all 
other species on board, or 200 lobsters (whichever is less).
    (ii) Requirement to use a finfish excluder device (FED). A vessel 
must have a rigid or semi-rigid grate consisting of parallel bars of not 
more than 1-inch (2.54-cm) spacing that excludes all fish and other 
objects, except those that are small enough to pass between its bars 
into the codend of the trawl, secured in the trawl, forward of the 
codend, in such a manner that it precludes the passage of fish or other 
objects into the codend without the fish or objects having to first pass 
between the bars of the grate, in any net with mesh smaller than the 
minimum size specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The net must 
have a outlet or hole to allow fish or other objects that are too large 
to pass between the bars of the grate to exit out of the net. The 
aftermost edge of this outlet or hole must be at least as wide as the 
grate at

[[Page 266]]

the point of attachment. The outlet or hole must extend forward from the 
grate toward the mouth of the net. A funnel of net material is allowed 
in the lengthening piece of the net forward of the grate to direct catch 
towards the grate. (Copies of a schematic example of a properly 
configured and installed FED are available from the Regional 
Administrator upon request.)
    (iii) Time restrictions. A vessel may only fish under this exemption 
during the northern shrimp season, as established by the Commission and 
announced in the Commission's letter to participants.
    (4) Cultivator Shoal Whiting Fishery Exemption Area. Vessels subject 
to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section may fish with, use, or possess nets in the Cultivator Shoal 
Whiting Fishery Exemption Area with a mesh size smaller than the minimum 
size specified, if the vessel complies with the requirements specified 
in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. The Cultivator Shoal Whiting 
Fishery Exemption Area (copies of a map depicting the area are available 
from the Regional Administrator upon request) is defined by straight 
lines connecting the following points in the order stated:

    (i) Requirements. (A) A vessel fishing in the Cultivator Shoal 
Whiting Fishery Exemption Area under this exemption must have a letter 
of authorization issued by the Regional Administrator on board and may 
not fish for, possess on board, or land any species of fish other than 
whiting, except for the following, with the restrictions noted, as 
allowable incidental species: Herring; longhorn sculpin; squid; 
butterfish; mackerel; monkfish and monkfish parts, dogfish, and red 
hake--up to 10 percent each, by weight, of all other species on board; 
and American lobster--up to 10 percent by weight of all other species on 
board or 200 lobsters, whichever is less.
    (B) All nets must comply with a minimum mesh size of 3-inch (7.62 
cm) square or diamond mesh applied to the first 160 meshes counted from 
the terminus of the net.
    (C) Fishing is confined to a season of June 15 through October 31, 
unless otherwise specified by notification in the Federal Register.
    (D) When transiting through the GOM/GB Regulated Mesh Area specified 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any nets with a mesh size 
smaller than the minimum mesh size specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section must be stowed in accordance with one of the methods specified 
in Sec. 648.23(b).
    (ii) Sea sampling. The Regional Administrator shall conduct periodic 
sea sampling to determine if there is a need to change the area or 
season designation, and to evaluate the bycatch of regulated species, 
especially haddock.
    (iii) Annual review. The NEFMC shall conduct an annual review of 
data to determine if there are any changes in area or season designation 
necessary, and to make appropriate recommendations to the Regional 
Administrator following the procedures specified in Sec. 648.90 of this 
part.
    (5) Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge (SB/JL) Juvenile Protection Area. 
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (d), (e), and (h) of this 
section, the minimum mesh size for any trawl net, Scottish seine, purse 
seine, or midwater trawl in use, or available for immediate use as 
described in Sec. 648.23(b), by a vessel fishing in the following area

    (ii) Fishing for northern shrimp in the SB/JL Juvenile Protection 
Area is allowed, subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (6) Transiting. (i) Vessels fishing in the Small Mesh Northern 
Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area and in Small Mesh Area 1/Small Mesh Area 
2, as specified in paragraphs (a) (3) and (8) of this section, may 
transit through the SB/JL Juvenile Protection Area defined in paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section with nets on board that do not conform to the 
requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(5) of this section, 
provided that the nets are stowed in accordance with one of the methods 
specified in Sec. 648.23(b).
    (ii) Vessels subject to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may transit through the Small Mesh 
Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area defined in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section with nets on board with a mesh size smaller than the 
minimum size specified, provided that the nets are stowed in accordance 
with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b), and provided the 
vessel has no fish on board.
    (iii) Vessels subject to the minimum mesh size restrictions 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may transit through the 
GOM/GB Regulated Mesh Area defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
with nets on board with a mesh size smaller than the minimum mesh size 
specified and with small mesh exempted species on board, provided that 
the following conditions are met:
    (A) All nets with a mesh size smaller than the minimum mesh size 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section are stowed in accordance 
with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b).
    (B) A letter of authorization issued by the Regional Administrator 
is on board.
    (C) Vessels do not fish for, possess on board, or land any fish, 
except when fishing in the areas specified in paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(9), 
(b), and (c) of this section. Vessels may retain exempted small mesh 
species as provided in paragraphs (a)(4)(i), (a)(9)(i), (b)(3), and 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (7) Addition or deletion of exemptions. (i) An exemption may be 
added in an existing fishery for which there are sufficient data or 
information to ascertain the amount of regulated species bycatch, if the 
Regional Administrator, after consultation with the NEFMC, determines 
that the percentage of regulated species caught as bycatch is, or can be 
reduced to, less than 5 percent, by weight, of total catch and that such 
exemption will not jeopardize fishing mortality objectives. In 
determining whether exempting a fishery may jeopardize meeting fishing 
mortality objectives, the Regional Administrator may take into 
consideration factors such as, but not limited to, juvenile mortality. A 
fishery can be defined, restricted, or allowed by area, gear, season, or 
other means determined to be appropriate to reduce bycatch of regulated 
species. An existing exemption may be deleted or modified if the 
Regional Administrator determines that the catch of regulated species is 
equal to or greater than 5 percent, by weight, of total catch, or that 
continuing the exemption may jeopardize meeting fishing mortality 
objectives. Notification of additions, deletions or modifications will 
be made through issuance of a rule in the Federal Register.
    (ii) The NEFMC may recommend to the Regional Administrator, through 
the framework procedure specified in Sec. 648.90(b), additions or 
deletions to exemptions for fisheries, either existing or proposed, for 
which there may be insufficient data or information for the Regional 
Administrator to determine,

[[Page 268]]

without public comment, percentage catch of regulated species.
    (iii) The Regional Administrator may, using the process described in 
either paragraph (a)(7)(i) or (ii) of this section, authorize an 
exemption for a white hake fishery by vessels using regulated mesh or 
hook gear. Determination of the percentage of regulated species caught 
in such fishery shall not include white hake.
    (iv) Bycatch in exempted fisheries authorized under this paragraph 
(a)(7) are subject, at minimum, to the following restrictions:
    (A) With the exception of fisheries authorized under paragraph 
(a)(7)(iii) of this section, a prohibition on the possession of 
regulated species.
    (B) A limit on the possession of monkfish or monkfish parts of 10 
percent, by weight, of all other species on board.
    (C) A limit on the possession of lobsters of 10 percent, by weight, 
of all other species on board or 200 lobsters, whichever is less.
    (D) A limit on the possession of skate or skate parts in the 
Southern New England regulated mesh area described in paragraph (b) of 
this section of 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board.
    (8) Small Mesh Area 1/Small Mesh Area 2. (i) Vessels subject to the 
minimum mesh size restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section may fish with or possess nets with a mesh size smaller than the 
minimum size, provided the vessel complies with the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(8)(iv) or (a)(3)(ii) of this section, from July 15 through 
November 15 when fishing in Small Mesh Area 1 and from January 1 through 
June 30 when fishing in Small Mesh Area 2, except as specified in 
paragraph (a)(8)(ii) and (a)(8)(iii) of this section. A vessel may not 
fish for, possess on board, or land any species of fish other than: 
Butterfish, dogfish, herring, mackerel, ocean pout, scup, squid, silver 
hake, and red hake, except for the following allowable incidental 
species (bycatch as the term is used elsewhere in this part), with the 
restrictions noted: Longhorn sculpin; monkfish and monkfish parts--up to 
10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board; and American 
lobster--up to 10 percent, by weight, of all other species on board or 
200 lobsters, whichever is less. These areas are defined by straight 
lines connecting the following points in the order stated (copies of a 
chart depicting these areas are available from the Regional 
Administrator upon request (see Table 1 to Sec. 600.502)):

    (iv) Raised footrope trawl. Vessels fishing with trawl gear must 
configure it in such a way that, when towed, the gear is not in contact 
with the ocean bottom. Vessels are presumed to be fishing in such a 
manner if their trawl gear is designed as specified in paragraphs 
(a)(8)(iv) (A) through (D) of this section and is towed so that it does 
not come into contact with the ocean bottom:
    (A) Eight inch (20.3 cm) diameter floats must be attached to the 
entire length of the headrope with a maximum spacing of 4 feet (12.2 cm) 
between floats;
    (B) The ground gear must all be bare wire not larger than \1/2\-inch 
(1.2 cm) for the top leg, not larger than \5/8\-inch (1.6 cm) for the 
bottom leg, and not larger than \3/4\-inch (1.9 cm) for the ground 
cables. The top and bottom legs must be equal in length with no 
extensions. The total length of ground cables and legs must not be 
greater than 40 fathoms from the doors to wingends;
    (C) The footrope must be at least 20 feet (6.1 m) longer than the 
length of the headrope; and
    (D) The sweep must be rigged so it is behind and below the footrope, 
and the footrope is off the bottom. This is accomplished by having the 
sweep longer than the footrope and having long dropper chains attaching 
the sweep to the footrope at regular intervals. The forward end of the 
sweep and footrope must be connected to the bottom leg at the same 
point. This attachment, in conjunction with the headrope flotation, 
keeps the footrope off the bottom. The sweep and its rigging must be 
made entirely of 5/16 inch (0.8 cm) diameter bare chain. No wrapping or 
cookies are allowed on the chain. The total length of the sweep must be 
at least 7 feet (2.1 m) longer than the total length of the footrope, or 
3.5 feet (1.1 m) longer on each side. Drop chains must connect the 
footrope to the sweep chain, and the length of each drop chain must be 
at least 42 inches (106.7 cm). One drop chain must be hung from the 
center of the footrope to the center of the sweep, and one drop chain 
must be hung from each corner (the quarter or the junction of the bottom 
wing to the belly at the footrope). The attachment points of each drop 
chain on the sweep and the footrope must be the same distance from the 
center drop chain attachments. Drop chains must be hung at 8 foot (2.4 
m) intervals from the corners toward the wing ends. The distance of the 
drop chain that is nearest the wing end to the end of the footrope may 
differ from net to net. However, the sweep must be at least 3.5 feet 
(1.1 m) longer than the footrope between the drop chain closest to the 
wing ends and the end of the sweep that attaches to the wing end.
    (9) Nantucket Shoals dogfish fishery exemption area. Vessels subject 
to the minimum mesh size restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section may fish with, use, or possess nets of mesh smaller than 
the minimum size specified in the Nantucket Shoals Dogfish Fishery 
Exemption Area, if the vessel complies with the requirements specified 
in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section. The Nantucket Shoals Dogfish 
Fishery Exemption Area (copies of a map depicting this area are 
available from the Regional Administrator upon request) is defined by 
straight lines connecting the following points in the order stated:

the minimum mesh size specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must 
be stowed and unavailable for immediate use in accordance with 
Sec. 648.23(b).
    (D) The following species may be retained, with the restrictions 
noted, as allowable bycatch species in the Nantucket Shoals Dogfish 
Fishery Exemption Area: Longhorn sculpin; silver hake--up to two 
standard totes; monkfish and monkfish parts--up to 10 percent, by 
weight, of all other species on board; American lobster--up to 10 
percent, by weight, of all other species on board or 200 lobsters, 
whichever is less; and skate or skate parts--up to 10 percent, by 
weight, of all other species on board.
    (E) A vessel fishing in the Nantucket Shoals Dogfish Fishery 
Exemption Area under the exemption must comply with any additional gear 
restrictions specified in the letter of authorization issued by the 
Regional Administrator.
    (ii) Sea sampling. The Regional Administrator may conduct periodic 
sea sampling to determine if there is a need to change the area or 
season designation, and to evaluate the bycatch of regulated species.
    (10) Scallop Dredge Fishery Exemption within the Gulf of Maine (GOM) 
Small Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area. Vessels with a 
limited access scallop permit that have declared out of the DAS program 
as specified in Sec. 648.10, or have used up their DAS allocations, and 
vessels issued a general scallop permit may fish in the GOM Small Mesh 
Northern Shrimp Fishery Exemption Area when not under a NE multispecies 
DAS providing the vessel complies with the requirements specified in 
paragraph (a)(10)(i) of this section. The GOM Scallop Dredge Fishery 
Exemption Area is equivalent to the area defined in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section and designated as the Small Mesh Northern Shrimp Fishery 
Exemption Area.
    (i) Requirements. (A) A vessel fishing in the GOM Scallop Dredge 
Fishery Exemption Area specified in paragraph (a)(10) of this section, 
may not fish for, possess on board, or land any species of fish other 
than Atlantic sea scallops.
    (B) The combined dredge width in use by or in possession on board 
vessels fishing in the GOM Scallop Dredge Fishery Exemption Area shall 
not exceed 10.5 ft (3.2 m) measured at the widest point in the bail of

    (C) The exemption does not apply to areas closed to meet the Mid-
coast closure fishery mortality reduction targets as specified in 
Sec. 648.81(g).
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (11) Nantucket Shoals Mussel and Sea Urchin Dredge Exemption Area. A 
vessel may fish with a dredge in the Nantucket Shoals Mussel and Sea 
Urchin Dredge Exemption Area, provided that any dredge on board the 
vessel does not exceed 8 ft (2.44 m) measured at the widest point in the 
bail of the dredge, and the vessel does not fish for, harvest, possess, 
or land any species of fish other than mussels and sea urchins. The area 
coordinates of the Nantucket Shoals Mussel and Sea Urchin Dredge 
Exemption Area are the same coordinates as those of the Nantucket Shoals 
Dogfish Fishery Exemption Area specified under paragraph (a)(9) of this 
section.
    (12) GOM/GB Monkfish Gillnet Exemption. A vessel may fish with 
gillnets in the GOM/GB Dogfish and Monkfish Gillnet Fishery Exemption 
Area when not under a NE multispecies DAS if the vessel complies with 
the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this section. The

    (f) Mesh measurements--(1) Gillnets. Beginning October 15, 1996, 
mesh size of gillnet gear shall be measured by lining up five 
consecutive knots perpendicular to the float line and, with a ruler or 
tape measure, measuring ten consecutive measures on the diamond, inside 
knot to inside knot. The mesh shall be the average of the measurements 
of ten consecutive measures.

[[Page 275]]

    (2) All other nets. With the exception of gillnets, mesh size shall 
be measured by a wedged-shaped gauge having a taper of 2 cm in 8 cm and 
a thickness of 2.3 mm, inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull 
of 5 kg.
    (i) Square-mesh measurement. Square mesh in the regulated portion of 
the net is measured by placing the net gauge along the diagonal line 
that connects the largest opening between opposite corners of the 
square. The square mesh size is the average of the measurements of 20 
consecutive adjacent meshes from the terminus forward along the long 
axis of the net. The square mesh is measured at least five meshes away 
from the lacings of the net.
    (ii) Diamond-mesh measurement. Diamond mesh in the regulated portion 
of the net is measured running parallel to the long axis of the net. The 
mesh size is the average of the measurements of any series of 20 
consecutive meshes. The mesh is measured at least five meshes away from 
the lacings of the net.
    (g) Restrictions on gear and methods of fishing--(1) Net obstruction 
or constriction. A fishing vessel shall not use any device or material, 
including, but not limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or 
chafing gear, on the top of a trawl net, except that one splitting strap 
and one bull rope (if present), consisting of line and rope no more than 
3 inches (7.62 cm) in diameter, may be used if such splitting strap and/
or bull rope does not constrict in any manner the top of the trawl net. 
``The top of the trawl net'' means the 50 percent of the net that (in a 
hypothetical situation) would not be in contact with the ocean bottom 
during a tow if the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the 
purpose of this paragraph (g)(1), head ropes are not considered part of 
the top of the trawl net.
    (2) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (i) A fishing vessel may not 
use any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in 
the top of the net, as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, if 
it obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (ii) A fishing vessel may not use a net capable of catching 
multispecies if the bars entering or exiting the knots twist around each 
other.
    (3) Pair trawl prohibition. No vessel may fish for NE multispecies 
while pair trawling, or possess or land NE multispecies that have been 
harvested by means of pair trawling.
    (h) Scallop vessels. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section, a scallop vessel that possesses a limited access scallop 
permit and either a multispecies combination vessel permit or a scallop 
multispecies possession limit permit, and that is fishing under a 
scallop DAS allocated under Sec. 648.53, may possess and land up to 300 
lb (136.1 kg) of regulated species, provided it has at least one 
standard tote on board, unless otherwise restricted by 
Sec. 648.86(a)(2).
    (2) Combination vessels fishing under a NE multispecies DAS are 
subject to the gear restrictions specified in Sec. 648.80 and may 
possess and land unlimited amounts of regulated species. Such vessels 
may simultaneously fish under a scallop DAS.
    (i) State waters winter flounder exemption. Any vessel issued a 
multispecies permit may fish for, possess, or land winter flounder while 
fishing with nets of mesh smaller than the minimum size specified in 
paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), and (c)(2) of this section, provided that:
    (1) The vessel has on board a certificate approved by the Regional 
Administrator and issued by the state agency authorizing the vessel's 
participation in the state's winter flounder fishing program and is in 
compliance with the applicable state laws pertaining to minimum mesh 
size for winter flounder.
    (2) Fishing is conducted exclusively in the waters of the state from 
which the certificate was obtained.
    (3) The state's winter flounder plan has been approved by the 
Commission as being in compliance with the Commission's winter flounder 
fishery management plan.
    (4) The state elects, by a letter to the Regional Administrator, to 
participate in the exemption program described by this section.
    (5) The vessel does not enter or transit the EEZ.
    (6) The vessel does not enter or transit the waters of another 
state, unless

[[Page 276]]

such other state is participating in the exemption program described by 
this section and the vessel is enrolled in that state's program.
    (7) The vessel, when not fishing under the DAS program, does not 
fish for, possess, or land more than 500 lb (226.8 kg) of winter 
flounder, and has at least one standard tote on board.
    (8) The vessel does not fish for, possess, or land any species of 
fish other than winter flounder and the exempted small mesh species 
specified under paragraphs (a)(3)(i), (a)(8)(iii), (b)(3), and (c)(3) of 
this section when fishing in the areas specified under paragraphs 
(a)(3), (a)(8), (b)(1), and (c)(1) of this section, respectively. 
Vessels fishing under this exemption in New York and Connecticut state 
waters may also possess and retain skate as incidental take in this 
fishery.
    (9) The vessel complies with all other applicable requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 648.82  Effort-control program for limited access vessels.

    (a) General. Except as provided in Sec. 648.17, a vessel issued a 
limited access multispecies permit may not fish for, possess, or land 
regulated species, except during a DAS as allocated under and in 
accordance with the applicable DAS program described in this section, 
unless otherwise provided elsewhere in this part.
    (1) End-of-year carry-over. With the exception of vessels that held 
a Confirmation of Permit History as described in Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(J) 
for the entire fishing year preceding the carry-over year, limited 
access vessels that have unused DAS on the last day of April of any 
year, may carry over a maximum of 10 DAS into the next year. DAS 
sanctioned vessels will be credited with unused DAS based on their DAS 
allocation minus total DAS sanctioned.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) DAS program--permit categories, allocations and initial 
assignments to categories. Beginning with the 1996 fishing year, all 
limited access multispecies permit holders shall be assigned to one of 
the following DAS permit categories according to the criteria specified. 
Permit holders may request a change in permit category for the 1996 
fishing year and all fishing years thereafter, as specified in 
Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2). Each fishing year shall begin on May 1 and 
extend through April 30 of the following year.
    (1) Individual DAS category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel fishing 
under the Individual DAS category shall be allocated 65 percent of its 
initial 1994 allocation baseline, as established under Amendment 5 to 
the NE Multispecies FMP, multiplied by the proration factor of 0.833 for 
the 1996 fishing year, unless a vessel qualifies for a restoration of 
DAS under paragraph (j) of this section, and 50 percent of its initial 
allocation baseline for the 1997 fishing year and beyond, as calculated 
under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Initial assignment. Any vessel issued a valid limited access 
multispecies Individual DAS permit as of July 1, 1996, except those that 
have been issued a gillnet permit, shall be initially assigned to the 
Individual DAS category.

[[Page 283]]

    (2) Fleet DAS category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel fishing under 
the Fleet DAS category shall be allocated 116 DAS (139 DAS multiplied by 
the proration factor of 0.833) for the 1996 fishing year, unless a 
vessel qualifies for a restoration of DAS under paragraph (j) of this 
section, and 88 DAS for the 1997 fishing year and beyond.
    (ii) Initial assignment. Any vessel issued a valid Fleet DAS permit, 
Gillnet permit, limited access Hook-Gear permit, or a vessel issued a 
Less than or equal to 45 ft (13.7 m) permit that is larger than 20 ft 
(6.1 m) in length as determined by its most recent permit application, 
as of July 1, 1996, shall be initially assigned to the Fleet DAS 
category.
    (3) Small vessel category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel qualified 
and electing to fish under the small vessel category may retain cod, 
haddock, and yellowtail flounder, combined up to 300 lb (136.1 kg) per 
trip without being subject to DAS restrictions. Such a vessel is not 
subject to a possession limit for other NE multispecies.
    (ii) Initial assignment. A vessel issued a valid limited access 
multispecies permit and fishing under the small vessel category (less 
than or equal to 45 ft (13.7 m)) permit as of July 1, 1996, and that is 
20 ft (6.1 m) or less in length as determined by the vessel's last 
application for a permit, shall be initially assigned to the small 
vessel category. Any other vessel may elect to switch into this 
category, as provided for in Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2), if such vessel 
meets or complies with the following:
    (A) The vessel is 30 ft (9.1 m) or less in length overall as 
determined by measuring along a horizontal line drawn from a 
perpendicular raised from the outside of the most forward portion of the 
stem of the vessel to a perpendicular raised from the after most portion 
of the stern.
    (B) If construction of the vessel was begun after May 1, 1994, the 
vessel must be constructed such that the quotient of the overall length 
divided by the beam is not less than 2.5.
    (C) Acceptable verification for vessels 20 ft (6.1 m) or less in 
length shall be USCG documentation or state registration papers. For 
vessels over 20 ft (6.1 m) in length, the measurement of length must be 
verified in writing by a qualified marine surveyor, or the builder, 
based on the vessel's construction plans, or by other means determined 
acceptable by the Regional Administrator. A copy of the verification 
must accompany an application for a multispecies permit.
    (D) Adjustments to the small vessel category requirements, including 
changes to the length requirement, if required to meet fishing mortality 
goals, may be made by the Regional Administrator following framework 
procedures of Sec. 648.90.
    (4) Hook-Gear category--(i) DAS allocation. Any vessel issued a 
valid limited access multispecies Hook-Gear permit shall be allocated 
116 DAS (139 DAS multiplied by the proration factor of 0.833) for the 
1996 fishing year and 88 DAS for the 1997 fishing year and beyond. A 
vessel fishing under this category in the DAS program must meet or 
comply with the following while fishing for, in possession of, or 
landing regulated species:
    (A) Vessels, and persons on such vessels, are prohibited from 
possessing gear other than hook gear on board the vessel.
    (B) Vessels, and persons on such vessels, are prohibited from 
fishing, setting, or hauling back, per day, or possessing on board the 
vessel, more than 4,500 rigged hooks. An unbaited hook and gangion that 
has not been secured to the ground line of the trawl on board a vessel 
is deemed to be a replacement hook and is not counted toward the 4,500-
hook limit. A ``snap-on'' hook is deemed to be a replacement hook if it 
is not rigged or baited.
    (ii) Initial assignment. No vessel shall be initially assigned to 
the Hook-Gear category. Any vessel that meets the qualifications 
specified in Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i) may apply for and obtain a permit to 
fish under this category.
    (5) Combination vessel category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel 
fishing under the Combination Vessel category shall be allocated 65 
percent of its initial 1994 allocation baseline, as established under 
Amendment 5 to the NE Multispecies FMP, multiplied by the proration 
factor of 0.833 for the 1996 fishing year, unless a vessel qualifies for 
a restoration of DAS under paragraph (j) of

[[Page 284]]

this section, and 50 percent of its initial allocation baseline for the 
1997 fishing year and beyond, as calculated under paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section.
    (ii) Initial assignment. A vessel issued a valid limited access 
multispecies permit qualified to fish as a combination vessel as of July 
1, 1996, shall be assigned to the combination vessel category.
    (6) Large Mesh Individual DAS category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel 
fishing under the Large Mesh Individual DAS category shall be allocated 
a DAS increase of 12 percent in year 1 and 36 percent in year 2 and 
beyond over the DAS allocations specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section (this includes the proration factor for 1996). To be eligible to 
fish under the Large Mesh Individual DAS category, a vessel, while 
fishing under this category, must fish with gillnet gear with a minimum 
size of 7-inch (17.78 cm) diamond mesh or with trawl gear with a minimum 
mesh size of 8-inch (20.32 cm) diamond mesh, for the entire year, as 
described under Sec. 648.80(a)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(ii).
    (ii) Initial assignment. No vessel shall be initially assigned to 
the large mesh individual DAS category. Any vessel that is initially 
assigned to the individual DAS, fleet DAS, or small vessel category may 
request and be granted a switch into this category as specified in 
Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2).
    (7) Large Mesh Fleet DAS category--(i) DAS allocation. A vessel 
fishing under the Large Mesh Fleet DAS category shall be allocated 129 
DAS (155 DAS multiplied by the proration factor of 0.833) for the 1996 
fishing year, unless a vessel qualifies for a restoration of DAS under 
paragraph (j) of this section, and 120 DAS for the 1997 fishing year, 
and beyond. To be eligible to fish under the Large Mesh Fleet DAS 
category, a vessel while fishing under this category must fish with 
gillnet gear with a minimum mesh size of 7-inch (17.78-cm) diamond mesh 
or trawl gear with a minimum mesh size of 8-inch (20.32-cm) diamond 
mesh, as described under Sec. 648.80(a)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(ii), and 
(c)(2)(ii).
    (ii) Initial assignment. No vessel shall be initially assigned to 
the large mesh fleet DAS category. Any vessel that is initially assigned 
to the individual DAS, fleet DAS, or small vessel category may request 
and be granted a switch into this category as specified in 
Sec. 648.4(a)(1)(i)(I)(2).
    (c) 1996 DAS appeals. (1) Previously exempted vessels. A vessel that 
was issued a valid 1995 limited access multispecies permit, and that has 
been fishing under the small vessel (less than or equal to 45 ft (13.7 
m)), hook-gear, or gillnet categories, is eligible to appeal its 
allocation of DAS, if it has not previously done so, as described under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Each vessel's initial allocation of 
DAS will be considered to be 176 DAS for purposes of this appeal (i.e., 
the fleet DAS category baseline prior to the 1996-1997 reductions).
    (2) Exempted gillnet vessels that held an individual DAS permit. A 
vessel that was issued a valid 1995 limited access multispecies permit 
and that has been fishing under both the gillnet and individual DAS 
categories, is eligible to appeal its allocation of gillnet DAS, as 
described under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Each vessel's initial 
allocation of DAS will be considered to be 176 DAS for purposes of this 
appeal (i.e., the fleet DAS category baseline prior to the 1996-1997 
reductions).
    (d) Individual DAS allocations--(1) Calculation of a vessel's 
individual DAS. The DAS assigned to a vessel for purposes of determining 
that vessel's annual allocation under the individual DAS program is 
calculated as follows:
    (i) Count the total number of the vessel's NE multispecies DAS for 
the years 1988, 1989, and 1990. NE multispecies DAS are deemed to be the 
total number of days the vessel was absent from port for a trip where 
greater than 10 percent of the vessel's total landings were comprised of 
regulated species, minus any days for such trips in which a scallop 
dredge was used;
    (ii) Exclude the year of least NE multispecies DAS; and
    (iii) If 2 years of multispecies DAS are remaining, average those 
years' DAS; or
    (iv) If only 1 year remains, use that year's DAS.
    (2) Appeal of DAS allocation--(i) Initial allocations of individual 
DAS to those vessels authorized to appeal under paragraph (c) of this 
section may

[[Page 285]]

be appealed to the Regional Administrator if a request to appeal is 
received by the Regional Administrator no later than August 31, 1996, or 
30 days after the initial allocation is made, whichever is later. Any 
such appeal must be in writing and be based on one or more of the 
following grounds:
    (A) The information used by the Regional Administrator was based on 
mistaken or incorrect data.
    (B) The applicant was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her 
control from meeting relevant criteria.
    (C) The applicant has new or additional information.
    (ii) The Regional Administrator will appoint a designee who will 
make an initial decision on the written appeal.
    (iii) If the applicant is not satisfied with the initial decision, 
the applicant may request that the appeal be presented at a hearing 
before an officer appointed by the Regional Administrator.
    (iv) The hearing officer shall present his/her findings to the 
Regional Administrator and the Regional Administrator will make a 
decision on the appeal. The Regional Administrator's decision on this 
appeal is the final administrative decision of the Department of 
Commerce.
    (3) Status of vessels pending appeal of DAS allocations. While a 
vessel's individual DAS allocation is under appeal, the vessel may fish 
under the fleet DAS category until the Regional Administrator has made a 
final determination on the appeal. Any DAS spent fishing for regulated 
species by a vessel while that vessel's initial DAS allocation is under 
appeal, shall be counted against any DAS allocation that the vessel may 
ultimately receive.
    (e) Accrual of DAS. Same as Sec. 648.53(e).
    (f) Good Samaritan credit. Same as Sec. 648.53(f).
    (g) Spawning season restrictions. A vessel issued a valid Small 
Vessel permit under paragraph (b)(3) of this section may not fish for, 
possess, or land regulated species from March 1 through March 20 of each 
year. Any other vessel issued a limited access multispecies permit must 
declare out and be out of the NE multispecies DAS program, as described 
in paragraph (b) of this section, for a 20-day period between March 1 
and May 31 of each calendar year using the notification requirements 
specified in Sec. 648.10. A vessel fishing under a Day gillnet category 
designation is prohibited from fishing with gillnet gear capable of 
catching multispecies during its declared 20-day spawning block, unless 
the vessel is fishing in an exempted fishery as described in 
Sec. 648.80. If a vessel owner has not declared and been out for a 20-
day period between March 1 and May 31 of each calendar year on or before 
May 12 of each year, the vessel is prohibited from fishing for, 
possessing or landing any regulated species or non-exempt species during 
the period May 12 through May 31, inclusive. If a vessel has taken a 
spawning season 20-day block out of the NE multispecies DAS program 
during May 1996, it is not required to take a 20-day block out of the NE 
multispecies DAS program in 1997. Beginning January 1, 1998, any such 
vessel must comply with the spawning season restriction specified in 
this part.
    (h) Declaring DAS and blocks of time out. A vessel's owner or 
authorized representative shall notify the Regional Administrator of a 
vessel's participation in the DAS program, declaration of its 120 days 
out of the non-exempt gillnet fishery if designated as a Day gillnet 
category vessel, and declaration of its 20-day period out of the NE 
multispecies DAS program, using the notification requirements specified 
in Sec. 648.10.
    (i) Adjustments in annual DAS allocations. Adjustments in annual DAS 
allocations, if required to meet fishing mortality goals, may be made by 
the Regional Administrator following the framework procedures of 
Sec. 648.90.
    (j) Restoration of unused DAS. Vessels that held valid 1996 
Amendment 5 NE multispecies permits in the Individual, Fleet or 
Combination Vessel categories are eligible for restoration of unused DAS 
if DAS fished during May and June 1996 was less than one-sixth of their 
1996 Amendment 7 allocation. Restoration of DAS will be based on the NE 
multispecies permit category held on August 16, 1996. These vessels will 
be automatically credited with DAS equal to the difference between the 
proration reduction and their DAS

[[Page 286]]

fished during May and June 1996, as recorded in the NMFS call-in system 
specified at Sec. 648.10(c) (or on other verifiable evidence of days 
spent fishing for multispecies). If the number of DAS fished during this 
time period exceeded the proration reduction amount, those days will not 
be subtracted from a vessel's 1996 allocation.
    (k) Gillnet restrictions. Vessels issued a limited access NE 
multispecies permit fishing under a multispecies DAS with gillnet gear 
must obtain an annual designation as either a Day gillnet or Trip 
gillnet vessel as described in Sec. 648.4(c)(2)(iii)(B).
    (1) Day gillnet vessels. A Day gillnet vessel fishing with gillnet 
gear under a multispecies DAS is not required to remove gillnet gear 
from the water upon returning to the dock and calling-out of the DAS 
program, provided:
    (i) Number and size of nets. Vessels may not fish with, haul, 
possess, or deploy more than 80 roundfish gillnets or 160 flatfish 
gillnets. Vessels may fish any combination of roundfish and flatfish 
gillnets, up to 160 nets, provided that the number of roundfish and 
flatfish gillnets does not exceed the limitations specified in this 
subparagraph, and the nets are tagged in accordance with paragraph 
(k)(1)(ii) of this section. Nets may not be longer than 300 ft (91.44 
m), or 50 fathoms, in length.
    (ii) Tagging requirements. Beginning June 1, 1997, when under a NE 
multispecies DAS, all roundfish gillnets fished, hauled, possessed, or 
deployed must have two tags per net, with one tag secured to each bridle 
of every net within a string of nets and all flatfish gillnets fished, 
hauled, possessed, or deployed must have one tag per net, with one tag 
secured to every other bridle of every net within a string of nets. Tags 
must be obtained as described in Sec. 648.4(c)(2)(iii), and vessels must 
have on board written confirmation issued by the Regional Administrator, 
indicating that the vessel is a Day gillnet vessel. The vessel operator 
must produce all net tags upon request by an authorized officer.
    (iii) All gillnet gear is brought to port prior to the vessel 
fishing in an exempted fishery.
    (iv) Declaration of time out of the gillnet fishery. (A) During each 
fishing year, vessels must declare, and take, a total of 120 days out of 
the non-exempt gillnet fishery. Each period of time declared and taken 
must be a minimum of 7 consecutive days. At least 21 days of this time 
must be taken between June 1 and September 30 of each fishing year. The 
spawning season time out period required by Sec. 648.82(g) will be 
credited toward the 120 days time out of the non-exempt gillnet fishery. 
If a vessel owner has not declared and taken, any or all of the 
remaining periods of time required by the last possible date to meet 
these requirements, the vessel is prohibited from fishing for, 
possessing, or landing regulated multispecies or non-exempt species 
harvested with gillnet gear, and from having gillnet gear on board the 
vessel that is not stowed in accordance with Sec. 648.81(e)(4), while 
fishing under a multispecies DAS, from that date through the end of the 
period between June 1 and September 30, or through the end of the 
fishing year, as applicable.
    (B) Vessels shall declare their periods of required time out 
following the notification procedures specified in Sec. 648.10(f)(2).
    (C) During each period of time declared out, a vessel is prohibited 
from fishing with non-exempted gillnet gear. However, the vessel may 
fish in an exempted fishery as described in Sec. 648.80, or it may fish 
under a multispecies DAS provided it fishes with gear other than non-
exempted gillnet gear.
    (v) Method of counting DAS. Day gillnet vessels fishing with gillnet 
gear under a multispecies DAS will accrue 15 hours DAS for each trip 
greater than 3 hours but less than or equal to 15 hours. Such vessels 
will accrue actual DAS time at sea for trips less than or equal to 3 
hours or greater than 15 hours.
    (vi) Lost tags. Vessel owners or operators are required to report 
lost, destroyed, and missing tag numbers as soon as feasible after tags 
have been discovered lost, destroyed or missing, by letter or fax to the 
Regional Administrator.
    (vii) Replacement tags. Vessel owners or operators seeking 
replacement of lost, destroyed, or missing tags must request replacement 
of tags by letter

[[Page 287]]

or fax to the Regional Administrator. A check for the cost of the 
replacement tags must be received before tags will be re-issued.
    (2) Trip gillnet vessels. When fishing under a multispecies DAS, a 
Trip gillnet vessel is required to remove all gillnet gear from the 
water before calling-out of a multispecies DAS under Sec. 648.10(c)(3). 
When not fishing under a multispecies DAS, Trip gillnet vessels may fish 
in an exempted fishery with gillnet gear as authorized under the 
exemptions described in Sec. 648.80. Vessels electing to fish under the 
Trip gillnet designation must have on board written confirmation issued 
by the Regional Administrator, that the vessel is a Trip gillnet vessel.

Sec. 648.83  Minimum fish sizes.

    (a) Minimum fish sizes. (1) Minimum fish sizes for recreational 
vessels and charter/party vessels that are not fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS are specified in Sec. 648.89. Except as provided in 
Sec. 648.17, all other vessels are subject to the following minimum fish 
sizes (TL):

                         Minimum Fish Sizes (TL)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Species                           Size (Inches)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cod.....................................................    19 (48.3 cm)
Haddock.................................................    19 (48.3 cm)
Pollock.................................................    19 (48.3 cm)
Witch flounder (gray sole)..............................    14 (35.6 cm)
Yellowtail flounder.....................................    13 (33.0 cm)
American plaice (dab)...................................    14 (35.6 cm)
Winter flounder (blackback).............................   12 (30.48 cm)
Redfish.................................................     9 (22.9 cm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The minimum fish size applies to the whole fish or to any part 
of a fish while possessed on board a vessel, except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, and to whole fish only, after landing. 
Fish or parts of fish must have skin on while possessed on board a 
vessel and at the time of landing in order to meet minimum size 
requirements. ``Skin on'' means the entire portion of the skin normally 
attached to the portion of the fish or fish parts possessed.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) Each person aboard a vessel issued a 
multispecies limited access permit and fishing under the DAS program may 
possess up to 25 lb (11.3 kg) of fillets that measure less than the 
minimum size if such fillets are from legal-sized fish and are not 
offered or intended for sale, trade, or barter.
    (2) Recreational, party, and charter vessels may possess fillets 
less than the minimum size specified, if the fillets are taken from 
legal-sized fish and are not offered or intended for sale, trade or 
barter.
    (3) Vessels fishing exclusively with pot gear may possess 
multispecies frames used, or to be used, as bait that measure less than 
the minimum fish size, if there is a receipt for purchase of those 
frames on board the vessel.
    (c) Adjustments. (1) At any time when information is available, the 
NEFMC will review the best available mesh selectivity information to 
determine the appropriate minimum size for the species listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, except winter flounder, according to the 
length at which 25 percent of the regulated species would be retained by 
the applicable minimum mesh size.
    (2) Upon determination of the appropriate minimum sizes, the NEFMC 
shall propose the minimum fish sizes to be implemented following the 
procedures specified in Sec. 648.90.
    (3) Additional adjustments or changes to the minimum fish sizes 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and exemptions as specified 
in paragraph (b) of this section, may be made at any time after 
implementation of the final rule as specified under Sec. 648.90.

Sec. 648.84  Gear-marking requirements and gear restrictions.

    (a) Bottom-tending fixed gear, including, but not limited to 
gillnets and longlines, designed for, capable of, or fishing for NE 
multispecies must have the name of the owner or vessel, or the official 
number of that vessel permanently affixed to any buoys, gillnets, 
longlines, or other appropriate gear so that the name of the owner or 
vessel or

[[Page 288]]

official number of the vessel is visible on the surface of the water.
    (b) Bottom-tending fixed gear, including, but not limited to 
gillnets or longline gear, must be marked so that the westernmost end 
(measuring the half compass circle from magnetic south through west to, 
and including, north) of the gear displays a standard 12-inch (30.5-cm) 
tetrahedral corner radar reflector and a pennant positioned on a staff 
at least 6 ft (1.8 m) above the buoy. The easternmost end (meaning the 
half compass circle from magnetic north through east to, and including, 
south) of the gear need display only the standard 12-inch (30.5-cm) 
tetrahedral radar reflector positioned in the same way.
    (c) Continuous gillnets must not exceed 6,600 ft (2,011.7 m) between 
the end buoys.
    (d) In the GOM/GB regulated mesh area specified in Sec. 648.80(a), 
gillnet gear set in an irregular pattern or in any way that deviates 
more than 30 deg. from the original course of the set must be marked at 
the extremity of the deviation with an additional marker, which must 
display two or more visible streamers and may either be attached to or 
independent of the gear.

Sec. 648.85  Flexible Area Action System.

    (a) The Chair of the Multispecies Oversight Committee, upon learning 
of the presence of discard problems associated with large concentrations 
of juvenile, sublegal, or spawning multispecies, shall determine if the 
situation warrants further investigation and possible action. In making 
this determination, the Committee Chair shall consider the amount of 
discard of regulated species, the species targeted, the number and types 
of vessels operating in the area, the location and size of the area, and 
the resource condition of the impacted species. If he/she determines it 
is necessary, the Committee Chair will request the Regional 
Administrator to initiate a fact finding investigation to verify the 
situation and publish notification in the Federal Register requesting 
public comments in accordance with the procedures therefor in Amendment 
3 to the NE Multispecies FMP.
    (b) After examining the facts, the Regional Administrator shall, 
within the deadlines specified in Amendment 3, provide the technical 
analysis required by Amendment 3.
    (c) The NEFMC shall prepare an economic impact analysis of the 
potential management options under consideration within the deadlines 
specified in Amendment 3.
    (d) Copies of the analysis and reports prepared by the Regional 
Administrator and the NEFMC shall be made available for public review at 
the NEFMC's office and the Committee shall hold a meeting/public 
hearing, at which time it shall review the analysis and reports and 
request public comments. Upon review of all available sources of 
information, the Committee shall determine what course of action is 
warranted by the facts and make a recommendation, consistent with the 
provisions of Amendment 3 to the Regional Administrator.
    (e) By the deadline set in Amendment 3 the Regional Administrator 
shall either accept or reject the Committee's recommendation. If the 
recommended action is consistent with the record established by the 
fact-finding report, impact analysis, and comments received at the 
public hearing, he/she shall accept the Committee's recommendation and 
implement it through notification in the Federal Register and by notice 
sent to all vessel owners holding multispecies permits. The Regional 
Administrator shall also use other appropriate media, including, but not 
limited to, mailings to the news media, fishing industry associations 
and radio broadcasts, to disseminate information on the action to be 
implemented.
    (f) Once implemented, the Regional Administrator shall monitor the 
affected area to determine if the action is still warranted. If the 
Regional Administrator determines that the circumstances under which the 
action was taken, based on the Regional Administrator's report, the 
NEFMC's report, and the public comments, are no longer in existence, he/
she shall terminate the action by notification in the Federal Register.
    (g) Actions taken under this section will ordinarily become 
effective upon

[[Page 289]]

the date of filing with the Office of the Federal Register. The Regional 
Administrator may determine that facts warrant a delayed effective date.

Sec. 648.86  Possession restrictions.

    Except as provided in Sec. 648.17, the following possession 
restrictions apply:
    (a) Haddock--(1) NE multispecies DAS vessels. (i) Except as provided 
in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a vessel that is 
fishing under a NE multispecies DAS may land or possess on board up to 
1,000 lb (453.6 kg) of haddock provided it has at least one standard 
tote on board. Haddock on board a vessel subject to this possession 
limit must be separated from other species of fish and stored so as to 
be readily available for inspection.
    (ii) During the period May 1, 1998, through August 31, 1998, a 
vessel may land up to 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) of haddock per DAS fished, or 
any part of a DAS fished, up to 10,000 lb (4,536.0 kg) per trip. Haddock 
on board a vessel subject to this landing limit must be separated from 
other species of fish and stored so as to be readily available for 
inspection.
    (iii) Beginning September 1, 1998, through April 30, 1999, unless 
otherwise specified in this paragraph, a vessel may land up to 3,000 lb 
(1,360.8 kg) of haddock per DAS fished, or any part of a DAS fished, up 
to 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) per trip. When the Regional Administrator 
projects that 7.9 million lb (3,598 mt) will be harvested, NMFS will 
publish a notification in the Federal Register that on a specific date 
the limit will be reduced to either the 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) per trip 
possession limit restriction specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section, or the 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) per DAS fished, 10,000 lb (4,536.0 
kg) maximum, landing limit restriction specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section, depending on the risk of exceeding the target TAC. 
Haddock on board a vessel subject to this landing limit must be 
separated from other species of fish and stored so as to be readily 
available for inspection.
    (2) Scallop dredge vessels. (i) No person owning or operating a 
scallop dredge vessel issued a multispecies permit may land haddock 
from, or possess haddock on board, a scallop dredge vessel, from January 
1 through June 30.
    (ii) No person owning or operating a scallop dredge vessel without a 
multispecies permit may possess haddock in, or harvested from, the EEZ, 
from January 1 through June 30.
    (iii) From July 1 through December 31, scallop dredge vessels or 
persons owning or operating a scallop dredge vessel that is fishing 
under a scallop DAS allocated under Sec. 648.53 may land or possess on 
board up to 300 lb (136.1 kg) of haddock provided that the vessel has at 
least one standard tote on board. This restriction does not apply to 
vessels issued NE multispecies Combination Vessel permits that are 
fishing under a multispecies DAS. Haddock on board a vessel subject to 
this possession limit must be separated from other species of fish and 
stored so as to be readily available for inspection.
    (b) Cod--(1) Landing limit from May 1, 1998, through April 30, 2001. 
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) of this 
section, and subject to the cod landing limit call-in provision 
specified at Sec. 648.10(f)(3)(i), a vessel fishing under a NE 
multispecies DAS may land up to 700 lb (317.5 kg) of cod per DAS, or any 
part of a DAS, unless otherwise specified in this paragraph. Vessels 
calling-out of the multispecies DAS program under Sec. 648.10(c)(3) that 
have utilized part of a DAS (less than 24 hours) may land up to an 
additional 700 lb (317.5 kg) of cod for that part of a DAS; however, 
such vessels may not end any subsequent trip with cod on board within 
the 24-hour period following the beginning of the part of the DAS 
utilized (e.g., a vessel that has called-in to the multispecies DAS 
program at 3 p.m. on a Monday and ends its trip the next day (Tuesday) 
at 4 p.m. (accruing a total of 25 hours) may legally land up to 1,400 lb 
(635.0 kg) of cod on such a trip, but the vessel may not end any 
subsequent trip with cod on board until after 3 p.m. on the following 
day (Wednesday)). When the Regional Administrator projects that 892 mt 
will be harvested, NMFS will publish a notification in the Federal 
Register that on a specific date the limit will be reduced to a 
specified amount between 400 lb (181.4 kg) and 700 lb (317.5 kg) per DAS 
depending on the

[[Page 290]]

risk of exceeding the target TAC. Cod on board a vessel subject to this 
landing limit must be separated from other species of fish and stored so 
as to be readily available for inspection.
    (ii) A vessel subject to the cod landing limit restrictions 
described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(3) of this section, and 
subject to the cod landing limit call-in provision specified at 
Sec. 648.10(f)(3)(ii), may come into port with and offload cod in excess 
of the landing limit as determined by the number of DAS elapsed since 
the vessel called into the DAS program, provided that:
    (A) The vessel operator does not call-out of the DAS program as 
described under Sec. 648.10(c)(3) and does not depart from a dock or 
mooring in port to engage in fishing, unless transiting as allowed in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, until sufficient time has elapsed to 
account for and justify the amount of cod harvested at the time of 
offloading regardless of whether all of the cod on board is offloaded 
(e.g., a vessel subject to the landing limit restriction, described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, that has called-in to the 
multispecies DAS program at 3 p.m. on Monday and that fishes and comes 
back into port at 4 p.m. on Wednesday of that same week with 2,800 lb 
(1,270.1 kg) of cod to offloads some or all of its catch, cannot call-
out of the DAS program or leave port until 3:01 p.m. the next day, 
Thursday (i.e., 3 days plus one minute)); and
    (B) Upon returning to port and before offloading, the vessel 
operator notifies the Regional Administrator (see Table 1 to 
Sec. 600.502 of this chapter for the Regional Administrator's address) 
and provides the following information: Vessel name and permit number, 
owner and caller name, DAS confirmation number, phone number, and the 
hail weight of cod on board and the amount of cod to be offloaded, if 
any. A vessel that has not exceeded the landing limit and is offloading 
and ending its trip by calling out of the multispecies DAS program does 
not have to report under this call-in system.
    (iii) A vessel that has not exceeded the cod landing limit 
restrictions described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and that 
is offloading some or all of its catch without calling out of the 
multispecies DAS program under Sec. 648.10(c)(3), is subject to the 
call-in requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section.
    (2) Exemption. A vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS is 
exempt from the landing limit described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section when fishing south of a line beginning at the Cape Cod, MA 
coastline at 42 deg.00' N. lat. and running eastward along 42 deg.00' N. 
lat. until it intersects with 69 deg.30' W. long., then northward along 
69 deg.30' W. long. until it intersects with 42 deg.20' N. lat., then 
eastward along 42 deg.20' N. lat. until it intersects with 67 deg.20' W. 
long., then northward along 67 deg.20' W. long. until it intersects with 
the U.S.-Canada maritime boundary, provided that it does not fish north 
of this exemption area for a minimum of 30 consecutive days (when 
fishing under the multispecies DAS program), and has on board an 
authorization letter issued by the Regional Administrator. Vessels 
exempt from the landing limit requirement may transit the GOM/GB 
Regulated Mesh Area north of this exemption area, provided that their 
gear is stowed in accordance with one of the provisions of 
Sec. 648.81(e).
    (3) Landing limit beginning May 1, 2001. (i) Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) of this section, and subject to the cod 
landing limit call-in provision specified at Sec. 648.10(f)(3)(i), a 
vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS may land up to 1,000 lb 
(453.6 kg) of cod per DAS, or any part of a DAS, for each of the first 4 
DAS of a trip, and may land up to 1,500 lb (680.4 kg) of cod per DAS for 
each DAS, or any part of a DAS, in excess of 4 consecutive DAS. Vessels 
calling-out of the multispecies DAS program under Sec. 648.10(c)(3) that 
have utilized part of a DAS (less than 24 hours) may land up to an 
additional 1,000 lb (453.6 kg), or 1,500 lb (680.4 kg) if applicable, of 
cod for that part of a DAS; however, such vessels may not end any 
subsequent trip with cod on board within the 24-hour period following 
the beginning of the part of the DAS utilized (e.g., a vessel that has 
called-in to the multispecies DAS program at 3 p.m. on a Monday and ends 
its trip the next day (Tuesday) at 4 p.m. (accruing a total of 25 hours) 
may

[[Page 291]]

legally land up to 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) of cod on such a trip, but the 
vessel may not end any subsequent trip with cod on board until after 3 
p.m. on the following day (Wednesday)). Cod on board a vessel subject to 
this landing limit must be separated from other species of fish and 
stored so as to be readily available for inspection.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (4) Transiting. A vessel that has exceeded the cod landing limit as 
specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section and is, 
therefore, subject to remain in port for the period of time described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, may transit to another port 
during this time, provided that the vessel operator notifies the 
Regional Administrator (see Table 1 to Sec. 600.502) either at the time 
the vessel reports its hailed weight of cod or at a later time prior to 
transiting, and provides the following information: Vessel name and 
permit number, destination port, time of departure, and estimated time 
of arrival. A vessel transiting under this provision must stow its gear 
in accordance with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.81(e), and 
may not have any fish on board the vessel.
    (c) Other possession restrictions. Vessels are subject to any other 
applicable possession limit restrictions of this part.

    (c) Framework adjustment. (1) At least annually, the Regional 
Administrator will provide the NEFMC with the best available information 
on the status of Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise, including estimates of 
abundance and estimates of bycatch in the sink gillnet fishery. Within 
60 days of receipt of that information, the NEFMC's HPRT shall complete 
a review of the data, assess the adequacy of existing regulations, 
evaluate the impacts of other measures that reduce harbor porpoise take 
and, if necessary, recommend additional measures in light of the NEFMC's 
harbor porpoise mortality reduction goals. In addition, the HPRT shall 
make a determination on whether other conservation issues exist that 
require a management response to meet the goals and objectives outlined 
in the NE Multispecies FMP. The HPRT shall report its findings and 
recommendations to the NEFMC.
    (2) After receiving and reviewing the HPRT's findings and 
recommendations, the NEFMC shall determine whether adjustments or 
additional management measures are necessary to meet the goals and 
objectives of the NE Multispecies FMP. If the NEFMC determines that 
adjustments or additional management measures are necessary, or at any 
other time in consultation with the HPRT, it shall develop and analyze 
appropriate management actions over the span of at least two NEFMC 
meetings.
    (3) The NEFMC may request, at any time, that the HPRT review and 
make recommendations on any harbor porpoise take reduction measures or 
develop additional take reduction proposals.
    (4) The NEFMC shall provide the public with advance notice of the 
availability of the proposals, appropriate rationale, economic and 
biological analyses, and opportunity to comment on them prior to and at 
the second NEFMC meeting. The NEFMC's recommendation on adjustments or 
additions to management measures must come from one or more of the 
categories specified under Sec. 648.90(b)(1).
    (5) If the NEFMC recommends that the management measures should be 
issued as a final rule, the NEFMC must consider at least the factors 
specified in Sec. 648.90(b)(2).
    (6) The Regional Administrator may accept, reject, or with NEFMC 
approval, modify the NEFMC's recommendation, including the NEFMC's 
recommendation to issue a final rule, as specified under 
Sec. 648.90(b)(3).

Sec. 648.89  Recreational and charter/party restrictions.

    (a) Recreational gear restrictions. Persons aboard charter or party 
vessels permitted under this part and not fishing under the DAS program, 
and recreational fishing vessels in the EEZ, are prohibited from fishing 
with more than two hooks per line and one line per angler and must stow 
all other fishing gear on board the vessel as specified under 
Secs. 648.23(b) and 648.81(e) (2), (3), and (4).
    (b) Recreational minimum fish sizes--(1) Minimum fish sizes. Persons

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Exception. Vessels may possess fillets less than the minimum 
size specified, if the fillets are taken from legal-sized fish and are 
not offered or intended for sale, trade or barter.
    (c) Possession restrictions. Each person on a recreational vessel 
may not possess more than 10 cod and/or haddock, combined, in or 
harvested from the EEZ.
    (1) For purposes of counting fish, fillets will be converted to 
whole fish at the place of landing by dividing fillet number by two. If 
fish are filleted into a single (butterfly) fillet, such fillet shall be 
deemed to be from one whole fish.
    (2) Cod and haddock harvested by recreational vessels with more than 
one person aboard may be pooled in one or more containers. Compliance 
with the possession limit will be determined by dividing the number of 
fish on board by the number of persons aboard. If there is a violation 
of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying more than one person, 
the violation shall be deemed to have been committed by the owner and 
operator.
    (3) Cod and haddock must be stored so as to be readily available for 
inspection.
    (d) Restrictions on sale. It is unlawful to sell, barter, trade, or 
otherwise transfer for a commercial purpose, or to attempt to sell, 
barter, trade, or otherwise transfer for a commercial purpose, NE 
multispecies caught or landed by charter or party vessels permitted 
under this part not fishing under a DAS or a recreational fishing 
vessels fishing in the EEZ.


<R05>
Sec. 648.90  Framework specifications.

    (a) Annual review. The Multispecies Monitoring Committee (MSMC) 
shall meet on or before November 15 of each year to develop target TACs 
for the upcoming fishing year and options for NEFMC consideration on any 
changes, adjustment or additions to DAS allocations, closed areas, or 
other measures necessary to achieve the NE Multispecies FMP goals and 
objectives.
    (1) The MSMC shall review available data pertaining to: Catch and 
landings, DAS and other measures of fishing effort, survey results, 
stock status, current estimates of fishing mortality, and any other 
relevant information.
    (2) Based on this review, the MSMC shall recommend target TACs and 
develop options necessary to achieve the FMP goals and objectives, which 
may include a preferred option. The MSMC must demonstrate through 
analysis and documentation that the options it develops are expected to 
meet the NE Multispecies FMP goals and objectives. The MSMC may review 
the performance of different user groups or fleet sectors in developing 
options. The range of options developed by the

[[Page 295]]

MSMC may include any of the management measures in the NE Multispecies 
FMP, including, but not limited to: Annual target TACs, which must be 
based on the projected fishing mortality levels required to meet the 
goals and objectives outlined in the NE Multispecies FMP for the 10 
regulated species; DAS changes; possession limits; gear restrictions; 
closed areas; permitting restrictions; minimum fish sizes; recreational 
fishing measures; and any other management measures currently included 
in the NE Multispecies FMP.
    (3) The NEFMC shall review the recommended target TACs and all of 
the options developed by the MSMC and other relevant information, 
consider public comment, and develop a recommendation to meet the NE 
Multispecies FMP objective that is consistent with the other applicable 
law. If the NEFMC does not submit a recommendation that meets the NE 
Multispecies FMP objectives and is consistent with other applicable law, 
the Regional Administrator may adopt any option developed by the MSMC, 
unless rejected by the NEFMC, as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this 
section, provided the option meets the NE Multispecies FMP objective and 
is consistent with other applicable law.
    (4) Based on this review, the NEFMC shall submit a recommendation to 
the Regional Administrator of any changes, adjustments or additions to 
DAS allocations, closed areas or other measures necessary to achieve the 
NE Multispecies FMP's goals and objectives. Included in the NEFMC's 
recommendation will be supporting documents, as appropriate, concerning 
the environmental and economic impacts of the proposed action and the 
other options considered by the NEFMC.
    (5) If the NEFMC submits, on or before January 7, a recommendation 
to the Regional Administrator after one NEFMC meeting, and the Regional 
Administrator concurs with the recommendation, the Regional 
Administrator shall publish the NEFMC's recommendation in the Federal 
Register as a proposed rule. The Federal Register notification of the 
proposed action will provide a 30-day public comment period. The NEFMC 
may instead submit its recommendation on or before February 1, if it 
chooses to follow the framework process outlined in paragraph (b) of 
this section and requests that the Regional Administrator publish the 
recommendation as a final rule. If the Regional Administrator concurs 
that the NEFMC's recommendation meets the NE Multispecies FMP objective 
and is consistent with other applicable law, and determines that the 
recommended management measures should be published as a final rule, the 
action will be published as a final rule in the Federal Register. If the 
Regional Administrator concurs that the recommendation meets the FMP 
objective and is consistent with other applicable law and determines 
that a proposed rule is warranted, and, as a result, the effective date 
of a final rule falls after the start of the fishing year on May 1, 
fishing may continue. However, DAS used by a vessel on or after May 1 
will be counted against any DAS allocation the vessel ultimately 
receives for that year.
    (6) If the Regional Administrator concurs in the NEFMC's 
recommendation, a final rule shall be published in the Federal Register 
on or about April 1 of each year, with the exception noted in paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section. If the NEFMC fails to submit a recommendation to 
the Regional Administrator by February 1 that meets the FMP goals and 
objectives, the Regional Administrator may publish as a proposed rule 
one of the options reviewed and not rejected by the NEFMC, provided that 
the option meets the FMP objective and is consistent with other 
applicable law. If, after considering public comment, the Regional 
Administrator decides to approve the option published as a proposed 
rule, the action will be published as a final rule in the Federal 
Register.
    (b) Within season management action. The Council may, at any time, 
initiate action to add or adjust management measures if it finds that 
action is necessary to meet or be consistent with the goals and 
objectives of the Northeast Multispecies FMP or to address gear 
conflicts as defined under Sec. 600.10 of this chapter.
    (1) Adjustment process. After a management action has been 
initiated, the

[[Page 296]]

Council shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions over 
the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council shall provide the 
public with advance notice of the availability of both the proposals and 
the analysis and opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the 
second Council meeting. The Council's recommendation on adjustments or 
additions to management measures, other than to address gear conflicts, 
must come from one or more of the following categories: DAS changes, 
effort monitoring, data reporting, possession limits, gear restrictions, 
closed areas, permitting restrictions, crew limits, minimum fish sizes, 
onboard observers, minimum hook size and hook style, the use of 
crucifiers in the hook-gear fishery, fleet sector shares, recreational 
fishing measures, area closures and other appropriate measures to 
mitigate marine mammal entanglements and interactions, and any other 
management measures currently included in the FMP.
    (2) Adjustment process for gear conflicts. The Council may develop a 
recommendation on measures to address gear conflict as defined under 50 
CFR 600.10, in accordance with the procedure specified in Sec. 648.55(d) 
and (e).
    (3) NEFMC recommendation. After developing management actions and 
receiving public testimony, the NEFMC shall make a recommendation to the 
Regional Administrator. The NEFMC's recommendation must include 
supporting rationale and, if management measures are recommended, an 
analysis of impacts and a recommendation to the Regional Administrator 
on whether to issue the management measures as a final rule. If the 
NEFMC recommends that the management measures should be issued as a 
final rule, the NEFMC must consider at least the following factors and 
provide support and analysis for each factor considered:
    (i) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season.
    (ii) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the NEFMC's recommended management measures.
    (iii) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or 
to impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts.
    (iv) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted following their implementation as a final rule.
    (4) Regional Administrator action. If the NEFMC's recommendation 
includes adjustments or additions to management measures and, after 
reviewing the NEFMC's recommendation and supporting information:
    (i) If the Regional Administrator concurs with the NEFMC's 
recommended management measures and determines that the recommended 
management measures should be issued as a final rule based on the 
factors specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the measures will 
be issued as a final rule in the Federal Register.
    (ii) If the Regional Administrator concurs with the NEFMC's 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, the measures will be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if the Regional Administrator concurs with the NEFMC 
recommendation, the measures will be issued as a final rule in the 
Federal Register.
    (iii) If the Regional Administrator does not concur, the NEFMC will 
be notified in writing of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (c) Emergency action. Nothing in this section is meant to derogate 
from the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under 
section 305(e) of the Magnuson Act.

    Subpart G--Management Measures for the Summer Flounder Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 648.100  Catch quotas and other restrictions.

    (a) Annual review. The Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee shall 
review the following data on or before August 15 of each year to 
determine the allowable levels of fishing and other restrictions 
necessary to achieve a fishing mortality rate (F) of 0.30 in 1997, and 
the F that produces the maximum yield per recruit (F<INF>max</INF>) in 
1998 and thereafter, provided the allowable levels of fishing in 1997 
may not exceed 18,518,830 lb (8,400 mt), unless such fishing levels have 
an associated F of F<INF>max</INF>: Commercial and recreational catch 
data; current estimates of fishing mortality; stock status; recent 
estimates of recruitment; virtual population analysis results; levels of 
noncompliance by fishermen or individual states; impact of size/mesh 
regulations; sea sampling and winter trawl survey data or, if sea 
sampling data are unavailable, length frequency information from the 
winter trawl survey and mesh selectivity analyses; impact of gear other 
than otter trawls on the mortality of summer flounder; and any other 
relevant information.
    (b) Recommended measures. Based on this review, the Summer Flounder 
Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the Demersal Species Committee 
of the MAFMC and the Commission the following measures to assure that 
the F specified in paragraph (a) of this section will not be exceeded:
    (1) Commercial quota set from a range of 0 to the maximum allowed to 
achieve the specified F.
    (2) Commercial minimum fish size.
    (3) Minimum mesh size.
    (4) Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 15 summer 
flounder to achieve the specified F.
    (5) Recreational minimum fish size.
    (6) Recreational season.
    (7) Restrictions on gear other than otter trawls.
    (8) Adjustments to the exempted area boundary and season specified 
in Sec. 648.104(b)(1) by 30-minute intervals of latitude and longitude 
and 2-week intervals, respectively, based on data specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section to prevent discarding of sublegal sized summer 
flounder in excess of 10 percent, by weight.
    (c) Annual fishing measures. The Demersal Species Committee shall 
review the recommendations of the Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee. 
Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the Demersal 
Species Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC measures necessary to 
assure that the applicable specified F will not be exceeded. The MAFMC 
shall review these recommendations and, based on the recommendations and 
any public comment, recommend to the Regional Administrator measures 
necessary to assure that the applicable specified F will not be 
exceeded. The MAFMC's recommendations must include supporting 
documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic 
impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review 
these recommendations and any recommendations of the Commission. After 
such review, the Regional Administrator will publish a proposed rule in 
the Federal Register by October 15 to implement a coastwide commercial 
quota and recreational harvest limit and additional management measures 
for the commercial fishery, and will publish a proposed rule in the 
Federal Register by February 15 to implement additional management 
measures for the recreational fishery, if he/she determines that such 
measures are necessary to assure that the applicable specified F will 
not be exceeded. After considering public comment, the Regional 
Administrator will publish a final rule in the Federal Register to 
implement the measures necessary to assure that the applicable specified 
F will not be exceeded.
    (d) Distribution of annual quota. (1) The annual commercial quota 
will be distributed to the states, based upon the following percentages:

                     Annual Commercial Quota Shares
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Share
                            State                              (percent)

Virginia.....................................................   21.31676
North Carolina...............................................   27.44584
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) All summer flounder landed for sale in a state shall be applied 
against that state's annual commercial quota, regardless of where the 
summer flounder were harvested. Any overages of the commercial quota 
landed in any state will be deducted from that state's annual quota for 
the following year.
    (e) Quota transfers and combinations. Any state implementing a state 
commercial quota for summer flounder may request approval from the 
Regional Administrator to transfer part or all of its annual quota to 
one or more states. Two or more states implementing a state commercial 
quota for summer flounder may request approval from the Regional 
Administrator to combine their quotas, or part of their quotas, into an 
overall regional quota. Requests for transfer or combination of 
commercial quotas for summer flounder must be made by individual or 
joint letter(s) signed by the principal state official with marine 
fishery management responsibility and expertise, or his/her previously 
named designee, for each state involved. The letter(s) must certify that 
all pertinent state requirements have been met and identify the states 
involved and the amount of quota to be transferred or combined.
    (1) Within 10 working days following the receipt of the letter(s) 
from the states involved, the Regional Administrator shall notify the 
appropriate state officials of the disposition of the request. In 
evaluating requests to transfer a quota or combine quotas, the Regional 
Administrator shall consider whether:
    (i) The transfer or combination would preclude the overall annual 
quota from being fully harvested.
    (ii) The transfer addresses an unforeseen variation or contingency 
in the fishery.
    (iii) The transfer is consistent with the objectives of the Summer 
Flounder FMP and Magnuson Act.
    (2) The transfer of quota or the combination of quotas will be valid 
only for the calendar year for which the request was made and will be 
effective upon the filing by NMFS of a notice of the approval of the 
transfer or combination with the Office of the Federal Register.
    (3) A state may not submit a request to transfer quota or combine 
quotas if a request to which it is party is pending before the Regional 
Administrator. A state may submit a new request when it receives notice 
that the Regional Administrator has disapproved the previous request or 
when notice of the approval of the transfer or combination has been 
filed at the Office of the Federal Register.
    (4) If there is a quota overage among states involved in the 
combination of quotas at the end of the fishing year, the overage will 
be deducted from the following year's quota for each of the states 
involved in the combined quota. The deduction will be proportional, 
based on each state's relative share of the combined quota for the 
previous year. A transfer of quota or combination of quotas does not 
alter any state's percentage share of the overall quota specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section.

[61 FR 34968, July 3, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 14650, Mar. 27, 1997; 62 
FR 66310, Dec. 18, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 648.101  Closures.

    (a) EEZ closure. The Regional Administrator shall close the EEZ to 
fishing for summer flounder by commercial vessels for the remainder of 
the calendar year by publishing notification in the Federal Register if 
he/she determines that the inaction of one or more states will cause the 
applicable F specified in Sec. 648.100(a) to be exceeded, or if the 
commercial fisheries in all states have been closed. The Regional 
Administrator may reopen the EEZ if earlier inaction by a state has been 
remedied by that state, or if commercial fisheries in one or more states 
have been reopened without causing the applicable specified F to be 
exceeded.

[[Page 299]]

    (b) State quotas. The Regional Administrator will monitor state 
commercial quotas based on dealer reports and other available 
information and shall determine the date when a state commercial quota 
will be harvested. The Regional Administrator shall publish notification 
in the Federal Register advising a state that, effective upon a specific 
date, its commercial quota has been harvested and notifying vessel and 
dealer permit holders that no commercial quota is available for landing 
summer flounder in that state.


<R05>
Sec. 648.102  Time restrictions.

    Vessels that are not eligible for a moratorium permit under 
Sec. 648.4(a)(3) and fishermen subject to the possession limit may fish 
for summer flounder from January 1 through December 31. This time period 
may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.100.


<R05>
Sec. 648.103  Minimum fish sizes.

    (a) The minimum size for summer flounder is 14 inches (35.6 cm) TL 
for all vessels issued a moratorium permit under Sec. 648.4 (a)(3), 
except on board party and charter boats carrying passengers for hire or 
carrying more than three crew members, if a charter boat, or more than 
five crew members, if a party boat;
    (b) The minimum size for summer flounder is 15 inches (38 cm) TL for 
all vessels that do not qualify for a moratorium permit, and party boats 
holding a moratorium permit if fishing with passengers for hire or 
carrying more than five crew members, or charter boats holding a 
moratorium permit if fishing with more than three crew members.
    (c) The minimum sizes in this section apply to whole fish or to any 
part of a fish found in possession, e.g., fillets, except that party and 
charter vessels possessing valid state permits authorizing filleting at 
sea may possess fillets smaller that the size specified if all state 
requirements are met.

<R05>
Sec. 648.104  Gear restrictions.

    (a) General. (1) Otter trawlers whose owners are issued a summer 
flounder permit and that land or possess 100 or more lb (45.4 or more 
kg) of summer flounder from May 1 through October 31, or 200 lb or more 
(90.8 kg or more) of summer flounder from November 1 through April 30, 
per trip, must fish with nets that have a minimum mesh size of 5.5-inch 
(14.0-cm) diamond or 6.0-inch (15.2-cm) square mesh applied throughout 
the body, extension(s), and codend portion of the net.
    (2) Mesh sizes are measured by a wedge-shaped gauge having a taper 
of 2 cm in 8 cm and a thickness of 2.3 mm inserted into the meshes under 
a pressure or pull of 5 kg. The mesh size is the average of the 
measurement of any series of 20 consecutive meshes for nets having 75 or 
more meshes, and 10 consecutive meshes for nets having fewer than 75 
meshes. The mesh in the regulated portion of the net is measured at 
least five meshes away from the lacings, running parallel to the long 
axis of the net.
    (b) Exemptions. The minimum mesh-size requirements specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply to:
    (1) Vessels issued a summer flounder moratorium permit and fishing 
from November 1 through April 30 in the ``exemption area,'' which is 
east of the line that follows 72 deg.30.0' W. long. until it intersects 
the outer boundary of the EEZ. Vessels fishing with a summer flounder 
exemption permit shall not fish west of the line. Vessels issued a 
permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(3)(iii) may transit the area west or south of 
the line, if the vessel's fishing gear is stowed in a manner prescribed 
under Sec. 648.100(e), so that it is not ``available for immediate use'' 
outside the exempted area. The Regional Administrator may terminate this 
exemption if he/she determines, after a review of sea sampling data, 
that vessels fishing under the exemption are discarding more than 10 
percent, by weight, of their entire catch of summer flounder per trip. 
If the Regional Administrator makes such a determination, he/she shall 
publish notification in the Federal Register terminating the exemption 
for the remainder of the exemption season.

[[Page 300]]

    (2) Vessels fishing with a two-seam otter trawl fly net with the 
following configuration, provided that no other nets or netting with 
mesh smaller than 5.5 inches (14.0 cm) are on board:
    (i) The net has large mesh in the wings that measures 8 inches (20.3 
cm) to 64 inches (162.6 cm).
    (ii) The first body section (belly) of the net has 35 or more meshes 
that are at least 8 inches (20.3 cm).
    (iii) The mesh decreases in size throughout the body of the net to 2 
inches (5 cm) or smaller towards the terminus of the net.
    (3) The Regional Administrator may terminate this exemption if he/
she determines, after a review of sea sampling data, that vessels 
fishing under the exemption, on average, are discarding more than 1 
percent of their entire catch of summer flounder per trip. If the 
Regional Administrator makes such a determination, he/she shall publish 
a notice in the Federal Register terminating the exemption for the 
remainder of the calendar year.
    (c) Net modifications. No vessel subject to this part shall use any 
device, gear, or material, including, but not limited to nets, net 
strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of the 
regulated portion of a trawl net; except that, one splitting strap and 
one bull rope (if present) consisting of line or rope no more than 3 
inches (7.2 cm) in diameter may be used if such splitting strap and/or 
bull rope does not constrict, in any manner, the top of the regulated 
portion of the net, and one rope no greater than 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) in 
diameter extending the length of the net from the belly to the terminus 
of the codend along the top, bottom, and each side of the net. ``Top of 
the regulated portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of the entire 
regulated portion of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) will not 
be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the regulated 
portion of the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of 
this paragraph (c), head ropes shall not be considered part of the top 
of the regulated portion of a trawl net. A vessel shall not use any 
means or mesh configuration on the top of the regulated portion of the 
net, as defined in Sec. 648.104(e), if it obstructs the meshes of the 
net or otherwise causes the size of the meshes of the net while in use 
to diminish to a size smaller than the minimum specified in 
Sec. 648.100(a).
    (d) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (1) A fishing vessel may not 
use any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in 
the top of the net, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, that 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (2) No person on any vessel may possess or fish with a net capable 
of catching summer flounder in which the bars entering or exiting the 
knots twist around each other.
    (e) Stowage of nets. Otter trawl vessels retaining 100 lb (45.3 kg) 
or more of summer flounder from May 1 through October 31, or 200 lb 
(90.6 kg) or more of summer flounder from November 1 through April 30, 
and subject to the minimum mesh size requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section may not have ``available for immediate use'' any net or any 
piece of net that does not meet the minimum mesh size requirement, or 
any net, or any piece of net, with mesh that is rigged in a manner that 
is inconsistent with the minimum mesh size requirement. A net that is 
stowed in conformance with one of the methods specified in 
Sec. 648.23(b) and that can be shown not to have been in recent use is 
considered to be not ``available for immediate use.''
    (f) The minimum net mesh requirement may apply to any portion of the 
net. The minimum mesh size and the portion of the net regulated by the 
minimum mesh size may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures in 
Sec. 648.100.

<R05>
Sec. 648.105  Possession restrictions.

    (a) No person shall possess more than eight summer flounder in, or 
harvested from, the EEZ unless that person is the owner or operator of a 
fishing vessel issued a summer flounder moratorium permit or is issued a 
summer flounder dealer permit. Persons aboard a commercial vessel that 
is not eligible for a summer flounder moratorium permit are subject to 
this possession limit. The owner, operator, and crew of a charter or 
party boat issued a summer

[[Page 301]]

flounder moratorium permit are not subject to the possession limit when 
not carrying passengers for hire and when the crew size does not exceed 
five for a party boat and three for a charter boat.
    (b) If whole summer flounder are processed into fillets, the number 
of fillets will be converted to whole summer flounder at the place of 
landing by dividing the fillet number by two. If summer flounder are 
filleted into single (butterfly) fillets, each fillet is deemed to be 
from one whole summer flounder.
    (c) Summer flounder harvested by vessels subject to the possession 
limit with more than one person on board may be pooled in one or more 
containers. Compliance with the daily possession limit will be 
determined by dividing the number of summer flounder on board by the 
number of persons on board, other than the captain and the crew. If 
there is a violation of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying 
more than one person, the violation shall be deemed to have been 
committed by the owner and operator.
    (d) Owners and operators of otter trawl vessels issued a permit 
under Sec. 648.4(a)(3) that fish with or possess nets or pieces of net 
on board that do not meet the minimum mesh requirements and that are not 
stowed in accordance with Sec. 648.104(f), may not retain 100 lb (45.3 
kg) or more of summer flounder from May 1 through October 31, or 200 lb 
(90.6 kg) or more of summer flounder from November 1 through April 30. 
Summer flounder on board these vessels must be stored so as to be 
readily available for inspection in standard 100-lb (45.3-kg) totes or 
fish boxes having a liquid capacity of 18.2 gal (70 L), or a volume of 
not more than 4,320 in \3\ (2.5 ft \3\ or 70.79 cm \3\).

<R05>
Sec. 648.106  Sea turtle conservation.

    This section will be suspended during the effectiveness of any 
temporary regulations issued to regulate incidental take of sea turtles 
in the summer flounder fishery under authority of the ESA under parts 
217, 222, 227 of this title. Such suspensions and temporary regulations 
will be issued by publication in the Federal Register and will be 
effective for a specified period of time, not to exceed 1 year.
    (a) Sea turtle handling and resuscitation. The sea turtle handling 
and resuscitation requirements specified in Sec. 227.72(e)(1) (i) and 
(ii) of this title apply with respect to sea turtles incidentally taken 
by a vessel fishing for summer flounder.
    (b) Sea turtle monitoring and assessment program. (1) The Regional 
Administrator will establish a monitoring and assessment program, in 
cooperation with the MAFMC and the State of North Carolina, to measure 
the incidental take of sea turtles in the summer flounder fishery, 
monitor compliance with required conservation measures by trawlers, and 
predict interactions between the fishery and sea turtles to prevent 
turtle mortalities.
    (2) A scientifically designed, observer-based monitoring program in 
accordance with Sec. 648.11 may be used to gather scientific data 
measuring the incidental take of turtles by trawlers in the summer 
flounder fishery and to report turtle distribution and abundance.
    (3) A cooperative sea turtle monitoring and assessment program 
utilizing a variety of information, including aerial and vessel surveys; 
onboard observers; individually tagged turtles; physical parameters, 
such as sea surface temperatures, and reports from the sea turtle 
stranding network; and other relevant and reliable information, will 
assess and predict turtle distribution, abundance, movement patterns, 
and timing to provide information to NMFS to prevent turtle mortality 
caused by the summer flounder fishery.
    (c) Required use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TED). The Regional 
Administrator will require the use of a NMFS-approved TED by any vessels 
engaged in summer flounder fishing operations and utilizing trawl gear 
on or after October 15 as necessary to protect sea turtles. The Regional 
Administrator will publish notification in the Federal Register with the 
specific time period. Descriptions of NMFS-approved TEDs can be found in 
Sec. 227.72(e)(4) of this title. This requirement applies to vessels 
within the EEZ bounded on the

[[Page 302]]

north by a line along 37 deg.05' N. lat., bounded on the south by a line 
along 33 deg.35' N. lat., and bounded on the east by a line 7 nm from 
the shoreward boundary of the EEZ.
    (d) Closure of the fishery. The Regional Administrator may close the 
summer flounder fishery in the EEZ, or any part thereof, after 
consultation with the MAFMC, the Director of the State of North Carolina 
Division of Marine Fisheries, and the marine fisheries agency of any 
other affected state, by publishing notification in the Federal 
Register. The Regional Administrator shall take such action if he/she 
determines a closure is necessary to avoid jeopardizing the continued 
existence of any species listed under the ESA. The determination of the 
impact on sea turtles must be based on turtle mortalities and 
projections of turtle mortality by the NMFS monitoring and assessment 
program. A closure will be applicable to those areas specified in the 
notification and for the period specified in the notification. The 
Regional Administrator will provide as much advance notice as possible, 
consistent with the requirements of the ESA, and will have the closure 
announced on channel 16 of the marine VHF radio. A closure may prohibit 
all fishing operations, may prohibit the use of certain gear, may 
require that gear be stowed, or may impose similar types of restrictions 
on fishing activities. The prohibitions, restrictions, and duration of 
the closure will be specified in the notification.
    (e) Reopening of the fishery. (1) The Regional Administrator may 
reopen the summer flounder fishery in the EEZ, or any part thereof, 
after consultation with the MAFMC, the Director of the State of North 
Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries, and the marine fisheries agency 
of any other affected state, by publishing notification in the Federal 
Register. The Regional Administrator may reopen the summer flounder 
fishery in the EEZ, or any part thereof, if additional sea turtle 
conservation measures are implemented and if projections of NMFS' sea 
turtle monitoring program indicate that such measures will ensure that 
continued operation of the summer flounder fishery is not likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of any species listed under the ESA.
    (2) The Regional Administrator may reopen the summer flounder 
fishery in the EEZ, or any part thereof, if the sea turtle monitoring 
program indicates changed conditions and if projections of the sea 
turtle monitoring program indicate that NMFS can ensure that continued 
operation of the summer flounder fishery is not likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of any species listed under the ESA.
    (f) Additional sea turtle conservation measures. (1) The Regional 
Administrator may impose additional sea turtle conservation measures, 
including tow-time requirements, in the EEZ, after consultation with the 
MAFMC, the Director of the State of North Carolina Division of Marine 
Fisheries, and the marine fisheries agency of any other affected state, 
by publishing notification in the Federal Register. The Regional 
Administrator shall take such action if he/she determines further 
measures are necessary to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of 
any species listed under the ESA or if such action would allow reopening 
of the summer flounder fishery in the EEZ. The determination of the 
impact on sea turtles must be based on turtle mortalities and 
projections of turtle mortality by the NMFS monitoring and assessment 
program.
    (2) Consistent with the procedures specified in Sec. 648.10, the 
Regional Administrator may require that all or a certain portion of the 
vessels engaged in fishing for summer flounder carry observers, 
consistent with the requirements of Sec. 648.10, to gather data on 
incidental capture of sea turtles and to monitor compliance with 
required conservation measures. This requirement may apply to certain 
types of vessels, certain areas, or during certain times of the year.
    (g) Experimental projects. Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through 
(f) of this section, the Regional Administrator may authorize summer 
flounder fishing, as a part of experimental projects to measure turtle 
capture rates, to monitor turtle abundance, to test alternative gear or 
equipment, or for other research purposes. Research

[[Page 303]]

must be approved by the Regional Administrator, and it must not be 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any species listed under 
the ESA. The Regional Administrator will impose such conditions as he/
she determines necessary to ensure adequate turtle protection during 
experimental projects. Individual authorizations may be issued in 
writing. Authorizations applying to multiple vessels will be published 
in the Federal Register.

           Subpart H--Management Measures for the Scup Fishery

    Source: 61 FR 43426, Aug. 23, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 648.120  Catch quotas and other restrictions.

    (a) Annual review. The Scup Monitoring Committee shall review the 
following data, subject to availability, on or before August 15 of each 
year. This review will be conducted to determine the allowable levels of 
fishing and other restrictions necessary to achieve an exploitation rate 
of 47 percent in 1997, 1998, and 1999, 33 percent in 2000 and 2001, and 
19 percent in 2002 and thereafter: Commercial and recreational catch 
data; current estimates of fishing mortality; stock status; recent 
estimates of recruitment; virtual population analysis results; levels of 
noncompliance by fishermen or individual states; impact of size/mesh 
regulations; impact of gear on the mortality of scup; and any other 
relevant information.
    (b) Recommended measures. Based on this review, the Scup Monitoring 
Committee shall recommend the following measures to the Demersal Species 
Committee of the MAFMC and the Commission to assure that the 
exploitation rate specified in paragraph (a) of this section will not be 
exceeded:
    (1) The commercial quota for each of the three periods specified in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to be set from a range of 0 to the 
maximum allowed to achieve the specified exploitation rate. The 
commercial quota will be established by estimating the annual total 
allowable catch (TAC), allocating it into the three periods, and 
deducting the discard estimates for each period.
    (2) Landing limits for the Winter I and Winter II periods.
    (3) Percent of landings attained at which the landing limit for the 
Winter I period will be reduced.
    (4) Commercial minimum fish size.
    (5) Minimum mesh size.
    (6) Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 50 scup 
to achieve the specified exploitation rate.
    (7) Recreational minimum fish size set from a range of 7 inches 
(17.8 cm) TL to 10 inches (25.4 cm) TL.
    (8) Recreational season.
    (9) Restrictions on gear.
    (10) Season and area closures in the commercial fishery.
    (c) Annual fishing measures. The Demersal Species Committee shall 
review the recommendations of the Scup Monitoring Committee. Based on 
these recommendations and any public comment, the Demersal Species 
Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC measures necessary to assure that 
the specified exploitation rate will not be exceeded. The MAFMC shall 
review these recommendations and, based on these recommendations and any 
public comment, recommend to the Regional Administrator measures 
necessary to assure that the specified exploitation rate will not be 
exceeded. The MAFMC's recommendation must include supporting 
documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic 
impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review 
these recommendations and any recommendations of the Commission. After 
such review, NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register 
by October 15 to implement a commercial quota, specifying the amount of 
quota allocated to each of the three periods, landing limits for the 
Winter I and Winter II periods, the percentage of landings attained 
during the Winter I fishery at which the landing limits will be reduced, 
a recreational harvest limit and additional management measures for the 
commercial fishery. NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal 
Register by February 15 to implement additional management

[[Page 304]]

measures for the recreational fishery, if the Regional Administrator 
determines that such measures are necessary to assure that the specified 
exploitation rate will not be exceeded. After considering public 
comment, NMFS will publish a final rule in the Federal Register to 
implement the annual measures.
    (d) Distribution of Commercial Quota. (1) The annual commercial 
quota will be allocated into three periods, based on the following 
percentages:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Period                              Percent
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Winter I--January-April......................................      45.11
Summer-May-October...........................................      38.95
Winter II--November-December.................................      15.94
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) The Winter I and Winter II commercial quotas will each be 
distributed to the coastal states from Maine through North Carolina on a 
coastwide basis.
    (3) The Summer commercial quota will be allocated to the coastal 
states from Maine through North Carolina, based upon the following 
percentages:

           Summer Period (May-October) Commercial Quota Shares
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Share
                          State                              (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maine...................................................         0.13042
New Hampshire...........................................         0.00004
Massachusetts...........................................        15.49120
Rhode Island............................................        60.56589
Connecticut.............................................         3.39884
New York................................................        17.05295
New Jersey..............................................         3.14307
Delaware................................................         0.00000
Maryland................................................         0.01286
Virginia................................................         0.17789
North Carolina..........................................         0.02690
Total...................................................       100.00000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) All scup landed for sale in any state during either Winter I or 
Winter II shall be applied against the coastwide commercial quota for 
that period, regardless of where the scup were harvested. All scup 
landed for sale in a state during the Summer period shall be applied 
against that state's summer commercial quota, regardless of where the 
scup were harvested.
    (5) All scup landed for sale in any state during the period January 
1, 1997, through April 30, 1997, shall be applied against the coastwide 
commercial quota for the 1997 Winter I period, regardless of where the 
scup were harvested. Any landings during that time in excess of the 1997 
Winter I commercial quota will be subtracted from the 1997 Winter II 
period's allocation. Any overage beyond the 1997 Winter II allocation 
will be deducted from subsequent winter periods.
    (6) Beginning in 1997, any overages of the commercial quota landed 
in any state during the Summer period will be deducted from that state's 
Summer period quota for the following year. Beginning in 1998, any 
overages of the commercial quota landed in any Winter period will be 
subtracted from the period's allocation for the following year.
    (7) Based upon any changes in the landings data available from the 
states for the base years 1983-92, the Commission and the Council may 
recommend to the Regional Administrator that the states' shares 
specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and the period allocations 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section be revised. The Council's 
and the Commission's recommendation must include supporting 
documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic 
impacts of the recommendation. The Regional Administrator shall review 
the recommendation of the Commission and the Council. After such review, 
NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register to implement a 
revision in the state shares. After considering public comment, NMFS 
will publish a final rule in the Federal Register to implement the 
changes in allocation.
    (e) Quota transfers and combinations. Any state implementing a state 
commercial quota for scup may request approval from the Regional 
Administrator to transfer part or all of its Summer period quota to one 
or more states. Two or more states implementing a state commercial quota 
for scup may request approval from the Regional Administrator to combine 
their quotas, or part of their quotas, into an overall regional quota. 
Requests for transfer or combination of commercial quotas for scup must 
be made by individual or joint letter(s) signed by the principal state 
official with marine fishery management responsibility and expertise, or 
his or her previously

[[Page 305]]

named designee, for each state involved. The letter(s) must certify that 
all pertinent state requirements have been met and identify the states 
involved and the amount of quota to be transferred or combined.
    (1) Within 10 working days following the receipt of the letter(s) 
from the states involved, the Regional Administrator shall notify the 
appropriate state officials of the disposition of the request. In 
evaluating requests to transfer a quota or combine quotas, the Regional 
Administrator shall consider whether:
    (i) The transfer or combination would preclude the overall Summer 
period quota from being fully harvested.
    (ii) The transfer addresses an unforeseen variation or contingency 
in the fishery.
    (iii) The transfer is consistent with the objectives of the Summer 
Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass FMP and the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
    (2) The transfer of quota or the combination of quotas will be valid 
only for the Summer period for which the request was made and will be 
effective upon the filing by NMFS of a notification of approval of the 
quota transfer or combination with the Office of the Federal Register.
    (3) A state may not submit a request to transfer quota or combine 
quotas if a request to which it is party is pending before the Regional 
Administrator. A state may submit a new request when it receives notice 
that the Regional Administrator has disapproved the previous request or 
when notification of approval of the quota transfer or combination has 
been filed at the Office of the Federal Register.
    (4) If there is a quota overage among states involved in the 
combination of quotas at the end of the Summer period, the overage will 
be deducted from the following Summer period's quota for each of the 
states involved in the combined quota. The deduction will be 
proportional, based on each state's relative share of the combined quota 
for the previous Summer period. A transfer of quota or combination of 
quotas does not alter any state's percentage share of the overall Summer 
period quota specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

Sec. 648.121  Closures.

    (a) Winter closures. The Regional Administrator will monitor the 
harvest of commercial quota for each Winter period based on dealer 
reports, state data, and other available information and shall determine 
the date when the commercial quota for a Winter period will be 
harvested. NMFS shall close the EEZ to fishing for scup by commercial 
vessels for the remainder of the indicated period by publishing 
notification in the Federal Register advising that, effective upon a 
specific date, the commercial quota for that period has been harvested, 
and notifying vessel and dealer permit holders that no commercial quota 
is available for landing scup for the remainder of the period.
    (b) Summer closure. The Regional Administrator will monitor the 
Summer period state commercial quota based on dealer reports, state 
data, and other available information, and shall determine the date when 
a state's commercial quota will be harvested. NMFS shall publish 
notification in the Federal Register advising a state that, effective 
upon a specific date, its Summer period commercial quota has been 
harvested and notifying vessel and dealer permit holders that no Summer 
period commercial quota is available for landing scup in that state for 
the remainder of the period.

    If the MAFMC determines through its annual review process that 
seasonal restrictions or area closures are necessary for the commercial 
or recreational sectors to assure that the exploitation rate is not 
exceeded, or to attain other FMP objectives, such measures will be 
enacted through the procedure specified in Sec. 648.120.


<R05>
Sec. 648.123  Gear restrictions.

    (a) Travel vessel gear restrictions--(1) Minimum mesh size. The 
owners or operators of otter trawlers issued a scup moratorium permit, 
and that possess

[[Page 306]]

4,000 lb or more (1,814 kg or more) of scup from November 1 through 
April 30 or 1,000 lb or more (454 kg or more) of scup from May 1 through 
October 31 must fish with nets that have a minimum mesh size of 4.5 
inches (11.43 cm) diamond mesh, applied throughout the codend for at 
least 75 continuous meshes forward of the terminus of the net, or for 
codends with less than 75 meshes, the minimum-mesh-size codend must be a 
minimum of one-third of the net, measured from the terminus of the 
codend to the head rope, excluding any turtle excluder device extension. 
Scup on board these vessels shall be stored separately and kept readily 
available for inspection.
    (2) Mesh-size measurement. Mesh sizes will be measured according to 
the procedure specified in Sec. 648.104(a)(2).
    (3) Net modification. The owner or operator of a fishing vessel 
subject to the minimum mesh requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section shall not use any device, gear, or material, including, but not 
limited to, nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on 
the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net. However, one splitting 
strap and one bull rope (if present), consisting of line or rope no more 
than 3 inches (7.2 cm) in diameter, may be used if such splitting strap 
and/or bull rope does not constrict in any manner the top of the 
regulated portion of the net, and one rope no greater that 0.75 inches 
(1.9 cm) in diameter extending the length of the net from the belly to 
the terminus of the codend along the top, bottom, and each side of the 
net. ``Top of the regulated portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of 
the entire regulated portion of the net that (in a hypothetical 
situation) will not be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if 
the regulated portion of the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For 
the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), head ropes are not considered part 
of the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net.
    (4) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (i) The owner or operator of a 
fishing vessel subject to the minimum mesh restriction in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section shall not use any mesh construction, mesh 
configuration, or other means on or in the top of the regulated portion 
of the net, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if it 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner.
    (ii) The owner or operator of a fishing vessel subject to the 
minimum mesh requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may not use 
a net capable of catching scup if the bars entering or exiting the knots 
twist around each other.
    (5) Stowage of nets. The owner or operator of an otter trawl vessel 
retaining 4,000 lb or more (1,814 kg or more) of scup and subject to the 
minimum mesh requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, may not 
have available for immediate use any net, or any piece of net, not 
meeting the minimum mesh size requirement, or mesh that is rigged in a 
manner that is inconsistent with the minimum mesh size. A net that 
conforms to one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b) and that can 
be shown not to have been in recent use is considered to be not 
``available for immediate use.''
    (6) Roller gear. The owner or operator of an otter trawl vessel 
issued a moratorium permit pursuant to Sec. 648.4(a)(6) shall not use 
roller rig trawl gear equipped with rollers greater than 18 inches (45.7 
cm) in diameter.
    (7) Procedures for changes. The minimum net mesh and the threshold 
catch level at which it is required set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, and the maximum roller diameter set forth in paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section, may be changed following the procedures in 
Sec. 648.120.
    (b) Pot and trap gear restrictions. Owners or operators of vessels 
subject to this part must fish with scup pots or traps that comply with 
the following:
    (1) Degradable hinges. A scup pot or trap must have degradable 
hinges and fasteners made of one of the following degradable materials:
    (i) Untreated hemp, jute, or cotton string of \3/16\ inches (4.8 mm) 
diameter or smaller;
    (ii) Magnesium alloy, timed float releases (pop-up devices) or 
similar magnesium alloy fasteners; or
    (iii) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire of 0.094 inches (2.4 mm) 
diameter or smaller.

[[Page 307]]

    (2) Escape vents. (i) All scup pots or traps that have a circular 
escape vent with a minimum of 3.1 inches (7.9 cm) in diameter, or a 
square escape vent with a minimum of 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) for each side, 
or an equivalent rectangular escape vent.
    (ii) The minimum escape vent size set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
of this section may be revised following the procedures in Sec. 648.120.
    (3) Pot and trap identification. Pots or traps used in fishing for 
scup must be marked with a code of identification that may be the number 
assigned by the Regional Administrator and/or the identification marking 
as required by the vessel's home port state.

<R05>
Sec. 648.124  Minimum fish sizes.

    (a) The minimum size for scup is 9 inches (22.9 cm) TL for all 
vessels issued a moratorium permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(6). If such a 
vessel is also issued a charter and party boat permit and is carrying 
passengers for hire, or carrying more than three crew members if a 
charter boat, or more than five crew members if a party boat, then the 
minimum size specified in paragraph (b) of this section applies.
    (b) The minimum size for scup is 7 inches (17.8 cm) TL for all 
vessels that do not have a moratorium permit, or for party and charter 
vessels that are issued a moratorium permit but are fishing with 
passengers for hire, or carrying more than three crew members if a 
charter boat, or more than five crew members if a party boat.
    (c) The minimum size applies to whole fish or any part of a fish 
found in possession, e.g., fillets. These minimum sizes may be adjusted 
pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.120.


<R05>
Sec. 648.125  Possession limit.

    (a) Pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.120, the Regional 
Administrator may limit the number of scup that may be possessed in or 
harvested from the EEZ north of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat. by persons aboard 
vessels that have not been issued a valid moratorium permit.
    (b) If whole scup are processed into fillets, an authorized officer 
will convert the number of fillets to whole scup at the place of landing 
by dividing fillet number by 2. If scup are filleted into a single 
(butterfly) fillet, such fillet shall be deemed to be from one whole 
scup.
    (c) Scup harvested by vessels subject to the possession limit with 
more than one person aboard may be pooled in one or more containers. 
Compliance with the daily possession limit will be determined by 
dividing the number of scup on board by the number of persons aboard 
other than the captain and crew. If there is a violation of the 
possession limit on board a vessel carrying more than one person, the 
violation shall be deemed to have been committed by the owner and 
operator.
    (d) Scup and scup parts harvested by a vessel with a moratorium or 
charter or party boat scup permit, or in or from the EEZ north of 
35 deg.15.3' N. lat., may not be landed with the skin removed.


<R05>
Sec. 648.126  Protection of threatened and endangered sea turtles.

    This section supplements existing regulations issued to regulate 
incidental take of sea turtles under authority of the Endangered Species 
Act under 50 CFR parts 217 and 227. In addition to the measures required 
under those parts, NMFS will investigate the extent of take in flynet 
gear and if deemed appropriate, may develop and certify a Turtle 
Excluder Device for that gear.

<R05>
Sec. 648.140  Catch quotas and other restrictions.

    (a) Annual review. The Black Sea Bass Monitoring Committee will 
review the following data, subject to availability, on or before August 
15 of each year to determine the allowable levels of fishing and other 
restrictions necessary to result in a target exploitation rate of 48 
percent for black sea bass in 1998, 1999, and 2000; a target 
exploitation rate of 37 percent in 2001 and

[[Page 308]]

2002; and a target exploitation rate of 23 percent (based on 
F<INF>max</INF>) in 2003 and subsequent years: Commercial and 
recreational catch data; current estimates of fishing mortality; stock 
status; recent estimates of recruitment; virtual population analysis 
results; levels of noncompliance by fishermen or individual states; 
impact of size/mesh regulations; sea sampling and winter trawl survey 
data, or if sea sampling data are unavailable, length frequency 
information from the winter trawl survey and mesh selectivity analyses; 
impact of gear other than otter trawls, pots and traps on the mortality 
of black sea bass; and any other relevant information.
    (b) Recommended measures. Based on this review, the Black Sea Bass 
Monitoring Committee will recommend to the Demersal Species Committee of 
the Council and the Commission the following measures to assure that the 
target exploitation rate specified in paragraph (a) of this section is 
not exceeded:
    (1) A commercial quota allocated to quarterly periods set from a 
range of (0) to the maximum allowed to achieve the specified target 
exploitation rate specified in paragraph (a) of this section. 
Implementation of this measure will begin in 1998.
    (2) A commercial trip limit for all moratorium vessels set from a 
range of (0) to the maximum allowed to assure that the quarterly quota 
is not exceeded.
    (3) Commercial minimum fish size.
    (4) Minimum mesh size in the codend or throughout the net and the 
catch threshold that will require compliance with the minimum mesh 
requirement.
    (5) Escape vent size.
    (6) A recreational possession limit set from a range of (0) to the 
maximum allowed to achieve the target exploitation rate specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. Implementation of this measure will begin 
in 1998.
    (7) Recreational minimum fish size.
    (8) Recreational season. This measure may be adjusted beginning in 
1998.
    (9) Restrictions on gear other than otter trawls and pots or traps.
    (c) Annual fishing measures. The Demersal Species Committee shall 
review the recommendations of the Black Sea Bass Monitoring Committee. 
Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the Demersal 
Species Committee shall make its recommendations to the Council with 
respect to the measures necessary to assure that the target exploitation 
rate specified in paragraph (a) of this section is not exceeded. The 
Council shall review these recommendations and, based on the 
recommendations and public comment, make recommendations to the Regional 
Administrator with respect to the measures necessary to assure that the 
target exploitation rate specified in paragraph (a) of this section is 
not exceeded. Included in the recommendation will be supporting 
documents, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic 
impacts of the proposed action. The Regional Administrator will review 
these recommendations and any recommendations of the Commission. After 
such review, the Regional Administrator will publish a proposed rule in 
the Federal Register by October 15 to implement a commercial quota and a 
recreational harvest limit, and additional management measures for the 
commercial fishery, and will publish a proposed rule in the Federal 
Register by February 15 to implement additional management measures for 
the recreational fishery, if he or she determines that such measures are 
necessary to assure that the target exploitation rate specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section is not exceeded. After considering public 
comment, the Regional Administrator will publish a final rule in the 
Federal Register to implement the measures necessary to assure that the 
target exploitation rate specified in paragraph (a) of this section is 
not exceeded.
    (d) Distribution of annual quota. (1) Beginning January 1, 1998, a 
commercial quota will be allocated by quarterly periods based upon the 
following percentages:

                    Quarterly Commercial Quota Shares
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Share
                          Quarter                             (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 309]]

 
October-December...........................................        19.77
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) All black sea bass landed for sale in the states from North 
Carolina through Maine by a vessel with a moratorium permit issued under 
Sec. 648.4(a)(7) shall be applied against that quarter's commercial 
quota, regardless of where the black sea bass were harvested. All black 
sea bass harvested north of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat., and landed for sale in 
the states from North Carolina through Maine by any vessel without a 
moratorium permit and fishing exclusively in state waters will be 
counted against the quota by the state in which it is landed pursuant to 
the Fishery Management Plan for the Black Sea Bass Fishery adopted by 
the Commission. The Regional Administrator will determine the date on 
which the quarterly quota will be harvested and the EEZ north of 
35 deg.15.3' N. lat. closed. The Regional Administrator will publish a 
notice in the Federal Register advising that, upon that date, no vessel 
may possess black sea bass in the EEZ north of 35 deg.15.3' N. lat. 
during a closure, nor may vessels issued a moratorium permit land black 
sea bass during the closure. Individual states will have the 
responsibility to close their ports to landings of black sea bass during 
a closure pursuant to the Fishery Management Plan for the Black Sea Bass 
Fishery adopted by the Commission. Any overages of the commercial 
quarterly quota landed will be deducted from that quarter's quota for 
the following year.


<R05>
Sec. 648.141  Closure.

    EEZ closure. The Regional Administrator shall close the EEZ to 
fishing for black sea bass by commercial vessels issued a moratorium 
permit for the remainder of the calendar year by publishing notification 
in the Federal Register if he or she determines that the action or 
inaction of one or more states will cause the applicable target 
exploitation rate specified in Sec. 648.140(a) to be exceeded. The 
Regional Administrator may reopen the EEZ if earlier action or inaction 
by a state has been remedied by that state without causing the 
applicable specified target exploitation rate to be exceeded.


<R05>
Sec. 648.142  Time restrictions.

    Vessels that are not eligible for a moratorium permit under 
Sec. 648.4(a)(6) and fishermen subject to the possession limit may not 
fish for black sea bass from August 1 through August 15. This time 
period may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.140.

[63 FR 27868, May 21, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 648.143  Minimum sizes.

    (a) The minimum size for black sea bass is 10 inches (25.4 cm) total 
length for all vessels issued a moratorium permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(7) 
that fish for or retain black sea bass in or from U.S. waters of the 
western Atlantic Ocean from 35 deg.15.3' N. Lat., the latitude of Cape 
Hatteras Light, North Carolina, northward to the U.S.-Canada border. The 
minimum size may be adjusted for commercial vessels pursuant to the 
procedures in Sec. 648.140.
    (b) The minimum size for black sea bass is 10 inches (25.4 cm) TL 
for all vessels that do not qualify for a moratorium permit, and party 
boats holding a moratorium permit if fishing with passengers for hire or 
carrying more than five crew members, or charter boats, holding a 
moratorium permit if fishing with more than three crew members. The 
minimum size may be adjusted for recreational vessels pursuant to the 
procedures in Sec. 648.140.
    (c) The minimum size in this section applies to the whole fish or 
any part of a fish found in possession (e.g., fillets), except that 
party or charter vessels possessing valid state permits authorizing 
filleting at sea may possess fillets smaller than the size specified if 
skin remains on the fillet and all other state requirements are met.

Sec. 648.144  Gear restrictions.

    (a) Trawl gear restrictions--(1) General. (i) Otter trawlers whose 
owners are issued a black sea bass moratorium permit and that land or 
possess 1,000 lb or more (453.6 kg or more) of black sea

[[Page 310]]

bass per trip, must fish with nets that have a minimum mesh size of 4.0 
inches (10.2 cm) diamond or 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) square (inside measure) 
mesh applied throughout the codend for at least 75 continuous meshes 
forward of the terminus of the net, or, for codends with less than 75 
meshes, the minimum-mesh-size codend must be a minimum of one-third of 
the net, measured from the terminus of the codend to the center of the 
head rope, excluding any turtle excluder device extension.
    (ii) Mesh sizes shall be measured pursuant to the procedure 
specified in Sec. 648.104(a)(2).
    (2) Net modifications. No vessel subject to this part shall use any 
device, gear, or material, including, but not limited to nets, net 
strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing gear, on the top of the 
regulated portion of a trawl net; except that, one splitting strap and 
one bull rope (if present) consisting of line or rope no more than 3 
inches (7.6 cm) in diameter may be used if such splitting strap and/or 
bull rope does not constrict, in any manner, the top of the regulated 
portion of the net, and one rope no greater than 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) in 
diameter extending the length of the net from the belly to the terminus 
of the codend along the top, bottom, and each side of the net. ``Top of 
the regulated portion of the net'' means the 50 percent of the entire 
regulated portion of the net that (in a hypothetical situation) will not 
be in contact with the ocean bottom during a tow if the regulated 
portion of the net were laid flat on the ocean floor. For the purpose of 
this paragraph, head ropes shall not be considered part of the top of 
the regulated portion of a trawl net.
    (3) Mesh obstruction or constriction. (i) A fishing vessel may not 
use any mesh configuration, mesh construction, or other means on or in 
the top of the net, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that 
obstructs the meshes of the net in any manner, or otherwise causes the 
size of the meshes of the net while in use to diminish to a size smaller 
than the minimum established pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (ii) No person on any vessel may possess or fish with a net capable 
of catching black sea bass in which the bars entering or exiting the 
knots twist around each other.
    (4) Stowage of nets. Otter trawl vessels subject to the minimum 
mesh-size requirement of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section may not 
have ``available for immediate use'' any net or any piece of net that 
does not meet the minimum mesh size requirement, or any net, or any 
piece of net, with mesh that is rigged in a manner that is inconsistent 
with the minimum mesh size requirement. A net that is stowed in 
conformance with one of the methods specified in Sec. 648.23(b) and that 
can be shown not to have been in recent use, is considered to be not 
``available for immediate use.''
    (5) Roller gear. Rollers used in roller rig or rock hopper trawl 
gear shall be no larger than 18 inches (45.7 cm) in diameter.
    (b) Pot and trap gear restrictions--(1) Gear marking. The owner of a 
vessel issued a black sea bass moratorium permit must mark all black sea 
bass pots or traps with the vessel's USCG documentation number or state 
registration number.
    (2) Escape vents. All black sea bass traps or pots must have an 
escape vent placed in a lower corner of the parlor portion of the pot or 
trap which complies with one of the following minimum sizes: 1.125 
inches (2.86 cm) by 5.75 inches (14.61 cm); or a circular vent 2 inches 
(5.08 cm) in diameter; or a square vent with sides of 1.5 inches (3.81 
cm), inside measure; however, black sea bass traps or pots constructed 
of wooden laths may instead have an escape vent constructed by leaving a 
space of at least 1.125 inches (2.86 cm) between one set of laths in the 
parlor portion of the trap. The dimensions for escape vents and lath 
spacing may be adjusted pursuant to the procedures in Sec. 648.140.
    (3) Ghost panel. Black sea bass traps or pots must contain a ghost 
panel affixed to the trap or pot with degradable fasteners and hinges. 
The opening to be covered by the ghost panel must measure at least 3.0 
inches (7.62 cm) by 6.0 inches (15.24 cm). The ghost panel must be 
affixed to the pot or trap with hinges and fasteners made of one of the 
following degradable materials:

[[Page 311]]

    (i) Untreated hemp, jute, or cotton string of 3/16 inches (4.8 mm) 
diameter or smaller; or
    (ii) Magnesium alloy, timed float releases (pop-up devices) or 
similar magnesium alloy fasteners; or
    (iii) Ungalvanized or uncoated iron wire of 0.094 inches (2.4 mm) 
diameter or smaller.

<R05>
Sec. 648.145  Possession limit.

    A possession limit will be established pursuant to the procedures in 
Sec. 648.140 to assure that the recreational harvest limit is not 
exceeded.
    (a) If whole black sea bass are processed into fillets, an 
authorized officer will convert the number of fillets to whole black sea 
bass at the place of landing by dividing fillet number by two. If black 
sea bass are filleted into a single (butterfly) fillet, such fillet 
shall be deemed to be from one whole black sea bass.
    (b) Black sea bass harvested by vessels subject to the possession 
limit with more than one person aboard may be pooled in one or more 
containers. Compliance with the daily possession limit will be 
determined by dividing the number of black sea bass on board by the 
number of persons aboard, other than the captain and the crew. If there 
is a violation of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying more 
than one person, the violation shall be deemed to have been committed by 
the owner and operator.
    (c) Owners or operators of otter trawl vessels issued a moratorium 
permit under Sec. 648.4(a)(6) and fishing with, or possessing on board, 
nets or pieces of net that do not meet the minimum mesh requirements and 
that are not stowed in accordance with Sec. 648.144(a)(4), may not 
retain 1,000 lb (453.6 kg) or more of black sea bass. Black sea bass on 
board these vessels shall be stored so as to be readily available for 
inspection in a standard 100-lb (45.4-kg) tote.

Sec. 648.146  Special management zones.

    The recipient of a Corps of Engineers permit for an artificial reef, 
fish attraction device, or other modification of habitat for purposes of 
fishing may request that an area surrounding and including the site be 
designated by the Council as a special management zone (SMZ). The SMZ 
will prohibit or restrain the use of specific types of fishing gear that 
are not compatible with the intent of the artificial reef or fish 
attraction device or other habitat modification. The establishment of an 
SMZ will be effected by a regulatory amendment pursuant to the following 
procedure:
    (a) A SMZ monitoring team comprised of members of staff from the 
Mid-Atlantic FMC, NMFS Northeast Region, and NMFS Northeast Fisheries 
Science Center will evaluate the request in the form of a written report 
considering the following criteria:
    (1) Fairness and equity.
    (2) Promotion of conservation.
    (3) Avoidance of excessive shares.
    (4) Consistency with the objectives of Amendment 9 to the Fishery 
Management Plan for the Summer Flounder, Scup and Black Sea Bass 
fisheries, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and other applicable law.
    (5) The natural bottom in and surrounding potential SMZs.
    (6) Impacts on historical uses.
    (b) The Council Chairman may schedule meetings of Industry Advisors 
and/or the Scientific and Statistical Committee to review the report and 
associated documents and to advise the Council. The Council Chairman may 
also schedule public hearings.
    (c) The Council, following review of the SMZ monitoring teams's 
report, supporting data, public comments, and other relevant 
information, may recommend to the Regional Administrator that a SMZ be 
approved. Such a recommendation will be accompanied by all relevant 
background information.
    (d) The Regional Administrator will review the Council's 
recommendation. If the Regional Administrator concurs in the 
recommendation, he or she will publish a proposed rule in the Federal

[[Page 312]]

Register in accordance with the recommendations. If the Regional 
Administrator rejects the Council's recommendation, he or she shall 
advise the Council in writing of the basis for the rejection.
    (e) The proposed rule shall afford a reasonable period for public 
comment. Following a review of public comments and any information or 
data not previously available, the Regional Administrator will publish a 
final rule if he or she determines that the establishment of the SMZ is 
supported by the substantial weight of evidence in the administrative 
record and consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable 
law.

Sec. 648.160  Fishing year.

    The fishing year is from January 1 through December 31.


<R05>
Sec. 648.161  Possession limit.

    (a) Possession limit. (1) No person shall possess more than ten 
bluefish unless he/she has a permit meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 648.4(a)(8).
    (2) Bluefish caught while in possession of a permit meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 648.4(a)(8) must be kept separate from the pooled 
catch and in the possession of the permit holder at all times.
    (3) If Atlantic bluefish are filleted into two or more sections, 
such fillets shall be deemed to be whole Atlantic bluefish using a ratio 
of 1:2 (two fillets to one whole fish). If Atlantic bluefish are 
filleted into single (butterfly) fillets, such fillets shall be deemed 
to be whole Atlantic bluefish.
    (4) Atlantic bluefish harvested from party and charter boats or 
other vessels carrying more than one person may be commingled. 
Compliance with the daily possession limit will be determined by 
dividing the number of Atlantic bluefish on board by the number of 
persons aboard, provided, however, that if a person or persons aboard 
are fishing under a permit meeting the requirements of Sec. 648.4(a)(8), 
his/her catch shall not be counted for determining compliance with the 
possession limit, if it is maintained in the possession of such 
person(s). If there is a violation of the possession limit on board a 
vessel carrying more than one person, the violation shall be deemed to 
have been committed by the owner and/or operator.
    (b) Adjustment of the possession limit. After notice and 15 days 
opportunity for public comment, NMFS may adjust the possession limit 
within a range of 0 to 15 Atlantic bluefish based on a recommendation of 
the MAFMC and Commission. NMFS will publish a notice of any proposed 
adjustment, together with the basis for such adjustment, in the Federal 
Register. After consideration of any public comments, NMFS may adjust 
the possession limit by publishing a notice of adjustment in the Federal 
Register.


<R05>
Sec. 648.162  Catch monitoring, commercial controls, and gear restrictions.

    (a) The Bluefish Committee will review bluefish catch statistics, a 
projection of the commercial share for the next fishing year, and the 
most recent stock assessment prior to August 15th of each year. The 
Bluefish Committee will report to the MAFMC and the Commission.
    (b) The MAFMC and the Commission will review the report of the 
Bluefish Committee. If the report indicates that the commercial catch 
for the next fishing year will equal or exceed 20 percent of the total 
catch (recreational catch plus commercial landings) of Atlantic 
bluefish, the MAFMC and Commission will propose the commercial controls 
to be implemented at the start of the upcoming year. If the report 
indicates that the commercial catch will be greater than 17 percent but 
less than 20 percent of the total catch of Atlantic bluefish, or that 
the commercial share for the last full year is 50 percent greater than 
the previous year's commercial share, the MAFMC and Commission will 
determine whether commercial controls are necessary. In making such a 
determination the MAFMC and Commission will consider:
    (1) The most recent catch data.

[[Page 313]]

    (2) Trends in the fishery.
    (3) Any other relevant factors.
    (c) If the catch in the commercial fishery is projected to equal or 
exceed the 20 percent limit during the upcoming year, then a state 
allocation system will be implemented. This will entail the use of 
landings data from the most recent 10-year period for each state, to 
determine the average percentage of each state's coastwide commercial 
landings. These percentages will be used to determine the amount of the 
coastwide quota allocated to each state. Quotas will apply to landings 
in each state, regardless of where the bluefish were caught.
    (d) If whole Atlantic bluefish are processed into fillets at sea, 
then fillet weight will be converted to whole weight at the state of 
landing by multiplying fillet weight by 2.5. If whole Atlantic bluefish 
are headed and gutted at sea, then the conversion is accomplished by 
multiplying headed/gutted weight by 1.5.
    (e) If the MAFMC concludes that the increase in the commercial catch 
is attributable to the use of purse seines, pair trawls, or encircling 
(runaround) gillnets, then it will propose restrictions applicable to 
that gear type. In determining what restrictions are necessary to 
control the catch of Atlantic bluefish by commercial fishermen using 
these gear types, the MAFMC may consider:
    (1) Trip limits;
    (2) Area closures;
    (3) Banning the use of these gear types; or
    (4) Any other measures it deems appropriate.
    (f) The Regional Administrator will review any gear restrictions 
proposed by the MAFMC. If the Regional Administrator concurs that the 
proposed gear restrictions are consistent with the goals and objectives 
of the FMP, the national standards, and other applicable law, the 
Regional Administrator will recommend that NMFS publish a notice of the 
proposed restrictions in the Federal Register with a 30-day public 
comment period. After publication of such notice and after consideration 
of any public comments, NMFS may impose such restrictions by publishing 
a notice of gear restrictions in the Federal Register.
    (g) NMFS may rescind any gear restriction if it finds, based on the 
advice of the MAFMC through the process set forth in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section, that the restriction is no longer necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 648.163  Closure of the fishery.

    The Regional Administrator shall close the commercial fishery for 
Atlantic bluefish in the EEZ if the commercial fisheries for Atlantic 
bluefish have been closed in all Atlantic coastal states.

[59 FR 31943, June 21, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 10750, Mar. 10, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 649.3  Relation to other laws.

    (a) The relation of this part to other laws is set forth in 
Sec. 620.3 of this chapter.
    (b) Nothing in these regulations shall supersede more restrictive 
state management measures for American lobsters.


<R05>
Sec. 649.4  Vessel permits.

    (a) 1994 vessel permits. (1) Through April 30, 1995, any vessel of 
the United States fishing for American lobster in the EEZ must have been 
issued and carry on board a valid permit required by or issued under 
this part. The Regional Director may, by agreement with State agencies, 
recognize permits or licenses issued by those agencies endorsed for 
fishing for lobster in the EEZ, providing that such permitting programs 
accurately identify persons who fish in the EEZ, and that the Regional 
Director can either individually, or in concert with the state agency, 
act to suspend the permit or license for EEZ fishing for any violation 
under this part.
    (2) Alternate State EEZ permitting programs will be established 
through a letter of agreement between the Regional Director and the 
director of the State marine fisheries agency concerned. The letter of 
agreement will specify the information to be collected by the alternate 
EEZ permitting program and the mode and frequency of provision of that 
information to the Regional Director. The Regional Director will, in 
cooperation with the State director, arrange for notification of the 
existence and terms of any such agreements to the affected persons. 
Persons intending to fish in the EEZ should determine whether an 
alternate EEZ permitting program is in force for their state before 
applying for a Federal permit under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (3) Vessel owners or operators who apply for a fishing vessel permit 
under this section, or for a State permit endorsed for EEZ fishing under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, must agree, as a condition of the 
permit, that all the vessel's lobster fishing, catch, and gear (without 
regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, 
and without regard to where such lobster, lobster meats, or parts, or 
gear are possessed, taken or landed) will be subject to all the 
requirements of this part. All such fishing, catch, and gear will remain 
subject to any applicable state or local requirements. If a requirement 
of this part and a conservation measure required by state or local law 
differ, any vessel owner or operator permitted to fish in the EEZ

[[Page 316]]

must comply with the more restrictive requirement.
    (b) Limited access American lobster permits. From May 1, 1995, 
through December 31, 1999, any vessel of the United States that fishes 
for, possesses, or lands American lobster in or harvested from the EEZ 
must have been issued and carry on board a valid Federal limited access 
American lobster permit. This requirement does not apply to party, 
charter and dive boats that possess six or fewer American lobsters, not 
intended for or resulting in trade, barter or sale, per person aboard 
the vessel at any time, or to recreational vessels, and vessels that 
fish exclusively in state waters for American lobsters.
    (1) Eligibility in 1995. (i) To be eligible for a limited access 
permit for 1995, a vessel or the permit applicant must meet one of the 
following criteria:
    (A) The vessel was issued a Federal American lobster permit and 
landed American lobster prior to March 25, 1991, while in possession of 
the lobster permit.
    (B) To qualify for the limited access permit based on a federally 
endorsed state permit history, one of the following criteria must be 
met:
    (1) The permit applicant was issued a federally endorsed state 
American lobster permit, and landed American lobster prior to March 25, 
1991, and owned a vessel that landed American lobster prior to March 25, 
1991, while in possession of the lobster permit; or
    (2) The vessel was owned by a person who landed lobster prior to 
March 25, 1991, while in possession of a valid federally endorsed state 
American lobster permit, and the vessel was transferred to the current 
vessel owner in accordance with the exception to the presumption 
specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section; or
    (3) The permit applicant owned a vessel that landed American lobster 
prior to March 25, 1991, while under the operation of an individual with 
a valid federally endorsed state lobster permit; or
    (4) The permit applicant owned a vessel that landed American lobster 
prior to March 25, 1991, while the applicant held a valid signed written 
lease, recognized and authorized by the issuing state, granting the 
rights to a federally endorsed state lobster permit.
    (C) The vessel was under written agreement for construction or 
rerigging for directed American lobster fishing, or was under written 
contract for purchase as of March 25, 1991, and the applicant meets one 
of the eligibility criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) 
of this section. For the purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) all 
references to March 25, 1991, in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this 
section should be March 25, 1992.
    (D) The vessel is replacing a vessel that meets the criteria set 
forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
    (ii) No more than one vessel may qualify, at any one time, for a 
limited access American lobster permit based on that or another vessel's 
fishing and permit history. If more than one vessel owner claims 
eligibility for a limited access American lobster permit, based on one 
vessel's fishing and permit history, the Regional Director shall 
determine who is entitled to qualify for the limited access American 
lobster permit.
    (iii) A limited access American lobster permit for 1995 will not be 
issued unless an application for such permit is received by the Regional 
Director on or before December 31, 1995.
    (2) Eligibility in 1996 and thereafter. (i) To be eligible to renew 
or apply for a limited access lobster permit after 1995, a vessel or 
permit applicant must have been issued either a limited access lobster 
permit or a confirmation of permit history for the preceding year, or a 
vessel must be replacing a valid limited access American lobster permit 
or permit history confirmation from the preceding year. If more than one 
applicant claims eligibility to apply for a limited access American 
lobster permit based on one fishing and permit history, the Regional 
Director shall determine who is entitled to qualify for the limited 
access permit or permit history confirmation.
    (ii) Beginning January 1, 2000, any vessel of the United States that 
fishes for, possesses, or lands American lobster, in or harvested from 
the EEZ, must have been issued and carry on board a valid Federal 
American lobster permit. This requirement does not apply to party, 
charter and dive boats

[[Page 317]]

that possess six or fewer American lobsters, not intended for or 
resulting in trade, barter, or sale, per person aboard the vessel at any 
time, or to recreational vessels and vessels that fish exclusively in 
state waters for American lobsters. The eligibility requirements for 
limited access permits for the years 1996 - 1999 are not applicable for 
obtaining an American lobster permit for the year 2000 and thereafter.
    (3) Change in ownership. (i) The fishing and permit history of a 
vessel that qualifies based on issuance of a Federal lobster permit 
under paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (C) of this section is presumed to 
transfer with the vessel whenever it is bought, sold or otherwise 
transferred, unless there is a written agreement, signed by the 
transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, or other credible written 
evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller is retaining the vessel 
fishing and permit history for purposes of replacing the vessel.
    (ii) The fishing and permit history of a vessel owner and a vessel 
that qualifies based on issuance of a federally endorsed state lobster 
permit under paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(B) and (C) of this section is presumed 
to remain with such owner for any transfers of the vessel before and 
including March 25, 1991; and for any transfers of ownership of the 
vessel after March 25, 1991, the fishing and permit history necessary to 
qualify for a limited access lobster permit under paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i)(B) and (C) of this section is presumed to remain with the last 
owner of the vessel as of or prior to March 25, 1991, unless there is a 
written agreement, signed by the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, 
or other credible written evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller 
is transferring the fishing and permit history of a vessel necessary to 
qualify for a limited access lobster permit under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) 
or (C) of this section to the transferee/buyer.
    (4) Notification of eligibility for a limited access permit. (i) 
NMFS will attempt to notify all owners of vessels for which NMFS has 
credible evidence that they meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (ii) If a vessel owner has not been notified that the vessel is 
eligible to be issued a limited access American lobster permit, and the 
vessel owner believes that there is credible evidence that the vessel 
does qualify under the pertinent criteria, the vessel owner may apply 
for a limited access American lobster permit by submitting the 
information described in paragraphs (d) through (e) of this section. In 
the event the application is denied, the applicant may appeal as 
specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. If, through either of 
these procedures, the Regional Director determines that the vessel meets 
the eligibility criteria, a limited access American lobster permit will 
be issued to the vessel.
    (5) Appeal of denial of limited access American lobster permit or of 
permit category assignment. (i) Any applicant denied a limited access 
American lobster permit may appeal the denial to the Regional Director 
within 30 days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal must be based on 
one or more of the following grounds, must be in writing, and must state 
the grounds for the appeal:
    (A) The information used by the Regional Director was based on 
mistaken or incorrect data;
    (B) The applicant was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her 
control from meeting relevant criteria; or
    (C) The applicant has new or additional information.
    (ii) The Regional Director will appoint a designee who will make the 
initial decision on the appeal.
    (iii) The appellant may request a review of the initial decision by 
the Regional Director by so requesting, in writing, within 30 days of 
the notice of initial decision. If the appellant does not request a 
review of the initial decision within 30 days, the initial decision 
shall become the final administrative action of the Department of 
Commerce.
    (iv) Recommendations to the Regional Director by a hearing officer. 
A hearing officer shall be appointed by the Regional Director to review 
the initial decision. The hearing officer shall make findings and a 
recommendation to the Regional Director, which shall be advisory only.

[[Page 318]]

    (v) Upon receiving the findings and a recommendation, the Regional 
Director will issue a final decision on the appeal. The Regional 
Director's decision is the final administrative action of the Department 
of Commerce.
    (vi) Fishing during appeal. A vessel for which an appeal has been 
initiated and that was issued a 1994 Federal or federally endorsed state 
lobster permit, may fish for American lobster in the EEZ if the appeal 
is pending and the vessel has on board an authorizing letter from the 
Regional Director. If the appeal is finally denied, the Regional 
Director shall send a notice of final denial to the vessel owner; the 
authorizing letter becomes invalid 5 days after receipt of the notice of 
denial.
    (6) Confirmation of Permit History. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this part, a person who does not currently own a fishing 
vessel, but who has owned a qualifying vessel that has sunk, been 
destroyed, or transferred to another person, may apply for and receive a 
Confirmation of Permit History if the fishing and permit history of such 
vessel has been retained lawfully by the applicant. To be eligible to 
obtain a Confirmation of Permit History, the applicant must show that 
the qualifying vessel meets the eligibility requirements, as applicable, 
in this part. Issuance of a valid and current Confirmation of Permit 
History preserves the eligibility of the applicant to apply for or renew 
a limited access permit for a replacement vessel based on the qualifying 
vessel's fishing and permit history at a subsequent time, subject to the 
replacement provisions specified at Sec. 649.4. A Confirmation of Permit 
History must be applied for and received on an annual basis in order for 
the applicant to preserve the fishing rights and limited access 
eligibility of the qualifying vessel. If fishing privileges have been 
assigned or allocated previously under this part based on the qualifying 
vessel's fishing and permit history, the Confirmation of Permit History 
also preserves such fishing privileges. Any decision regarding the 
issuance of a Confirmation of Permit History for a qualifying vessel 
that has applied for or been issued previously a limited access permit 
under this part is a final agency action subject to judicial review 
under 5 U.S.C. 704. Applications for a Confirmation of Permit History 
shall be accepted by the Regional Director on or before December 31, 
1995. For subsequent years, applications must be received by the end of 
the calendar year in which the Confirmation of Permit History expires. 
Information requirements for the Confirmation of Permit History 
application shall be the same as those for a limited access permit with 
any request for information about the vessel being applicable to the 
qualifying vessel that has been sunk, destroyed, or transferred. Vessel 
permit applicants who hold a Confirmation of Permit History and who wish 
to obtain a vessel permit for a replacement vessel based upon the 
previous vessel history may do so pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (c) Condition. Vessel owners who apply for a permit under this 
section must agree, as a condition of the permit, that the vessel and 
vessel's fishing, catch, and pertinent gear (without regard to whether 
such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, and without 
regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, taken, or landed), are 
subject to all requirements of this part. The vessel and all such 
fishing, catch, and gear shall remain subject to all applicable state or 
local requirements. If a requirement of this part and a management 
measure required by state or local law differ, any vessel owner 
permitted to fish in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive 
requirement.
    (d) Vessel permit application. Applicants for a permit under this 
section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form 
obtained from the Regional Director. The application must be signed by 
the owner of the vessel, or the owner's authorized representative, and 
be submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days before the date 
on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. The 
Regional Director will notify the applicant of any deficiency in the 
application pursuant to this section. Applicants for 1995 limited access 
American lobster permits who have not been notified of eligibility by 
the Regional Director shall provide information with the application 
sufficient for

[[Page 319]]

the Regional Director to determine whether the vessel meets the 
eligibility requirements specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. Acceptable forms of proof include, but are not limited to, 
state weigh-out records, packout forms, and settlement sheets.
    (e) Information requirements. In addition to applicable information 
required to be provided by paragraph (d) of this section, an application 
for a Federal American lobster permit must contain at least the 
following information, and any other information required by the 
Regional Director: Vessel name; owner name, mailing address, and 
telephone number; U.S. Coast Guard documentation number and a copy of 
the vessel's U.S. Coast Guard documentation or, if undocumented, state 
registration number and a copy of the state registration; home port and 
principal port of landing; overall length; gross tonnage; net tonnage; 
engine horsepower; year the vessel was built; type of construction; type 
of propulsion; approximate fish-hold capacity; type of fishing gear used 
by the vessel; permit category; if the owner is a corporation, a copy of 
the Certificate of Incorporation; and the names and addresses of all 
shareholders owning 25 percent or more of the corporation's shares; if 
the owner is a partnership, a copy of the Partnership Agreement and the 
names and addresses of all partners; if there is more than one owner, 
names of all owners having more than a 25 percent interest; and name and 
signature of the owner or the owner's authorized representative.
    (f) Fees. The Regional Director may charge a fee to recover the 
administrative expense of issuing a permit required under this section. 
The amount of the fee shall be calculated in accordance with the 
procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining administrative 
costs of each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such 
costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee 
must accompany each application; if it does not, the application will be 
considered incomplete for purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (g) Issuance. (1) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904 
and under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the Regional Director shall 
issue a Federal American lobster vessel permit within 30 days of receipt 
of the application unless:
    (i) The applicant has failed to submit a completed application. An 
application is complete when all requested forms, information, 
documentation, and fees, if applicable, have been received; or
    (ii) The application was not received by the Regional Director by 
the deadlines set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section; or
    (iii) The applicant and applicant's vessel failed to meet all 
eligibility requirements described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section; or
    (iv) The applicant has failed to meet any other application 
requirements stated in this part.
    (2) Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed 
application, the Regional Director shall notify the applicant of the 
deficiency in the application. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (h) Expiration. A Federal American lobster permit will expire upon 
the renewal date specified in the permit.
    (i) Duration. A permit is valid until it is revoked, suspended, or 
modified under 15 CFR part 904, or until it otherwise expires, or 
ownership changes, or the applicant has failed to report any change in 
the information on the permit application to the Regional Director as 
specified in paragraph (l) of this section.
    (j) Replacement. Replacement permits, for an otherwise valid permit, 
may be issued by the Regional Director when requested in writing by the 
owner or authorized representative, stating the need for replacement, 
the name of the vessel, and the Federal Fisheries Permit number 
assigned. An application for a replacement permit will not be considered 
a new application. An appropriate fee may be charged for issuance of the 
replacement permit.

[[Page 320]]

    (l) Change in application information. Within 15 days after a change 
in the information contained in an application submitted under this 
section, a written notice of the change must be submitted to the 
Regional Director. If the written notice of the change in information is

    (p) Limited access American lobster permit renewal. To renew a 
limited access permit in 1996 and thereafter, a completed application 
must be received by the Regional Director by December 31 of the year in 
which the permit is required. Failure to renew a limited access American 
lobster permit or confirmation of permit history in any year prevents 
the renewal of such in subsequent years.
    (q) Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of limited access 
American lobster permits. If a vessel's limited access American lobster 
permit or confirmation of permit history is voluntarily relinquished to 
the Regional Director, or abandoned through failure to renew or 
otherwise, no limited access American lobster permit or confirmation of 
permit history may be reissued or renewed based on that vessel's 
history.

    (a) General. Beginning on January 1, 1995, any operator of a vessel 
issued a Federal limited access American lobster permit under 
Sec. 649.4(b), or any operator of a vessel of the United States that 
fishes for, possesses, or lands American lobsters, in or harvested from 
the EEZ must have been issued and carry on board a valid operator's 
permit issued under this section. This requirement does not apply to 
party, charter, and dive boats that possess six or fewer American 
lobsters, not intended for or resulting in trade, barter or sale, per 
person aboard the vessel at any time, or to recreational vessels, and 
vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for American lobsters.
    (b) Operator application. Applicants for a permit under this section 
must submit a completed permit application on an appropriate form 
obtained from the Regional Director. The application must be signed by 
the applicant and submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days 
prior to the date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made 
effective. The Regional Director will notify the applicant of any 
deficiency in the application, pursuant to this section.
    (c) Condition. Vessel operators who apply for an operator's permit 
under this section must agree, as a condition of this permit, that the 
operator and vessel's fishing, catch, crew size, and pertinent gear 
(without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of 
the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, 
taken, or landed), are subject to all requirements of this part while 
fishing in the EEZ or on board a vessel permitted under Sec. 649.4(b). 
The vessel and all such fishing, catch, and gear will remain subject to 
all applicable state or local requirements. Further, such operators must 
agree, as a condition of this permit, that if the permit is suspended or 
revoked pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, the operator cannot be on board any 
fishing vessel issued a Federal Fisheries Permit or any vessel subject 
to Federal fishing regulations while the vessel is at sea or engaged in 
offloading. If a requirement of this part and a management measure 
required by state or local law differ, any operator issued a permit 
under this part must comply with the more restrictive requirement.

each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and 
is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must 
accompany each application; if it does not, the application will be 
considered incomplete for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Issuance. Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, 
the Regional Director shall issue an operator's permit within 30 days of 
receipt of a completed application, if the criteria specified in this 
section are met. Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly executed 
application, the Regional Director will notify the applicant of the 
deficiency in the application. If the applicant fails to correct the 
deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the 
application will be considered abandoned.
    (g) Expiration. A Federal operator permit will expire upon the 
renewal date specified in the permit.
    (h) Duration. A permit is valid until it is revoked, suspended, or 
modified under 15 CFR part 904, or otherwise expires, or the applicant 
has failed to report a change in the information on the permit 
application to the Regional Director as specified in paragraph (k) of 
this section.
    (i) Replacement. Replacement permits, for otherwise valid permits, 
may be issued by the Regional Director when requested in writing by the 
applicant, stating the need for replacement and the Federal operator 
permit number assigned. An applicant for a replacement permit must also 
provide two color passport-size photos of the applicant. An application 
for a replacement permit will not be considered a new application. An 
appropriate fee may be charged.
    (j) Transfer. Permits issued under this section are not transferable 
or assignable. A permit is valid only for the person to whom it is 
issued.
    (k) Change in application information. Notice of a change in the

writing to, and received by, the Regional Director within 15 days of the 
change in information. If written notice of the change in information is 
not received by the Regional Director within 15 days, the permit is 
void.
    (l) Alteration. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (m) Display. Any permit issued under this part must be maintained in 
legible condition and displayed for inspection upon request by any 
authorized officer.
    (n) Sanctions. Vessel operators with suspended or revoked permits 
may not be on board a federally permitted fishing vessel in any capacity 
while the vessel is at sea or engaged in offloading. Procedures 
governing enforcement related permit sanctions and denials are found at 
subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.

the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining the administrative costs of 
each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and 
is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must 
accompany each application; if it does not, the application will be 
considered incomplete for purposes of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) Issuance. Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, 
the Regional Director will issue a permit at any time during the fishing 
year to an applicant, unless the applicant has failed to submit a 
completed application. An application is complete when all requested 
forms, information, and documentation have been received. Upon receipt 
of an incomplete or improperly executed application, the Regional 
Director will notify the applicant of the deficiency in the application. 
If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 days 
following the date of notification, the application will be considered 
abandoned.
    (f) Expiration. A Federal dealer permit will expire upon the renewal 
date specified in the permit.
    (g) Duration. A permit is valid until it is revoked, suspended, or

this section must be maintained in legible condition and displayed for 
inspection upon request by any authorized officer.
    (m) Federal versus state requirements. If a requirement of this part 
differs from a fisheries management measure required by state law, any

one holding a valid State of Maine American lobster permit or license 
and fishing under the provisions of and in the areas designated in 
Sec. 649.24, unless the American lobsters were harvested by a vessel 
without a Federal American lobster permit and that fishes for American 
lobster exclusively in state waters.
    (5) Beginning January 1, 1995, to be, or act as, an operator of a 
vessel fishing for or possessing American lobsters in or from the EEZ, 
or issued a Federal American lobster permit under Sec. 649.4 (b), 
without having been issued and possessing a valid operator's permit 
issued under Sec. 649.5.
    (6) Assault, resist, oppose, impede, harass, intimidate, or

(d)(2), except as provided in Sec. 649.23(a)(2), (b)(2), (c)(2), and 
(d)(2).
    (12) Fish, or be in the areas described in Sec. 649.23(a)(1), 
(b)(1), and (c)(1) on a fishing vessel with lobster pot gear during the

recreational vessel.
    (e) Presumption. American lobsters that are possessed, or landed at 
or prior to the time when the American lobsters are received by a 
dealer, or American lobsters that are possessed by a dealer, are 
presumed to be harvested from the EEZ or by a vessel with a Federal 
lobster permit. A preponderance of all submitted evidence that such 
American lobsters were harvested by a vessel without a Federal American 
lobster permit and fishing exclusively for American lobsters in state 
waters will be sufficient to rebut the presumption.
    (f) The possession of egg-bearing female American lobsters, V-
notched female American lobsters, or American lobsters that are smaller 
than the minimum size set forth in Sec. 649.20(b), will be prima facie 
evidence that such American lobsters were taken or imported in violation 
of these regulations. Evidence that such American lobsters were 
harvested by a vessel not holding a permit under this part and fishing 
exclusively within state or foreign waters will be sufficient to rebut 
the presumption.

requirements of this part for the conduct of experimental fishing 
beneficial to the management of the American lobster resource or 
fishery.
    (b) The Regional Director may not grant such exemption unless it is 
determined that the purpose, design, and administration of the exemption 
is consistent with the objectives of the FMP, the provisions of the 
Magnuson Act, and other applicable law, and that granting the exemption 
will not:
    (1) Have a detrimental effect on the American lobster resource and 
fishery; or
    (2) Create significant enforcement problems.
    (c) Each vessel participating in any exempted experimental fishing 
activity is subject to all provisions of this part, except those 
necessarily relating to the purpose and nature of the exemption. The 
exemption will be specified in a letter issued by the Regional Director 
to each vessel participating in the exempted activity. This letter must 
be carried aboard the vessel seeking the benefit of such exemption.

                           Management Measures


<R05>
Sec. 649.41  Purpose and scope.

    The purpose of this subpart is to specify the requirements and 
framework procedures for implementing the Stock Rebuilding Program, 
intended to eliminate overfishing in any resource areas.


<R05>
Sec. 649.42  Stock rebuilding program requirements and time frame.

    (a) General. (1) The Council has until July 20, 1995 to submit to 
NMFS management measures to achieve the objectives of the FMP. The 
measures must be designed to achieve the FMP objectives for reducing 
fishing mortality within 5 years for the stock in the Gulf of Maine 
segment of the fishery and 10 years for the Southern New England segment 
of the stock. Such measures may be submitted through the Magnuson Act 
amendment process or through the first-year area management framework 
specifications in Sec. 649.43.
    (2) In developing such management measures, the Council shall submit 
management measures to reduce fishing mortality in each of four 
management areas specified in paragraph (b) of this section. These 
management measures shall be implemented according to the first-year 
area management framework specifications in Sec. 649.43.
    (3) If the Council has not submitted management measures sufficient 
to achieve the objectives of the FMP on or before July 20, 1995, the 
Secretary shall determine, according to provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1854(c), 
whether to prepare an amendment to the FMP.
    (b) Management areas. The Stock Rebuilding Program to be submitted 
by the Council shall be developed based on the status of stock of 
American lobsters and management considerations for each of the areas 
described and defined in this paragraph (b) (see Figures 2 and 3 of this 
part).

    (b) After receiving the recommendations of the EMTs, the Council 
shall determine what management measures are necessary for each 
management area, in order to achieve the objectives of stock rebuilding 
specified in the FMP. For the management measures the Council determines 
are necessary to meet FMP objectives, the Council shall provide 
appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis of the 
determinations. The Council shall make these determinations over the 
span of at least two Council meetings and provide the public with 
advance notice of, and opportunity to comment

[[Page 332]]

on, the determinations and the analyses before making final 
recommendations to be submitted to NMFS. The Council's recommendation on 
necessary management measures may come from one or more of the following 
categories:
    (1) Minimum-size changes;
    (2) A maximum-size limit;
    (3) Trap limits;
    (4) Seasonal closures of one or more management areas;
    (5) Closed areas or zones within a management area;
    (6) Restrictions on allowable fishing time;
    (7) Restrictions on allowable catches;
    (8) Permitting restrictions;
    (9) Additional restrictions on gear;
    (10) Overfishing definition;
    (11) Limitations on participation in the fishery in accordance with 
the control date guidelines listed below. These guidelines will apply 
until a stock rebuilding program is established.
    (i) It is the intent of the Council that in the event that a system 
of assigning fishing rights is developed as part of the FMP, such 
assignments shall be based upon historical levels of participation in 
the fishery prior to March 25, 1991, with consideration for recent 
investments that have not yet been reflected in measures of 
participation.
    (ii) New or re-rigged vessels will be given consideration in the 
assignment of fishing rights if:
    (A) They were under construction or re-rigging for directed lobster 
fishing as of March 25, 1991, as evidenced by written construction 
contracts, work orders, equipment purchases, or other evidence of 
substantial investment and intent to participate in the lobster fishery; 
and
    (B) They possessed an American lobster permit and landed lobster 
prior to March 25, 1992.
    (iii) The public is further notified that it is the intent of the 
Council that historical participation will transfer with a vessel, for 
transfers made after March 25, 1991, unless such transfer is accompanied 
by a written document indication the agreement of both buyer and seller 
that any future fishing rights applicable to that vessel are not being 
transferred with the vessel.
    (iv) The Council further intends that any system of assigning 
fishing rights will take into consideration the following concerns 
relative to individuals or corporations that have sold a vessel within 
the time that may be chosen to determine historical fishing rights:
    (A) The degree of economic dependence upon the lobster fishery 
including, but not limited to, the percentage of income derived from the 
lobster fishery;
    (B) Extent of past participation in the lobster fishery; and
    (C) Demonstration of intent prior to March 25, 1991, to re-enter the 
lobster fishery with a different vessel.
    (12) Any other restrictions that the Council may designate for the 
purpose of reducing or controlling fishing mortality rates, except that 
an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system would require a full FMP 
amendment.
    (c) After developing necessary management measures and receiving 
public testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation to the 
Regional Director on or before July 20, 1995. The Council's 
recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if management 
measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and a recommendation 
to the Regional Director on whether to publish the management measures 
as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management measures 
should be published as a final rule, the Council must consider at least 
the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor 
considered:
    (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Council's recommended management measures;
    (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; and

[[Page 333]]

    (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted, following their promulgation as a final rule.
    (d) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or 
additions to management measures, after reviewing the Council's 
recommendation and supporting information:
    (1) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended 
management measures and determines that the recommended management 
measures may be published as a final rule, based on the factors 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the action will be published 
in the Federal Register as a final rule; or
    (2) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, the action will be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if the Regional Director concurs with the Council 
recommendation, the action will be published as a final rule in the 
Federal Register; or
    (3) If the Regional Director does not concur, the Council will be 
notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (e) At any time, the Council may make other adjustments to 
management measures implemented under this part pursuant to the 
provisions in Sec. 649.44.
    (f) Nothing in this section is meant to diminish the authority of 
the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of the 
Magnuson Act.


<R05>
Sec. 649.44  Framework specifications.

    (a) Annually, upon request from the Council, the Regional Director 
will provide the Council with information of the status of the American 
lobster resource, based on the most recent stock assessment report.
    (b) The Council and Atlantic States Fisheries Commission, through 
consultation with the ASMFC Lobster Scientific Committee within the 
stock assessment process and with the EMTs, shall continue to monitor 
the effectiveness of the Stock Rebuilding Program and to ensure, to the 
extent possible, that regional measures (within a Management Area) do 
not shift costs from one Management Area to another.
    (c) In addition, the EMTs, on at least an annual basis, shall 
determine the extent to which the objectives of the FMP are being 
achieved and shall make recommendations to the Council for further 
management actions, if required.
    (d) After receiving the EMT recommendations, the Council shall 
determine whether adjustments to, or additional management measures are 
necessary to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP. After considering 
the EMT's recommendations, or at any other time, if the Council 
determines that adjustments to, or additional management measures are 
necessary, it shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions 
over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council shall 
provide the appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis 
for its recommendation, utilizing the most current catch, effort, and 
other relevant data from the fishery. The Council shall provide the 
public with advance notice of the availability of both the proposals and 
the analyses, and opportunity to comment on them prior to, and at, the 
second Council meeting. The Council's recommendation on adjustments or 
additions to management measures may come from one or more of the 
following categories:
    (1) Minimum-size changes;
    (2) A maximum-size limit;
    (3) Trap limits;
    (4) Seasonal closures of one or more management areas;
    (5) Closed areas or zones within a management area;
    (6) Restrictions on allowable fishing time;
    (7) Restrictions on allowable catches;
    (8) Permitting restrictions;
    (9) Additional restrictions on gear;
    (10) Overfishing definition;
    (11) Limitations on participation in the fishery in accordance with 
the control date guidelines contained in Sec. 649.44(b)(11). These 
guidelines will apply until a stock rebuilding program is established.
    (12) Any other restrictions which the Council may designate for the 
purpose

[[Page 334]]

of reducing or controlling fishing mortality rates, except that an 
Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system would require a full FMP 
amendment.
    (e) The Council may develop a recommendation on measures to address 
gear conflicts as defined under 50 CFR 600.10 in accordance with the 
procedure specified in Sec. 648.55(d) and (e).
    (f) After developing management actions and receiving public 
testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation to the Regional 
Director. The Council's recommendation must include supporting rationale 
and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and 
a recommendation to the Regional Director on whether to publish the 
management measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the 
management measures should be published as a final rule, the Council 
must consider at least the following factors and provide support and 
analysis for each factor considered:
    (1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended 
management measures are based allows for adequate time to publish a 
proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire 
harvest/fishing season;
    (2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for 
participation by the public and members of the affected industry in the 
development of the Council's recommended management measures;
    (3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource or to 
impose management measures to resolve gear conflicts; and
    (4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management 
measures adopted, following their promulgation as a final rule.
    (g) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or 
additions to management measures, after reviewing the Council's 
recommendation and supporting information:
    (1) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended 
management measures and determines that the recommended management 
measures may be published as a final rule, based on the factors 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the action will be published 
in the Federal Register as a final rule; or
    (2) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's 
recommendation and determines that the recommended management measures 
should be published first as a proposed rule, the action will be 
published as a proposed rule in the Federal Register. After additional 
public comment, if the Regional Director concurs with the Council 
recommendation, the action will be published as a final rule in the 
Federal Register; or
    (3) If the Regional Director does not concur, the Council will be 
notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
    (h) Nothing in this section shall impair the authority of the 
Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of the Magnuson 
Act.

Sec. 654.20  Seasons.

    (a) Closed season. No person may possess a stone crab in the 
management area from 12:01 a.m., local time, May 16, through 12 p.m. 
midnight, local time, October 14, each year. Holding a stone crab in a 
trap in the water during a soak period or during a removal period (see 
paragraph (b) of this section), or during any extension thereto, is not

[[Page 340]]

deemed possession, provided that, if the trap is removed from the water 
during such period, such crab is returned immediately to the water with 
its claws unharvested.
    (b) Placement of traps. (1) Prior to the fishing season. The period 
of October 5 through October 14 is established as a trap soak period. A 
stone crab trap may be placed in the management area not earlier than 1 
hour before sunrise on October 5.
    (2) After the fishing season. The period of May 16 through May 20 is 
established as a trap removal period. A stone crab trap must be removed 
from the management area not later than 1 hour after sunset on May 20, 
unless an extension to the removal period is granted under paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section and the extension authorization is carried 
aboard the fishing vessel as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (i) An extension of the removal period may be granted by Florida in 
accordance with Rule 46-13.002(2)(b), Florida Administrative Code, in 
effect as of April 14, 1995. This incorporation by reference was 
approved by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be 
obtained from the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission, 2540 Executive 
Center Circle West, Suite 106, Tallahassee, FL 32301; telephone: 904-

Director, or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol 
Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC.
    (ii) The extension authorization must be carried aboard the fishing 
vessel. The operator of a fishing vessel must present the authorization 
for inspection upon request of an authorized officer.
    (c) Possession of stone crab traps. A stone crab trap may not be 
possessed in the management area from the end of the trap removal 
period, or an extension thereto, to the beginning of the trap soak 
period, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. A stone crab 
trap, float, or rope in the management area during this period will be 
considered unclaimed or abandoned property and may be disposed of in any 
manner considered appropriate by the Assistant Administrator or an 
authorized officer. An owner of such trap, float, or rope remains 
subject to appropriate civil penalties.


<R05>
Sec. 654.21  Harvest limitations.

    (a) Claw size. No person may remove from a stone crab in or from the 
management area, or possess in the management area, a claw with a 
propodus measuring less than 2.75 inches (7.0 cm), measured in a 
straight line from the elbow to the tip of the lower immovable finger. 
The propodus is the largest section of the claw assembly that has both a 
movable and immovable finger and is located farthest from the body when 
the entire appendage is extended. (See Appendix A, Figure 1, of this 
part.)
    (b) Egg-bearing stone crabs. An egg-bearing stone crab in or from 
the management area must be returned immediately to the water unharmed--
without removal of a claw. An egg-bearing stone crab may not be stripped 
of its eggs or otherwise molested.
    (c) Holding stone crabs. A live stone crab in or from the management 
area may be held aboard a vessel until such time as a legal-sized claw 
is removed, provided it is held in a container that is shaded from 
direct sunlight and it is wet with sea water as necessary to keep it in 
a damp condition. Containers holding stone crabs must be stacked in a 
manner that does not compress the crabs. A stone crab body from which a 
legal-sized claw has been removed must be returned to the sea before the 
vessel reaches shore or a port or dock.


<R05>
Sec. 654.22  Gear restrictions.

    (a) Biodegradable panels. A stone crab trap used or possessed in the 
management area must have a panel constructed of wood or cotton and 
located on a side of the trap at least two slats above the bottom, or on 
the top of the trap, which, when removed, will leave an opening in the 
trap measuring at least 2.5 inches by 5 inches (6.35 cm by 12.7 cm).
    (b) Daylight hours. A stone crab trap in the management area may be 
pulled or tended during daylight hours only--that is, from 1 hour before 
sunrise to 1 hour after sunset.

[[Page 341]]

    (c) Gear belonging to others. No fisherman may willfully tend, open, 
pull, or otherwise molest another fisherman's trap, buoy, or line in the 
management area without the prior written consent of that fisherman.


<R05>
Sec. 654.23  Southwest Florida seasonal trawl closure.

    From January 1 to 1 hour after sunset (local time) May 20, each

of this section, or as soon as practicable thereafter, NMFS will notify 
the applicant in writing of the decision to grant or deny the EFP and, 
if denied, the reasons for the denial. Grounds for denial of an EFP 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) The applicant has failed to disclose material information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with his or her application.
    (ii) According to the best scientific information available, the 
harvest to be conducted under the permit would detrimentally affect any 
species of fish in a significant way.
    (iii) Issuance of the EFP would inequitably allocate fishing 
privileges among domestic fishermen or would have economic allocation as 
its sole purpose.
    (iv) Activities to be conducted under the EFP would be inconsistent 
with the intent of this section or the management objectives of the FMP.
    (v) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit.
    (vi) The activity proposed under the EFP would create a significant 
enforcement problem.

If the permit is granted, NMFS will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register describing the experimental fishing to be conducted under the 
EFP. The Regional Director may attach terms and conditions to the EFP 
consistent with the purpose of the experiment including, but not limited 
to:
    (i) The maximum amount of each species that can be harvested and 
landed during the term of the EFP, including trip limits, where 
appropriate.
    (ii) The number, sizes, names, and identification numbers of the

under an EFP.
    (vi) Data reporting requirements.
    (vii) Such other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance 
with the purposes of the EFP consistent with the objectives of the FMP.
    (f) Duration. Unless otherwise specified in the EFP or a superseding 
notice or regulation, an EFP is effective for no longer than 1 year, 
unless revoked, suspended, or modified. EFPs may be renewed following 
the application procedures in this section.
    (g) Alteration. Any EFP that has been altered, erased, or mutilated 
is invalid.
    (h) Transfer. EFPs issued under subparts B through F of this part 
are not transferable or assignable. An EFP is valid only for the 
vessel(s) for which it is issued.
    (i) Inspection. Any EFP issued under subparts B through F of this 
part must be carried aboard the vessel(s) for which it was issued. The 
EFP must be presented for inspection upon request of any authorized 
officer.
    (j) Sanctions. Failure of the holder of an EFP to comply with the 
terms and conditions of an EFP, the provisions of subparts A through F 
of this part, any other applicable provision of this part,

[[Page 357]]

the Magnuson Act, or any other regulation promulgated thereunder, is 
grounds for revocation, suspension, or modification of the EFP with 
respect to all persons and vessels conducting activities under the EFP. 
Any action taken to revoke, suspend, or modify an EFP will be governed 
by 15 CFR part 904 subpart D. Other sanctions available under the 
statute will be applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 660.27  Exemptions for longline fishing prohibited areas; procedures.

    (a) An exemption permitting a person to use longline gear to fish in 
a portion(s) of the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area will be 
issued to a person who can document that he or she:
    (1) Currently owns a Hawaii longline limited access permit issued 
under this part and registered for use with his or her vessel.
    (2) Before 1970, was the owner or operator of a vessel when that 
vessel landed Pacific pelagic management unit species taken on longline 
gear in an area that is now within the Hawaii longline fishing 
prohibited area.
    (3) Was the owner or operator of a vessel that landed Pacific 
pelagic management unit species taken on longline gear in an area that 
is now within the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area, in at least 5 
calendar years after 1969, which need not be consecutive.
    (4) In any one of the 5 calendar years, was the owner or operator of 
a vessel that harvested at least 80 percent of its total landings, by 
weight, of longline-caught Pacific pelagic management unit species in an 
area that is now in the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited area.
    (b) Each exemption shall specify the portion(s) of the Hawaii 
longline fishing prohibited area, bounded by longitudinal and 
latitudinal lines drawn to include each statistical area, as appearing 
on Hawaii State Commercial Fisheries Charts, in which the exemption 
holder made the harvest documented for the exemption application under 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (c) Each exemption is valid only within the portion(s) of the Hawaii 
longline fishing prohibited area specified on the exemption.
    (d) A person seeking an exemption under this section must submit an 
application and supporting documentation to the Pacific Area Office at 
least 15 days before the desired effective date of the exemption.
    (e) If the Regional Director determines that a gear conflict has 
occurred and is likely to occur again in the Hawaii longline fishing 
prohibited area between a vessel used by a person holding an exemption 
under this section and a non-longline vessel, the Regional Director may 
prohibit all longline fishing in the Hawaii longline fishing prohibited 
area around the island where the conflict occurred, or in portions 
thereof, upon notice to each holder of an exemption who would be 
affected by such a prohibition.
    (f) The Council will consider information provided by persons with 
Hawaii longline limited access permits issued under this part who 
believe they have experienced extreme financial hardship resulting from 
the Hawaii longline area closure, and will consider recommendations of 
the Pelagic Advisory Review Board to assess whether exemptions under 
this section should continue to be allowed, and, if appropriate, revise 
the qualifying criteria in paragraph (a)

[[Page 362]]

of this section to permit additional exemptions.
    (1) If additional exemptions are needed, the Council will advise the 
Regional Director in writing of its recommendation, including criteria 
by which financial hardships will be mitigated, while retaining the 
effectiveness of the longline fishing prohibited area.
    (2) Following a review of the Council's recommendation and 
supporting rationale, the Regional Director may:
    (i) Reject the Council's recommendation, in which case written 
reasons will be provided by the Regional Director to the Council for the 
rejection; or
    (ii) Concur with the Council's recommendation and, after finding 
that it is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Pelagics FMP, 
the national standards, and other applicable law, initiate rulemaking to 
implement the Council's recommendations.


<R05>
Sec. 660.28  Conditions for at-sea observer coverage.

    (a) NMFS shall advise the permit holder or the designated agent of 
any observer requirement at least 24 hours (not including weekends and 
Federal holidays) before any trip for which NMFS received timely notice 
in compliance with these regulations.
    (b) The ``Notice Prior to Fishing Trip'' requirements in this 
subpart commit the permit holder to the representations in the notice. 
The notice can be modified by the permit holder or designated agent 
because of changed circumstance, if the Regional Director is promptly 
provided a modification to the notice that complies with the notice 
requirements. The notice will also be considered modified if the 
Regional Director and the permit holder or designated agent agree to 
placement changes.
    (c) When NMFS notifies the permit holder or designated agent of the 
obligation to carry an observer in response to a notification under this 
subpart, or as a condition of an EFP issued under Sec. 660.17, the 
vessel may not engage in the fishery without taking the observer.
    (d) A NMFS observer shall arrive at the observer's assigned vessel 
30 minutes before the time designated for departure in the notice or the 
notice as modified, and will wait 1 hour for departure.
    (e) A permit holder must accommodate a NMFS observer assigned under 
these regulations. The Regional Director's office, and not the observer, 
will address any concerns raised over accommodations.
    (f) The permit holder, vessel operator, and crew must cooperate with 
the observer in the performance of the observer's duties, including:
    (1) Allowing for the embarking and debarking of the observer.
    (2) Allowing the observer access to all areas of the vessel 
necessary to conduct observer duties.
    (3) Allowing the observer access to communications equipment and 
navigation equipment as necessary to perform observer duties.
    (4) Allowing the observer access to VMS units to verify operation, 
obtain data, and use the communication capabilities of the units for 
official purposes.
    (5) Providing accurate vessel locations by latitude and longitude or 
loran coordinates, upon request by the observer.
    (6) Providing sea turtle, marine mammal, or sea bird specimens as 
requested.
    (7) Notifying the observer in a timely fashion when commercial 
fishing operations are to begin and end.
    (g) The permit holder, operator, and crew must comply with other 
terms and conditions to ensure the effective deployment and use of 
observers that the Regional Director imposes by written notice.
    (h) The permit holder must ensure that assigned observers are 
provided living quarters comparable to crew members and are provided the 
same meals, snacks, and amenities as are normally provided to other 
vessel personnel. A mattress or futon on the floor or a cot is not 
acceptable if a regular bunk is provided to any crew member, unless 
other arrangements are approved in advance by the Regional Director.
    (i) Reimbursement requirements are as follows:
    (1) Upon observer verification of vessel accommodations and the 
number of

[[Page 363]]

assigned days on board, NMFS will reimburse vessel owners a reasonable 
amount for observer subsistence as determined by the Regional Director.
    (2) If requested and properly documented, NMFS will reimburse the 
vessel owner for the following:
    (i) Communications charges incurred by the observer.
    (ii) Lost fishing time arising from a seriously injured or seriously 
ill observer, provided that notification of the nature of the emergency 
is transmitted to the Fisheries Observer Branch, Southwest Region, NMFS 
(see address for Southwest Regional Director) at the earliest practical 
time. NMFS will reimburse the owner only for those days during which the 
vessel is unable to fish as a direct result of helping the NMFS employee 
who is seriously injured or seriously ill. Lost fishing time is based on 
time travelling to and from the fishing grounds and any documented out-
of-pocket expenses for medical services. Payment will be based on the 
current target fish market prices and that vessel's average target fish 
catch retained per day at sea for the previous 2 years, but shall not 
exceed $5,000 per day or $20,000 per claim. Detailed billing with 
receipts and supporting records are required for allowable communication 
and lost fishing time claims. The claim must be completed in ink, 
showing the claimant's printed name, address, vessel name, observer 
name, trip dates, days observer on board, an explanation of the charges, 
and claimant's dated signature with a statement verifying the claim to 
be true and correct. Requested reimbursement claims must be submitted to 
the Fisheries Observer Branch, Southwest Region, NMFS. NMFS will not 
process reimbursement invoices and documentation submitted more than 120 
days after the occurrence.
    (j) If a vessel normally has cabins for crew members, female 
observers on a vessel with an all-male crew must be accommodated either 
in a single person cabin or, if NMFS concludes that adequate privacy can 
be ensured by installing a curtain or other temporary divider, in a two-
person shared cabin. If the vessel normally does not have cabins for 
crew members, alternative accommodations must be approved by NMFS. If a 
cabin assigned to a female observer does not have its own toilet and 
shower facilities that can be provided for the exclusive use of the 
observer, or if no cabin is assigned, then arrangements for sharing 
common facilities must be established and approved in advance by NMFS.


<R05>
Sec. 660.29  Port privileges and transiting for unpermitted U.S. longline vessels.

    A U.S. longline fishing vessel that does not have a permit under 
subpart B of this part may enter waters of the fishery management area 
with Pacific pelagic management unit species on board, but may not land 
or transship any management unit species on board the vessel. The 
vessel's longline gear must be stowed or secured so it is rendered 
unusable during the time the vessel is in those waters.


<R05>
Sec. 660.30  Prohibition of drift gillnetting.

    Fishing with drift gillnets in the fishery management area is 
prohibited, except where authorized by an EFP issued under Sec. 660.17.


<R05>
Sec. 660.31  Framework adjustments to management measures.

    (a) Introduction. Adjustments in management measures may be made 
through rulemaking if new information demonstrates that there are 
biological, social, or economic concerns in the fishery. The following 
framework process authorizes the implementation of measures that may 
affect the operation of the fisheries, gear, harvest guidelines, or 
changes in catch and/or effort.
    (b) Annual report. By June 30 of each year, the Council-appointed 
Pelagics Plan Team will prepare an annual report on the fisheries in the 
management area. The report shall contain, among other things, 
recommendations for Council action and an assessment of the urgency and 
effects of such action(s).
    (c) Procedure for established measures. (1) Established measures are 
management measures that, at some time, have been included in 
regulations implementing the FMP, and for which the impacts have been 
evaluated in Council/NMFS documents in the context of current 
conditions.

[[Page 364]]

    (2) Following the framework procedures of Amendment 7 to the 
Pelagics FMP, the Council may recommend to the Regional Director that 
established measures be modified, removed, or re-instituted. Such 
recommendation shall include supporting rationale and analysis, and 
shall be made after advance public notice, public discussion, and 
consideration of public comment. NMFS may implement the Council's 
recommendation by rulemaking if approved by the Regional Director.
    (d) Procedure for new measures. (1) New measures are management 
measures that have not been included in regulations implementing the 
FMP, or for which the impacts have not been evaluated in Council/NMFS 
documents in the context of current conditions.
    (2) Following the framework procedures of Amendment 7 to the 
Pelagics FMP, the Council will publicize, including by Federal Register 
notice, and solicit public comment on, any proposed new management 
measure. After a Council meeting at which the measure is discussed, the 
Council will consider recommendations and prepare a Federal Register 
notice summarizing the Council's deliberations, rationale, and analysis 
for the preferred action, and the time and place for any subsequent 
Council meeting(s) to consider the new measure. At subsequent public 
meeting(s), the Council will consider public comments and other 
information received to make a recommendation to the Regional Director 
about any new measure. NMFS may implement the Council's recommendation 
by rulemaking if approved by the Regional Director.

             Subpart D--Western Pacific Crustacean Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 660.41  Permits.

    (a) Applicability. (1) The owner of any vessel used to fish for 
lobster in Permit Area 1 must have a limited access permit issued for 
such vessel. Only one permit will be assigned to any vessel.
    (2) The owner of any vessel used to fish for lobster in Permit Area 
2 or Permit Area 3, must have a permit issued for such a vessel.
    (3) No vessel owner will have permits for a single vessel to harvest 
lobsters in Permit Areas 1 and 2 at the same time.
    (4) A limited access permit is valid for fishing only in Permit Area 
1.
    (b) General requirements. General requirements governing application 
information, issuance, fees, expiration, replacement, transfer, 
alteration, display, sanctions, and appeals for permits issued under 
this section, as applicable, are contained in Sec. 660.13.
    (c) Application. An application for a permit required under this 
section will be submitted to the Pacific Area Office as described in 
Sec. 660.13. If the application for a limited access permit is submitted 
on behalf of a partnership or corporation, the application must be 
accompanied by a supplementary information sheet obtained from the 
Pacific Area Office and contain the names and mailing addresses of all 
partners or shareholders and their respective percentage of ownership in 
the partnership or corporation.
    (d) Number of permits. A maximum of 15 limited access permits can be 
valid at any time.
    (e) Transfer or sale of limited access permits. (1) Permits may be 
transferred or sold, but no one individual, partnership, or corporation 
will be allowed to hold a whole or partial interest in more than one 
permit, except that an owner who qualifies initially for more than one 
permit may maintain those permits, but may not obtain additional 
permits. Layering of partnerships or corporations shall not insulate a 
permit holder from this requirement.
    (2) If 50 percent or more of the ownership of a limited access 
permit is passed to persons other than those listed on the permit 
application, the Pacific Area Office must be notified of the change in 
writing and provided copies of the appropriate documents confirming the 
changes within 30 days.
    (3) Upon the transfer or sale of a limited access permit, a new 
application must be submitted by the new permit owner according to the 
requirements of Sec. 660.13. The transferred permit is not valid until 
this process is completed.
    (f) Replacement of a vessel covered by a limited access permit. A 
limited access permit issued under this section may, without limitation 
as to frequency, be transferred by the permit holder to a

[[Page 365]]

replacement vessel owned by that person.
    (g) Issuance of limited access permits to future applicants.
    (1) The Regional Director may issue limited access permits under 
this section when fewer than 15 vessel owners hold active permits.
    (2) When the Regional Director has determined that limited access 
permits may be issued to new persons, a notice shall be placed in the 
Federal Register, and other means will be used to notify prospective 
applicants of the opportunity to obtain permits under the limited access 
management program.
    (3) A period of 90 days will be provided after publication of the 
Federal Register notice for submission of new applications for a limited 
access permit.
    (4) Limited access permits issued under this paragraph (g) will be 
issued first to applicants qualifying under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this 
section. If the number of limited access permits available is greater 
than the number of applicants that qualify under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of 
this section, then limited access permits will be issued to applicants 
under paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (i) First priority to receive limited access permits under this 
paragraph (g) goes to owners of vessels that were used to land lobster 
from Permit Area 1 during the period 1983 through 1990, and who were 
excluded from the fishery by implementation of the limited access 
system. If there are insufficient permits for all such applicants, the 
new permits shall be issued by the Regional Director through a lottery.
    (ii) Second priority to receive limited access permits under 
paragraph (g) goes to owners with the most points, based upon a point 
system. If two or more owners have the same number of points and there 
are insufficient permits for all such owners, the Regional Director 
shall issue the permits through a lottery. Under the point system, 
limited access permits will be issued, in descending order, beginning 
with owners who have the most points and proceeding to owners who have 
the least points, based on the following:
    (A) Three points shall be assigned for each calendar year after 
August 8, 1985, that the applicant was the operator of a vessel that was 
used to land lobster from Permit Area 1.
    (B) Two points shall be assigned for each calendar year or partial 
year after August 8, 1985, that the applicant was the owner, operator, 
or crew member of a vessel engaged in either commercial fishing in 
Permit Area 2 for lobster, or fishing in Permit Area 1 for fish other 
than lobster with an intention to sell all or part of the catch.
    (C) One point shall be assigned for each calendar year or partial 
year after August 8, 1985, that the applicant was the owner, operator, 
or crew member of a vessel engaged in any other commercial fishing in 
the EEZ surrounding Hawaii.
    (5) A holder of a new limited access permit must own at least a 50-
percent share in the vessel that the permit would cover.

Sec. 660.53  Framework procedures.

    (a) Introduction. New management measures may be added through 
rulemaking if new information demonstrates that there are biological, 
social, or economic concerns in Permit Areas 1, 2, or 3. The following 
framework process authorizes the implementation of measures that may 
affect the operation of the fisheries, gear, harvest guidelines, or 
changes in catch and/or effort.
    (b) Annual report. By June 30 of each year, the Council-appointed 
Crustaceans Plan Team will prepare an annual report on the fisheries in 
the management area. The report shall contain, among other things, 
recommendations for Council action and an assessment of the urgency and 
effects of such action(s).
    (c) Procedure for established measures. (1) Established measures are 
management measures that, at some time, have been included in 
regulations implementing the FMP, and for which the impacts have been 
evaluated in Council/NMFS documents in the context of current 
conditions.
    (2) Following the framework procedures of Amendment 9 to the FMP, 
the Council may recommend to the Regional Director that established 
measures be modified, removed, or re-instituted. Such recommendation 
shall include supporting rationale and analysis, and shall be made after 
advance public notice, public discussion, and consideration of public 
comment. NMFS may implement the Council's recommendation by rulemaking 
if approved by the Regional Director.
    (d) Procedure for New Measures. (1) New measures are management 
measures that have not been included in regulations implementing the 
FMP, or for which the impacts have not been evaluated in Council/NMFS 
documents in the context of current conditions.
    (2) Following the framework procedures of Amendment 9 to the FMP, 
the Council will publicize, including by a Federal Register document, 
and solicit public comment on, any proposed new management measure. 
After a Council meeting at which the measure is discussed, the Council 
will consider recommendations and prepare a Federal Register document 
summarizing the Council's deliberations, rationale, and analysis for the 
preferred action, and the time and place for any subsequent Council 
meeting(s) to consider the new measure. At subsequent public meeting(s), 
the Council will consider public comments and other information received 
to make a recommendation to the Regional Director about

[[Page 372]]

any new measure. NMFS may implement the Council's recommendation by 
rulemaking if approved by the Regional Director.

         Subpart E--Bottomfish and Seamount Groundfish Fisheries


<R05>
Sec. 660.61  Permits.

    (a) The owner of any vessel used to fish for bottomfish in the Mau 
Zone must have a permit issued under this section for that vessel. 
Permits for persons not previously permitted to fish in the Mau Zone 
will not be issued for a 2-year period beginning March 27, 1997.
    (b) Application. (1) An application for a permit required under this 
section will be submitted to the Pacific Area Office as described in 
Sec. 660.13.
    (2) Before the Regional Director issues a Mau Zone or Ho'omalu zone 
permit to fish for bottomfish under this section, the primary operator 
and relief operator named on the application form must have completed a 
protected species workshop conducted by NMFS.
    (3) Each applicant for a Ho'omalu zone permit will submit a 
supplementary information sheet to be provided by the Pacific Area 
Office. Each application for a Ho'omalu zone permit will be signed by 
the vessel owner or a designee and include the following information:
    (i) The qualification criterion that the applicant believes he or 
she meets for issuance of a limited access permit; and
    (ii) Copies of landings receipts or other documentation, with a 
certification from a state or Federal agency that this information is 
accurate, to demonstrate participation in the NWHI bottomfish fishery; 
or
    (iii) If the application is filed by a partnership or corporation, 
the application must identify the names of the owners and their 
respective percentage of ownership of the partnership or corporation.
    (c) Sale or transfer of Ho'omalu Zone permits to new vessel owners. 
(1) A Ho'omalu zone permit shall not be sold or otherwise transferred to 
a new owner.
    (2) A Ho'omalu zone permit or permits may be held by a partnership 
or corporation. If 50 percent or more of the ownership of the vessel 
passes to persons other than those listed in the original application, 
the permit will lapse and must be surrendered to the Regional Director.
    (d) Transfer of permits to replacement vessels. (1) An owner of a 
permitted vessel may, without limitation, transfer his or her permit to 
another vessel owned by him or her, provided that the replacement vessel 
does not exceed 60 ft (18.3 m) in length and that the replacement vessel 
is put into service within 12 months after the owner declares to the 
Regional Director the intent to make the transfer of the permit.
    (2) An owner of a permitted vessel may apply to the Regional 
Director for approval to use the permit for a replacement vessel greater 
than 60 ft (18.3 m) in length. The Regional Director may allow this 
change upon determining, after consultation with the Council and 
considering the objectives of the limited access program, that the 
replacement vessel has equal catching power as the original vessel, or 
that the replacement vessel has catching power that is comparable to the 
rest of the vessels holding permits for the fishery, and that the change 
is not inconsistent with the objectives of the program.
    (3) The Regional Director shall consider vessel length, range, hold 
capacity, gear limitations, and other appropriate factors in making 
determinations of catching power equivalency and comparability of the 
catching power of vessels in the fishery.
    (e) Supplementary requirements for permit renewal. (1) A permit will 
be eligible for renewal if the vessel covered by the permit makes three 
or more qualifying landings as defined in Sec. 660.12 during the permit 
year.

[[Page 373]]

    (2) The owner of a permitted vessel that did not make three or more 
qualifying landings of bottomfish in a year may apply to the Regional 
Director for waiver of the landing requirement. If the Regional Director 
finds that failure to make three landings was due to circumstances 
beyond the owner's control, the Regional Director may renew the permit. 
A waiver may not be granted if the failure to make three landings was 
due to general economic conditions or market conditions, such that the 
vessel operations would not be profitable.
    (f) Supplementary requirements for new limited access permits. The 
Regional Director may issue new vessel permits under this part when the 
Regional Director has determined, in consultation with the Council, that 
bottomfish stocks in the Ho'omalu Zone are able to support additional 
fishing effort. This shall be established by determining that the total 
estimated annual revenue to the fleet exceeds the total estimated annual 
fixed and variable costs to the fleet in the Ho'omalu Zone by an amount 
at least equal to the average cost of a vessel year. This determination 
shall be made and published annually in association with the annual 
report required under Sec. 660.67.
    (g) Eligibility for new limited access permits. When the Regional 
Director has determined that new permits may be issued, they shall be 
issued to applicants based upon eligibility, determined as follows:
    (1) Point system. (i) Two points shall be assigned for each year in 
which the applicant was owner or captain of a vessel that made three or 
more qualifying landings of bottomfish from the NWHI.
    (ii) One point shall be assigned for each year in which the 
applicant was owner or captain of a vessel that landed at least 6,000 lb 
(2,722 kg) of bottomfish from the main Hawaiian Islands.
    (iii) Points will be assigned only under paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (ii) 
of this section for any 1 year.
    (iv) Points will be assigned for every year for which the requisite 
landings can be documented.
    (2) Restrictions. An applicant must own at least a 25-percent share 
in the vessel that the permit would cover, and only one permit will be 
assigned to any vessel.
    (3) Order of issuance. New permits shall be awarded to applicants in 
descending order, starting with the applicant with the largest number of 
points. If two or more persons have an equal number of points, and there 
are insufficient new permits for all such applicants, the new permits 
shall be awarded by the Regional Director through a lottery.
    (4) Notification. The Regional Director shall place a notice in the 
Federal Register and shall use other means to notify prospective 
applicants of the opportunity to file applications for new permits under 
this program.
    (h) Appeals of permit actions. (1) Except as provided in subpart D 
of 15 CFR part 904, any applicant for a permit or a permit holder may 
appeal the granting, denial, conditioning, or suspension of their permit 
or a permit affecting their interests to the Assistant Administrator. In 
order to be considered by the Assistant Administrator, such appeal must 
be in writing, must state the action(s) appealed, and the reasons 
therefor, and must be submitted within 30 days of the action(s) by the 
Regional Director. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the 
appeal.
    (2) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the 
Assistant Administrator will notify the permit applicant, or permit 
holder as appropriate, and will request such additional information and 
in such form as will allow action upon the appeal. Upon receipt of 
sufficient information, the Assistant Administrator will decide the 
appeal in accordance with the permit eligibility criteria set forth in 
this section and the amendment to the FMP, as appropriate, based upon 
information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council 
and any additional information, the summary record kept of any hearing 
and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and such other 
considerations as deemed appropriate. The Assistant Administrator will 
notify all interested persons of the decision, and the reasons therefor, 
in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of

[[Page 374]]

sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.
    (3) If a hearing is requested, or if the Assistant Administrator 
determines that one is appropriate, the Assistant Administrator may 
grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that 
purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter 
of the hearing in the Federal Register. Such a hearing shall normally be 
held no later than 30 days following publication of the notice in the 
Federal Register, unless the hearing officer extends the time for 
reasons deemed equitable. The appellant, the applicant (if different), 
and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested persons, 
may appear personally or be represented by counsel at the hearing and 
submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by 
the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the 
hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Assistant 
Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 660.67  Framework for regulatory adjustments.

    (a) Annual reports. By June 30 of each year, a Council-appointed 
bottomfish monitoring team will prepare an annual report on the fishery 
by area covering the following topics:
    (1) Fishery performance data.
    (2) Summary of recent research and survey results.
    (3) Habitat conditions and recent alterations.
    (4) Enforcement activities and problems.
    (5) Administrative actions (e.g., data collection and reporting, 
permits).
    (6) State and territorial management actions.
    (7) Assessment of need for Council action (including biological, 
economic, social, enforcement, administrative, and state/Federal needs, 
problems, and trends). Indications of potential problems warranting 
further investigation may be signaled by the following indicator 
criteria:
    (i) Mean size of the catch of any species in any area is a pre-
reproductive size.
    (ii) Ratio of fishing mortality to natural mortality for any 
species.
    (iii) Harvest capacity of the existing fleet and/or annual landings 
exceed best estimate of MSY in any area.
    (iv) Significant decline (50 percent or more) in bottomfish catch 
per unit of effort from baseline levels.
    (v) Substantial decline in ex-vessel revenue relative to baseline 
levels.
    (vi) Significant shift in the relative proportions of gear in any 
one area.
    (vii) Significant change in the frozen/fresh components of the 
bottomfish catch.
    (viii) Entry/exit of fishermen in any area.
    (ix) Per-trip costs for bottomfishing exceed per-trip revenues for a 
significant percentage of trips.

[[Page 376]]

    (x) Significant decline or increase in total bottomfish landings in 
any area.
    (xi) Change in species composition of the bottomfish catch in any 
area.
    (xii) Research results.
    (xiii) Habitat degradation or environmental problems.
    (xiv) Reported interactions between bottomfishing operations and 
protected species in the NWHI.
    (8) Recommendations for Council action.
    (9) Estimated impacts of recommended action.
    (b) Recommendation of management action. (1) The team may present 
management recommendations to the Council at any time. Recommendations 
may cover actions suggested for Federal regulations, state/territorial 
action, enforcement or administrative elements, and research and data 
collection. Recommendations will include an assessment of urgency and 
the effects of not taking action.
    (2) The Council will evaluate the team's reports and 
recommendations, and the indicators of concern. The Council will assess 
the need for one or more of the following types of management action: 
Catch limits, size limits, closures, effort limitations, access 
limitations, or other measures.
    (3) The Council may recommend management action by either the state/
territorial governments or by Federal regulation.
    (c) Federal management action. (1) If the Council believes that 
management action should be considered, it will make specific 
recommendations to the Regional Director after requesting and 
considering the views of its Scientific and Statistical Committee and 
Bottomfish Advisory Panel and obtaining public comments at a public 
hearing.
    (2) The Regional Director will consider the Council's recommendation 
and accompanying data, and, if he or she concurs with the Council's 
recommendation, will propose regulations to carry out the action. If the 
Regional Director rejects the Council's proposed action, a written 
explanation for the denial will be provided to the Council within 2 
weeks of the decision.
    (3) The Council may appeal denial by writing to the Assistant 
Administrator, who must respond in writing within 30 days.
    (4) The Regional Director and the Assistant Administrator will make 
their decisions in accord with the Magnuson Act, other applicable law, 
and the Bottomfish FMP.
    (5) To minimize conflicts between the Federal and state management 
systems, the Council will use the procedures in paragraph (b) of this 
section to respond to state/territorial management actions. Council 
consideration of action would normally begin with a representative of 
the state or territorial government bringing a potential or actual 
management conflict or need to the Council's attention.
    (d) Access limitation procedures. (1) Access limitation may be 
adopted under this paragraph (d) only for the NWHI, American Samoa, and 
Guam.
    (2) If access limitation is proposed for adoption or subsequent 
modification through the process described in this paragraph (d), the 
following requirements must be met:
    (i) The Bottomfish Monitoring Team must consider and report to the 
Council on present participation in the fishery; historical fishing 
practices in, and dependence on, the fishery; economics of the fishery; 
capability of fishing vessels used in the fishery to engage in other 
fisheries; cultural and social framework relevant to the fishery; and 
any other relevant considerations.
    (ii) Public hearings must be held specifically addressing the 
limited access proposals.
    (iii) A specific advisory subpanel of persons experienced in the 
fishing industry will be created to advise the Council and the Regional 
Director on administrative decisions.
    (iv) The Council's recommendation to the Regional Director must be 
approved by a two-thirds majority of the voting members.
    (3) If prior participation in the fishery is used as a factor in any 
access limitation system recommended by the Council, August 7, 1985, is 
the date selected by the Council as the date to be used for the NWHI and 
May 30, 1986, for American Samoa and Guam.

Sec. 660.303  Reporting and recordkeeping.

    (a) This subpart recognizes that catch and effort data necessary for 
implementing the PCGFMP are collected by the States of Washington, 
Oregon, and California under existing state data collection 
requirements. Telephone surveys of the domestic industry will be 
conducted biannually by NMFS to determine amounts of fish that will be 
made available to foreign fishing and JVP. No additional Federal reports 
are required of fishers or processors, so long as the data collection 
and reporting systems operated by state agencies continue to provide 
NMFS with statistical information adequate for management.
    (b) Any person who is required to do so by the applicable state law 
must make and/or file, retain, or make available any and all reports of 
groundfish landings containing all data, and in the exact manner, 
required by the applicable state law.
    (c) Any person landing groundfish must retain on board the vessel 
from which groundfish is landed, and provide to an authorized officer 
upon request, copies of any and all reports of groundfish landings 
containing all data, and in the exact manner, required by the applicable 
state law throughout the cumulative limit period during which a landing 
occurred and for 15 days thereafter.

Sec. 660.321  Specifications and management measures.

    (a) General. NMFS will establish and adjust specifications and 
management measures annually and during the fishing year. Management of 
the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery will be conducted consistent with 
the standards and procedures in the PCGFMP and other applicable law. The 
PCGFMP is available from the Regional Director or the Council.
    (b) Annual actions. The Pacific Coast groundfish fishery is managed 
on a calendar year basis. Even though specifications and management 
measures are announced annually, they may apply for more than 1 year. In 
general, management measures are designed to achieve, but not exceed, 
the specifications, particularly harvest guidelines, limited entry and 
open access allocations, or other approved fishery allocations. Annual 
specifications and management measures are developed at two Council 
meetings and published in the Federal Register at the beginning of the 
year, according to the standards

[[Page 386]]

and procedures in the PCGFMP and other applicable law.
    (c) Routine management measures. Management measures designated 
``routine'' at Sec. 660.323(b) may be adjusted during the year after 
recommendation from the Council, approval by NMFS, and publication in 
the Federal Register.
    (d) Changes to the regulations. Regulations under this subpart may 
be promulgated, removed, or revised. Any such action will be made 
according to the framework standards and procedures in the PCGFMP and 
other applicable law, and will be published in the Federal Register.

gear must be attached outside any riblines and restraining straps. There 
is no limit on the number of sections of chafing gear on a net.
    (4) Codends. Only single-walled codends may be used in any trawl. 
Double-walled codends are prohibited.
    (5) Pelagic trawls. Pelagic trawl nets must have unprotected 
footropes at the trawl mouth, and must not have rollers, bobbins, tires, 
wheels, rubber discs, or any similar device anywhere in the net. 
Sweeplines, including the bottom leg of the bridle, must be bare. For at 
least 20 ft (6.15 m) immediately behind the footrope or headrope, bare 
ropes or mesh of 16-inch (40.6-cm) minimum mesh size must completely 
encircle the net. A band of mesh (a ``skirt'') may encircle the net 
under transfer cables, lifting or splitting straps (chokers), but must 
be: Over riblines and restraining straps; the same mesh size and 
coincide knot-to-knot with the net to which it is attached; and no wider 
than 16 meshes.
    (c) Fixed gear. (1) Fixed gear (longline, trap or pot, set net and 
stationary hook-and-line gear, including commercial vertical hook-and-
line gear) must be:
    (i) Marked at the surface, at each terminal end, with a pole, flag, 
light, radar reflector, and a buoy, except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Attended at least once every 7 days.
    (2) Commercial vertical hook-and-line gear that is closely tended 
may be marked only with a single buoy of sufficient size to float the 
gear. ``Closely tended'' means that a vessel is within

[[Page 387]]

visual sighting distance or within 0.25 nm (463 m) as determined by 
electronic navigational equipment, of its commercial vertical hook-and-
line gear.
    (3) A buoy used to mark fixed gear under paragraph (c)(1)(i) or 
(c)(2) of this section must be marked with a number clearly identifying 
the owner or operator of the vessel. The number may be either:
    (i) If required by applicable state law, the vessel's number, the 
commercial fishing license number, or buoy brand number; or
    (ii) The vessel documentation number issued by the USCG, or, for an 
undocumented vessel, the vessel registration number issued by the state.
    (d) Set nets. Fishing for groundfish with set nets is prohibited in 
the fishery management area north of 38 deg.00' N. lat.
    (e) Traps or pots. Traps must have biodegradable escape panels 
constructed with # 21 or smaller untreated cotton twine in such a manner 
that an opening at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter results when the 
twine deteriorates.
    (f) Recreational fishing. The only types of fishing gear authorized 
for recreational fishing are hook-and-line and spear.
    (g) Spears. Spears may be propelled by hand or by mechanical means.


<R05>
Sec. 660.323  Catch restrictions.

    (a) Groundfish species harvested in the territorial sea (0-3 nm) 
will be counted toward the catch limitations in this section.
    (1) Black rockfish. The trip limit for black rockfish (Sebastes 
melanops) for commercial fishing vessels using hook-and-line gear 
between the U.S.-Canada border and Cape Alava (48 deg.09'30" N. lat.), 
and between Destruction Island (47 deg.40' N. lat.) and Leadbetter Point 
(46 deg.38'10" N. lat.), is 100 lbs (45 kg) or 30 percent, by weight of 
all fish on board, whichever is greater, per vessel per fishing trip.
    (2) Nontrawl sablefish. This paragraph (a)(2) applies to the regular 
and mop-up seasons for the nontrawl limited entry sablefish fishery 
north of 36 deg. N. lat., except for paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (iv), and 
(vii) of this section, which also apply to the open access fishery north 
of 36 deg. N. lat. Limited entry and open access fixed gear sablefish 
fishing south of 36 deg. N. lat. is governed by routine management 
measures imposed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (i) Sablefish endorsement. A vessel may not participate in the 
regular or mop-up season for the nontrawl limited entry fishery, unless 
the vessel's owner holds (by ownership or otherwise) a limited entry 
permit for that vessel, affixed with both a gear endorsement for 
longline or trap (or pot) gear, and a sablefish endorsement.
    (ii) Pre-season closure--open access and limited entry fisheries. 
(A) Sablefish taken with fixed gear in the limited entry or open access 
fishery in the EEZ may not be retained or landed during the 48 hours 
immediately before the start of the regular season for the nontrawl 
limited entry sablefish fishery.
    (B) All fixed gear used to take and retain groundfish must be out of 
EEZ waters during the 48 hours immediately before the opening of the 
regular season for the nontrawl limited entry sablefish fishery.
    (iii) Regular season--nontrawl limited entry sablefish fishery. (A) 
The Regional Administrator will announce a season for waters north of 
36 deg. N. lat. to start on any day from August 1 through September 30, 
based on consultations with the Council, taking into account tidal 
conditions, Council meeting dates, alternative fishing opportunities, 
and industry comments.
    (B) During the regular season, each vessel with a limited entry 
permit with a sablefish endorsement that is registered for use with that 
vessel may land up to the cumulative trip limit announced for the tier 
to which the permit is assigned. Each permit will be assigned to one of 
three tiers. A cumulative trip limit is the maximum amount of sablefish 
that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a 
specified period of time, with no limit on the number of landings or 
trips.
    (C) The Regional Administrator will annually calculate the length of 
the regular season and the size of the cumulative trip limit for each 
tier in accordance with the process specified in chapter 1 of the EA/
RIR/IRFA for

[[Page 388]]

``Fixed Gear Sablefish Tiered Cumulative Limits,'' dated February 1998, 
which is available from the Council. The season length and the size of 
the cumulative trip limits will vary depending on the amount of 
sablefish available for the regular and mop-up fisheries and the 
projected harvest for the fishery. The season will be set to be as long 
as possible, under the constraints described in chapter 1 of the EA/RIR/
IRFA, up to a maximum season length of 10 days.
    (D) During the regular and mop-up season, limited entry nontrawl 
sablefish fishers may also be subject to trip limits to protect juvenile 
sablefish.
    (E) There will be no limited entry, daily trip limit fishery during 
the regular season.
    (iv) Post-season closure--limited entry and open access. No 
sablefish taken with fixed gear north of 36 deg. N. lat. during the 30 
hours immediately after the end of the regular season for the nontrawl 
limited entry sablefish fishery, may be retained. Sablefish taken and 
retained during the regular season may be possessed and landed during 
the 30-hour period. Gear may remain in water during the 30-hour post-
season closure. Fishers may not set or pull from the water fixed gear 
used to take and retain groundfish during the 30-hour post-season 
closure.
    (v) Mop-up season--limited entry fishery. A mop-up season to take 
the remainder of the limited entry nontrawl allocation will begin in 
waters north of 36 deg. N. lat. about 3 weeks, or as soon as 
practicable, after the end of the regular season. During the mop-up 
fishery, a cumulative trip limit will be imposed. A cumulative trip 
limit is the maximum amount of sablefish that may be taken and retained, 
possessed, or landed per vessel in a specified period of time, with no 
limit on the number of landings or trips. The length of the mop-up 
season and the amount of the cumulative trip limit, will be determined 
by the Regional Administrator in consultation with the Council or its 
designees, and will be based primarily on the amount of fish remaining 
in the limited entry nontrawl allocation, the amount of sablefish needed 
for the remainder of the daily trip limit fishery, and the number of 
mop-up participants anticipated. The Regional Administrator may 
determine that too little of the nontrawl allocation remains to conduct 
an orderly or manageable fishery, in which case there will not be a mop-
up season. There will be no limited entry daily trip limit fishery 
during the mop-up season.
    (vi) Other announcements. The dates and times that the regular 
season starts and ends (and trip limits on sablefish of all sizes are 
resumed), the size of the cumulative trip limits for the three tiers in 
the regular fishery, the dates and times for the 30-hour post-season 
closure, the dates and times that the mop-up season begins and ends, and 
the size of the cumulative trip limit for the mop-up fishery will be 
announced in the Federal Register, and may be modified. Unless otherwise 
announced, these seasons will begin and end at 12 noon on the specified 
date.
    (vii) Trip limits. Trip and/or frequency limits may be imposed in 
the limited entry fishery before and after the regular season, and after 
the mop-up season, under paragraph (b) of this section. Trip and/or size 
limits to protect juvenile sablefish in the limited entry or open-access 
fisheries also may be imposed at any time under paragraph (b) of this 
section. Trip limits may be imposed in the open-access fishery at any 
time under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) Pacific whiting (whiting)--(i) Seasons. The primary seasons for 
the whiting fishery are: For the shore-based sector, the period(s) when 
the large-scale target fishery is conducted (when trip limits under 
paragraph (b) of this section are not in effect); for catcher/
processors, the period(s) when at-sea processing is allowed and the 
fishery is open for the catcher/processor sector; and for vessels 
delivering to motherships, the period(s) when at-sea processing is 
allowed and the fishery is open for the mothership sector. Before and 
after the primary seasons, trip landing or frequency limits may be 
imposed under paragraph (b) of this section. The sectors are defined at 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (A) North of 40 deg.30' N. lat. Different starting dates may be 
established for the catcher/processor sector, the

[[Page 389]]

mothership sector, catcher vessels delivering to shoreside processors 
north of 42 deg. N. lat., and catcher vessels delivering to shoreside 
processors between 42 deg.-40 deg.30' N. lat.
    (1) Procedures. The primary seasons for the whiting fishery north of 
40 deg.30' N. lat. generally will be established according to the 
procedures in the PCGFMP for developing and implementing annual 
specifications and apportionments. The season opening dates remain in 
effect unless changed, but will be announced annually, generally with 
the annual specifications and management measures.
    (2) Criteria. The start of a primary season may be changed based on 
a recommendation from the Council and consideration of the following 
factors, if applicable: Size of the harvest guidelines for whiting and 
bycatch species; age/size structure of the whiting population; expected 
harvest of bycatch and prohibited species; availability and stock status 
of prohibited species; expected participation by catchers and 
processors; environmental conditions; timing of alternate or competing 
fisheries; industry agreement; fishing or processing rates; and other 
relevant information.
    (B) South of 40 deg.30' N. lat. The primary season starts on April 
15 south of 40 deg.30' N. lat.
    (ii) Closed areas. Pacific whiting may not be taken and retained in 
the following portions of the fishery management area:
    (A) Klamath River Salmon Conservation Zone. The ocean area 
surrounding the Klamath River mouth bounded on the north by 
41 deg.38'48" N. lat. (approximately 6 nm north of the Klamath River 
mouth), on the west by 124 deg.23' W. long. (approximately 12 nm from 
shore), and on the south by 41 deg.26'48" N. lat. (approximately 6 nm 
south of the Klamath River mouth).
    (B) Columbia River Salmon Conservation Zone. The ocean area 
surrounding the Columbia River mouth bounded by a line extending for 6 
nm due west from North Head along 46 deg.18' N. lat. to 124 deg.13'18" 
W. long., then southerly along a line of 167 True to 46 deg.11'06" N. 
lat. and 124 deg.11' W. long. (Columbia River Buoy), then northeast 
along Red Buoy Line to the tip of the south jetty.
    (iii) Eureka area trip limits. Trip landing or frequency limits may 
be established, modified, or removed under Sec. 660.321 or Sec. 660.323, 
specifying the amount of Pacific whiting that may be taken and retained, 
possessed, or landed by a vessel that, at any time during a fishing 
trip, fished in the fishery management area shoreward of the 100-fathom 
(183-m) contour (as shown on NOAA Charts 18580, 18600, and 18620) in the 
Eureka area (from 43 deg.00' to 40 deg.30' N. lat.).
    (iv) At-sea processing. Whiting may not be processed at sea south of 
42 deg.00' N. lat. (Oregon-California border), unless by a waste-
processing vessel as authorized under paragraph (a)(4)(vii) of this 
section.
    (v) Time of day. Pacific whiting may not be taken and retained by 
any vessel in the fishery management area south of 42 deg.00' N. lat. 
between 0001 hours to one-half hour after official sunrise (local time). 
During this time south of 42 deg.00' N. lat., trawl doors must be on 
board any vessel used to fish for whiting and the trawl must be attached 
to the trawl doors. Official sunrise is determined, to the nearest 
5 deg. lat., in The Nautical Almanac issued annually by the Nautical 
Almanac Office, U.S. Naval Observatory, and available from the U.S. 
Government Printing Office.
    (4) Whiting--allocation--(i) Sectors and allocations. The commercial 
harvest guideline for whiting is allocated among three sectors, as 
follows.
    (A) Sectors. The catcher/processor sector is composed of catcher/
processors, which are vessels that harvest and process whiting during a 
calendar year. The mothership sector is composed of motherships and 
catcher vessels that harvest whiting for delivery to motherships. 
Motherships are vessels that process, but do not harvest, whiting during 
a calendar year. The shoreside sector is composed of vessels that 
harvest whiting for delivery to shore-based processors.
    (B) Allocations. The allocations are: 34 percent for the catcher/
processor sector; 24 percent for the mothership sector; and 42 percent 
for the shoreside sector. No more than 5 percent of the shoreside 
allocation may be taken and retained south of 42 deg. N. lat. before the

[[Page 390]]

start of the primary season north of 42 deg. N. lat. These allocations 
are harvest guidelines unless otherwise announced in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) Additional restrictions on catcher/processors.
    (A) A catcher/processor may receive fish from a catcher vessel, but 
that catch is counted against the catcher/processor allocation unless 
the catcher/processor has been declared as a mothership under paragraph 
(a)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (B) A catcher/processor may not also act as a catcher vessel 
delivering unprocessed whiting to another processor in the same calendar 
year.
    (C) When renewing its limited entry permit each year under 
Sec. 660.333, the owner of a catcher/processor used to take and retain 
whiting must declare if the vessel will operate solely as a mothership 
in the whiting fishery during the calendar year to which its limited 
entry permit applies. Any such declaration is binding on the vessel for 
the calendar year, even if the permit is transferred during the year, 
unless it is rescinded in response to a written request from the permit 
holder. Any request to rescind a declaration must made by the permit 
holder and granted in writing by the Regional Director before any 
unprocessed whiting has been taken on board the vessel that calendar 
year.
    (iii) Reaching an allocation. If the whiting harvest guideline, 
commercial harvest guideline, or a sector's allocation is reached, or is 
projected to be reached, the following action(s) for the applicable 
sector(s) may be taken as provided under paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this 
section and will remain in effect until additional amounts are made 
available the next fishing year or under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this 
section.
    (A) Catcher/processor sector. Further taking and retaining, 
receiving, or at-sea processing of whiting by a catcher/processor is 
prohibited. No additional unprocessed whiting may be brought on board 
after at-sea processing is prohibited, but a catcher/processor may 
continue to process whiting that was on board before at-sea processing 
was prohibited.
    (B) Mothership sector. (1) Further receiving or at-sea processing of 
whiting by a mothership is prohibited. No additional unprocessed whiting 
may be brought on board after at-sea processing is prohibited, but a 
mothership may continue to process whiting that was on board before at-
sea processing was prohibited.
    (2) Whiting may not be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a 
catcher vessel participating in the mothership sector.
    (C) Shoreside sector. Whiting may not be taken and retained, 
possessed, or landed by a catcher vessel participating in the shoreside 
sector except as authorized under a trip limit specified under 
Sec. 660.323(b).
    (D) Shoreside south of 42 deg. N. lat. If 5 percent of the shoreside 
allocation for whiting is taken and retained south of 42 deg. N. lat. 
before the primary season for the shoreside sector begins north of 
42 deg. N. lat., then a trip limit specified under paragraph (b) of this 
section may be implemented south of 42 deg. N. lat. until the northern 
primary season begins, at which time the southern primary season would 
resume.
    (iv) Reapportionments. That portion of a sector's allocation that 
the Regional Director determines will not be used by the end of the 
fishing year shall be made available for harvest by the other sectors, 
if needed, in proportion to their initial allocations, on September 15 
or as soon as practicable thereafter. NMFS may release whiting again at 
a later date to ensure full utilization of the resource. Whiting not 
needed in the fishery authorized under Sec. 660.324 also may be made 
available.
    (v) Estimates. Estimates of the amount of whiting harvested will be 
based on actual amounts harvested, projections of amounts that will be 
harvested, or a combination of the two. Estimates of the amount of 
whiting that will be used by shoreside processors by the end of the 
fishing year will be based on the best information available to the 
Regional Director from state catch and landings data, the survey of 
domestic processing capacity and intent, testimony received at Council 
meetings, and/or other relevant information.
    (vi) Announcements. The Assistant Administrator will announce in the 
Federal Register when a harvest

[[Page 391]]

guideline, commercial harvest guideline, or an allocation of whiting is 
reached, or is projected to be reached, specifying the appropriate 
action being taken under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. The 
Regional Director will announce in the Federal Register any 
reapportionment of surplus whiting to other sectors on September 15, or 
as soon as practicable thereafter. In order to prevent exceeding the 
limits or to avoid underutilizing the resource, prohibitions against 
further taking and retaining, receiving, or at-sea processing of 
whiting, or reapportionment of surplus whiting may be made effective 
immediately by actual notice to fishermen and processors, by phone, fax, 
Northwest Region computerized bulletin board (contact 206-526-6128), 
letter, press release, and/or U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners 
(monitor channel 16 VHF), followed by publication in the Federal 
Register, in which instance public comment will be sought for a 
reasonable period of time thereafter. If insufficient time exists to 
consult with the Council, the Regional Director will inform the Council 
in writing of actions taken.
    (vii) Processing fish waste at sea. A vessel that processes only 
fish waste (a ``waste-processing vessel'') is not considered a whiting 
processor and therefore is not subject to the allocations, seasons, or 
restrictions for catcher/processors or motherships while it operates as 
a waste-processing vessel. However, no vessel may operate as a waste-
processing vessel 48 hours immediately before and after a primary season 
for whiting in which the vessel operates as a catcher/processor or 
mothership. A vessel must meet the following conditions to qualify as a 
waste-processing vessel:
    (A) The vessel makes meal (ground dried fish), oil, or minced 
(ground flesh) product, but does not make, and does not have on board, 
surimi (fish paste with additives), fillets (meat from the side of the 
fish, behind the head and in front of the tail), or headed and gutted 
fish (head and viscera removed).
    (B) The amount of whole whiting on board does not exceed the trip 
limit (if any) allowed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (C) Any trawl net and doors on board are stowed in a secured and 
covered manner, and detached from all towing lines, so as to be rendered 
unusable for fishing.
    (D) The vessel does not receive codends containing fish.
    (E) The vessel's operations are consistent with applicable state and 
Federal law, including those governing disposal of fish waste at sea.
    (b) Routine management measures. In addition to the catch 
restrictions in this section, other catch restrictions that are likely 
to be adjusted on an annual or more frequent basis may be imposed and 
announced by a single notification in the Federal Register if they first 
have been designated as ``routine'' according to the applicable 
procedures in the PCGFMP. The following catch restrictions are 
designated as routine for the reasons given in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 
this section:
    (1) Commercial-limited entry and open access fisheries--
    (i) Species and gear. (A) Widow rockfish--all gear--trip landing and 
frequency limits.
    (B) Sebastes complex--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (C) Yellowtail rockfish--all gear--trip landing and frequency 
limits.
    (D) Pacific ocean perch--all gear--trip landing and frequency 
limits.
    (E) Sablefish--all gear--trip landing, frequency, and size limits.
    (F) Dover sole--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (G) Thornyheads (shortspine thornyheads or longspine thornyheads, 
separately or combined)--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (H) Bocaccio--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (I) Pacific whiting--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (J) Lingcod--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits; size 
limits.
    (K) Canary rockfish--all gear--trip landing and frequency limits.
    (L) All groundfish, separately or in any combination--any legal open 
access gear (including non-groundfish trawl gear used to harvest pink 
shrimp, spot or ridgeback prawns, California halibut or sea cucumbers in 
accordance with the regulations in this subpart)--trip landing and 
frequency limits. (Size

[[Page 392]]

limits designated routine in this section continue to apply.)
    (ii) Reasons for ``routine'' management measures. All routine 
management measures on commercial fisheries are intended to keep 
landings within the harvest levels announced by NMFS. In addition, the 
following reasons apply:
    (A) Trip landing and frequency limits--to extend the fishing season; 
to minimize disruption of traditional fishing and marketing patterns; to 
reduce discards; to discourage target fishing while allowing small 
incidental catches to be landed; to allow small fisheries to operate 
outside the normal season; and, for the open access fishery only, to 
maintain landings at the historical proportions during the 1984-88 
window period.
    (B) Size limits--to protect juvenile fish; to extend the fishing 
season.
    (2) Recreational--(i) Species and gear. (A) Lingcod--all gear--bag 
and size limits.
    (B) Rockfish--all gear--bag limits.
    (ii) Reasons for ``routine'' management measures. All routine 
management measures on recreational fisheries are intended to keep 
landings within the harvest levels announced by NMFS. In addition, the 
following reasons apply:
    (A) Bag limits--to spread the available catch over a large number of 
anglers; to avoid waste; for consistency with state regulations.
    (B) Size limits--to protect juvenile fish; to enhance the quality of 
the recreational fishing experience; for consistency with state 
regulations.
    (c) Prohibited species. Groundfish species or species groups under 
the PCGFMP for which quotas have been achieved and the fishery closed 
are prohibited species. In addition, the following are prohibited 
species:
    (1) Any species of salmonid.
    (2) Pacific halibut.
    (3) Dungeness crab caught seaward of Washington or Oregon.

<R05>
Sec. 660.324  Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries.

    (a) Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes have treaty rights to harvest 
groundfish in their usual and accustomed fishing areas in U.S. waters.
    (b) For the purposes of this part, Pacific Coast treaty Indian 
tribes means the Hoh, Makah, and Quileute Indian Tribes and the Quinault 
Indian Nation.
    (c) The Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes' usual and accustomed 
fishing areas within the fishery management area (FMA) are set out below 
in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. Boundaries of a 
tribe's fishing area may be revised as ordered by a Federal court.
    (1) Makah--That portion of the FMA north of 48 deg.02'15" N. lat. 
(Norwegian Memorial) and east of 125 deg.44'00" W. long.
    (2) Quileute--That portion of the FMA between 48 deg.07'36" N. lat. 
(Sand Point) and 47 deg.31'42" N. lat. (Queets River) and east of 
125 deg.44'00" W. long.
    (3) Hoh--That portion of the FMA between 47 deg.54'18" N. lat. 
(Quillayute River) and 47 deg.21'00" N. lat. (Quinault River) and east 
of 125 deg.44'00" W. long.
    (4) Quinault--That portion of the FMA between 47 deg.40'06" N. lat. 
(Destruction Island) and 46 deg.53'18" N. lat. (Point Chehalis) and east 
of 125 deg.44'00" W. long.
    (d) Procedures. The rights referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
section will be implemented by the Secretary, after consideration of the 
tribal request, the recommendation of the Council, and the comments of 
the public. The rights will be implemented either through an allocation 
of fish that will be managed by the tribes, or through regulations in 
this section that will apply specifically to the tribal fisheries. An 
allocation or a regulation specific to the tribes shall be initiated by 
a written request from a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe to the 
Regional Director, prior to the first of the Council's two annual 
groundfish meetings. The Secretary generally will announce the annual 
tribal allocation at the same time as the annual specifications. The 
Secretary recognizes the sovereign status and co-manager role of Indian 
tribes over shared Federal and tribal fishery resources. Accordingly, 
the Secretary will develop tribal allocations and regulations under this 
paragraph in consultation with the affected tribe(s) and, insofar as 
possible, with tribal consensus.

[[Page 393]]

    (e) Identification. A valid treaty Indian identification card issued 
pursuant to 25 CFR part 249, subpart A, is prima facie evidence that the 
holder is a member of the Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe named on the 
card.
    (f) A limited entry permit under subpart C is not required for 
participation in a tribal fishery described in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (g) Fishing under this section by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty 
Indian tribe within their usual and accustomed fishing area is not 
subject to the provisions of other sections of this part.
    (h) Any member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe must comply 
with this section, and with any applicable tribal law and regulation, 
when participating in a tribal groundfish fishery described in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (i) Fishing by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe 
outside the applicable Indian tribe's usual and accustomed fishing area, 
or for a species of groundfish not covered by an allocation or 
regulation under this section, is subject to the regulations in the 
other sections of this part.
    (j) Black rockfish. Harvest guidelines for commercial harvests of 
black rockfish by members of the Pacific Coast Indian tribes using hook 
and line gear will be established annually for the areas between the 
U.S.-Canadian border and Cape Alava (48 deg.09'30" N. lat.) and between 
Destruction Island (47 deg.40'00" N. lat.) and Leadbetter Point 
(46 deg.38'10" N. lat.), in accordance with the procedures for 
implementing annual specifications. Pacific Coast treaty Indians fishing 
for black rockfish in these areas under these harvest guidelines are 
subject to the provisions in this section, and not to the restrictions 
in other sections of this part.
    (k) Groundfish without a tribal allocation. Makah tribal members may 
use midwater trawl gear to take and retain groundfish for which there is 
no tribal allocation and will be subject to the trip landing and 
frequency and size limits applicable to the limited entry fishery.


<R05>
Sec. 660.331  Limited entry and open access fisheries--general.

    All commercial fishing for groundfish must be conducted in 
accordance with the regulations governing limited entry and open access 
fisheries, except such fishing by treaty Indian tribes as may be 
separately provided for.


<R05>
Sec. 660.332  Allocations.

    (a) General. The commercial portion of the Pacific Coast groundfish 
fishery, excluding the treaty Indian fishery, is divided into limited 
entry and open access fisheries. Separate allocations for the limited 
entry and open access fisheries will be established annually for certain 
species and/or areas using the procedures described in this subpart or 
the PCGFMP.
    (1) Limited entry allocation. The allocation for the limited entry 
fishery is the allowable catch (harvest guideline or quota excluding set 
asides for recreational or tribal Indian fisheries) minus the allocation 
to the open access fishery.
    (2) Open access allocation. The allocation for the open access 
fishery is derived by applying the open access allocation percentage to 
the annual harvest guideline or quota after subtracting any set asides 
for recreational or tribal Indian fisheries. For management areas where 
quotas or harvest guidelines for a stock are not fully utilized, no 
separate allocation will be established for the open access fishery 
until it is projected that the allowable catch for a species will be 
reached.
    (b) Open access allocation percentage. For each species with a 
harvest guideline or quota, the initial open access allocation 
percentage is calculated by:
    (1) Computing the total catch for that species during the window 
period by any vessel that does not initially receive a limited entry 
permit.
    (2) Dividing that amount by the total catch during the window period 
by all gear.
    (3) The guidelines in this paragraph (b)(3) apply to recalculation 
of the open access allocation percentage. Any recalculated allocation 
percentage will be used in calculating the following year's open access 
allocation. If a gear

[[Page 394]]

type is prohibited by a state or the Secretary and a vessel thereby 
qualifies for a limited entry permit under this subpart, or if a small 
limited entry fleet is incorporated into the limited entry fishery under 
Sec. 660.338, the window-period catch of these vessels will be deducted 
from the open access fishery's historical catch levels and the open 
access allocation percentage recalculated accordingly.
    (c) Catch accounting between the limited entry and open access 
fisheries. Any groundfish caught by a vessel with a limited entry permit 
will be counted against the limited entry allocation while the limited 
entry fishery for that vessel's limited entry gear is open. When the 
fishery for a vessel's limited entry gear has closed, groundfish caught 
by that vessel with open access gear will be counted against the open 
access allocation. All groundfish caught by vessels without limited 
entry permits will be counted against the open access allocation.
    (d) Additional guidelines. Additional guidelines governing 
determination of the limited entry and open access allocations are in 
the PCGFMP.
    (e) Treaty Indian fisheries. Certain amounts of groundfish may be 
set aside annually for tribal fisheries prior to dividing the balance of 
the allowable catch between the limited entry and open access fisheries. 
Tribal fisheries conducted under a set-aside are not subject to the 
regulations governing limited entry and open access fisheries.
    (f) Recreational fisheries. Recreational fishing for groundfish is 
outside the scope of, and not affected by, the regulations governing 
limited entry and open access fisheries. Certain amounts of groundfish 
may be specifically allocated to the recreational fishery, and will be 
set aside prior to dividing the commercial allocation between the 
commercial limited entry and open access fisheries.


<R05>
Sec. 660.333  Limited entry fishery--general.

    (a) General. Participation in the limited entry fishery requires 
that the owner of a vessel hold (by ownership or otherwise) a limited 
entry permit affixed with a gear endorsement registered for use with 
that vessel for the gear being fished. A sablefish endorsement is also 
required for a vessel to participate in the regular and/or mop-up 
seasons for the nontrawl, limited entry sablefish fishery, north of 
36 deg. N. lat. There are three types of gear endorsements: ``A,'' 
``Provisional A,'' and ``Designated species B.'' More than one type of 
gear endorsement may be affixed to a limited entry permit. While the 
limited entry fishery is open, vessels fishing under limited entry 
permits may also fish with open access gear; except that during a period 
when the limited entry fixed gear sablefish fishery is limited to those 
vessels with sablefish endorsements, a longline or pot (or trap) limited 
entry permit holder without a sablefish endorsement may not fish for 
sablefish with open access gear.
    (b) Renewal of limited entry permits and gear endorsements.
    (1) Limited entry permits expire at the end of each calendar year, 
and must be renewed between October 1 and November 30 of each year in 
order to remain in force the following year.
    (2) Notification to renew limited entry permits will be issued by 
FMD prior to September 1 each year to the most recent address of the 
permit owner. The permit owner shall provide FMD with notice of any 
address change within 15 days of the change.
    (3) A limited entry permit that is allowed to expire will not be 
renewed unless the FMD determines that failure to renew was proximately 
caused by the illness, injury, or death of the permit owner.
    (c) Transfer and registration of limited entry permits and gear 
endorsements. (1) When the SFD transfers the limited entry permit on 
behalf of the permit holder, the SFD will reissue the permit in the name 
of the new permit holder with such gear and, if applicable, species 
endorsements and tier assignments as are eligible for transfer with the 
permit. Permit transfers will take effect on the first day of the next 
major limited entry cumulative limit period following the date of the 
transfer. Transfers of permits designated as participating in the ``B'' 
platoon will become effective on the first day of the next ``B'' platoon 
major limited entry cumulative limit period following the date

[[Page 395]]

of the transfer. No transfer is effective until the limited entry permit 
has been reissued as registered with the new vessel and the permit is in 
the possession of the new permit holder.
    (2) A limited entry permit may not be used with a vessel unless it 
is registered for use with that vessel. Limited entry permits will 
normally be registered for use with a particular vessel at the time the 
permit is issued, renewed, transferred, or replaced. A permit not 
registered for use with a particular vessel may not be used. If the 
permit will be used with a vessel other than the one registered on the 
permit, a registration for use with the new vessel must be obtained from 
the SFD and placed on board the vessel before it is used under the 
permit. Registration of a permit to be used with a new vessel will take 
effect on the first day of the next major limited entry cumulative limit 
period following the date of the transfer.
    (3) The major limited entry cumulative limit periods will be 
announced in the Federal Register each year with the annual 
specifications and management measures, or with routine management 
measures when the cumulative limit periods are changed.
    (4) Application forms for the transfer and registration of limited 
entry permits are available from the FMD (see part 600 for address of 
the Regional Director). Contents of the application, and required 
supporting documentation, are specified in the application form.
    (5) The FMD will maintain records of all limited entry permits that 
have been issued, renewed, transferred, registered, or replaced.
    (d) Evidence and burden of proof. A vessel owner (or person holding 
limited entry rights under the express terms of a written contract) 
applying for issuance, renewal, transfer, or registration of a limited 
entry permit has the burden to provide evidence that qualification 
requirements are met. The owner of a permit endorsed for longline or 
trap (or pot) gear applying for a sablefish endorsement or a tier 
assignment under Sec. 660.336(c) or (d) has the burden to submit 
evidence to prove that qualification requirements are met. The following 
evidentiary standards apply:
    (1) A certified copy of the current vessel document (USCG or state) 
is the best evidence of vessel ownership and LOA.
    (2) A certified copy of a state fish receiving ticket is the best 
evidence of a landing, and of the type of gear used.
    (3) A copy of a written contract reserving or conveying limited 
entry rights is the best evidence of reserved or acquired rights.
    (4) Such other relevant, credible evidence as the applicant may 
submit, or the FMD or the Regional Director request or acquire, may also 
be considered.
    (e) Initial decisions. Initial decisions regarding issuance, 
renewal, transfer, and registration of limited entry permits, and 
endorsement upgrade, will be made by the FMD.
    Adverse decisions shall be in writing and shall state the reasons 
therefor. The FMD may decline to act on an application for issuance, 
renewal, transfer, or registration of a limited entry permit if the 
permit sanction provisions of the Magnuson Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(a) and 
implementing regulations at 15 CFR part 904, subpart D, apply.
    (f) Transfers. Limited entry permits are transferable as follows:
    (1) The permit owner may transfer (by sale, assignment, lease, 
bequest, intestate succession, barter, trade, gift, or other form of 
conveyance) the limited entry permit to a different person. The permit 
holder may register the permit for use with a different vessel under the 
same ownership, subject to the conditions set forth in this subpart.
    (2) Gear endorsements, sablefish endorsements, and sablefish tier 
assignments may not be transferred separately from the limited entry 
permit.
    (3) Gear endorsements may not be transferred separately from the 
limited entry permit.
    (4) Except as provided in Secs. 660.335(b), 660.336(b), and 
660.337(b)(2), only ``A'' gear endorsements remain valid with the 
transfer of a limited entry permit.
    (g) Eligibility. Only a person eligible to own a documented vessel 
under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12102(a) may be issued or may hold (by 
ownership or otherwise) a limited entry permit.

[[Page 396]]

    (h) Vessel size endorsements--(1) General. The limited entry permit 
will be endorsed with the LOA for the size of the vessel that initially 
qualified for the permit, except:
    (i) If the permit was initially issued under section 14.3.2.3.8 of 
the FMP [re pre-1991 replacement vessels qualifying for ``provisional 
A'' permits] for a replacement vessel that was more than 5 ft (1.52 m) 
longer than the replaced vessel, the permit will be endorsed for the 
size of the replacement vessel.
    (ii) If the permit was initially issued to a replacement trawl 
vessel that was more than 5 ft (1.52 m) shorter than the replaced 
vessel, it will be endorsed for the size of the smaller replacement 
vessel.
    (iii) If the permit is registered for use with a trawl vessel that 
is more than 5 ft (1.52 m) shorter than the size for which the permit is 
endorsed, it will be endorsed for the size of the smaller vessel.
    (iv) When permits are combined into one permit to be registered for 
use with a vessel requiring a larger size endorsement, the new permit 
will be endorsed for the size of the larger vessel.
    (2) Limitations of size endorsements--(i) A limited entry permit 
endorsed only for gear other than trawl gear may be registered for use 
with a vessel up to 5 ft (1.52 m) longer than, the same length as, or 
any length shorter than, the size endorsed on the existing permit 
without requiring a combination of permits under paragraph (i) of this 
section or a change in the size endorsement.
    (ii) A limited entry permit endorsed for trawl gear may be 
registered for use with a vessel between 5 ft (1.52 m) shorter and 5 ft 
(1.52 m) longer than the size endorsed on the existing permit without 
requiring a combination of permits under paragraph (i) of this section 
or a change in the size endorsement under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this 
section.
    (iii) Two or more limited entry permits with ``A'' gear endorsements 
for the same type of limited entry gear may be combined and reissued as 
a single permit with a larger size endorsement. With respect to permits 
endorsed for nontrawl limited entry gear, a sablefish endorsement will 
be issued for the new permit only if all of the permits being combined 
have sablefish endorsements. If two or more permits with sablefish 
endorsements are combined, the new permit will receive the same tier 
assignment as the tier with the largest cumulative landing limit of the 
permits being combined. The vessel harvest capacity rating for each of 
the permits being combined is that indicated in Table 2 of this part for 
the LOA (in feet) endorsed on the respective limited entry permit. 
Harvest capacity ratings for fractions of a foot in vessel length will 
be determined by multiplying the fraction of a foot in vessel length by 
the difference in the two ratings assigned to the nearest integers of 
vessel length. The length rating for the combined permit is that 
indicated for the sum of the vessel harvest capacity ratings for each 
permit being combined. If that sum falls between the sums for two 
adjacent lengths on Table 2 of this part, the length rating shall be the 
higher length.
    (i) Limited entry permits indivisible. Limited entry permits may not 
be divided for use by more than one vessel.

<R05>
Sec. 660.334  Limited entry permits--''A'' endorsement.

    (a) A limited entry permit with an ``A'' endorsement entitles the 
holder to participate in the limited entry fishery for all groundfish 
species with the type(s) of limited entry gear specified in the 
endorsement, except for sablefish harvested north of 36 deg. N. lat. 
during times and with gears for which a sablefish endorsement is 
required. See Sec. 660.336 for provisions regarding sablefish 
endorsement requirements.
    (b) An ``A'' endorsement is transferable with the limited entry 
permit to another person, or a different vessel under the same ownership 
under Sec. 660.333.
    (c) An ``A'' endorsement expires on failure to renew the limited 
entry permit to which it is affixed (see Sec. 660.333).

[61 FR 34572, July 2, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 34674, June 27, 1997]

[[Page 397]]


<R05>
Sec. 660.335  Limited entry permits--''Provisional A'' endorsement.

    (a) A ``provisional A'' endorsement entitles the holder to 
participate in the limited entry fishery for all groundfish species with 
the type(s) of limited entry gear specified in the endorsement, except 
for sablefish harvested north of 36 deg. N. lat. during times and with 
gears for which a fixed gear sablefish endorsement is required. See 
Sec. 660.336 for provisions regarding sablefish endorsement 
requirements.
    (b) A ``provisional A'' endorsement is not transferrable except as 
specified in the PCGFMP.
    (c) The holder of a ``provisional A'' endorsement must comply with 
the requirements set out in the PCGFMP at 14.3.2.4 in order for the 
permit to be upgraded to an ``A'' permit.
    (d) A ``provisional A'' endorsement expires at the end of any of the 
three consecutive 365-day periods (during the 3-year qualifying period) 
in which a vessel's landings do not meet the applicable landing 
requirement or upon failure to renew the limited entry permit. A 
``provisional A'' endorsement that expires will not be reissued.

[61 FR 34572, July 2, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 34674, June 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 660.336  Limited entry permits--sablefish endorsement and tier assignment.

    (a) General. Participation in the limited entry fixed gear sablefish 
fishery during the ``regular'' or ``mop-up'' season described in 
Sec. 660.323 (a)(2)(iii) and (iv) north of 36 deg. N. lat., requires 
that an owner of a vessel hold (by ownership or otherwise) a limited 
entry permit, registered for use with that vessel, with a longline or 
trap (or pot) endorsement and a sablefish endorsement. During a period 
when the limited entry sablefish fishery is restricted to those limited 
entry vessels with sablefish endorsements, a vessel with a longline or 
pot limited entry permit but without a sablefish endorsement cannot be 
used to harvest sablefish in the open access fishery, even with open 
access gear.
    (1) A sablefish endorsement with a tier assignment will be affixed 
to the permit and will remain valid when the permit is transferred.
    (2) A sablefish endorsement and its associated tier assignment are 
not separable from the limited entry permit, and therefore may not be 
transferred separately from the limited entry permit.
    (b) Endorsement and tier assignment qualifying criteria. A sablefish 
endorsement will be affixed to any limited entry permit that meets the 
sablefish endorsement qualifying criteria and for which the owner 
submits a timely application. Limited entry permits with sablefish 
endorsements will be assigned to one of three different cumulative trip 
limit tiers, based on the qualifying catch history of the permit.
    (1) Permit catch history will be used to determine whether a permit 
meets the qualifying criteria for a fixed gear sablefish endorsement and 
to determine the appropriate tier assignment for endorsed permits. 
Permit catch history includes the catch history of the vessel(s) that 
initially qualified for the permit, and subsequent catch histories 
accrued when the limited entry permit or permit rights were associated 
with other vessels. The catch history of a permit also includes the 
catch of any interim permit held by the current owner of the permit 
during the appeal of an initial NMFS decision to deny the initial 
issuance of a limited entry permit, but only if the appeal for which an 
interim permit was issued was lost by the appellant, and the owner's 
current permit was used by the owner in the 1995 limited entry sablefish 
fishery. The catch history of an interim permit where the full ``A'' 
permit was ultimately granted will also be considered part of the catch 
history of the ``A'' permit. If the current permit is the result of the 
combination of multiple permits, then for the combined permit to qualify 
for an endorsement, at least one of the permits that were combined must 
have had sufficient sablefish history to qualify for an endorsement; or 
the permit must qualify based on catch occurring after it was combined, 
but taken within the qualifying period. If the current permit is the 
result of the combination of multiple permits, the combined catch 
histories of all of the permits that were combined to create a new 
permit before March 12, 1998, will

[[Page 398]]

be used in calculating the tier assignment for the resultant permit, 
together with any catch history (during the qualifying period) of the 
resultant permit. Only sablefish catch regulated by this part that was 
taken with longline or fish trap (or pot) gear will be considered for 
this endorsement. Sablefish harvested illegally or landed illegally will 
not be considered for this endorsement.
    (2) The sablefish endorsement qualifying criteria are: At least 
16,000 lb (7,257.5 kg) round weight of sablefish caught with longline or 
trap (or pot) gear in one calendar year from 1984 through 1994. All 
catch must be sablefish managed under this part. Sablefish taken in 
tribal set-aside fisheries does not qualify.
    (3) Only limited entry, fixed gear permits with sablefish 
endorsements will receive cumulative trip limit tier assignments. The 
qualifying criteria for Tier 1 are: At least 898,000 lb (406,794 kg) 
cumulative round weight of sablefish caught with longline or trap (or 
pot) gear over the years 1984 through 1994. The qualifying criteria for 
Tier 2 are: At least 380,000 lb (172,365 kg), but no more than 897,999 
lb (406,793 kg) cumulative round weight of sablefish caught with 
longline or trap (or pot) gear over the years 1984 through 1994. Fixed 
gear permits with less than 380,000 lb (172,365 kg) cumulative round 
weight of sablefish caught with longline or trap (or pot) gear over the 
years 1984 through 1994 qualify for Tier 3. All catch must be sablefish 
managed under this part. Sablefish taken in tribal set aside fisheries 
does not qualify.
    (c) Issuance process for sablefish endorsements. (1) The SFD has 
notified each limited entry, fixed gear permit holder, by letter of 
qualification status, whether Pacific States Marine Fisheries 
Commission's Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) records 
indicate that his or her permit qualifies for a sablefish endorsement. A 
person who has been notified by the SFD, by letter of qualification 
status, that his or her permit qualifies for a sablefish endorsement 
will be issued a revised limited entry permit with a sablefish 
endorsement if, by November 30, 1998, that person returns to the SFD the 
endorsement application and pays the one-time processing fee. No new 
applications for sablefish endorsements will be accepted after November 
30, 1998.
    (2) If the permit owner receives a letter of qualification status 
from the FMD indicating that PacFIN records do not show that his or her 
permit qualifies for a sablefish endorsement and if the permit owner 
believes that there is sufficient evidence to show that his or her 
permit does qualify for an endorsement, that permit holder must submit 
information to the FMD to demonstrate that the permit does qualify for a 
sablefish endorsement within 30 days of the issuance of the FMD's letter 
of qualification status. Section 660.333(d) sets out the relevant 
evidentiary standards and burden of proof.
    (3) After review of the evidence submitted under Sec. 660.336(c)(2), 
and any additional information the FMD finds to be relevant, the FMD 
will notify a permit owner if the permit qualifies for a sablefish 
endorsement. A person whose permit qualifies will be issued a revised 
limited entry permit with a sablefish endorsement upon payment of the 
one-time processing fee.
    (4) After review of the evidence submitted under Sec. 660.336(c)(2), 
and any additional information the FMD finds to be relevant, the FMD 
will notify a permit owner of his determination that the permit does not 
qualify for a sablefish endorsement.
    (5) If permit holder wishes to file an appeal of the determination 
under Sec. 660.336(c)(4), the appeal must be filed with the Regional 
Administrator within 30 days of the issuance of the letter (at 
Sec. 660.336(c)(4)). The appeal must be in writing and must allege facts 
or circumstances, and include credible evidence, demonstrating why the 
permit (or interim permit) qualifies for the sablefish endorsement. The 
appeal of a denial of a sablefish endorsement will not be referred to 
the Council for a recommendation under Sec. 660.340(e).
    (6) Absent good cause for further delay, the Regional Administrator 
will issue a written decision on the appeal within 45 days of receipt of 
the appeal. The Regional Administrator's decision is the final 
administrative decision of

[[Page 399]]

the Department of Commerce as of the date of the decision.
    (d) Issuance process for tier assignments. (1) The SFD will notify 
each owner of a limited entry permit with a sablefish endorsement, by 
letter of qualification status, of the tier assignment for which his or 
her permit qualifies, as indicated by PacFIN records. The SFD will also 
send to the permit owner a tier assignment certificate.
    (2) If a permit owner believes there is sufficient evidence to show 
that his or her permit qualifies for a different tier than that listed 
in the letter of qualification status, that permit owner must, within 30 
days of the issuance of the SFD's letter of qualification status, submit 
information to the SFD to demonstrate that the permit qualifies for a 
different tier. Section 660.333(d) sets out the relevant evidentiary 
standards and burden of proof.
    (3) After review of the evidence submitted under paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section, and any additional information the SFD finds to be 
relevant, the SFD will issue a letter of determination notifying a 
permit owner of whether the evidence submitted is sufficient to alter 
the initial tier assignment. If the SFD determines the permit qualifies 
for a different tier, the permit owner will be issued a revised tier 
assignment certificate once the initial certificate is returned to the 
SFD for processing.
    (4) If a permit owner chooses to file an appeal of the determination 
under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the appeal must be filed with 
the Regional Administrator within 30 days of the issuance of the letter 
of determination (at paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The appeal must 
be in writing and must allege facts or circumstances, and include 
credible evidence demonstrating why the permit qualifies for a different 
tier assignment. The appeal of a denial of an application for a 
different tier assignment will not be referred to the Council for a 
recommendation under Sec. 660.340(e).
    (5) Absent good cause for further delay, the Regional Administrator 
will issue a written decision on the appeal within 30 days of receipt of 
the appeal. The Regional Administrator's decision is the final 
administrative decision of the Department of Commerce as of the date of 
the decision.
    (e) Tier assignment certificates. For the 1998 season only, permit 
holders with sablefish endorsements will be issued certificates of tier 
assignment that are to be kept with and are considered part of their 
limited entry permits. When limited entry permit holders renew their 
permits for 1999, tier assignments for those limited entry permit 
holders with sablefish endorsements will be indicated directly on the 
limited entry permit.

<R05>
Sec. 660.337  Limited entry permits--``designated species B'' endorsement.

    (a) Issuance criteria--(1) General. Designated species means Pacific 
whiting, jack mackerel north of 39 deg. N. lat., and shortbelly 
rockfish. Bycatch allowances in fisheries for these species will be 
established using the procedures specified for incidental allowances in 
joint venture and foreign fisheries in the PCGFMP.
    (2) Catch limit. On or about October 1 of each year, the FMD will 
determine the commitment of persons with limited entry permits with 
``A'' gear endorsements (the ``limited entry fleet'') to harvest each 
designated species for delivery to domestic processors during the coming 
year. ``Commitment'' means a permit holder's contract or agreement with 
a specific domestic processor to deliver an estimated amount of the 
designated species. The ``designated species B'' endorsement catch limit 
is the harvest guideline or quota for the designated species minus the 
commitment of the limited entry fleet. If the commitment is less than 
DAP and the harvest guideline or quota for the species, ``designated 
species B'' endorsements valid for delivery to domestic processors will 
be issued in numbers necessary to reach but not exceed the harvest 
guideline or quota. ``Designated species B'' endorsements also may be 
issued for delivery to foreign processors of designated species for 
which a JVP is established. If, at any time during the fishing year, the 
FMD determines that any part of the limited entry fleet commitment will 
not be taken, the Regional Director

[[Page 400]]

will make a reapportionment to the ``designated species B'' endorsement 
catch limit. The amount of the annual limited entry fleet commitment, 
``designated species B'' endorsement catch limit, and the amounts and 
timing of any reapportionments to the ``designated species B'' 
endorsement catch limit will be announced in the Federal Register.
    (3) Procedure for issuance. Owners of vessels applying for 
``designated species B'' endorsements must apply on or before November 1 
of each year for a ``designated species B'' endorsement for the 
following year. Applications are available from the FMD. Applicants are 
required to specify their commitments for delivery of the designated 
species for the coming year. On or about November 1 of each year, the 
FMD will establish a prioritized list of applicants based on seniority 
(number of years the vessel has fished for the designated species). A 
vessel which replaces a lost vessel, consistent with the standards in 
the PCGFMP, has the same seniority status as the replaced vessel. 
Vessels with equal seniority will be ranked equally. ``Designated 
species B'' endorsements will be issued first to all vessels with the 
highest seniority, then to those with the next highest seniority, and so 
on down the list. No further endorsements will be issued when it is 
estimated that the commitments of applicants receiving endorsements is 
sufficient to take the ``designated species B'' catch limit. If there 
are insufficient commitments by senior applicants to take the 
``designated species B'' catch limit, additional applications will be 
ranked by lottery and a number of endorsements sufficient to take the 
catch limit will be issued.
    (b) Attributes. (1) A limited entry permit with a ``designated 
species B'' endorsement entitles the permit recipient to fish only for 
the species, and only with the gear, specified in the endorsement.
    (2) A ``designated species B'' endorsement is not transferable to 
another person, and may not be used with a different vessel under the 
same ownership, unless the vessel has been totally lost and replaced 
consistent with the provisions of the PCGFMP, in which case the 
replacement vessel has the same seniority as the lost vessel for 
purposes of a ``designated species B'' endorsement.
    (3) A ``designated species B'' endorsement is valid only for the 
fishing year for which it is issued.

Sec. 660.338  Limited entry permits--new permits.

    (a) Small limited entry fisheries that are controlled by a local 
government, are in existence as of July 11, 1991, and have negligible 
impacts on the groundfish resource, may be certified as consistent with 
the goals and objectives of the limited entry program and incorporated 
into the limited entry fishery. Permits issued under this subsection 
will be issued according to the standards and procedures set out in the 
PCGFMP and will carry the rights explained therein. Window period is 
that period from July 11, 1984, through August 1, 1988.
    (b) If, after the window period, an exempt gear is prohibited by 
Washington, Oregon, or California or NMFS, the owners of vessels using 
such gear, who would not otherwise qualify for an ``A'' or ``provisional 
A'' endorsement, may qualify for a ``provisional A'' endorsement for 
only one of the three limited entry gears, if the vessel used the 
prohibited gear to make sufficient landings of groundfish during the 
window period to meet the MLR for the limited entry gear. If a vessel 
would qualify for an endorsement for more than one limited entry gear, 
the owner must choose the type of gear for which the endorsement will be 
issued. If an ``A'' or ``provisional A'' endorsement was previously 
issued for the vessel, and the endorsement was subsequently transferred 
or expired, no ``provisional A'' endorsement will be issued. Permits 
issued under this section will be issued according to the procedures and 
standards set out in the PCGFMP and will carry the rights explained 
therein.
    (c) An owner of a vessel that qualifies under this section must 
apply to the FMD for a permit within 180 days of incorporation of the 
limited entry fleet of which the vessel is a part or within 180 days of 
the effective date of the prohibition of that vessel's gear. Untimely 
applications will be rejected unless the

[[Page 401]]

applicant demonstrates that circumstances beyond the applicant's control 
prevented submission of the application during the specified period. 
Illness, injury, or death of the potential applicant are the primary 
grounds on which untimely applications may be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 660.339  Limited entry permit fees.

    The Regional Director will charge fees to cover administrative 
expenses related to issuance of limited entry permits, including initial 
issuance, renewal, transfer, vessel registration, replacement, and 
appeals. The appropriate fee must accompany each application.


<R05>
Sec. 660.340  Limited entry permit appeals.

    (a) Decisions on appeals of initial decisions regarding issuance, 
renewal, transfer, and registration of limited entry permits, and 
endorsement upgrade, will be made by the Regional Director.
    (b) Appeals decisions shall be in writing and shall state the 
reasons therefor.
    (c) Within 30 days of an initial decision by the FMD denying 
issuance, renewal, transfer, or registration of a limited entry permit, 
or endorsement upgrade, on the terms requested by the applicant, an 
appeal may be filed with the Regional Director.
    (d) The appeal must be in writing, and must allege facts or 
circumstances to show why the criteria in this subpart have been met, or 
why an exception should be granted.
    (e) At the appellant's discretion, the appeal may be accompanied by 
a request that the Regional Director seek a recommendation from the 
Council as to whether the appeal should be granted. Such a request must 
contain the appellant's acknowledgement that the confidentiality 
provisions of the Magnuson Act at 16 U.S.C. 1853(d) and part 600 of this 
chapter are waived with respect to any information supplied by the 
Regional Director to the Council and its advisory bodies for purposes of 
receiving the Council's recommendation on the appeal. In responding to a 
request for a recommendation on appeal, the Council will apply the 
provisions of the PCGFMP in making its recommendation as to whether the 
appeal should be granted.
    (f) Absent good cause for further delay, the Regional Director will 
issue a written decision on the appeal within 45 days of receipt of the 
appeal, or, if a recommendation from the Council is requested, within 45 
days of receiving the Council's recommendation. The Regional Director's 
decision is the final administrative decision of the Department as of 
the date of the decision.


<R05>
Sec. 660.341  Limited entry permit sanctions.

    Limited entry permits issued or applied for under this subpart are 
subject to sanctions pursuant to the Magnuson Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(g) 
and 15 CFR part 904, subpart D.

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 36617, July 7, 1998, Sec. 660.350 was 
added, effective July 1, 1998 through Jan. 4, 1999.


<R05>
Sec. 660.350  Compensation with fish for collecting resource information--exempted fishing permits off Washington, Oregon, and California.

    In addition to the reasons stated in Sec. 600.745(b)(1) of this 
chapter, an EFP may be issued under this subpart G for the purpose of 
compensating the owner or operator of a vessel for collecting resource 
information according to a protocol approved by NMFS. The EFP would 
allow a vessel to retain fish as compensation in excess of trip limits, 
or to be exempt from other specified management measures for the Pacific 
coast groundfish fishery.
    (a) Compensation EFP. A compensation EFP may be issued to the owner 
or operator of a vessel that conducted a resource survey according to a 
contract with NMFS. A vessel's total compensation from all sources (in 
terms of dollars or amount of fish and including fish from survey 
samples or compensation fish) will be determined through normal Federal 
procurement procedures. The compensation EFP will specify the maximum 
amount or value of fish that may be retained by the vessel after the 
resource survey is completed.
    (1) Competitive offers. NMFS may initiate a competitive solicitation 
(request for proposals or RFP) to select

[[Page 402]]

vessels to conduct resource surveys that use fish as full or partial 
compensation, following normal Federal procurement procedures.
    (2) Consultation and approval. At a Council meeting, NMFS will 
consult with the Council and receive public comment on upcoming resource 
surveys to be conducted if groundfish could be used as whole or partial 
compensation. Generally, compensation fish would be similar to surveyed 
species, but there may be reasons to provide payment with healthier, 
more abundant, less restricted stocks, or more easily targeted species. 
For example, NMFS may decline to pay a vessel with species that are, or 
are expected to be, overfished, or that are subject to overfishing, or 
that are unavoidably caught with species that are overfished or subject 
to overfishing. NMFS also may also consider levels of discards, bycatch, 
and other factors. If the Council does not approve providing whole or 
partial compensation for the conduct of a survey, NMFS will not use 
fish, other than fish taken during the scientific research, as 
compensation for that survey. For each proposal, NMFS will present:
    (i) The maximum number of vessels expected or needed to conduct the 
survey,
    (ii) An estimate of the species and amount of fish likely to be 
needed as compensation,
    (iii) When the survey and compensation fish would be taken, and
    (iv) The year in which the compensation fish would be deducted from 
the ABC before determining the harvest guideline or quota.
    (3) Issuance of the compensation EFP. Upon successful completion of 
the survey, NMFS will issue a ``compensation EFP'' to the vessel if it 
has not been fully compensated. The procedures in Sec. 600.745(b)(1) 
through (b)(4) of this chapter do not apply to a compensation EFP issued 
under this subpart for the Pacific coast groundfish fishery (50 CFR part 
660, subpart G).
    (4) Terms and conditions of the compensation EFP. Conditions for 
disposition of bycatch or any excess catch, for reporting the value of 
the amount landed, and other appropriate terms and conditions will be 
specified in the EFP. Compensation fishing must occur during the period 
specified in the EFP, but no later than the end of September of the 
fishing year following the survey, and must be conducted according to 
the terms and conditions of the EFP.
    (5) Reporting the compensation catch. The compensation EFP may 
require the vessel owner or operator to keep separate records of 
compensation fishing and to submit them to NMFS within a specified 
period of time after the compensation fishing is completed.
    (6) Accounting for the compensation fish. As part of the annual 
specification process (Sec. 660.321), NMFS will advise the Council of 
the amount of fish retained under a compensation EFP, which then will be 
deducted from the next year's ABCs before setting the HGs or quotas. 
Fish taken too late in the year to be deducted from the following year's 
ABC will be accounted for in the next management cycle practicable.
    (b) EFP with a compensation clause. An EFP may be issued to a 
commercial fishing vessel for the purpose of collecting resource 
information in excess of current management limits (Sec. 600.745(b) of 
this chapter). The EFP may include a compensation clause that allows the 
participating vessel to be compensated with fish for its efforts to 
collect resource information according to NMFS' approved protocol. If 
compensation with fish is requested in an EFP application, or proposed 
by NMFS, the following provisions apply in addition to those at 
Sec. 600.745(b) of this chapter.
    (1) Application. In addition to the requirements in Sec. 600.745(b) 
of this chapter, application for an EFP with a compensation clause must 
clearly state whether a vessel's participation is contingent upon 
compensation with groundfish and, if so, the minimum amount (in metric 
tons, round weight) and the species. As with other EFPs issued under 
Sec. 600.745 of this chapter, the application may be submitted by any 
individual, including a state fishery management agency or other 
research institution.
    (2) Denial. In addition to the reasons stated in 
Sec. 600.745(b)(3)(iii) of this chapter, the application will be denied 
if the requested compensation fishery,

[[Page 403]]

species, or amount is unacceptable for reasons such as, but not limited 
to, the following: NMFS concludes the value of the resource information 
is not commensurate with the value of the compensation fish; the 
proposed compensation involves species that are (or are expected to be) 
overfished or subject to overfishing, fishing in times or areas where 
fishing is otherwise prohibited or severely restricted, or fishing for 
species that would involve unavoidable bycatch of species that are 
overfished or subject to overfishing; or NMFS concludes the information 
can reasonably be obtained at less cost to the resource.
    (3) Window period for other applications. If the RA or designee 
agrees that compensation should be considered, then a window period will 
be announced in the Federal Register during which additional 
participants will have an opportunity to apply. This notification would 
be made at the same time as announcement of receipt of the application 
and request for comments required under Sec. 660.745(b). If there are 
more qualified applicants than needed for a particular time and area, 
NMFS will choose among the qualified vessels, either randomly, in order 
of receipt of the completed application, or by other impartial selection 
methods. If the permit applicant is a state, university, or Federal 
entity other than NMFS and NMFS approves the selection method, the 
permit applicant may chose among the qualified vessels, either randomly, 
in order of receipt of the vessel application, or by other impartial 
selection methods.
    (4) Terms and conditions. The EFP will specify the amounts that may 
be taken as scientific samples and as compensation, the time period 
during which the compensation fishing must occur, management measures 
that are waived while fishing under the EFP, and other terms and 
conditions appropriate to the fishery and the collection of resource 
information. NMFS may require compensation fishing to occur on the same 
trip that the resource information is collected.
    (5) Accounting for the catch. Samples taken under this EFP, as well 
as any compensation fish, are counted toward the current year's catch or 
landings.

fishing gear, that has a present capability for:
    (1) On board freezing of the catch.
    (2) Storage of the fish in a frozen condition until they are landed.
    Land or landing means to begin transfer of fish from a fishing 
vessel. Once transfer begins, all fish onboard the vessel are counted as 
part of the landing.
    Plugs means artificial fishing lures made of wood or hard plastic 
with one or more hooks attached. Lures commonly known as ``spoons,'' 
``wobblers,'' ``dodgers,'' and flexible plastic lures are not considered 
plugs, and may not be used where ``plugs only'' are specified.
    Recreational fishing means fishing with recreational fishing gear as

any force or mutilation of the salmon other than fanning or swinging the 
tail.
    Treaty Indian fishing means fishing for salmon and steelhead in the 
fishery management area by a person authorized by the Makah Tribe to 
exercise fishing rights under the Treaty with the Makah, or by the 
Quileute, Hoh, or

[[Page 405]]

Quinault Tribes to exercise fishing rights under the Treaty of Olympia.
    Troll fishing gear will be defined annually under Sec. 660.408.

Sec. 600.725 of this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to do any of 
the following:
    (1) Take and retain or land salmon caught with a net in the fishery 
management area, except that a hand-held net may be used to bring hooked 
salmon on board a vessel.
    (2) Fish for, or take and retain, any species of salmon:
    (i) During closed seasons or in closed areas;
    (ii) While possessing on board any species not allowed to be taken 
in the area at the time;
    (iii) Once any catch limit is attained;
    (iv) By means of gear or methods other than recreational fishing 
gear or troll fishing gear, or gear authorized under Sec. 660.408(k) for 
treaty Indian fishing;
    (v) In violation of any action issued under this subpart; or
    (vi) In violation of any applicable area, season, species, zone, 
gear, daily bag limit, or length restriction.
    (3) Fish for salmon in an area when salmon of less than the legal 
minimum length for that area are on board the fishing vessel, except 
that this provision does not prohibit transit of an area when salmon of 
less than the legal minimum length for that area are on board, so long 
as no fishing is being conducted.
    (4) Remove the head of any salmon caught in the fishery management 
area, or possess a salmon with the head removed, if that salmon has been 
marked by removal of the adipose fin to indicate that a coded wire tag 
has been implanted in the head of the fish.
    (5) Take and retain or possess on board a fishing vessel any species 
of salmon that is less than the applicable minimum total length, 
including the applicable minimum length for dressed, head-off salmon.
    (6) Possess on board a fishing vessel a salmon, for which a minimum 
total length is extended or cannot be determined, except that dressed, 
head-off salmon may be possessed on board a freezer trolling vessel, 
unless the

adipose fin of such salmon has been removed.
    (7) Fail to return to the water immediately and with the least 
possible injury any salmon the retention of which is prohibited by this 
subpart.
    (8) Engage in recreational fishing while aboard a vessel engaged in 
commercial fishing. This restriction is not intended to prohibit the use 
of fishing gear otherwise permitted under the definitions of troll and 
recreational fishing gear, so long as that gear is legal in the fishery 
for which it is being used.
    (9) Take and retain, possess, or land any steelhead taken in the 
course of commercial fishing in the fishery management area, unless such 
take and retention qualifies as treaty Indian fishing.
    (10) Sell, barter, offer to sell, offer to barter, or purchase any 
salmon taken in the course of recreational salmon fishing.
    (11) Refuse to submit fishing gear or catch subject to such person's

prevent, by any means, such an inspection.
    (12) Take and retain Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) 
except in accordance with regulations of the International Pacific 
Halibut Commission at part 300 of this title. Pacific halibut that 
cannot be retained lawfully must be returned to the water immediately 
and with the least possible injury.
    (13) Violate any other provision of this subpart.
    (b) The fishery management area is closed to salmon fishing except 
as opened by this subpart or superseding regulations or notices. All

time on the dates specified.


<R05>
Sec. 660.406  Exempted fishing.

    (a) NMFS may allow such exempted fishing in the fishery management 
area as may be recommended by the Council, the Federal Government, state 
government, or treaty Indian tribes having usual and accustomed fishing 
grounds in the fishery management area.
    (b) NMFS will not allow any exempted fishery recommended by the 
Council unless NMFS determines that the purpose, design, and 
administration of the exempted fishery are consistent with the goals and 
objectives of the Council's fishery management plan, the national 
standards (section 301(a) of the Magnuson Act), and other applicable 
law.
    (c) Each vessel participating in any exempted fishery recommended by 
the Council and allowed by NMFS is subject to all provisions of this 
subpart, except those portions which relate to the purpose and nature of 
the exempted fishery. These exceptions will be specified in a permit 
issued by the Regional Director to each vessel participating in the 
exempted fishery and that permit must be carried aboard each 
participating vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 660.407  Treaty Indian fishing.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, treaty Indian fishing 
in any part of the fishery management area is subject to the provisions 
of this subpart, the Magnuson Act, and any other regulations issued 
under the Magnuson Act.


<R05>
Sec. 660.408  Annual actions.

    (a) General. NMFS will annually establish or, as necessary, adjust 
management specifications for the commercial, recreational, and treaty 
Indian fisheries by publishing the action in the Federal Register under 
Sec. 660.411. Management specifications are set forth in paragraphs (b) 
through (n) of this section.
    (b) Allowable ocean harvest levels. The allowable ocean harvest for 
commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be expressed in 
terms of season regulations expected to achieve a certain optimum 
harvest level or in terms of a particular number of fish. Procedures for 
determining allowable ocean harvest vary by species and fishery 
complexity, and are documented in the fishery management plan and 
Council documents.
    (c) Allocation of ocean harvest levels--(1) Coho and chinook from 
the U.S.-Canada border to Cape Falcon--(i) Overall allocation schedule. 
Initial allocation of coho and chinook salmon north of Cape Falcon, OR, 
will be based on the following schedule:

[[Page 407]]



------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      Percentage <SUP>1</SUP>
 Allowable non-treaty ocean harvest (thousands -------------------------
                   of fish)                     Commercial  Recreational
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coho:
  0-300.......................................         25           75
  >300........................................         60           40
Chinook:
  0-100.......................................         50           50
  >100-150....................................         60           40
  >150........................................         70          30
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<SUP>1</SUP> The percentage allocation is tiered and must be calculated in additive
  steps when the harvest level exceeds the initial tier. For example,
  for a total allowable ocean harvest of 150,000 chinook, the
  recreational allocation would be equal to 50 percent of 100,000
  chinook plus 40 percent of 50,000 chinook or 50,000 + 20,000 = 70,000
  chinook.

    (ii) Deviations from allocation schedule. The initial allocation may 
be modified annually in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) through 
(vii) of this section. These deviations from the allocation schedule 
provide flexibility to account for the dynamic nature of the fisheries 
and better achieve the allocation objectives and fishery allocation 
priorities in paragraphs (c)(1)(viii) and (ix) of this section. Total 
allowable ocean harvest will be maximized to the extent possible 
consistent with treaty obligations, state fishery needs, and spawning 
requirements. Every effort will be made to establish seasons and gear 
requirements that provide troll and recreational fleets a reasonable 
opportunity to catch the available harvest. These may include single-
species directed fisheries with landing restrictions for other species.
    (iii) Preseason trades. Preseason species trades (chinook and coho) 
may be made if they are based upon the recommendation of the commercial 
and recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanel representatives for the area 
north of Cape Falcon; simultaneously benefit both the commercial and 
recreational fisheries or benefit one fishery without harming the other; 
and are supported by a socio-economic analysis that compares the impacts 
of the recommendation to those of the standard allocation schedule to 
determine the allocation that best meets the allocation objectives. This 
analysis will be made available to the public during the preseason 
process for establishing annual management measures. Preseason trades 
will use an exchange ratio of four coho to one chinook as a desirable 
guideline.
    (iv) Commercial allocation. The commercial allowable ocean harvest 
of chinook and coho derived during the preseason allocation process may 
be varied by major subareas (i.e., north of Leadbetter Point and south 
of Leadbetter Point) if there is need to do so to decrease impacts on 
weak stocks. Deviations in each major subarea will generally not exceed 
50 percent of the allowable ocean harvest of each species that would 
have been established without a geographic deviation in the distribution 
of the allowable ocean harvest. Deviation of more than 50 percent will 
be based on a conservation need to protect the weak stocks and will 
provide larger overall harvest for the entire fishery north of Cape 
Falcon than would have been possible without the deviation.
    (v) Recreational allocation. The recreational allowable ocean 
harvest of chinook and coho derived during the preseason allocation 
process will be distributed among the three major recreational subareas 
as described in the coho and chinook distribution sections below. 
Additionally, based upon the recommendation of the recreational Salmon 
Advisory Subpanel representatives for the area north of Cape Falcon, the 
Council will include criteria in its preseason salmon management 
recommendations to guide any inseason transfer of coho among the 
recreational subareas to meet recreational season duration objectives. 
The Council may also establish additional subarea quotas with a major 
subarea to meet recreational season objectives based on agreement of 
representatives of the affected ports.
    (A) Coho distribution. The preseason recreational allowable ocean 
harvest of coho north of Cape Falcon will be distributed to provide 50 
percent to the area north of Leadbetter Point and 50 percent to the area 
south of Leadbetter Point. In years with no fishery in Washington State 
management area 4B, the distribution of coho north of Leadbetter Point 
will be divided to provide 74 percent to the subarea between Leadbetter 
Point and the Queets River (Westport) and 26 percent to the subarea 
north of the Queets River (Neah Bay/La Push). In years when there is an 
area 4B fishery under state

[[Page 408]]

management, 25 percent of the numerical value of that fishery shall be 
added to the recreational allowable ocean harvest north of Leadbetter 
Point prior to applying the sharing percentages. That same value would 
then be subtracted from the Neah Bay/La Push share in order to maintain 
the same total distribution north of Leadbetter Point.
    (B) Chinook distribution. Subarea distributions of chinook will be 
managed as guidelines based on calculations of the Salmon Technical Team 
with the primary objective of achieving all-species fisheries without 
imposing chinook restrictions (i.e., area closures or bag limit 
reductions). Chinook in excess of all-species fisheries needs may be 
utilized by directed chinook fisheries north of Cape Falcon or by 
negotiating a preseason species trade of chinook and coho between 
commercial and recreational allocations in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (vi) Inseason trades and transfers. Inseason transfers, including 
species trades of chinook and coho, may be permitted in either direction 
between commercial and recreational fishery quotas to allow for 
uncatchable fish in one fishery to be reallocated to the other. Fish 
will be deemed uncatchable by a respective commercial or recreational 
fishery only after considering all possible annual management actions to 
allow for their harvest that are consistent with the harvest management 
objectives specific in the fishery management plan including 
consideration of single species fisheries. Implementation of inseason 
transfers will require consultation with the pertinent commercial and 
recreational Salmon Advisory Subpanel representatives from the area 
involved and the Salmon Technical Team, and a clear establishment of 
available fish and impacts from the transfer. Inseason trades or 
transfers may vary from the guideline ratio of four coho to one chinook 
to meet the allocation objectives in paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this 
section.
    (vii) Other inseason provisions. Any increase or decrease in the 
recreational or commercial allowable ocean harvest resulting from an 
inseason restructuring of a fishery or other inseason management action 
does not require reallocation of the overall non-treaty allowable ocean 
harvest north of Cape Falcon between the recreational and commercial 
fisheries. Inseason redistribution of subarea quotas within the 
recreational fishery or the distribution of allowable coho catch 
transfers from the commercial fishery among subareas may deviate from 
the preseason distribution. Inseason management actions may be taken by 
the Regional Director to assure meeting the primary objective of 
achieving all-species fisheries without imposing chinook restrictions in 
each of the recreational subareas north of Cape Falcon. Such actions 
might include, but are not limited to: Closure from 0 to 3, 0 to 6, 3 to 
200, or 5 to 200 nm from shore; closure from a point extending due west 
from Tatoosh Island for 5 nm, then south to a point due west of Umatilla 
Reef Buoy, then due east to shore; closure from North Head at the 
Columbia River mouth north to Leadbetter Point; change in species that 
may be landed; or other actions as prescribed in the annual management 
measures.
    (viii) Allocation objectives. The goal of allocating ocean harvest 
north of Cape Falcon is to achieve, to the greatest degree possible, the 
following objectives for the commercial and recreational fisheries. When 
deviation from the allocation schedule is being considered, these 
objectives will serve as criteria to help determine whether a user group 
will benefit from the deviation.
    (A) Provide recreational opportunity by maximizing the duration of 
the fishing season while minimizing daily and area closures and 
restrictions on gear and daily limits.
    (B) Maximize the value of the commercial harvest while providing 
fisheries of reasonable duration.
    (ix) Fishery allocation priorities. The following fishery allocation 
priorities will provide guidance in the preseason process of 
establishing final harvest allocations and structuring seasons that best 
achieve the allocation objectives. To the extent fish are provided to 
each fishery by the allocation schedule, these priorities do not favor 
one user group over the other and should be met

[[Page 409]]

simultaneously for each fishery. Seasons may be structured that deviate 
from these priorities consistent with the allocation objectives.
    (A) At total allowable harvest levels up to 300,000 coho and 100,000 
chinook: For the recreational fishery, provide coho for a late June 
through early September all-species season; provide chinook to allow 
access to coho and, if possible, a minimal chinook-only fishery prior to 
the all-species season; and adjust days per week and/or institute area 
restrictions to stabilize season duration. For the commercial fishery, 
provide chinook for a May and early June chinook season and provide coho 
for hooking mortality and/or access to a pink fishery, and ensure that 
part of the chinook season will occur after June 1.
    (B) At total allowable harvest levels above 300,000 coho and above 
100,000 chinook: For the recreational fishery, relax any restrictions in 
the all-species fishery and/or extend the all-species season beyond 
Labor Day as coho quota allows; provide chinook for a Memorial Day 
through late June chinook-only fishery; and adjust days per week to 
ensure continuity with the all-species season. For the commercial 
fishery, provide coho for an all-species season in late summer and/or 
access to a pink fishery; and leave adequate chinook from the May 
through June season to allow access to coho.
    (2) Coho south of Cape Falcon--(i) Allocation schedule. Preseason 
allocation shares of coho salmon south of Cape Falcon, OR, will be 
determined by an allocation schedule, which is based on the following 
formula. The formula will be used to interpolate between allowable 
harvest levels as shown in the table below.
    (A) Up to 350,000 allowable ocean harvest: The first 150,000 fish 
will be allocated to the recreational fishery. Additional fish will be 
allocated 66.7 percent to troll and 33.3 percent to recreational. The 
incidental coho mortality for a commercial all-salmon-except-coho 
fishery will be deducted from the troll allocation. If the troll 
allocation is insufficient for this purpose, the remaining number of 
coho needed for this estimated incidental coho mortality will be 
deducted from the recreational share.
    (B) From 350,000 to 800,000 allowable ocean harvest: The 
recreational allocation is equal to 14 percent of the allowable harvest 
above 350,000 fish, plus 217,000 fish. The remainder of the allowable 
ocean harvest will be allocated to the troll fishery.
    (C) Above 800,000 allowable ocean harvest: The recreational 
allocation is equal to 10 percent of the allowable harvest above 800,000 
fish, plus 280,000 fish. The remainder of the allowable ocean harvest 
will be allocated to the troll fishery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ An incidental coho allowance associated with any commercial all-
  salmon-except-coho fishery will be deducted from the recreational
  share of coho during periods of low coho abundance when the commercial
  allocation of coho under the schedule would be insufficient to allow
  for incidental hooking mortality of coho in the commercial all-salmon-
  except-coho fishery.

    (ii) Geographic distribution. Allowable harvest south of Cape Falcon 
may be divided and portions assigned to subareas based on considerations 
including, but not limited to, controlling ocean harvest impacts on 
depressed, viable natural stocks within acceptable maximum allowable 
levels; stock abundance; allocation considerations; stock specific 
impacts; relative abundance of

[[Page 410]]

the salmon species in the fishery; escapement goals; and maximizing 
harvest potential.
    (iii) Recreational allocation at 167,000 fish or less. When the 
recreational allocation is at 167,000 fish or less, the total 
recreational allowable ocean harvest of coho will be divided between two 
major subareas with independent impact quotas. The initial allocation 
will be 70 percent from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain and 30 percent 
south of Humbug Mountain. Coho transfers between the two impact quotas 
may be permitted on a one-for-one basis, if chinook constraints preclude 
access to coho. Horse Mountain to Point Arena will be managed for an 
impact guideline of 3 percent of the south of Cape Falcon recreational 
allocation. The recreational coho fishery between Humbug Mountain and 
Point Arena may be closed when it is projected that the harvest impact 
between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena, combined with the projected 
harvest impact that will be taken south of Point Arena to the end of the 
season, equals the impact quota for south of Humbug Mountain. The 
recreational fishery for coho salmon south of Point Arena will not close 
upon attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota.
    (iv) Oregon coastal natural coho. At Oregon coastal natural coho 
spawning escapements of 28 or fewer adults per mile, the allocation 
provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section do not apply. 
Fisheries will be established that will provide only the minimum 
incidental harvest of Oregon coastal natural coho necessary to prosecute 
other fisheries, and that under no circumstances will cause irreparable 
harm to the Oregon coastal natural coho stock.
    (v) Inseason reallocation. No later than August 15 each year, the 
Salmon Technical Team will estimate the number of coho salmon needed to 
complete the recreational seasons. Any coho salmon allocated to the 
recreational fishery that are not needed to complete the recreational 
seasons will be reallocated to the commercial fishery. Once reallocation 
has taken place, the remaining recreational quota will change to a 
harvest guideline. If the harvest guideline for the recreational fishery 
is projected to be reached on or before Labor Day, the Regional Director 
may allow the recreational fishery to continue through the Labor Day 
weekend only if there is no significant danger of impacting the 
allocation of another fishery or of failing to meet an escapement goal.
    (d) Management boundaries and zones. Management boundaries and zones 
will be established or adjusted to achieve a conservation purpose. A 
conservation purpose protects a fish stock, simplifies management of a 
fishery, or promotes wise use of fishery resources by, for example, 
separating fish stocks, facilitating enforcement, separating conflicting 
fishing activities, or facilitating harvest opportunities. Management 
boundaries and zones will be described by geographical references, 
coordinates (latitude and longitude), LORAN readings, depth contours, 
distance from shore, or similar criteria.
    (e) Minimum harvest lengths. The minimum harvest lengths for 
commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be changed upon 
demonstration that a useful purpose will be served. For example, an 
increase in minimum size for commercially caught salmon may be necessary 
for conservation or may provide a greater poundage and monetary yield 
from the fishery while not substantially increasing hooking mortality. 
The removal of a minimum size for the recreational fishery may prevent 
wastage of fish and outweigh the detrimental impacts of harvesting 
immature fish.
    (f) Recreational daily bag limits. Recreational daily bag limits for 
each fishing area will be set equal to one, two, or three salmon of some 
combination of species. The recreational daily bag limits for each 
fishing area will be set to maximize the length of the fishing season 
consistent with the allowable level of harvest in the area.
    (g) Fishing gear restrictions. Gear restrictions for commercial, 
recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be established or modified 
upon demonstration that a useful purpose will be served. For example, 
gear restrictions may be imposed or modified

[[Page 411]]

to facilitate enforcement, reduce hooking mortality, or reduce gear 
expenses for fishermen.
    (h) Seasons--(1) In general. Seasons for commercial and recreational 
fishing will be established or modified taking into account allowable 
ocean harvest levels and quotas, allocations between the commercial and 
recreational fisheries, and the estimated amount of effort required to 
catch the available fish based on past seasons.
    (2) Commercial seasons. Commercial seasons will be established or 
modified taking into account wastage of fish that cannot legally be 
retained, size and poundage of fish caught, effort shifts between 
fishing areas, and protection of depressed stocks present in the fishing 
areas. All-species seasons will be established to allow the maximum 
allowable harvest of pink and sockeye salmon without exceeding allowable 
chinook or coho harvest levels and within conservation and allocation 
constraints of the pink and sockeye stocks.
    (3) Recreational seasons. If feasible, recreational seasons will be 
established or modified to encompass Memorial Day and Labor Day 
weekends, and to avoid the need for inseason closures.
    (i) Quotas (by species, including fish caught 0-3 nm seaward of 
Washington, Oregon, and California). Quotas for commercial, 
recreational, and treaty Indian fishing may be established or modified 
to ensure that allowable ocean harvests are not exceeded. Quotas may be 
fixed or adjustable and used in conjunction with seasons. Any quota 
established does not represent a guaranteed ocean harvest, but a maximum 
ceiling on catch.
    (j) Selective fisheries. In addition to the all-species seasons and 
the all-species-except-coho seasons established for the commercial and 
recreational fisheries, selective coho-only, chinook-only, or pink-only 
fisheries may be established if harvestable fish of the target species 
are available; harvest of incidental species will not exceed allowable 
levels; proven, documented selective gear exists; significant wastage of 
incidental species will not occur; and the selective fishery will occur 
in an acceptable time and area where wastage can be minimized and target 
stocks are primarily available.
    (k) Treaty Indian fishing. (1) NMFS will establish or modify treaty 
Indian fishing seasons and/or fixed or adjustable quotas, size limits, 
gear restrictions, and/or area restrictions taking into account 
recommendations of the Council, proposals from affected tribes, and 
relevant Federal court proceedings.
    (2) The combined treaty Indian fishing seasons will not be longer 
than necessary to harvest the allowable treaty Indian catch, which is 
the total treaty harvest that would occur if the tribes chose to take 
their total entitlement of the weakest stock in the fishery management 
area, assuming this level of harvest did not create conservation or 
allocation problems on other stocks.
    (3) Any fixed or adjustable quotas established will be consistent 
with established treaty rights and will not exceed the harvest that 
would occur if the entire treaty entitlement to the weakest run were 
taken by treaty Indian fisheries in the fishery management area.
    (4) If adjustable quotas are established for treaty Indian fishing, 
they may be subject to inseason adjustment because of unanticipated coho 
hooking mortality occurring during the season, catches in treaty Indian 
fisheries inconsistent with those unanticipated under Federal 
regulations, or a need to redistribute quotas to ensure attainment of an 
overall quota.
    (l) Yurok and Hoopa Valley tribal fishing rights. For purposes of 
section 303 of the Magnuson Act, the federally reserved fishing rights 
of the Yurok and Hoopa Valley Indian Tribes as set out in a legal 
opinion <SUP>2</SUP> dated October 4, 1993, by the Office of the 
Solicitor, Department of the Interior, are applicable law. Under section 
303 of the Magnuson Act, allowable ocean harvest must be consistent with 
all applicable laws.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Copies of the Solicitor's Opinion are available from the 
Director, Southwest Region, NMFS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (m) Inseason notice procedures. Telephone hotlines and USCG 
broadcasts will provide actual notice of inseason actions for 
commercial, recreational, and treaty Indian fishing.

[[Page 412]]

    (n) Reporting requirements. Reporting requirements for commercial 
fishing may be imposed to ensure timely and accurate assessment of 
catches in regulatory areas subject to quota management. Such reports 
are subject to the limitations described herein. Persons engaged in 
commercial fishing in a regulatory area subject to quota management and 
landing their catch in another regulatory area open to fishing may be 
required to transmit a brief radio report prior to leaving the first 
regulatory area. The regulatory areas subject to these reporting 
requirements, the contents of the radio reports, and the entities 
receiving the reports will be specified annually.

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 34601, July 2, 1996, Sec. 660.408 was 
added. This section contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 660.409  Inseason actions.

    (a) Fixed inseason management provisions. NMFS is authorized to take 
the following inseason management actions annually, as appropriate.
    (1) Automatic season closures based on quotas. When a quota for the 
commercial or the recreational fishery, or both, for any salmon species 
in any portion of the fishery management area is projected by the 
Regional Director to be reached on or by a certain date, NMFS will, by 
an inseason action issued under Sec. 660.411, close the commercial or 
recreational fishery, or both, for all salmon species in the portion of 
the fishery management area to which the quota applies as of the date 
the quota is projected to be reached.
    (2) Rescission of automatic closure. If a fishery is closed under a 
quota before the end of a scheduled season based on overestimate of 
actual catch, NMFS will reopen that fishery in as timely a manner as 
possible for all or part of the remaining original season provided NMFS 
finds that a reopening of the fishery is consistent with the management 
objectives for the affected species and the additional open period is no 
less than 24 hours. The season will be reopened by an inseason action 
issued under Sec. 660.411.
    (3) Adjustment for error in preseason estimates. NMFS may, by an 
inseason action issued under Sec. 660.411, make appropriate changes in 
relevant seasons or quotas if a significant computational error or 
errors made in calculating preseason estimates of salmon abundance are 
identified, provided that such correction can be made in a timely manner 
to affect the involved fishery without disrupting the capacity to meet 
the objectives of the fishery management plan.
    (b) Flexible inseason management provisions. (1) The Regional 
Director will consult with the Chairman of the Council and the 
appropriate State Directors prior to taking any of the following 
flexible inseason management provisions, which include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
    (i) Modification of quotas and/or fishing seasons.
    (ii) Modification of the species that may be caught and landed 
during specific seasons and the establishment or modification of limited 
retention regulations.
    (iii) Modification of recreational bag limits and recreational 
fishing days per calendar week.
    (iv) Establishment or modification of gear restrictions.
    (v) Modification of boundaries, including landing boundaries, and 
establishment of closed areas.

Sec. 660.410  Escapement and management goals.

    (a) The escapement and management goals are summarized in Table 6-1 
of the Fishery Management Plan for Commercial and Recreational Salmon 
Fisheries off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California.
    (b) Modification of escapement goals. NMFS is authorized, through an 
action issued under Sec. 660.411, to modify an escapement goal if--
    (1) A comprehensive technical review of the best scientific 
information available provides conclusive evidence that, in the view of 
the Council and the Salmon Technical Team, justifies modification of an 
escapement goal;
    (2) For Oregon coastal chinook, specific goals are developed within 
the overall goal for north coast and south coast stocks; or
    (3) Action by a Federal court indicates that modification of an 
escapement goal is appropriate.
    (c) The annual management measures will be consistent with NMFS 
jeopardy standards or NMFS recovery plans for species listed under the 
Endangered Species Act.

existing data collection provisions. No additional reports will be 
required of fishermen or processors as long as the data collection and 
reporting systems operated by the State of California continue to 
provide the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) with statistical 
information adequate for management. Reporting requirements may be 
implemented by emergency regulations if this reporting system becomes 
inadequate for management purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 660.505  Vessel identification.

    (a) Official number. Each fishing vessel in the reduction fishery 
must display its official number on the port and starboard sides of the

<R05>
Sec. 660.509  Harvest quota.

    (a) Announcement of harvest quotas. The total harvest quota, 
reduction harvest quota, subarea B harvest quota, and special 
allocations will be determined by the Regional Administrator from the 
estimated spawning biomass according to the formulas in paragraph (b) of 
this section, and will be announced on or about August 1 as interim 
final quotas. The quotas will be announced according to the following 
procedure:
    (1) No less than 14 calendar days before the meeting of the 
Council's Anchovy Planning team and Advisory Subpanel, a document will 
be published in the Federal Register notifying the public when the 
estimate of the annual spawning biomass will be available. The document 
also will announce the date and location of a meeting of the Council's 
Anchovy Planning team and Advisory Subpanel, where the estimated 
spawning biomass and the annual quotas will be reviewed and public 
comments received. This meeting is expected to convene during the second 
week of June.
    (2) All materials relating to the annual quotas will be forwarded to 
the Council and its Scientific and Statistical Committee and will be 
available for public inspection at the Office of the Regional 
Administrator.
    (3) On or about August 1, the interim final quotas will be published 
in the Federal Register with an opportunity for public comment.
    (4) At a regular meeting of the Council, the Council will review the 
estimated spawning biomass and harvest quotas and offer time for public 
comment. The Council will either accept the harvest quotas as published 
or recommend to the Regional Administrator that the numbers be revised. 
If a revision is requested, a justification for the revision must be 
provided. An annual quota may be adjusted only if inaccurate data were 
used or if errors were made in the calculations.
    (5) If the Regional Administrator determines that a change in a 
harvest quota is justified, NMFS will publish a document in the Federal 
Register notifying the public of the change and the reasons for the 
change. If no changes are necessary, the interim final quotas will 
become final quotas, and no notice will be published.
    (b) Determination of harvest quotas. The total harvest quota in the 
PAFA will be determined by adding the non-reduction fishery allocation 
in the PAFA and the reduction harvest quota in the PAFA, and they will 
be separately determined by the following formulas.
    (1) When the estimated spawning biomass is less than 300,000 mt, 
there will be no reduction harvest quota, and the non-reduction 
allocation in the PAFA will be 4,900 mt.
    (2) When the estimated spawning biomass is equal to or greater than 
300,000 mt, the reduction harvest quota in the PAFA will be 70 percent 
of the estimated spawning biomass in excess of 300,000 mt or 140,000 mt, 
whichever is

[[Page 416]]

less, and the non-reduction fishery allocation in the PAFA will be 4,900 
mt except as specified in Sec. 660.510(b).
    (3) When the estimated spawning biomass is less than 50,000 mt for 2 
consecutive fishing years, there will be no reduction quota and no non-
reduction allocation until the spawning biomass reaches or exceeds 
50,000 mt.
    (4) There is no limit on the harvest of anchovy for live bait, 
except that when the spawning biomass is less than 50,000 mt for 2 
consecutive fishing years, there will be no live bait harvest until the 
spawning biomass reaches or exceeds 50,000 mt.
    (c) Subarea B harvest quota. The reduction harvest quota for subarea 
B will be equal to the reduction harvest quota in the PAFA minus a 
reserve of 10 percent of the reduction harvest quota or 9,072 mt, 
whichever is less. This reserve is allocated to the reduction fishery in 
subarea A except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Reallocation of subarea A reserve. The Secretary may reallocate 
on June 1 from subarea A to subarea B that portion of the reserve 
allocated to subarea A under paragraph (c) of this section that will not 
be harvested in subarea A by the end of the fishing year. This amount 
will be estimated based on catch to date in the current year and the 
expected intentions of processors and fishermen in the reduction fishery 
north of Point Buchon to harvest anchovies in the remaining fishing 
year. Reallocation under this paragraph will be based first, on a need 
to increase the subarea B harvest quota and secondly, on the projected 
reduction harvest in subarea A to the end of the fishing year.
    (e) Procedure for reallocation of subarea A reserve. (1) The 
Secretary may, by May 1 each year, determine the need to increase the 
subarea B harvest quota as provided in paragraph (d) of this section if 
the expected reduction fishery harvest in subarea B is an amount equal 
to or greater than the subarea B harvest quota. After making a 
determination that the subarea B harvest quota needs to be increased as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary will make the 
estimate under paragraph (d) of this section on or about May 15 and, as 
soon as practicable after June 1, announce to all reduction fishing 
vessel owners and operators and licensed anchovy reduction plant 
operators by notification in the Federal Register and other appropriate 
notice--
    (i) The change in the subarea B quota.
    (ii) The reasons for the change.
    (iii) A summary of, and responses to, any comments submitted under 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (2) The Regional Administrator will compile in aggregate form all 
data used to make the estimates under paragraph (d) of this section and 
make them available for public inspection during normal business hours 
at the Southwest Regional Office at the address in Table 1 Sec. 600.502.
    (3) Comments from the public on the estimates made under paragraph 
(d) of this section may be submitted to the Regional Administrator until 
May 31.
    (f) Anchovies harvested for reduction and non-reduction purposes in 
the PAFA and adjacent territorial sea will be counted toward the total 
harvest quota.


<R05>
Sec. 660.510  Closures.

    (a) Closure of the reduction fishery. The Secretary will close the 
reduction fishery during the open season provided in Sec. 660.511 when 
the total harvest quota in the PAFA is taken. The Secretary will close 
only the reduction fishery in subarea B when the subarea B reduction 
harvest quota is taken.
    (b) Closure of the non-reduction fishery. The Secretary will close 
the non-reduction fishery in the PAFA only if the total harvest quota is 
taken.
    (c) Procedure for closing. (1) When the harvest quotas prescribed in 
Sec. 660.509 are about to be taken, the Secretary will announce, by 
notification in the Federal Register and to the Council and the 
California Department of Fish and Game, the date of closure in one or 
both subareas.
    (2) If a reduction fishery closure is announced, the reduction 
fishery in the affected subarea will cease on the date of closure 
specified in the Federal Register document provided by paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section, and will not resume until a final determination of

[[Page 417]]

new harvest quotas is announced under Sec. 662.509.
    (3) The non-reduction fishery in the PAFA ceases on the date that a 
total harvest quota closure is announced under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, and will not resume until a new harvest quota is announced 
under Sec. 660.509.


<R05>
Sec. 660.511  Fishing seasons.

    All open seasons will begin at 0001 hours and terminate at 2400 
hours local time. The PAFA is closed to anchovy fishing except as

2. There are no restrictions under this part on the harvest of black corals, except the data submission
  requirements (Sec.  660.3). State regulations on black coral harvesting are not superseded by this part.
3. Only \1/5\ of the indicated amount is allowed if nonselective gear is used; that is, the nonselective harvest
  will be multiplied by 5 and counted against the quota. If both selective and nonselective methods are used,
  the bed will be closed when S+5N=Q, where S=selective harvest amount, N=nonselective harvest amount and
  Q=total harvest quota, for any single species on that bed.
4. Only selective gear may be used in the EEZ seaward of the main Hawaiian Islands; i.e., south and east of a
  line midway between Nihoa and Niihau Islands. Nonselective gear or selective gear may be used in all other
  portions of exploratory areas.
5. S=Selective gear only; N=Nonselective or selective gear.
6. No authorized fishing for coral in refugia.

<R05>
Sec. 678.4  Permits and fees.

    (a) Applicability. (1) Annual vessel permit. (i) As a prerequisite 
to sell shark from the management unit or to be eligible for exemption 
from the bag limits specified in Sec. 678.23(b), an owner or operator of 
a vessel that fishes in the EEZ must obtain an annual vessel permit; 
except that there is no Federal requirement for a permit for a vessel 
that fishes exclusively within state waters.
    (ii) For a vessel owned by a corporation or partnership to be 
eligible for a vessel permit, the earned income qualification specified 
in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section must be met by, and the 
statement required by that paragraph must be submitted by, an officer or 
shareholder of the corporation, a general partner of the partnership, or 
the vessel operator.
    (iii) A vessel permit issued upon the qualification of an operator 
is valid only when that person is the operator of the vessel.
    (iv) An owner or operator who applies for a permit under paragraph 
(b) of this section must agree, as a condition of such permit, that the 
vessel's shark fishing, catch, and gear are subject to the requirements 
of this part during the period of validity of the permit, without regard 
to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ, landward of the EEZ, or 
outside the EEZ, and without regard to where such shark or gear are 
possessed, taken, or landed. However, when a vessel fishes in the waters 
of a state that has more restrictive regulations on shark fishing, those 
more restrictive regulations may be applied by that state to fishing, 
catch, and gear in its waters.

provide the employer identification number, if one has been assigned by 
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and, in lieu of the date of birth, 
provide the date the corporation/partnership was formed).
    (iv) If the owner does not meet the earned income qualification 
specified in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section and the operator does 
meet that qualification, the name, mailing address including ZIP code, 
telephone number, social security number, and date of birth of the 
operator.

fisheries vessel is used in, as requested by the Regional Director and 
included on the application form.
    (vi) A sworn statement by the applicant certifying that, during 1 of 
the 3 calendar years preceding the application,
    (A) More than 50 percent of his or her earned income was derived 
from commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch, or from charter or 
headboat operations; or
    (B) His or her gross sales of fish were more than $20,000; or

Copies of income tax forms and schedules are treated as confidential.
    (c) Application for an annual dealer permit. (1) An application for 
a dealer permit must be submitted and signed by the dealer or an officer 
of a corporation acting as a dealer. The application must be submitted 
to the Regional Director at least 30 days prior to the date on which the 
applicant desires to have the permit made effective.

time to an applicant if the application is complete and, in the case of 
the annual vessel permit specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
the applicant meets the earned income requirement specified in paragraph 
(b)(2)(vi) of this section. An application is complete when all 
requested forms, information, and documentation have been received and 
the applicant has submitted all applicable reports specified at 
Sec. 678.5 (a) or (b).
    (2) Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the Regional Director

correct the deficiency within 90 days of the date of the Regional 
Director's letter of notification, the application will be considered 
abandoned.
    (f) Duration. A permit remains valid for the period specified on it,

prohibited in the EEZ or aboard a vessel that has been issued a permit 
pursuant to Sec. 678.4.
    (2) Shark fins that are possessed aboard or off-loaded from a 
fishing vessel must be in proper proportion to the weight of carcasses. 
That is, the weight of fins may not exceed five percent of the weight of 
the carcasses. All fins must be weighed in conjunction with the weighing 
of the carcasses at the vessel's first point of landing and such weights 
of the fins landed must be recorded on the weighout slips submitted by 
the vessel owner or operator under Sec. 678.5(a).
    (3) Shark fins may not be possessed aboard a fishing vessel after 
the vessel's first point of landing.

vessel that has been issued a permit pursuant to Sec. 678.4 that is not 
retained--
    (1) Must be released in a manner that will ensure maximum 
probability of survival; and

[[Page 433]]

    (2) If caught by hook and line, must be released by cutting the line 
near the hook without removing the fish from the water.
    (c) Vessel trip limits. (1) A vessel that has been issued a permit 
pursuant to Sec. 678.4 may not possess on any trip, or land from any 
trip, large coastal species in excess of 4,000 lb (1,814 kg), dressed 
weight.
    (2) A shark from any of the three management units may not be 
transferred at sea from a vessel issued an Atlantic shark permit issued 
under Sec. 678.4 to any other vessel.
    (d) Filleting. (1) A shark from any of the three management units 
that is possessed in the EEZ, or harvested by a vessel that has been 
issued a permit pursuant to Sec. 678.4, may not be filleted at sea. 
Sharks may be eviscerated and the head and fins may be removed.

which the bag limits apply is responsible for the vessel trip limit 
applicable to large coastal species and pelagic species combined, and 
for the cumulative bag limit applicable to small coastal species based 
on the number of persons aboard.
    (e) Transfer of sharks. A person for whom a bag limit specified in 
this section applies may not transfer at sea a shark--
    (1) Taken in the EEZ, regardless of where such transfer takes place; 
or
    (2) In the EEZ, regardless of where such shark was taken.

the GOA by vessels of the United States (see subparts A, B, D, and E of 
this part).
    (2) The following State of Alaska regulations are not preempted by 
this part for vessels regulated under this part fishing for demersal 
shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District, and which are 
registered under the laws of the State of Alaska: 5 AAC 28.110, fishing 
seasons; 5 AAC 28.130, gear; 5 AAC 28.160, harvest guidelines; 5 AAC 
28.190, harvest of bait by commercial permit holders.
    (b) Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering 
Sea and Aleutian Islands Area. Regulations in this part govern 
commercial fishing for groundfish in the BSAI by vessels of the United 
States (see subparts A, B, C, D, and E of this part).
    (c) Moratorium on entry (applicable through December 31, 1998). 
Regulations in this part govern a moratorium on the entry of new vessels 
in the commercial fisheries for groundfish in the GOA and BSAI and in 
the commercial fisheries for king and Tanner crabs in the Bering Sea and 
Aleutian Islands Area (see subparts A and D of this part).

for the commercial fisheries that use fixed gear to harvest sablefish 
and halibut (see subparts A, B, D, and E of this part).
    (1) Sablefish. (i) Regulations in this part govern commercial 
fishing for sablefish by vessels of the United States:
    (A) Using fixed gear within that portion of the GOA and the BSAI 
over which the United States exercises exclusive fishery management 
authority; and
    (B) Using fixed gear in waters of the State of Alaska adjacent to 
the BSAI and the GOA, provided that such fishing is conducted by persons 
who have been issued permits under Sec. 679.4.
    (ii) Regulations in this part do not govern commercial fishing for 
sablefish in Prince William Sound or under a State of Alaska limited 
entry program.
    (2) Halibut. Regulations in this part govern commercial fishing for 
halibut by vessels of the United States using fixed gear, as that term 
is defined in 50 CFR 679.2, in and off of Alaska.
    (e) Western Alaska CDQ Program. The goals and purpose of the CDQ 
program are to allocate CDQ to eligible Western Alaska communities to 
provide the means for starting or supporting commercial fisheries 
business activities that will result in an ongoing, regionally based, 
fisheries-related economy.
    (f) Groundfish Observer Program (Applicable through December 31, 
1997). Regulations in this part govern elements of the Groundfish 
Observer Program for the BSAI groundfish and GOA groundfish fisheries 
under the Council's authority (see subpart E of this part).
    (g) Fishery Management Plan for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab 
Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area. Regulations in 
this part govern commercial fishing for king and

[[Page 437]]

Tanner crab in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area by vessels of 
the United States, including regulations superseding State of Alaska 
regulations applicable to the commercial king and Tanner crab fisheries 
in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area EEZ that are determined to 
be inconsistent with the FMP (see subparts A, B, and E of this part).
    (h) Fishery Management Plan for the Scallop Fishery off Alaska. (1) 
Regulations in this part govern commercial fishing for scallops in the 
Federal waters off Alaska by vessels of the United States (see subpart A

the owner of a vessel of the United States if he/she submits to the 
Regional Administrator a complete moratorium permit application that is 
subsequently approved and if the vessel's LOA does not exceed the 
maximum LOA as specified in Sec. 679.2. A complete application for a 
moratorium permit must include the following information for each 
vessel:
    (i) Name of the vessel, state registration number of the vessel and 
the USCG documentation number of the vessel, if any.
    (ii) Name(s), business address(es), and telephone and fax numbers of 
the owner of the vessel.
    (iii) Name of the managing company.
    (iv) Valid documentation of the vessel's moratorium qualification, 
if requested by the Regional Administrator due to an absence of landings 
records for the vessel from January 1, 1988, through February 9, 1992.
    (v) Reliable documentation of the vessel's original qualifying LOA, 
if requested by the Regional Administrator, such as a vessel survey, 
builder's plan, state or Federal registration certificate, fishing 
permit records, or other reliable and probative documents that clearly 
identify the vessel and its LOA, and that are dated before June 24, 
1992.
    (vi) Specification of the fishing gear(s) used from January 1, 1988, 
through February 9, 1992, and, if necessary, the fishing gear(s) used 
from February 10, 1992, through December 11, 1994.
    (vii) Specification of the vessel as either a catcher vessel or a 
catcher/processor vessel.
    (viii) If applicable, transfer authorization if a permit request is 
based on transfer of moratorium qualification pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (ix) Signature of the person who is the owner of the vessel or the 
person who is responsible for representing the vessel owner.
    (7) Moratorium qualification. A vessel has moratorium qualification 
if:
    (i) The vessel is an original qualifying vessel;
    (ii) The vessel is not a moratorium exempt vessel under paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section;
    (iii) The vessel's moratorium qualification has not been 
transferred;
    (iv) The vessel receives a valid moratorium qualification through a 
transfer approved by the Regional Administrator under pargraph (c)(9) of 
this section; and
    (v) That moratorium qualification is not subsequently transferred.
    (8) Application for moratorium qualification transfer--(i) General. 
An application for approval of a transfer of moratorium qualification 
(see paragraph (c)(9) of this section) must be completed and the 
transfer approved by the Regional Administrator before an application 
for a moratorium permit based on that transfer can be approved. An 
application for approval of a transfer and an application for a 
moratorium permit may be submitted simultaneously.

[[Page 457]]

    (ii) Contents of application. A complete application for approval of 
transfer must include the following information, as applicable, for each 
vessel involved in the transfer of moratorium qualification:
    (A) Name(s), business address(es), and telephone and fax numbers of 
the applicant(s) (including the owners of the moratorium qualification 
that is to be or was transferred and the person who is to receive or 
received the transferred moratorium qualification).
    (B) Name of the vessel whose moratorium qualification is to be or 
was transferred and the name of the vessel that would receive or 
received the transferred moratorium qualification (if any), the state 
registration number of each vessel and, if documented, the USCG 
documentation number of each vessel.
    (C) The original qualifying LOA of the vessel whose moratorium 
qualification is to be or was transferred, its current LOA, and its 
maximum LOA.
    (D) The LOA of the vessel that would receive or received the 
transferred moratorium qualification and documentation of that LOA by a 
current vessel survey or other reliable and probative document.
    (E) Signatures of the persons from whom moratorium qualification 
would be transferred or their representative, and the persons who would 
receive the transferred moratorium qualification or their 
representative.
    (iii) Contract or agreement. A legible copy of a contract or 
agreement must be included with the application for transfer that 
specifies the vessel or person from which moratorium qualification is to 
be or is transferred, the date of the transfer agreement, names and 
signatures of all current owner(s) of the vessel whose moratorium 
qualification is to be or was transferred, and names and signatures of 
all current owner(s) of the moratorium qualification that is to be or 
was transferred.
    (iv) Vessel reconstruction. The following information must be 
included with the application for transfer:
    (A) A legible copy of written contracts or written agreements with 
the firm that performed reconstruction of the vessel and that relate to 
that reconstruction.
    (B) An affidavit signed by the vessel owner(s) and the owner/manager 
of the firm that performed the vessel reconstruction, specifying the 
beginning and ending dates of the reconstruction.
    (C) An affidavit signed by the vessel owner(s) specifying the LOA of 
the reconstructed vessel.
    (v) Vessels lost or destroyed. A copy of USCG Form 2692, Report of 
Marine Casualty, must be included with the application for transfer.
    (9) Transfer of moratorium qualification (applicable through 
December 31, 1998)--(i) General. A transfer of a vessel's moratorium 
qualification must be approved by the Regional Administrator before a 
moratorium permit may be issued under this section for the vessel to 
which the qualification is transferred. A moratorium permit is not 
transferrable or assignable. A fishery-specific gear type endorsement(s) 
is not severable from an endorsed permit. A transfer of moratorium 
qualification will not be approved by the Regional Administrator unless:
    (A) A complete transfer application that satisfies all requirements 
specified in paragraph (c)(8) of this section is submitted;
    (B) The LOA of the vessel to which the moratorium qualification is 
transferred does not exceed the maximum LOA of the original qualifying 
vessel; and
    (C) The moratorium permit associated with the moratorium 
qualification is not revoked or suspended.
    (ii) Vessels lost or destroyed in 1988. The moratorium qualification 
of a vessel that was lost or destroyed before January 1, 1989, may not 
be transferred to another vessel and is not valid for purposes of 
issuing a moratorium permit for that vessel, if salvaged, unless salvage 
began on or before June 24, 1992, and the LOA of the salvaged vessel 
does not exceed its maximum LOA. The moratorium qualification of such a 
vessel is not valid for purposes of issuing a moratorium permit for 1998 
unless that vessel is used to make a legal landing of a moratorium 
species from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 1997.
    (iii) Vessels lost or destroyed from 1989 through 1995. The 
moratorium qualification of any vessel that was lost or

[[Page 458]]

destroyed on or after January 1, 1989, but before January 1, 1996, is 
valid for purposes of issuing a moratorium permit for that vessel, if 
salvaged, regardless of when salvage began, provided that the vessel has 
not already been replaced and the LOA of the salvaged vessel does not 
exceed its maximum LOA. The moratorium qualification of any vessel that 
was lost or destroyed on or after January 1, 1989, but before January 1, 
1996, may be transferred to another vessel, provided the LOA of that 
vessel does not exceed the maximum LOA of the original qualifying 
vessel. The moratorium qualification of such a vessel is not valid for 
purposes of issuing a moratorium permit for 1998, unless that vessel is 
used to make a legal landing of a moratorium species from January 1, 
1996, through December 31, 1997.
    (iv) Vessels lost or destroyed after 1995. The moratorium 
qualification of any vessel that was lost or destroyed on or after 
January 1, 1996, is valid for purposes of issuing a moratorium permit 
for that vessel, if salvaged, regardless of when salvage began, provided 
that the vessel has not already been replaced and the LOA of the 
salvaged vessel does not exceed its maximum LOA. The moratorium 
qualification of any vessel that is lost or destroyed on or after 
January 1, 1996, may be transferred to another vessel, providing the LOA 
of that vessel does not exceed the maximum LOA of the original 
qualifying vessel.
    (v) Reconstruction. The moratorium qualification of a vessel is not 
valid for purposes of issuing a moratorium permit if, after June 23, 
1992, reconstruction is initiated that results in increasing the LOA of 
the vessel to exceed the maximum LOA of the original qualifying vessel. 
For a vessel whose reconstruction began before June 24, 1992, and was 
completed after June 24, 1992, the maximum LOA is the LOA on the date 
reconstruction was completed, provided the owner files an application 
for transfer and the Regional Administrator certifies that maximum LOA 
and approves the transfer based on information concerning the LOA of the 
reconstructed vessel submitted under paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this 
section.
    (10) Appeal--(i) Determination. The Chief, RAM Division, will issue 
an initial administrative determination to each applicant who is denied 
a moratorium permit by that official. An initial administrative 
determination may be appealed by the applicant in accordance with 
Sec. 679.43. The initial administrative determination will be the final 
agency action if a written appeal is not received by the Regional 
Administrator, within the period specified at Sec. 679.43.
    (ii) Permit denial. An initial administrative determination that 
denies an application for a moratorium permit must authorize the 
affected vessel to catch and retain moratorium crab or moratorium 
groundfish species with the type of fishing gear specified on the 
application. The authorization expires on the effective date of the 
final agency action relating to the application.
    (iii) Final action. An administrative determination denying approval 
of the transfer of a moratorium qualification and/or denying the 
issuance of a moratorium permit based on that moratorium qualification 
is the final agency action for purposes of judicial review.
    (d) IFQ--(1) General. In addition to the permit and licensing 
requirements prescribed in the annual management measures published in 
the Federal Register pursuant to Sec. 300.62 of chapter III of this 
title and in the permit requirements of this section, all fishing 
vessels that harvest IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish must have on board:
    (i) IFQ permit. A copy of an IFQ permit that specifies the IFQ 
regulatory area and vessel category in which IFQ halibut or IFQ 
sablefish may be harvested by the IFQ permit holder and a copy of the 
most recent accompanying statement specifying the amount of each species 
that may be harvested during the current IFQ fishing season; and
    (ii) IFQ card. An original IFQ card issued by the Regional 
Administrator.
    (2) Registered buyer permit. Any person who receives IFQ halibut or 
IFQ sablefish from the person(s) that harvested the fish must possess a 
registered buyer permit, except under conditions of paragraph (d)(2) 
(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. A registered buyer permit

[[Page 459]]

also is required of any person who harvests IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish 
and transfers such fish:
    (i) In a dockside sale;
    (ii) Outside of an IFQ regulatory area; or
    (iii) Outside the State of Alaska.
    (3) Permit issuance--(i) IFQ permits and cards--(A) Issuance. IFQ 
permits and cards will be renewed or issued annually by the Regional 
Administrator to each person with approved QS for IFQ halibut or IFQ 
sablefish allocated in accordance with this section.
    (B) IFQ permit. Each IFQ permit issued by the Regional Administrator 
will identify the permitted person and will be accompanied by a 
statement that specifies the amount of IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish that 
person may harvest from a specified IFQ regulatory area using fixed gear 
and a vessel of a specified vessel category.
    (C) IFQ card. Each IFQ card issued by the Regional Administrator 
will display an IFQ permit number and the individual authorized by the 
IFQ permit holder to land IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish for debit against 
the permit holder's IFQ.
    (ii) Registered buyer permits. Registered buyer permits will be 
renewed or issued annually by the Regional Administrator to persons that 
have a registered buyer application approved by the Regional 
Administrator.
    (4) Duration--(i) IFQ permit. An IFQ permit authorizes the person 
identified on the permit to harvest IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish from a 
specified IFQ regulatory area at any time during an open fishing season 
during the fishing year for which the IFQ permit is issued until the 
amount harvested is equal to the amount specified under the permit, or 
until it is revoked, suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part 904.
    (ii) IFQ card. An IFQ card authorizes the individual identified on 
the card to land IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish for debit against the 
specified IFQ permit until the card expires, or is revoked, suspended, 
or modified under 15 CFR part 904, or cancelled on request of the IFQ 
permit holder.
    (iii) Registered buyer permit. A registered buyer permit authorizes 
the person identified on the permit to receive or make an IFQ landing by 
an IFQ permit or card holder at any time during the fishing year for 
which it is issued until the registered buyer permit expires, or is 
revoked, suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part 904.
    (5) Transfer. The IFQ permits issued under this section are not 
transferable, except as provided under Sec. 679.41. IFQ cards and 
registered buyer permits issued under this paragraph (d) are not 
transferable.
    (6) Inspection--(i) IFQ permit. A legible copy of any IFQ permit 
issued under this section must be carried on board the vessel used by 
the permitted person to harvest IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish at all 
times that such fish are retained on board.
    (ii) IFQ card. Except as specified in Sec. 679.42(d), an individual 
that is issued an IFQ card must remain aboard the vessel used to harvest 
IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish with that card during all fishing 
operations until arrival at the point of landing and during all IFQ 
landings. The IFQ cardholder must present a copy of the IFQ permit and 
the original IFQ card for inspection on request of any authorized 
officer, clearing officer, or registered buyer purchasing IFQ species. 
Nothing in this paragraph would prevent an individual who is issued an 
IFQ card from being absent from the vessel used to harvest IFQ halibut 
or IFQ sablefish between the time the vessel arrives at the point of 
landing until the commencement of landing.
    (iii) Registered buyer permit. A legible copy of the registered 
buyer permit must be present at the location of an IFQ landing, and must 
be made available for inspection on request of any authorized officer or 
clearing officer.
    (e) Halibut/sablefish CDQ permits and CDQ cards. See Sec. 679.33(a) 
and (b).
    (f) Federal processor permit--(1) Requirement. No shoreside 
processor of the United States or vessel of the United States operating 
solely as a mothership in Alaska State waters may receive or process 
groundfish harvested in the GOA or BSAI, unless the owner first obtains 
a Federal processor permit issued under this part. A Federal processor 
permit is issued without charge.

[[Page 460]]

    (2) Application. A complete application for a Federal processor 
permit must include the following:
    (i) If the application is for an amended permit, the current Federal

    (3) Issuance. (i) Upon receipt of a properly completed permit 
application, the Regional Administrator will issue a Federal processor 
permit required by this paragraph (f).
    (ii) The Regional Administrator will send the Federal processor 
permit to the applicant with the shoreside processor logbook, as 
provided under Sec. 679.5.
    (4) Duration. (i) A Federal processor permit is issued for a 3-year 
period and remains in full force and effect from the date of issuance 
through the end of the current NMFS 3-year renewal cycle, unless it is 
revoked, suspended, or modified under Sec. 600.735 or Sec. 600.740 of 
this chapter.
    (ii) A Federal processor permit is surrendered when the original 
permit is submitted to and received by the Chief, RAM Division, NMFS.

    (g) Scallop moratorium permits (applicable through June 30, 2000)--
(1) General--(i) Applicability. Except as provided under paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section, any vessel used to take or retain any scallop 
species in Federal waters must have a valid scallop moratorium permit on 
board the vessel at all times when the vessel is engaged in fishing for 
scallops in Federal waters or has scallops taken from Federal waters 
retained on board. Any vessel used to take or retain scallops in Federal 
waters within Scallop Registration Area H must have a scallop moratorium 
permit endorsed for Registration Area H. Any vessel used to take or 
retain scallop species in Federal waters outside Registration Area H 
must have a scallop moratorium permit endorsed for Federal waters 
exclusive of Registration Area H.
    (ii) Applicable dates and duration. The requirement to carry a 
moratorium permit is applicable from July 1, 1997, through June 30, 
2000. A scallop moratorium permit is valid for the duration of the 
moratorium unless otherwise specified.
    (iii) Validity. A scallop moratorium permit issued under this 
paragraph is valid only if:
    (A) A person named on the moratorium permit is the owner or operator 
of the vessel on which the permit is used.
    (B) The vessel's LOA does not exceed the maximum LOA specified on 
the permit.
    (C) The permit has not been revoked or suspended under 15 CFR part 
904.

ft (7.9 m) in the GOA, and less than or equal to 32 ft (9.8 m) in the 
BSAI and that does not have dredge gear on board is exempt from the 
requirements of this paragraph (g) when fishing for scallops with dive 
gear.
    (3) Qualification criteria--(i) Qualifying period. To qualify for a 
moratorium permit, a vessel must have made a legal landing of scallops 
during 1991, 1992, or 1993, or during at least 4 separate years from 
1980 through 1990.

[[Page 461]]

    (ii) Area endorsements. A scallop moratorium permit may contain an 
area endorsement for Federal waters within Registration Area H, for 
Federal waters outside Registration Area H, or for both areas.
    (A) Registration Area H. A scallop moratorium permit may be endorsed 
for fishing in Federal waters within Registration Area H if a qualifying 
vessel made a legal landing of scallops taken inside Registration Area H 
during the qualifying period defined at paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this 
section.
    (B) Waters outside Registration Area H. A scallop moratorium permit 
may be endorsed for fishing in Federal waters outside Registration Area 
H if the qualifying vessel made a legal landing of scallops taken in 
waters outside Registration Area H during the qualifying period defined 
at paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Legal landings. Evidence of legal landings shall be limited to 
documentation of State or Federal catch reports that indicate the amount 
of scallops harvested, the registration area or location in which they 
were caught, the vessel used to catch them, and the date of harvesting, 
landing, or reporting.
    (4) Maximum LOA--(i) All scallop moratorium permits will specify a 
maximum LOA, which will be 1.2 times the LOA of the qualifying vessel on 
January 20, 1993, unless the qualifying vessel was under reconstruction 
on January 20, 1993.
    (ii) If a qualifying vessel was under reconstruction on January 20, 
1993, the maximum LOA will be the LOA on the date reconstruction was 
completed.
    (5) Application for permit. A scallop moratorium permit will be 
issued to the person or successor in interest who was the owner of a 
qualifying vessel when it most recently made qualifying landings under 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section, if he/she submits to the Regional 
Administrator a complete scallop moratorium permit application that is 
subsequently approved. A complete application for a scallop moratorium 
permit must include the following information:
    (i) Name(s), signature(s), business address(es), and telephone and 
fax numbers of the person(s) who owned the vessel when the most recent 
qualifying landing of scallops occurred.
    (ii) Name of the qualifying vessel, state registration number of the 
vessel and the USCG number of the vessel, if any.
    (iii) Valid documentation of the vessel's basis for moratorium 
qualification, if requested by the Regional Administrator due to an 
absence of landings records for the vessel for the qualifying period.
    (iv) Reliable documentation of the vessel's qualifying LOA, if 
requested by the Regional Administrator, such as a vessel survey, 
builder's plan, state or Federal registration certificate, or other 
reliable and probative documents that clearly identify the vessel and 
its LOA and that are dated on or before January 20, 1993.
    (v) Name(s) and signature(s) of the person(s) who is/are the 
owner(s) of the vessel or the person(s) responsible for representing the 
vessel owner.
    (vi) If the qualifying vessel was under reconstruction on January 
20, 1993, the permit application must contain the following additional 
information:
    (A) A legible copy of written contracts or written agreements with 
the firm that performed reconstruction of the vessel and that relate to 
that reconstruction.
    (B) An affidavit signed by the vessel owner(s) and the owner/manager 
of the firm that performed the reconstruction specifying the beginning

    (i) For vessels required to be documented under the laws of the 
United States, the USCG abstract of title issued in respect to that 
vessel.
    (ii) A certificate of registration that is determinative as to 
vessel ownership.
    (iii) A bill of sale.
    (7) Permit transfer--(i) Applicability. A moratorium permit transfer 
is required to effect any change in permit ownership including the 
addition or subtraction of partners. Area endorsements

[[Page 462]]

may not be transferred independently of a moratorium permit.
    (ii) Required information. A complete application for approval of 
transfer of a scallop moratorium permit must include the following:
    (A) The original moratorium permit to be transferred.
    (B) Name(s), business address(es), and telephone and fax numbers of 
the applicant(s) including the holders of the scallop moratorium permit

moratorium permit in question must be included with the application for 
transfer that specifies the person(s) from whom the scallop moratorium 
permit is to be transferred, the date of the transfer agreement, name(s) 
and signature(s) of the current holder(s) of the permit, and name(s) and 
signature(s) of person(s) to whom the scallop moratorium permit is to be 
transferred.
    (8) Appeal--(i) Determination. The Chief, RAM Division, will issue 
an initial administrative determination to an applicant upon denial of a 
scallop moratorium permit by that official. An initial administrative 
determination may be appealed by the applicant in accordance with 
Sec. 679.43. The initial administrative determination will be the final 
agency action if a written appeal is not received by the Regional 
Administrator postmarked within the period specified at Sec. 679.43.
    (ii) Permit denial. An initial administrative determination that 
denies an application for a scallop moratorium permit may authorize the 
affected person to take or retain scallops. Any administrative 
determination that authorizes fishing will expire on the effective date 
of the final agency action relating to the application.
    (iii) Final action. An administrative determination denying the 
issuance of a scallop moratorium permit is the final agency action for 
purposes of judicial review.
    (9) Harvesting privilege. Scallop moratorium permits issued pursuant 
to this part do not represent an interest that is subject to the 
``takings'' provision of the 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
Rather, such permits represent only a harvesting privilege that may be 
revoked or amended subject to the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act and other applicable laws.
    (h) High Seas Salmon permits--(1) Operators of commercial fishing 
vessels using power troll gear. The operator of a fishing vessel using 
power troll gear may engage in commercial fishing for salmon in the High 
Seas Salmon Management Area if the operator:
    (i) Held a valid State of Alaska power troll permanent entry permit 
on May 15, 1979, or is a transferee under paragraph (h)(13) of this 
section from an operator who held such a permit on that date;
    (ii) Held a valid State of Alaska power troll interim use permit on 
May 15, 1979; or
    (iii) Holds a High Seas Salmon Fishery permit issued by the Regional 
Administrator under paragraph (h)(7) of this section.
    (2) Crew members and other persons not the operator of a commercial 
fishing vessel using power trawl gear. Crew members or other persons 
aboard but not the operator of a fishing vessel may assist in the 
vessel's commercial salmon fishing operations in the High Seas 
Management Area without a permit if a person described in paragraph 
(h)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section is also aboard the vessel and is 
engaged in the vessel's commercial fishing operations.
    (3) Personal use fishing. Any person who holds a valid State of 
Alaska sport fishing license may engage in personal use fishing in the 
High Seas Salmon Management Area.
    (4) Duration. Authorization under this paragraph (h) to engage in 
fishing for salmon in the High Seas Salmon Management Area constitutes a 
use privilege which may be revoked or modified without compensation.
    (5) Eligibility criteria for permits issued by the Regional 
Administrator. (i) Any person is eligible to be issued a High Seas 
Salmon Fishery permit under

[[Page 463]]

paragraph (h)(7) of this section if that person, during any one of the 
calendar years 1975, 1976, or 1977:
    (A) Operated a fishing vessel in the High Seas Salmon Management 
Area.
    (B) Engaged in commercial fishing for salmon in the High Seas Salmon 
Management Area.
    (C) Caught salmon in the High Seas Salmon Management Area using

    (A) Persons described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (B) Persons who once held but no longer hold a State of Alaska power 
troll permanent entry or interim-use permit.
    (6) Application. Applications for a High Seas Salmon Fishery permit 
must be in writing, signed by the applicant, and submitted to the 
Regional Administrator, at least 30 days prior to the date the person 
wishes to commence fishing, and must include:
    (i) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.
    (ii) The vessel's name, USCG documentation number or State of Alaska 
registration number, home port, length overall, registered tonnage, and 
color of the fishing vessel.
    (iii) The type of fishing gear used by the fishing vessel.
    (iv) State of Alaska fish tickets or other equivalent documents 
showing the actual landing of salmon taken in the High Seas Salmon 
Management Area by the applicant with power troll gear during any one of 
the years 1975 to 1977.
    (7) Issuance. (i) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 
904, upon receipt of a properly completed application, the Regional 
Administrator will determine whether the permit eligibility conditions 
have been met, and if so, will issue a High Seas Salmon Fishery permit.
    (ii) If the permit is denied, the Regional Administrator will notify 
the applicant in accordance with paragraph (h)(16) of this section.
    (iii) If an incomplete or improperly completed permit application is 
filed, the Regional Administrator will notify the applicant of the 
deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30

Sec. 679.6  Experimental fisheries.

    (a) General. For limited experimental purposes, the Regional 
Administrator may authorize, after consulting with the Council, fishing 
for groundfish in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited. No 
experimental fishing may be conducted unless authorized by an 
experimental fishing permit issued by the Regional Administrator to the 
participating vessel owner in accordance with the criteria and 
procedures specified in this section. Experimental fishing permits will 
be issued without charge and will expire at the end of a calendar year 
unless otherwise provided for under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) Application. An applicant for an experimental fishing permit 
shall submit to the Regional Administrator, at least 60 days before the 
desired effective date of the experimental fishing permit, a written 
application including, but not limited to, the following information:
    (1) The date of the application.
    (2) The applicant's name, mailing address, and telephone number.

[[Page 493]]

    (3) A statement of the purpose and goal of the experiment for which 
an experimental fishing permit is needed, including a general 
description of the arrangements for disposition of all species harvested 
under the experimental fishing permit.
    (4) Technical details about the experiment, including:
    (i) Amounts of each species to be harvested that are necessary to 
conduct the experiment, and arrangement for disposition of all species 
taken.
    (ii) Area and timing of the experiment.
    (iii) Vessel and gear to be used.
    (iv) Experimental design (e.g., sampling procedures, the data and 
samples to be collected, and analysis of the data and samples).
    (v) Provision for public release of all obtained information, and 
submission of interim and final reports.
    (5) The willingness of the applicant to carry observers, if required 
by the Regional Administrator, and a description of accommodations and 
work space for the observer(s).
    (6) Details for all coordinating parties engaged in the experiment 
and signatures of all representatives of all principal parties.
    (7) Information about each vessel to be covered by the experimental 
fishing permit, including:
    (i) Vessel name.
    (ii) Name, address, and telephone number of owner and master.
    (iii) USCG documentation, state license, or registration number.
    (iv) Home port.
    (v) Length of vessel.
    (vi) Net tonnage.
    (vii) Gross tonnage.
    (8) The signature of the applicant.
    (9) The Regional Administrator may request from an applicant 
additional information necessary to make the determinations required 
under this section. Any application that does not include all necessary 
information will be considered incomplete. An incomplete application 
will not be considered to be complete until the necessary information is 
provided in writing. An applicant for an experimental fishing permit 
need not be the owner or operator of the vessel(s) for which the 
experimental fishing permit is requested.
    (c) Review procedures. (1) The Regional Administrator, in 
consultation with the Alaska Fishery Science Center, will review each 
application and will make a preliminary determination whether the 
application contains all the information necessary to determine if the 
proposal constitutes a valid fishing experiment appropriate for further 
consideration. If the Regional Administrator finds any application does 
not warrant further consideration, the applicant will be notified in 
writing of the reasons for the decision.
    (2) If the Regional Administrator determines any application is 
complete and warrants further consideration, he or she will initiate 
consultation with the Council by forwarding the application to the 
Council. The Council's Executive Director shall notify the applicant of 
a meeting at which the Council will consider the application and invite 
the applicant to appear in support of the application, if the applicant 
desires. If the Regional Administrator initiates consultation with the 
Council, NMFS will publish notification of receipt of the application in 
the Federal Register with a brief description of the proposal.
    (d) Notifying the applicant. (1) The decision of the Regional 
Administrator, after consulting with the Council, to grant or deny an 
experimental fishing permit is the final action of the agency. The 
Regional Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the 
decision to grant or deny the experimental fishing permit and, if 
denied, the reasons for the denial, including:
    (i) The applicant has failed to disclose material information 
required, or has made false statements as to any material fact, in 
connection with the application.
    (ii) According to the best scientific information available, the 
harvest to be conducted under the permit would detrimentally affect 
living marine resources, including marine mammals and birds, and their 
habitat in a significant way.
    (iii) Activities to be conducted under the experimental fishing 
permit would be inconsistent with the intent of this section or the 
management objectives of the FMP.

[[Page 494]]

    (iv) The applicant has failed to demonstrate a valid justification 
for the permit.
    (v) The activity proposed under the experimental fishing permit 
could create a significant enforcement problem.
    (vi) The applicant failed to make available to the public 
information that had been obtained under a previously issued 
experimental fishing permit.
    (vii) The proposed activity had economic allocation as its sole 
purpose.
    (2) In the event a permit is denied on the basis of incomplete 
information or design flaws, the applicant will be provided an 
opportunity to resubmit the application, unless a permit is denied 
because experimental fishing would detrimentally affect marine 
resources, be inconsistent with the management objectives of the FMP, 
create significant enforcement problems, or have economic allocation as 
its sole purpose.
    (e) Terms and conditions. The Regional Administrator may attach 
terms and conditions to the experimental fishing permit that are 
consistent with the purpose of the experiment, including, but not 
limited to:
    (1) The maximum amount of each species that can be harvested and 
landed during the term of the experimental fishing permit, including 
trip limitations, where appropriate.
    (2) The number, sizes, names, and identification numbers of the 
vessels authorized to conduct fishing activities under the experimental 
fishing permit.
    (3) The time(s) and place(s) where experimental fishing may be 
conducted.
    (4) The type, size, and amount of gear that may be used by each 
vessel operated under the experimental fishing permit.
    (5) The condition that observers be carried aboard vessels operated 
under an experimental fishing permit.
    (6) Reasonable data reporting requirements.
    (7) Such other conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance 
with the purposes of the experimental fishing permit and consistency 
with the FMP objectives.
    (8) Provisions for public release of data obtained under the 
experimental fishing permit.
    (f) Effectiveness. Unless otherwise specified in the experimental 
fishing permit or superseding notification or regulation, an 
experimental fishing permit is effective for no longer than 1 calendar 
year, but may be revoked, suspended, or modified during the calendar 
year. Experimental fishing permits may be renewed following the 
application procedures in paragraph (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 679.20  General limitations.

    This section applies to vessels engaged in directed fishing for 
groundfish in the GOA and BSAI.
    (a) Harvest limits--(1) OY. The OY for BSAI and GOA target species 
and the ``other species'' category is a range that can be harvested 
consistently with this part, plus the amounts of ``nonspecified 
species'' taken incidentally to the harvest of target species and the 
``other species'' category. The species categories are defined in Table 
1 of the specifications as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) BSAI. The OY for groundfish in the BSAI regulated by this 
section and by part 600 of this chapter is 1.4 to 2.0 million mt.
    (ii) GOA. The OY for groundfish in the GOA regulated by this section 
and by part 600 of this chapter is 116,000 to 800,000 mt.
    (2) TAC. NMFS, after consultation with the Council, will specify and 
apportion the annual TAC and reserves for each calendar year among the 
GOA and BSAI target species and the ``other species'' categories. TACs 
in the target species category may be split or combined for purposes of 
establishing new TACs with apportionments thereof under paragraph (c) of 
this section. The sum of the TACs so specified must be within the OY 
range specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) Annual TAC determination. The annual determinations of TAC for 
each target species and the ``other species'' category, and the 
reapportionment of reserves may be adjusted, based upon a review of the 
following:
    (i) Biological condition of groundfish stocks. Resource assessment 
documents prepared annually for the Council that provide information on 
historical catch trend; updated estimates of the MSY of the groundfish 
complex and its component species groups; assessments of the stock 
condition of each target species and the ``other species'' category; 
assessments of the multispecies and ecosystem impacts of harvesting the 
groundfish complex at current levels, given the assessed condition of 
stocks, including consideration of rebuilding

[[Page 500]]

depressed stocks; and alternative harvesting strategies and related 
effects on the component species group.
    (ii) Socioeconomic considerations. Socioeconomic considerations that 
are consistent with the goals of the fishery management plans for the 
groundfish fisheries of the BSAI and the GOA, including the need to 
promote efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources, including 
minimizing costs; the need to manage for the optimum marketable size of 
a species; the impact of groundfish harvests on prohibited species and 
the domestic target fisheries that utilize these species; the desire to 
enhance depleted stocks; the seasonal access to the groundfish fishery 
by domestic fishing vessels; the commercial importance of a fishery to 
local communities; the importance of a fishery to subsistence users; and 
the need to promote utilization of certain species.
    (4) Sablefish TAC--(i) GOA Eastern Area. Vessels in the Eastern Area 
of the GOA using trawl gear will be allocated 5 percent of the sablefish 
TAC for bycatch in other trawl fisheries.
    (ii) GOA Central and Western Areas--(A) Hook-and-line gear. Vessels 
in the Central and Western Areas of the GOA using hook-and-line gear 
will be allocated 80 percent of the sablefish TAC in each of the Central 
and Western areas.
    (B) Trawl gear. Vessels using trawl gear will be allocated 20 
percent of the sablefish TAC in these areas.
    (iii) Bering Sea subarea--(A) Hook-and-line or pot gear. Vessels in 
the Bering Sea subarea using hook-and-line or pot gear will be allocated 
50 percent of each TAC for sablefish.
    (B) Trawl gear. Vessels in the Bering Sea subarea using trawl gear 
will be allocated 50 percent of each TAC for sablefish.
    (iv) Aleutian Islands subarea--(A) Hook-and-line or pot gear. 
Vessels in the Aleutian Islands subarea using hook-and-line or pot gear 
will be allocated 75 percent of each TAC for sablefish.
    (B) Trawl gear. Vessels in the Aleutian Islands subarea using trawl 
gear will be allocated 25 percent of each TAC for sablefish.
    (5) Pollock TAC--(i) BSAI--(A) Seasonal allowances. The TAC of 
pollock in each subarea or district of the BSAI will be divided, after 
subtraction of reserves, into two allowances. The first allowance will 
be available for directed fishing from 0001 hours Alaska local time 
(A.l.t.) January 1 through 1200 hours, A.l.t. , April 15. The second 
allowance will be available for directed fishing from 1200 hours, 
A.l.t., September 1 through 1200 hours A.l.t., November 1, of each 
fishing year. Within any fishing year, unharvested amounts of the first 
allowance will be added to the second allowance, and harvests in excess 
of the first allowance will be deducted from the second allowance.
    (B) Apportionment to vessels using nonpelagic trawl gear-- (1) 
General. NMFS, in consultation with the Council, may limit the amount of 
pollock TAC that may be taken in the directed fishery for pollock using 
nonpelagic trawl gear.
    (2) Factors to be considered. The Regional Administrator must 
consider the following information when limiting the amount of pollock 
TAC that is apportioned to the directed fishery for pollock using 
nonpelagic trawl gear:
    (i) The PSC limits and PSC bycatch allowances established under 
Sec. 679.21.
    (ii) The projected bycatch of prohibited species that would occur 
with and without a limit in the amount of pollock TAC that may be taken 
in the directed fishery for pollock using nonpelagic trawl gear.
    (iii) The cost of a limit in terms of amounts of pollock TAC that 
may be taken with nonpelagic trawl gear on the nonpelagic and pelagic 
trawl fisheries.
    (iv) Other factors pertaining to consistency with the goals and 
objectives of the FMP.
    (3) Notification. NMFS will publish proposed and final apportionment 
of pollock TAC to the directed fishery for pollock using nonpelagic 
trawl gear in the Federal Register with notification of proposed and 
final specifications defined in Sec. 679.20.
    (ii) GOA--(A) Apportionment by area. The TAC for pollock in the 
combined GOA Western and Central Regulatory Areas will be apportioned 
among statistical areas 610, 620, and 630 in proportion to the 
distribution of the pollock biomass as determined by the most recent 
NMFS surveys.

[[Page 501]]

    (B) Seasonal allowances. Each apportionment will be divided into 
three seasonal allowances of 25 percent, 35 percent, and 40 percent of 
the apportionment, respectively, corresponding to the three fishing 
seasons defined at Sec. 679.23(d)(2).
    (6) Inshore/offshore apportionments (Applicable through December 31, 
1998)--(i) BSAI pollock. The apportionment of pollock in each BSAI 
subarea or district, and for each seasonal allowance defined in 
paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, will be allocated 35 percent to 
vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 65 
percent to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore 
component.
    (ii) GOA pollock. The apportionment of pollock in all GOA regulatory 
areas and for each seasonal allowance described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) 
of this section will be allocated entirely to vessels catching pollock 
for processing by the inshore component after subtraction of an amount 
that is projected by the Regional Administrator to be caught by, or 
delivered to, the offshore component incidental to directed fishing for 
other groundfish species.
    (iii) GOA Pacific cod. The apportionment of Pacific cod in all GOA 
regulatory areas will be allocated 90 percent to vessels catching 
Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component and 10 percent to 
vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the offshore component.
    (iv) Directed fishing allowances and prohibitions. The Regional 
Administrator may establish separate directed fishing allowances and 
prohibitions authorized under paragraph (d) of this section for:
    (A) BSAI pollock. Vessels catching pollock in the BSAI for 
processing by the inshore component and for vessels catching pollock for 
processing by the offshore component.
    (B) GOA pollock. Vessels catching pollock in the GOA for processing 
by the inshore component and for vessels catching pollock for processing 
by the offshore component.
    (C) GOA Pacific cod. Vessels catching Pacific cod in the GOA for 
processing by the inshore component and for vessels catching Pacific cod 
for processing by the offshore component.
    (v) Reallocation--(A) BSAI pollock. If, during a fishing year, the 
Regional Administrator determines that either the inshore or offshore 
component will not be able to process the entire amount of pollock in 
the BSAI allocated to vessels catching pollock for processing by that 
component, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register that 
reallocates the projected unused amount of pollock to vessels catching 
pollock for processing by the other component.
    (B) GOA pollock. If the Regional Administrator determines that the 
inshore component will not be able to process the entire amount of 
pollock in the GOA allocated to vessels catching pollock for processing 
by the inshore component during a fishing year, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register that reallocates the projected 
unused amount of pollock to vessels catching pollock for processing by 
the offshore component.
    (C) GOA Pacific cod. If, during a fishing year, the Regional 
Administrator determines that either the inshore or offshore component 
will not be able to process the entire amount of Pacific cod in the GOA 
allocated to vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by that 
component, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register that 
reallocates the projected unused amount of Pacific cod to vessels 
catching Pacific cod for processing by the other component.
    (7) Pacific cod TAC, BSAI--(i) TAC by gear. (A) The BSAI TAC of 
Pacific cod, after subtraction of reserves, will be allocated 2 percent 
to vessels using jig gear, 51 percent to vessels using hook-and-line or 
pot gear, and 47 percent to vessels using trawl gear.
    (B) The portion of Pacific cod TAC allocated to trawl gear under 
paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this section will be further allocated 50 
percent to catcher vessels and 50 percent to catcher/processors as 
defined for the purposes of recordkeeping and reporting at Sec. 679.2.
    (C) The Regional Administrator may establish separate directed 
fishing allowances and prohibitions authorized under paragraph (d) of 
this section for vessels harvesting Pacific cod using jig gear, hook-
and-line or pot gear, or trawl gear.

[[Page 502]]

    (ii) Unused gear allocations--(A) Reallocation within the trawl 
sector. If, during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines 
that either trawl catcher vessels or trawl catcher/processors will not 
be able to harvest the entire amount of Pacific cod in the BSAI 
allocated to those vessels under paragraph (a)(7)(i) or (a)(7)(ii)(B) of 
this section, NMFS will first make the projected unused amount of 
Pacific cod available to the other trawl vessel sector before any 
reallocation to vessels using other gear types.
    (B) Reallocation between gear types. If, during a fishing year, the 
Regional Administrator determines that vessels using trawl gear or hook-
and-line or pot gear will not be able to harvest the entire amount of 
Pacific cod in the BSAI allocated to those vessels under paragraphs 
(a)(7)(i) or (a)(7)(iii) of this section, NMFS may reallocate the 
projected unused amount of Pacific cod to vessels harvesting Pacific cod 
using the other gear type(s) through notification in the Federal 
Register.
    (iii) Reallocation of TAC specified for jig gear. On September 15 of 
each year, the Regional Administrator will reallocate any projected 
unused amount of Pacific cod in the BSAI allocated to vessels using jig 
gear to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear through notification in 
the Federal Register.
    (iv) Seasonal allowances--(A) Time periods. NMFS, after consultation 
with the Council, may divide the TAC allocated to vessels using hook-
and-line or pot gear under paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section among the 
following three periods: January 1 through April 30, May 1 through 
August 31, and September 1 through December 31.
    (B) Factors to be considered. NMFS will base any seasonal allowance 
of the Pacific cod allocation to vessels using hook-and-line and pot 
gear on the following information:
    (1) Seasonal distribution of Pacific cod relative to prohibited 
species distribution.
    (2) Variations in prohibited species bycatch rates in the Pacific 
cod fisheries throughout the fishing year.
    (3) Economic effects of any seasonal allowance of Pacific cod on the 
hook-and-line and pot-gear fisheries.
    (C) Unused seasonal allowances. Any unused portion of a seasonal 
allowance of Pacific cod allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot 
gear will be reallocated to the remaining seasons during the current 
fishing year in a manner determined by NMFS, after consultation with the 
Council.
    (8) BSAI Atka mackerel--(i) TAC by gear. Vessels using jig gear will 
be allocated up to 2 percent of the TAC of Atka mackerel specified for 
the Eastern Aleutian Islands District and Bering Sea subarea, after 
subtraction of reserves, based on the criteria specified at paragraph 
(a)(8)(ii) of this section. The remainder of the TAC, after subtraction 
of reserves, will be allocated to vessels using other authorized gear 
types.
    (ii) Annual specification. The percentage of the Atka mackerel TAC 
specified for the Eastern Aleutian Islands District and Bering Sea 
subarea that is allocated annually to vessels using jig gear will be 
published in the Federal Register as part of the proposed and final 
annual specifications under paragraph (c) of this section. The jig gear 
allocation will be based on the following criteria:
    (A) The amount of Atka mackerel harvested by vessels using jig gear 
during recent fishing years;
    (B) The anticipated harvest of Atka mackerel by vessels using jig 
gear during the upcoming fishing year; and
    (C) The extent to which the jig gear allocation will support the 
development of a jig gear fishery for Atka mackerel while minimizing the 
amount of Atka mackerel TAC annually allocated to vessels using jig gear 
that remains unharvested at the end of the fishing year.
    (9) BSAI shortraker rockfish and rougheye rockfish. After 
subtraction of reserves, the TAC of shortraker rockfish and rougheye 
rockfish specified for the Aleutian Islands subarea will be allocated 30 
percent to vessels using non-trawl gear and 70 percent to vessels using 
trawl gear.
    (10) All other groundfish TAC. The initial TAC for each target 
species and the ``other species'' category will be 85 percent of the TAC 
as provided under paragraph (b) of this section.

[[Page 503]]

    (b) Reserves--(1) BSAI--(i) General. Fifteen percent of the BSAI TAC 
for each target species and the ``other species'' category, except the 
hook-and-line and pot gear allocation for sablefish, is automatically 
placed in a reserve, and the remaining 85 percent of the TAC is 
apportioned for each target species and the ``other species'' category, 
except the hook-and-line and pot gear allocation for sablefish.
    (ii) Nonspecified reserve. The reserve is not designated by species 
or species group, and any amount of the reserve may be apportioned to a 
target species, except the hook-and-line gear and pot gear allocation 
for sablefish, or the ``other species'' category, provided that such 
apportionments are consistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section and 
do not result in overfishing of a target species or the ``other 
species'' category.
    (iii) CDQ reserve--(A) Groundfish CDQ reserve. Except as limited by 
Sec. 679.31(a) of this part, one half of the nonspecified reserve 
established by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is apportioned to the 
groundfish CDQ reserve.
    (B) Fixed gear sablefish CDQ reserves. Twenty percent of the fixed 
gear allocation of sablefish established by paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of 
this section for each subarea or district of the BSAI is apportioned to 
a CDQ reserve for each subarea or district.
    (C) Apportionment of groundfish CDQ reserve by TAC category. (1) 
Except for the fixed gear sablefish CDQ reserves, the groundfish CDQ 
reserve is apportioned among TAC categories in amounts equal to 7.5 
percent of each TAC category for which a reserve is established.
    (2) If the final harvest specifications required by paragraph (c) of 
this section change the groundfish species comprising a species category 
or change a TAC by combining management areas or splitting a TAC into 
two or more TACs by management area, then any CDQ allocations based on 
those TACs change proportionally.
    (iv) Inshore/offshore reapportionment (Applicable through December 
31, 1998). Any amounts of the BSAI nonspecific reserve that are 
reapportioned to pollock as provided by this paragraph (b) must be 
apportioned between inshore and offshore components in the same 
proportion specified in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.
    (v) Pacific cod (Applicable through December 31, 1996). Any amounts 
of the BSAI nonspecific reserve that are apportioned to Pacific cod as 
provided by this paragraph (b) must be apportioned between vessels using 
jig, hook-and-line or pot, and trawl gear in the same proportion 
specified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, unless the Regional 
Administrator determines under paragraph (a)(7) (ii) or (iii) of this 
section that vessels using a certain gear type will not be able to 
harvest the additional amount of Pacific cod. In this case, the 
nonspecific reserve will be apportioned to vessels using the other gear 
type(s).
    (2) GOA. Initial reserves are established for pollock, Pacific cod, 
flatfish, and ``other species,'' which are equal to 20 percent of the 
TACs for these species or species groups.
    (i) Pollock inshore/offshore reapportionment (Applicable through 
December 31, 1998). Any amounts of the GOA reserve that are 
reapportioned to pollock as provided by this paragraph (b) must be 
apportioned between inshore and offshore components in the same 
proportion specified in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Pacific cod inshore/offshore reapportionment (Applicable 
through December 31, 1998). Any amounts of the GOA reserve that are 
reapportioned to Pacific cod as provided by this paragraph (b) must be 
apportioned between inshore and offshore components in the same 
proportion specified in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Apportionment of reserves. (i) Notification. (A) As soon as 
practicable after April 1, June 1, and August 1, and on such other dates 
as NMFS determines appropriate, NMFS will, by notification in the 
Federal Register, apportion all or part of the BSAI or GOA reserve in 
accordance with this paragraph (b).
    (B) No apportionment, retention, or PSC limit adjustment may take 
effect until notification has been published in the Federal Register 
with a statement of the findings upon which the apportionment, 
retention, or adjustment is based.

[[Page 504]]

    (ii) Apportionment--(A) General. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, NMFS will apportion the amount of BSAI or 
GOA reserve that will be harvested by U.S. vessels during the remainder 
of the year.
    (B) Exception. Part or all of the BSAI or GOA reserve may be 
withheld if an apportionment would adversely affect the conservation of 
groundfish resources or prohibited species.
    (iii) Public comment--(A) Prior comment. NMFS will provide all 
interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed 
apportionments, retentions, or PSC limit adjustments under this 
paragraph (b) before such apportionments, retentions, or adjustments are 
made, unless NMFS finds that there is good cause for not providing a 
prior comment opportunity, and publishes the reasons therefor in the 
notification of apportionment, retention, or adjustment.
    (B) Submittal dates. Comments provided for in this paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) must be received by NMFS not later than 5 days before April 
1, June 1, and August 1, or other dates that may be specified.
    (C) Subsequent comment. If NMFS determines for good cause that 
notification of apportionment, retention or PSC limit adjustment must be 
issued without providing interested persons a prior opportunity for 
public comment, comments on the apportionment, retention or adjustment 
will be received for a period of 15 days after its effective date.
    (D) Response to comments. NMFS will consider all timely comments in 
deciding whether to make a proposed apportionment, retention, or PSC 
limit adjustment or to modify an apportionment, retention, or adjustment 
that previously has been made, and shall publish responses to those 
comments in the Federal Register as soon as practicable.
    (E) Data available. The Regional Administrator will make available 
to the public during business hours the aggregate data upon which any 
preliminary TAC or PSC limit figure is based or the data upon which any 
apportionment or retention of surplus or reserve, or PSC limit 
adjustment was or is proposed to be based. These data will be available 
for a sufficient period to facilitate informed comment by interested 
persons.
    (c) Annual specifications--(1) Proposed specifications--
    (i) General--(A) Notification. As soon as practicable after 
consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish proposed specifications 
for the succeeding fishing year. The proposed specifications will 
reflect as accurately as possible the projected changes in U.S. 
harvesting and processing capacity and the extent to which U.S. 
harvesting and processing will occur during the coming year.
    (B) Public comment. NMFS will accept public comment on the proposed 
specifications for 30 days from the date of publication in the Federal 
Register.
    (ii) GOA. The GOA proposed specifications will specify annual TAC 
amounts for each target species and the ``other species'' category and 
apportionments thereof established under Sec. 679.20(a)(2), halibut 
prohibited species catch amounts established under Sec. 679.21, seasonal 
allowances of pollock, and inshore/offshore Pacific cod.
    (iii) BSAI. The BSAI proposed specifications will specify the annual 
TAC and initial TAC amounts for each target species and the ``other 
species'' category and apportionments thereof established by paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, PSQ reserves and prohibited species catch 
allowances established by Sec. 679.21, seasonal allowances of pollock 
TAC (including pollock CDQ), and CDQ reserve amounts established by 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Interim specifications. Interim harvest specifications will be 
in effect on January 1 and will remain in effect until superseded by the 
filing of the final specifications by the Office of the Federal 
Register. Interim specifications will be established as follows:
    (i) GOA. One-fourth of each proposed TAC and apportionment thereof 
(not including the reserves or the first seasonal allowance of pollock), 
one-fourth of the proposed halibut prohibited species catch amounts, and 
the proposed first seasonal allowance of pollock.
    (ii) BSAI. Except for pollock and the hook and line and pot gear 
allocation of sablefish, one quarter of each proposed initial TAC and 
apportionment

[[Page 505]]

thereof, one quarter of each CDQ reserve established by paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section, and one quarter of the proposed PSQ reserve 
and prohibited species catch allowances established by Sec. 679.21.
    (A) The interim specifications for pollock will be equal to the 
first seasonal allowance under paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section 
that is published in the proposed specifications under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section.
    (B) The interim specifications for CDQ pollock will be equal to the 
first seasonal allowance that is published in the proposed 
specifications under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) Final specifications--(i) Notification. NMFS will consider 
comments on the proposed specifications received during the comment 
period and, after consultation with the Council, will publish final 
specifications in the Federal Register. The final specifications will 
supersede the interim specifications.
    (ii) GOA. The final specifications will specify the annual TAC for 
each target species and the ``other species'' category and 
apportionments thereof, halibut prohibited species catch amounts, and 
seasonal allowances of pollock.
    (iii) BSAI. The final specifications will specify the annual TAC for 
each target species and the ``other species'' category and 
apportionments thereof, PSQ reserves and prohibited species catch 
allowances, seasonal allowances of the pollock TAC (including pollock 
CDQ), and CDQ reserve amounts.
    (4) Inshore/offshore allocations (Applicable through December 31, 
1998). The proposed, interim, and final specifications will specify the 
allocation of GOA Pacific cod, GOA pollock, and BSAI pollock for 
processing by the inshore and offshore components, and any seasonal 
allowances thereof, as authorized under paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(7) of 
this section.
    (5) BSAI Pacific cod gear allocations The proposed, interim, and 
final specifications will specify the allocation of BSAI Pacific cod 
among gear types as authorized under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (6) BSAI Atka mackerel allocations. The proposed, interim, and final 
specifications will specify the allocation of BSAI Atka mackerel among 
gear types as authorized under paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
    (d) Fishery closures--(1) Directed fishing allowance--(i) General. 
If the Regional Administrator determines that any allocation or 
apportionment of a target species or ``other species'' category 
specified under paragraph (c) of this section has been or will be 
reached, the Regional Administrator may establish a directed fishing 
allowance for that species or species group.
    (ii) Specified fishery amounts--(A) Inseason adjustments. The 
category allocations or apportionments established under paragraph (c) 
of this section may be revised by inseason adjustments, as defined at 
Sec. 679.25, for a given species or species group or pollock allowance, 
as identified by regulatory area, subarea, or district, and, if 
applicable, as further identified by gear type.
    (B) Incidental catch. In establishing a directed fishing allowance, 
the Regional Administrator shall consider the amount of the allocation 
or apportionment established under paragraph (c) of this section that 
will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species 
in the same subarea, regulatory area, or district.
    (iii) Directed fishing closure--(A) Notification. If the Regional 
Administrator establishes a directed fishing allowance for a fishery 
allocation or apportionment under this paragraph (d), and that allowance 
has been or will be reached before the end of the fishing season or 
year, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register prohibiting 
directed fishing in the specified subarea, regulatory area, or district.
    (B) Retention of bycatch species. If directed fishing for a target 
species or the ``other species'' category is prohibited, a vessel may 
not retain that bycatch species in an amount that exceeds the maximum 
retainable bycatch amount, as calculated under paragraphs (e) and (f) of 
this section, at any time during a fishing trip.
    (2) Groundfish as prohibited species closure. When the Regional 
Administrator determines that the TAC of any target species or the 
``other species'' category specified under paragraph (c) of this 
section, or the share of any TAC assigned to any type of gear, has been 
or

[[Page 506]]

will be achieved prior to the end of a year, NMFS will publish 
notification in the Federal Register requiring that target species or 
the ``other species'' be treated in the same manner as a prohibited 
species, as described under Sec. 679.21(b), for the remainder of the 
year.
    (3) Overfishing closure--(i) Notification. If, in making a 
determination under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Regional 
Administrator also determines that fishing for other target species or 
species groups in the area, district or part thereof where the 
notification applies, may lead to the overfishing of the species or 
species group for which the allocation or apportionment has been or will 
be reached, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
specifying limitations or prohibitions designed to prevent overfishing 
of that species or species group.
    (ii) Limitations and prohibitions. These limitations and 
prohibitions may prohibit directed fishing for other species or species 
groups in the area, district, or part thereof where the notification 
applies, or may limit time, area, or gear types that may be used in 
directed fishing for the other species or species groups.
    (iii) Factors to be considered. When making the determinations 
specified under paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section, 
the Regional Administrator may consider allowing fishing to continue or 
resume with certain gear types or in certain areas and times based on 
findings of:
    (A) The risk of biological harm to a groundfish species or species 
group for which the TAC or PSC limit is or will be reached.
    (B) The risk of socioeconomic harm to authorized users of the 
groundfish for which the TAC or PSC limit will be or has been reached.
    (C) The impact that the continued closure might have on the 
socioeconomic well-being of other domestic fisheries.
    (e) Maximum retainable bycatch amounts--(1) Proportion of basis 
species. The maximum retainable bycatch amount for a bycatch species or 
species group is calculated as a proportion of the basis species 
retained on board the vessel using the retainable percentages in Table 
10 to this part for the GOA species categories and in Table 11 to this 
part for the BSAI species categories.
    (2) Calculation. (i) To calculate the maximum retainable bycatch 
amount for a specific bycatch species, an individual retainable bycatch 
amount must be calculated with respect to each basis species that is 
retained on board that vessel.
    (ii) To obtain these individual retainable bycatch amounts, multiply 
the appropriate retainable percentage for the bycatch species/basis 
species combination, set forth in Table 10 to this part for the GOA 
species categories and Table 11 to this part for the BSAI species 
categories, by the amount of that basis species, in round-weight 
equivalents.
    (iii) The maximum retainable bycatch amount for that specific 
bycatch species is the sum of the individual retainable bycatch amounts.
    (f) Directed fishing calculations and determinations--(1) Round-
weight equivalents. Any determination concerning directed fishing, the 
amount or percentage of any species, species group, or any fish or fish 
products must be calculated in round-weight equivalents.
    (2) Retainable amounts. Except as provided in Table 10 to this part, 
arrowtooth flounder, retained CDQ species, or any groundfish species for 
which directed fishing is closed may not be used to calculate retainable 
amounts of other groundfish species.
    (g) Allowable retention of pollock roe--(1) Percentage of pollock 
roe. (i) Pollock roe retained on board a vessel at any time during a 
fishing trip must not exceed 7 percent of the total round-weight 
equivalent of pollock, as calculated from the primary pollock product on 
board the vessel during the same fishing trip.
    (ii) Determinations of allowable retention of pollock roe will be 
based on amounts of pollock harvested, received, or processed during a 
single fishing trip.
    (iii) Pollock or pollock products from previous fishing trips that 
are retained on board a vessel may not be used to determine the 
allowable retention of pollock roe for that vessel.

[[Page 507]]

    (2) Primary product. (i) For purposes of this paragraph (g), only 
one primary pollock product per fish, other than roe, may be used to 
calculate the round-weight equivalent.
    (ii) A primary pollock product that contains roe (such as headed and 
gutted pollock with roe) may not be used to calculate the round-weight 
equivalent of pollock.
    (iii) The primary pollock product must be distinguished from 
ancillary pollock products in the DCPL required under Sec. 679.5(a)(9).
    (3) Pollock product recovery rates (PRRs). Use the product types and 
standard PRRs for pollock found in Table 3 to this part to calculate 
round-weight equivalents for pollock for purposes of this paragraph (g).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Calculation of retainable pollock roe--(i) Round-weight 
equivalent. (A) To calculate the amount of pollock roe that can be 
retained on board during a fishing trip, first calculate the round-
weight equivalent by dividing the total amount of primary product on 
board by the appropriate PRR.
    (B) To determine the maximum mount of pollock roe that can be 
retained on board a vessel during the same fishing trip, multiply the 
round-weight equivalent by 0.07.
    (C) Pollock roe retained on board from previous fishing trips will 
not be counted.
    (ii) Two or more products from different fish. (A) If two or more 
products, other than roe, are made from different fish, round-weight 
equivalents are calculated separately for each product.
    (B) To determine the maximum amount of pollock roe that can be 
retained on board a vessel during a fishing trip, add the round-weight 
equivalents together; then, multiply the sum by 0.07.
    (iii) Two or more products from same fish. If two or more products, 
other than roe, are made from the same fish, the maximum amount of 
pollock roe that can be retained during a fishing trip is determined 
from the primary product.
    (5) Primary pollock product--(i) Process prior to transfer. Any 
primary pollock product used to calculate retainable amounts of pollock 
roe must be frozen, canned, or reduced to meal by the vessel retaining 
the pollock roe prior to any transfer of the product to another vessel.
    (ii) No discard of processed product. Any pollock product that has 
been processed may not be discarded at sea unless such discarding is 
necessary to meet other requirements of this part.
    (h) Standard product types and standard PRRs--(1) Calculating round-
weight equivalents from standard PRRs. Round-weight equivalents for 
groundfish products are calculated using the product codes and standard 
PRRs specified in Table 3 of this part.
    (2) Adjustments. The Regional Administrator may adjust standard PRRs 
and product types specified in Table 3 of this part if he or she 
determines that existing standard PRRs are inaccurate or if new product 
types are developed.
    (i) Adjustments to any standard PRR listed in Table 3 of this part 
that are within and including 15 percent of that standard PRR may be 
made without providing notification and opportunity for prior public 
comment.

[[Page 508]]

    (ii) Adjustments of any standard PRR during a calendar year, when 
aggregated with all other adjustments made during that year, will not 
exceed 15 percent of the standard PRR listed in Table 3 of this part at 
the beginning of that calendar year.
    (iii) No new product type will be announced until NMFS publishes the 
proposed adjustment and/or new product type in the Federal Register and 
provides the public with at least 30 days opportunity for public 
comment.
    (iv) Any adjustment of a PRR that acts to further restrict the 
fishery will not be effective until 30 days after the date of 
publication in the Federal Register.
    (v) If NMFS makes any adjustment or announcement without providing a 
prior notification and opportunity for prior public comment, the 
Regional Administrator will receive public comments on the adjustment or 
announcement for a period of 15 days from the date of publication in the 
Federal Register.
    (i) Forage fish--(1) Definition. See Sec. 679.2.
    (2) Applicability. The provisions of Sec. 679.20(i) apply to all 
vessels fishing for groundfish in the BSAI or GOA, and to all vessels 
processing groundfish harvested in the BSAI or GOA.
    (3) Closure to directed fishing. Directed fishing for forage fish is 
prohibited at all times in the BSAI and GOA.
    (4) Limits on sale, barter, trade, and processing. The sale, barter, 
trade, or processing of forage fish is prohibited, except as provided in 
paragraph (i)(5) of this section.
    (5) Allowable fishmeal production. Retained catch of forage fish not 
exceeding the maximum retainable bycatch amount may be processed into 
fishmeal for sale, barter, or trade.

<R05>
Sec. 679.21  Prohibited species bycatch management.

    (a) Applicability.(1) This section applies to all vessels required 
to have a Federal fisheries permit under Sec. 679.4.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided, this section also applies to all 
motherships and shoreside processors that receive groundfish from 
vessels required to have a Federal fisheries permit under Sec. 679.4.
    (b) General-- (1) Definition. Prohibited species, for the purpose of 
this part, means any of the species of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus 
spp.), steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), halibut, Pacific herring 
(Clupea harengus pallasi), king crab, and Tanner crab caught by a vessel 
regulated under this part while fishing for groundfish in the BSAI or 
GOA, unless retention is authorized by other applicable laws, including 
the annual management measures published in the Federal Register 
pursuant to Sec. 300.62 of this title.
    (2) Prohibited species catch restrictions. The operator of each 
vessel engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the GOA or BSAI 
must:
    (i) Minimize its catch of prohibited species.
    (ii) After allowing for sampling by an observer, if an observer is 
aboard, sort its catch immediately after retrieval of the gear and, 
except as provided below, return all prohibited species or parts thereof 
to the sea immediately, with a minimum of injury, regardless of its 
condition. The following exceptions are made:
    (A) Salmon prohibited species catch in the BSAI groundfish fisheries 
under paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 679.26; and
    (B) Salmon PSQ caught by catcher vessels using trawl gear in the CDQ 
fisheries under subpart C of this part.
    (3) Rebuttable presumption. Except as provided under paragraph (c) 
of this section, Sec. 679.26, or for salmon PSQ retained by catcher 
vessels using trawl gear in the CDQ fisheries, there will be a 
rebuttable presumption that any prohibited species retained on board a 
fishing vessel regulated under this part

[[Page 509]]

was caught and retained in violation of this section.
    (4) Prohibited species taken seaward of the EEZ off Alaska. No 
vessel fishing for groundfish in the GOA or BSAI may have on board any 
species listed in this paragraph (b) that was taken in waters seaward of 
these management areas, regardless of whether retention of such species 
was authorized by other applicable laws.
    (c) Salmon taken in BSAI trawl fishery--(1) Salmon discard. Except 
as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the operator of a 
vessel and the manager of a shoreside processor must not discard any 
salmon or transfer or process any salmon under the PSD Program at 
Sec. 679.26, if the salmon were taken incidental to a directed fishery 
for BSAI groundfish by vessels using trawl gear until the number of 
salmon has been determined by an observer and the collection of any 
scientific data or biological samples from the salmon has been 
completed.
    (2) Salmon retention and storage. (i) Operators of vessels carrying 
observers aboard and whose fishing operations allow for sorting of BSAI 
groundfish catch for salmon must retain all salmon bycatch from each 
haul in a separate bin or other location that allows an observer free 
and unobstructed physical access to the salmon to count each fish and 
collect any scientific data or biological samples. Salmon from different 
hauls must be retained separately in a manner that identifies the haul 
from which the salmon were taken.
    (ii) Operators of vessels not carrying observers aboard or whose 
fishing operations do not allow for sorting of BSAI groundfish catch for 
salmon must ice, freeze, or store in a refrigerated saltwater tank all 
salmon taken as bycatch in trawl operations for delivery to the 
processor receiving the vessel's BSAI groundfish catch.
    (iii) Processors receiving BSAI groundfish harvested in a directed 
fishery for groundfish using trawl gear must retain all salmon delivered 
by each trawl vessel during a weekly reporting period in separate bins 
marked with the vessel's name and ADF&G fish ticket number(s) for each 
delivery until an observer has counted each salmon and collected any 
scientific data or biological samples from the salmon delivered to the 
processor by that vessel. Processors without an observer present must 
store whole salmon in an iced or frozen state until an observer is 
available to count each fish. Salmon must be stored at a location that 
allows an observer free and unobstructed physical access to each salmon.
    (3) Exemption. Motherships and shoreside processors that are not 
required to obtain observer coverage during a month under Sec. 679.50(c) 
and (d) are not required to retain salmon.
    (4) Assignment of crew to assist observer. Operators of vessels and 
managers of shoreside processors that are required to retain salmon 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must designate and identify to 
the observer aboard the vessel or at the shoreside processor a crew 
person or employee to be responsible for sorting, retention, and storage 
of salmon. Upon request of the observer, the designated crew person or 
employee also is responsible for counting salmon and taking biological 
samples from retained salmon under the direction of the observer.
    (5) Release of salmon. Salmon must be returned to Federal waters as 
soon as is practicable, with a minimum of injury, regardless of 
condition, following notification by an observer that the number of 
salmon has been determined and the collection of any scientific data or 
biological samples has been completed.
    (d) GOA halibut PSC limits. This section is applicable for vessels 
engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the GOA.
    (1) Notification--(i) Proposed and final limits and apportionments. 
NMFS will publish annually in the Federal Register proposed and final 
halibut PSC limits and apportionments thereof in the notification 
required under Sec. 679.20.
    (ii) Modification of limits. NMFS, by notification in the Federal 
Register, may change the halibut PSC limits during the year for which 
they were specified, based on new information of the types set forth in 
this paragraph (d)(1).

[[Page 510]]

    (2) Public comment. NMFS will accept public comment on the proposed 
halibut PSC limits, and apportionments thereof, for a period of 30 days 
from the date of publication in the Federal Register. NMFS will consider 
comments received on proposed halibut limits and, after consultation 
with the Council, will publish notification in the Federal Register 
specifying the final halibut PSC limits and apportionments thereof.
    (3) Trawl gear proposed halibut limit--(i) Notification. Aftny 
weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of groundfish 
and is not a shallow-water species fishery as defined under paragraph 
(d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (4) Hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries--(i) Notification. After 
consultation with the Council, NMFS will publish notification in the 
Federal Register specifying the proposed and final halibut PSC limits 
for vessels using hook-and-line gear. The notification also may specify 
a halibut PSC limit for the pot gear fisheries.
    (ii) Halibut bycatch allowance. The halibut PSC limit specified for 
vessels using hook-and-line gear may be further apportioned, as bycatch 
allowances, to the fishery categories listed in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of 
this section, based on each category's proportional share of the 
anticipated halibut bycatch mortality during a fishing year and the need 
to optimize the amount of total groundfish harvest under the halibut PSC 
limit. The sum of all bycatch allowances will equal the halibut PSC 
limit established under this paragraph (d).
    (iii) Hook-and-line fishery categories. For purposes of apportioning 
the hook-and-line halibut PSC limit among fisheries, the following 
fishery categories are specified and defined in terms of round-weight 
equivalents of those GOA groundfish species for which a TAC has been 
specified under Sec. 679.20.
    (A) Demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District. 
Fishing with hook-and-line gear in the Southeast Outside District of the 
GOA Eastern Regulatory Area (SEEO) during any weekly reporting period 
that results in a retained catch of demersal shelf rockfish that is 
greater than the retained amount of any other fishery category defined 
under this paragraph (d)(4)(iii).
    (B) Sablefish fishery. Fishing with hook-and-line gear during any 
weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of sablefish 
that is greater than the retained amount of any other fishery category 
defined under this paragraph (d)(4)(iii).
    (C) Other hook-and-line fishery. Fishing with hook-and-line gear 
during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of 
groundfish and is not a demersal shelf rockfish fishery or a sablefish 
fishery defined under paragraphs (d)(4)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (5) Seasonal apportionments--(i) General. NMFS, after consultation 
with the Council, may apportion each halibut PSC limit or bycatch 
allowance specified under this paragraph (d) on a seasonal basis.
    (ii) Factors to be considered. NMFS will base any seasonal 
apportionment of a halibut PSC limit or bycatch allowance on the 
following types of information:
    (A) Seasonal distribution of halibut.
    (B) Seasonal distribution of target groundfish species relative to 
halibut distribution.
    (C) Expected halibut bycatch needs, on a seasonal basis, relative to 
changes in halibut biomass and expected catches of target groundfish 
species.
    (D) Expected variations in bycatch rates throughout the fishing 
year.
    (E) Expected changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons.
    (F) Expected start of fishing effort.
    (G) Economic effects of establishing seasonal halibut allocations on 
segments of the target groundfish industry.
    (iii) Unused seasonal apportionments. Unused seasonal apportionments 
of halibut PSC limits specified for trawl, hook-and-line, or pot gear 
will be added to the respective seasonal apportionment for the next 
season during a current fishing year.
    (iv) Seasonal apportionment exceeded. If a seasonal apportionment of 
a halibut PSC limit specified for trawl, hook-and-line, or pot gear is 
exceeded,

[[Page 511]]

the amount by which the seasonal apportionment is exceeded will be 
deducted from the respective apportionment for the next season during a 
current fishing year.
    (6) Apportionment among regulatory areas and districts. Each halibut 
PSC limit specified under this paragraph (d) also may be apportioned 
among the GOA regulatory areas and districts.
    (7) Halibut PSC closures--(i) Trawl gear fisheries. If, during the 
fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that U.S. fishing 
vessels participating in either of the trawl fishery categories listed 
in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) (A) or (B) of this section will catch the 
halibut bycatch allowance, or apportionments thereof, specified for that 
fishery category under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, NMFS will 
publish notification in the Federal Register closing the entire GOA or 
the applicable regulatory area or district to directed fishing with 
trawl gear for each species and/or species group that comprises that 
fishing category; provided, however, that when the halibut bycatch 
allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for the shallow-
water species fishery is reached, fishing for pollock by vessels using 
pelagic trawl gear may continue, consistent with other provisions of 
this part.
    (ii) Hook-and-line fisheries. If, during the fishing year, the 
Regional Administrator determines that U.S. fishing vessels 
participating in any of the three hook-and-line gear fishery categories 
listed under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section will catch the 
halibut bycatch allowance, or apportionments thereof, specified for that 
fishery category under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, NMFS will 
publish notification in the Federal Register closing the entire GOA or 
the applicable regulatory area or district to directed fishing with 
hook-and-line gear for each species and/or species group that comprises 
that fishing category.
    (iii) Pot gear fisheries. If, during the fishing year, the Regional 
Administrator determines that the catch of halibut by operators of 
vessels using pot gear to participate in a directed fishery for 
groundfish will reach the halibut PSC limit, or seasonal apportionment 
thereof, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal Register 
prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using pot gear 
for the remainder of the season to which the halibut PSC limit or 
seasonal apportionment applies.
    (iv) Nonpelagic trawl gear fisheries--(A) Continued fishing under 
specified conditions. When the vessels to which a halibut PSC limit 
applies have caught an amount of halibut equal to that PSC, the Regional 
Administrator may, by notification in the Federal Register, allow some 
or all of those vessels to continue to fish for groundfish using 
nonpelagic trawl gear under specified conditions, subject to the other 
provisions of this part.
    (B) Factors to be considered. In authorizing and conditioning such 
continued fishing with bottom-trawl gear, the Regional Administrator 
will take into account the following considerations, and issue relevant 
findings:
    (1) The risk of biological harm to halibut stocks and of socio-
economic harm to authorized halibut users posed by continued bottom 
trawling by these vessels.
    (2) The extent to which these vessels have avoided incidental 
halibut catches up to that point in the year.
    (3) The confidence of the Regional Administrator in the accuracy of 
the estimates of incidental halibut catches by these vessels up to that 
point in the year.
    (4) Whether observer coverage of these vessels is sufficient to 
assure adherence to the prescribed conditions and to alert the Regional 
Administrator to increases in their incidental halibut catches.
    (5) The enforcement record of owners and operators of these vessels, 
and the confidence of the Regional Administrator that adherence to the 
prescribed conditions can be assured in light of available enforcement 
resources.
    (e) BSAI PSC limits--(1) Trawl gear-- (i) PSQ reserve. 7.5 percent 
of each PSC limit set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) (ii) through (v), 
(e)(1)(vii), and (e)(1)(viii) of this section is allocated to the 
groundfish CDQ program as PSQ reserve. The PSQ reserve is not 
apportioned by gear or fishery.
    (ii) Red king crab in Zone 1. The PSC limit of red king crab caught 
by trawl

[[Page 512]]

vessels while engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in Zone 1 
during any fishing year will be specified annually by NMFS, after 
consultation with the Council, based on abundance and spawning biomass 
of red king crab using the criteria set out under paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) 
(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) When the number of mature female red king crab is at or below 
the threshold of 8.4 million mature crab or the effective spawning 
biomass is less than or equal to 14.5 million lb (6,577 mt), the Zone 1 
PSC limit will be 35,000 red king crab.
    (B) When the number of mature female red king crab is above the 
threshold of 8.4 million mature crab and the effective spawning biomass 
is greater than 14.5 but less than 55 million lb (24,948 mt), the Zone 1 
PSC limit will be 100,000 red king crab.
    (C) When the number of mature female red king crab is above the 
threshold of 8.4 million mature crab and the effective spawning biomass 
is equal to or greater than 55 million lb, the Zone 1 PSC limit will be 
200,000 red king crab.
    (iii) Tanner crab (C. bairdi). The PSC limit of C. bairdi crabs 
caught by trawl vessels while engaged in directed fishing for groundfish 
in Zones 1 and 2 during any fishing year will be specified annually by 
NMFS under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, based on total abundance of 
C. bairdi crabs as indicated by the NMFS annual bottom trawl survey, 
using the criteria set out under paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of 
this section.
    (A) Zone 1. When the total abundance of C. bairdi crabs is:
    (1) 150 million animals or less, the PSC limit will be 0.5 percent 
of the total abundance.
    (2) Over 150 million to 270 million animals, the PSC limit will be 
750,000 animals.
    (3) Over 270 million to 400 million animals, the PSC limit will be 
850,000 animals.
    (4) Over 400 million animals, the PSC limit will be 1,000,000 
animals.
    (B) Zone 2. When the total abundance of C. bairdi crabs is:
    (1) 175 million animals or less, the PSC limit will be 1.2 percent 
of the total abundance.
    (2) Over 175 million to 290 million animals, the PSC limit will be 
2,100,000 animals.
    (3) Over 290 million to 400 million animals, the PSC limit will be 
2,550,000 animals.
    (4) Over 400 million animals, the PSC limit will be 3,000,000 
animals.
    (iv) C. opilio. The PSC limit of C. opilio caught by trawl vessels 
while engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the COBLZ will be 
specified annually by NMFS under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, based 
on total abundance of C. opilio as indicated by the NMFS annual bottom 
trawl survey using the following criteria:
    (A) PSC Limit. The PSC limit will be 0.1133 percent of the total 
abundance, unless;
    (B) Minimum PSC Limit. If 0.1133 percent multiplied by the total 
abundance is less than 4.5 million, then the minimum PSC limit will be 
4.5 million animals; or
    (C) Maximum PSC Limit. If 0.1133 percent multiplied by the total 
abundance is greater than 13 million, then the maximum PSC limit will be 
13 million animals.
    (v) Halibut. The PSC limit of halibut caught while conducting any 
trawl fishery for groundfish in the BSAI during any fishing year is an 
amount of halibut equivalent to 3,775 mt of halibut mortality.
    (vi) Pacific herring. The PSC limit of Pacific herring caught while 
conducting any domestic trawl fishery for groundfish in the BSAI is 1 
percent of the annual eastern Bering Sea herring biomass. The PSC limit 
will be apportioned into annual herring PSC allowances, by target 
fishery, and will be published along with the annual herring PSC limit 
in the Federal Register with the proposed and final groundfish 
specifications defined in Sec. 679.20.
    (vii) Chinook salmon. The PSC limit of chinook salmon caught while 
conducting any trawl fishery for groundfish in the BSAI between January 
1 and April 15 is 48,000 fish.
    (viii) Non-chinook salmon. The PSC limit of non-chinook salmon 
caught by

[[Page 513]]

vessels using trawl gear during August 15 through October 14 in the CVOA 
is 42,000 fish.
    (2) Nontrawl gear, halibut. (i) The PSC limit of halibut caught 
while conducting any nontrawl fishery for groundfish in the BSAI during 
any fishing year is the amount of halibut equivalent to 900 mt of 
halibut mortality.
    (ii) 7.5 percent of the nontrawl gear halibut PSC limit set forth in 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section is allocated to the groundfish CDQ 
program as PSQ reserve. The PSQ reserve is not apportioned by gear or 
fishery.
    (3) PSC apportionment to trawl fisheries--(i) General. NMFS, after 
consultation with the Council and after subtraction of PSQ reserve, will 
apportion each PSC limit set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) (ii) through 
(viii) of this section into bycatch allowances for fishery categories 
defined in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, based on each 
category's proportional share of the anticipated incidental catch during 
a fishing year of prohibited species for which a PSC limit is specified 
and the need to optimize the amount of total groundfish harvested under 
established PSC limits.
    (ii) Red king crab, C. bairdi Tanner crab, and halibut--(A) General. 
For vessels engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the GOA or 
BSAI, the PSC limits for red king crab, C. bairdi, C. opilio, and 
halibut will be apportioned to the trawl fishery categories defined in 
paragraphs (e)(3)(iv) (B) through (F) of this section.
    (B) Red King Crab Savings Subarea (RKCSS). (1) The RKCSS is the 
portion of the RKCSA between 56 deg.00' and 56 deg.10' N. lat. 
Notwithstanding other provisions of this part, vessels using non-pelagic 
trawl gear in the RKCSS may engage in directed fishing for groundfish in 
a given year, if the ADF&G had established a guideline harvest level the 
previous year for the red king crab fishery in the Bristol Bay area.
    (2) When the RKCSS is open to vessels fishing for groundfish with 
nonpelagic trawl gear under (e)(3)(ii)(B)(1) of this section, NMFS, 
after consultation with the Council, will specify an amount of the red 
king crab bycatch limit annually established under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) 
of this section for the RKCSS. The amount of the red king crab bycatch 
limit specified for the RKCSS will not exceed an amount equivalent to 35 
percent of the trawl bycatch allowance specified for the rock sole/
flathead sole/``other flatfish'' fishery category under this paragraph 
(e)(3) and will be based on the need to optimize the groundfish harvest 
relative to red king crab bycatch.
    (C) Incidental catch in midwater pollock fishery. Any amount of red 
king crab, C. bairdi, C. opilio, or halibut that is incidentally taken 
in the midwater pollock fishery as defined in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of 
this section will be counted against the bycatch allowances specified 
for the pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species'' category defined in 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(F) of this section.
    (iii) Pacific herring. The PSC limit for Pacific herring will be 
apportioned to the BSAI trawl fishery categories defined in paragraphs 
(e)(3)(iv) (A) through (F) of this section.
    (iv) Trawl fishery categories. For purposes of apportioning trawl 
PSC limits among fisheries, the following fishery categories are 
specified and defined in terms of round-weight equivalents of those 
groundfish species or species groups for which a TAC has been specified 
under Sec. 679.20.
    (A) Midwater pollock fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any 
weekly reporting period that results in a catch of pollock that is 95 
percent or more of the total amount of groundfish caught during the 
week.
    (B) Flatfish fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly 
reporting period that results in a retained aggregate amount of rock 
sole, ``other flatfish,'' and yellowfin sole that is greater than the 
retained amount of any other fishery category defined under this 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (1) Yellowfin sole fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any 
weekly reporting period that is defined as a flatfish fishery under this 
paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) and results in a retained amount of yellowfin 
sole that is 70 percent or more of the retained aggregate amount of rock 
sole, ``other flatfish,'' and yellowfin sole.
    (2) Rock sole/flathead sole/``other flatfish'' fishery. Fishing with 
trawl gear

[[Page 514]]

during any weekly reporting period that is defined as a flatfish fishery 
under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) and is not a yellowfin sole fishery 
as defined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of this section.
    (C) Greenland turbot/arrowtooth flounder/sablefish fishery. Fishing 
with trawl gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a 
retained aggregate amount of Greenland turbot, arrowtooth flounder, and 
sablefish that is greater than the retained amount of any other fishery 
category defined under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (D) Rockfish fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly 
reporting period that results in a retained aggregate amount of rockfish 
species that is greater than the retained amount of any other fishery 
category defined under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (E) Pacific cod fishery. Fishing with trawl gear during any weekly 
reporting period that results in a retained aggregate amount of Pacific 
cod that is greater than the retained amount of any other groundfish 
fishery category defined under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (F) Pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species.'' Fishing with trawl gear 
during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained aggregate 
amount of pollock other than pollock harvested in the midwater pollock 
fishery defined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, Atka 
mackerel, and ``other species'' that is greater than the retained amount 
of any other fishery category defined under this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).
    (4) Halibut apportionment to nontrawl fishery categories--(i) 
General. NMFS, after consultation with the Council and after subtraction 
of PSQ reserve, may apportion the halibut PSC limit for nontrawl gear 
set forth under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section into bycatch 
allowances for nontrawl fishery categories defined under paragraph 
(e)(4)(ii) of this section based on each category's proportional share 
of the anticipated bycatch mortality of halibut during a fishing year 
and the need to optimize the amount of total groundfish harvested under 
the nontrawl halibut PSC limit. The sum of all bycatch allowances of any 
prohibited species will equal its PSC limit.
    (ii) Nontrawl fishery categories. For purposes of apportioning the 
nontrawl halibut PSC limit among fisheries, the following fishery 
categories are specified and defined in terms of round-weight 
equivalents of those BSAI groundfish species for which a TAC has been 
specified under Sec. 679.20.
    (A) Pacific cod hook-and-line fishery. Fishing with hook-and-line 
gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch 
of Pacific cod that is greater than the retained amount of any other 
groundfish species.
    (B) Sablefish hook-and-line fishery. Fishing with hook-and-line gear 
during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of 
sablefish that is greater than the retained amount of any other

weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch of groundfish.
    (D) Groundfish pot gear fishery. Fishing with pot gear under 
restrictions set forth in Sec. 679.24(b) during any weekly reporting 
period that results in a retained catch of groundfish.
    (E) Other nontrawl fisheries. Fishing for groundfish with nontrawl 
gear during any weekly reporting period that results in a retained catch 
of groundfish and does not qualify as a Pacific cod hook-and-line 
fishery, a sablefish hook-and-line fishery, a jig gear fishery, or a 
groundfish pot gear fishery as defined under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of 
this section.
    (5) Seasonal apportionments of bycatch allowances--(i) General. 
NMFS, after consultation with the Council, may apportion fishery bycatch 
allowances on a seasonal basis.
    (ii) Factors to be considered. NMFS will base any seasonal 
apportionment of a bycatch allowance on the following types of 
information:
    (A) Seasonal distribution of prohibited species;
    (B) Seasonal distribution of target groundfish species relative to 
prohibited species distribution;
    (C) Expected prohibited species bycatch needs on a seasonal basis 
relevant to change in prohibited species

[[Page 515]]

biomass and expected catches of target groundfish species;
    (D) Expected variations in bycatch rates throughout the fishing 
year;
    (E) Expected changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons;
    (F) Expected start of fishing effort; or
    (G) Economic effects of establishing seasonal prohibited species 
apportionments on segments of the target groundfish industry.
    (iii) Seasonal trawl fishery bycatch allowances--(A) Unused seasonal 
apportionments. Unused seasonal apportionments of trawl fishery bycatch 
allowances made under this paragraph (e)(5) will be added to its 
respective fishery bycatch allowance for the next season during a 
current fishing year.
    (B) Seasonal apportionment exceeded. If a seasonal apportionment of 
a trawl fishery bycatch allowance made under paragraph (d)(5) of this 
section is exceeded, the amount by which the seasonal apportionment is 
exceeded will be deducted from its respective apportionment for the next 
season during a current fishing year.
    (iv) Seasonal nontrawl fishery bycatch allowances--(A) Unused 
seasonal apportionments. Any unused portion of a seasonal nontrawl 
fishery bycatch allowance made under this paragraph (e)(5) will be 
reapportioned to the fishery's remaining seasonal bycatch allowances 
during a current fishing year in a manner determined by NMFS, after 
consultation with the Council, based on the types of information listed 
under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (B) Seasonal apportionment exceeded. If a seasonal apportionment of 
a nontrawl fishery bycatch allowance made under this paragraph (e)(5) is 
exceeded, the amount by which the seasonal apportionment is exceeded 
will be deducted from the fishery's remaining seasonal bycatch 
allowances during a current fishing year in a manner determined by NMFS, 
after consultation with the Council, based on the types of information 
listed under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (6) Notification--(i) General. NMFS will publish annually in the 
Federal Register the annual red king crab PSC limit, and, if applicable, 
the amount of this PSC limit specified for the RKCSS, the annual C. 
bairdi PSC limit, the annual C. opilio PSC limit, the proposed and final

Regional Administrator determines that U.S. fishing vessels 
participating in any of the nontrawl fishery categories listed under 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section will catch the halibut bycatch 
allowance, or seasonal apportionment thereof, specified for that fishery 
category under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, NMFS will publish 
in the Federal Register the closure of the entire BSAI to directed 
fishing with the relevant gear type for each species and/or species 
group in that fishery category.
    (f) Program to reduce prohibited species bycatch rates--(1) 
Requirements--(i) General. A vessel's bycatch rate, as calculated at the 
end of a fishing month under paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section, while 
participating in the fisheries identified in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, shall not exceed bycatch rate standards referenced in paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Applicability. A vessel is subject to this paragraph (f) if the 
groundfish catch of the vessel is observed on board the vessel, or on 
board a mothership that receives unsorted codends from the vessel, at 
any time during a weekly reporting period, and the vessel is assigned to 
one of the fisheries defined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (2) Assigned fisheries. During any weekly reporting period, a 
vessel's observed catch composition of groundfish species for which a 
TAC has been specified in the GOA or BSAI will determine the fishery to 
which the vessel is assigned, as follows:
    (i) GOA midwater pollock fishery means fishing with trawl gear in 
the GOA that results in an observed catch of groundfish from the GOA 
during any weekly reporting period that is composed of 95 percent or 
more of pollock when the directed fishery for pollock by vessels using 
trawl gear other than pelagic trawl gear is closed.
    (ii) GOA other trawl fishery means fishing with trawl gear in the 
GOA that results in an observed catch of groundfish from the GOA during 
any weekly reporting period that does not qualify as a midwater pollock 
fishery under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) BSAI midwater pollock fishery means fishing with trawl gear in 
the BSAI that results in an observed catch of groundfish from the BSAI 
during any weekly reporting period that is composed of 95 percent or 
more of pollock when the directed fishery for pollock by vessels using 
trawl gear other than pelagic trawl gear is closed.
    (iv) BSAI yellowfin sole fishery means fishing with trawl gear in 
the BSAI that results in a retained aggregate amount of rock sole, 
``other flatfish,'' and yellowfin sole caught in the BSAI during any 
weekly reporting period that is greater than the retained amount of any 
other fishery under this paragraph (f)(2) and results in a retained 
amount of BSAI yellowfin sole that is 70 percent or more of the retained 
aggregate amount of BSAI rock sole, ``other flatfish,'' and yellowfin 
sole.
    (v) BSAI bottom pollock fishery means fishing with trawl gear in the 
BSAI that results in a retained amount of pollock caught in the BSAI 
during any weekly reporting period other than pollock harvested in the 
midwater pollock fishery in the BSAI defined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of 
this section, that is greater than the retained amount of any other 
fishery defined under this paragraph (f)(2).
    (vi) BSAI other trawl fishery means fishing with trawl gear in the 
BSAI that results in a retained amount of groundfish caught in the BSAI 
during any weekly reporting period that does not qualify as a midwater 
pollock, yellowfin sole, or bottom pollock fishery.
    (3) Notification of bycatch rate standards--(i) Prior notice. Prior 
to January 1 and July 1 of each year, the Regional Administrator will 
publish notification in the Federal Register specifying bycatch rate 
standards for the fisheries identified in this paragraph (f) that will 
be in effect for specified seasons within the 6-month periods of January 
1 through June 30 and July 1 through December 31, respectively.
    (ii) Adjustments. The Regional Administrator may adjust bycatch rate 
standards as frequently as he or she considers appropriate.
    (4) Factors upon which bycatch rate standards are based. Bycatch 
rate standards for a fishery and adjustments to such standards will be 
based on the following information and considerations:

[[Page 518]]

    (i) Previous years' average observed bycatch rates for that fishery.
    (ii) Immediately preceding season's average observed bycatch rates 
for that fishery.
    (iii) The bycatch allowances and associated fishery closures 
specified under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
    (iv) Anticipated groundfish harvests for that fishery.
    (v) Anticipated seasonal distribution of fishing effort for 
groundfish.
    (vi) Other information and criteria deemed relevant by the Regional 
Administrator.
    (5) Public comment--(i) Prior comment. Bycatch rate standards or 
adjustments to such standards specified under this section will not take 
effect until NMFS has published the proposed bycatch rate standards or 
adjustments to such standards in the Federal Register for public comment 
for a period of 30 days, unless NMFS finds for good cause that such 
notification and public comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or 
contrary to the public interest.
    (ii) Comment after notification. If NMFS decides, for good cause, 
that bycatch rate standards or adjustments to such standards are to be 
made effective without affording a prior opportunity for public comment, 
public comments on the necessity for, and extent of, bycatch rate 
standards or adjustments to such standards will be received by the 
Regional Administrator for a period of 15 days after the effective date 
of notification.
    (iii) Public inspection of data. During any such 15-day period, the 
Regional Administrator will make available for public inspection, during 
business hours, the aggregate data upon which bycatch rate standards or 
adjustments to such standards were based.
    (iv) Written comments. If written comments are received during any 
such 15-day period that oppose or protest bycatch rate standards or 
adjustments to such standards issued under this section, NMFS will 
reconsider the necessity for the bycatch standards or adjustment to such 
standards and, as soon as practicable after that reconsideration, will 
either--
    (A) Publish in the Federal Register notification of continued 
effectiveness of bycatch rate standards or adjustment to such standards, 
responding to comments received; or
    (B) Modify or rescind bycatch rate standards or adjustment to such 
standards.
    (6) Notification of adjustment to bycatch rate standards. 
Notification of adjustments to bycatch rate standards issued by NMFS 
under paragraph (f)(3) of this section will include the following 
information:
    (i) A description of the adjustment to one or more bycatch rate 
standards specified for a fishery.
    (ii) The reasons for the adjustment and the determinations required 
under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (iii) The effective date and any termination date of such 
adjustment. If no termination date is specified, the adjustment will 
remain in effect until revised by subsequent notification in the Federal 
Register.
    (7) Vessel bycatch rates--(i) Observed data. For purposes of this 
section, observed data collected for each haul sampled during a day will 
include: Date; Federal reporting area where trawl gear for the haul was 
retrieved; total round weight of groundfish, in metric tons in the 
portion of the haul sampled by groundfish species or species group for 
which a TAC has been specified under Sec. 679.20; and total round weight 
of halibut, in kilograms, in the portion of the haul sampled. Observer 
data from the BSAI trawl fisheries also will include the total number of 
red king crab in the portion of the haul sampled.
    (ii) Observer sampling procedures. (A) NMFS will randomly 
predetermine the hauls to be sampled by an observer during the time the 
observer is on a vessel.
    (B) An observer will take samples at random from throughout the 
haul, and take samples prior to sorting of the haul by the crew for 
processing or discarding of the catch.
    (C) An observer will sample a minimum of 100 kg of fish from each 
haul sampled.
    (D) While an observer is at sea, the observer will report to NMFS, 
on at least a weekly basis, the data for sampled hauls.

[[Page 519]]

    (E) Upon request, the observer will allow the vessel operator to see 
all observed data set forth under paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section 
that the observer submits to NMFS.
    (8) Determination of individual vessel bycatch rates. For each 
vessel, the Regional Administrator will aggregate from sampled hauls the 
observed data collected during a weekly reporting period on the total 
round weight, in metric tons, of each groundfish species or species 
group for which a TAC has been specified under Sec. 679.20 to determine 
to which of the fisheries described in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this 
section the vessel should be assigned for that week.
    (i) Vessel assignment to fisheries--(A) BSAI catcher/processors. 
Catcher/proc- essors will be assigned to fisheries at the end of each 
weekly reporting period based on the round-weight equivalent of the 
retained groundfish catch composition reported on a vessel's WPR that is 
submitted to the Regional Administrator under Sec. 679.5.
    (B) BSAI catcher vessel delivery in Federal waters. Catcher vessels 
that deliver to motherships in Federal waters during a weekly reporting 
period will be assigned to fisheries based on the round-weight 
equivalent of the retained groundfish catch composition reported on the 
WPR submitted to the Regional Administrator for that week by the 
mothership under Sec. 679.5.
    (C) BSAI catcher vessel delivery in Alaska State waters. Catcher 
vessels delivering groundfish to shoreside processors or to motherships 
in Alaska State waters during a weekly reporting period will be assigned 
to fisheries based on the round-weight equivalent of the groundfish 
retained by the processor and reported on an ADF&G fish ticket as 
required under Alaska State regulations at A.S. 16.05.690.
    (ii) Calculation of monthly bycatch rates--(A) Assigned fishery. At 
the end of each fishing month during which an observer sampled at least 
50 percent of a vessel's total number of trawl hauls retrieved while an 
observer was aboard (as recorded in the vessel's DFL), the Regional 
Administrator will calculate the vessel's bycatch rate based on observed 
data for each fishery to which the vessel was assigned for any weekly 
reporting period during that fishing month.
    (B) Verified observer data. Only observed data that have been 
checked, verified, and analyzed by NMFS will be used to calculate vessel 
bycatch rates for purposes of this section.
    (C) Calculation. The bycatch rate of a vessel for a fishery defined 
under paragraph (f)(2) of this section during a fishing month is a ratio 
of halibut to groundfish that is calculated by using the total round 
weight of halibut (in kilograms), or total number of red king crab, in 
samples during all weekly reporting periods in which the vessel was 
assigned to that fishery and the total round weight of the groundfish 
(in metric tons) for which a TAC has been specified under Sec. 679.20 in 
samples taken during all such periods.
    (9) Compliance with bycatch rate standards. A vessel has exceeded a 
bycatch rate standard for a fishery if the vessel's bycatch rate for a 
fishing month, as calculated under paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section 
exceeds the bycatch rate standard established for that fishery under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

the card was issued.
    (3) Catches of sablefish in excess of the maximum retainable bycatch 
amounts and catches made without IFQ must be treated in the same manner 
as prohibited species as defined at Sec. 679.21(b).
    (h) Stand down requirements for trawl catcher vessels transiting 
between the BSAI and GOA.

Sec. 679.24  Gear limitations.

    Regulations pertaining to vessel and gear markings are set forth in 
this section and as prescribed in the annual management measures 
published in the Federal Register pursuant to Sec. 300.62 of chapter III 
of this title.
    (a) Marking of gear--longline marker buoys. (1) All longline marker 
buoys carried on board or used by any vessel regulated under this part 
shall be marked with the following:
    (i) The vessel's name; and
    (ii) The vessel's Federal fisheries permit number; or
    (iii) The vessel's registration number.
    (2) Markings shall be in characters at least 4 inches (10.16 cm) in 
height and 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) in width in a contrasting color visible 
above the water line and shall be maintained so the markings are clearly 
visible.
    (b) Gear restrictions--(1) Pots--(i) Biodegradable panel. Each pot 
used to fish for groundfish must be equipped with a biodegradable panel 
at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in length that is parallel to, and within 
6 inches (15.24 cm) of, the bottom of the pot, and that is sewn up with 
untreated cotton thread of no larger size than No. 30.
    (ii) Tunnel opening. Each pot used to fish for groundfish must be 
equipped with rigid tunnel openings that are no wider than 9 inches 
(22.86 cm) and no higher than 9 inches (22.86 cm), or soft tunnel 
openings with dimensions that are no wider than 9 inches (22.86 cm).
    (iii) Longline pot gear. Any person using longline pot gear must 
treat any catch of groundfish as a prohibited species, except:
    (A) In the Aleutian Islands subarea.
    (B) While directed fishing for sablefish in the Bering Sea subarea, 
except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Net-sounder device. Each person trawling in any GOA area limited 
to pelagic trawling under Sec. 679.22 must maintain on that trawl a 
properly functioning, recording net-sounder device, and must retain all 
net-sounder recordings on board the fishing vessel during the fishing 
year.
    (3) Trawl footrope. No person trawling in any GOA area limited to 
pelagic trawling under Sec. 679.22 may allow the footrope of that trawl 
to be in contact with the seabed for more than 10 percent of the period 
of any tow, as indicated by the net-sounder device.
    (c) Gear restrictions for sablefish--(1) Gear allocations. Gear 
allocations of sablefish TAC are set out under Sec. 679.20.
    (2) GOA Eastern Area--(i) General. (A) No person may use any gear 
other than

[[Page 524]]

hook-and-line and trawl gear when fishing for sablefish in the GOA 
Eastern Area.
    (B) No person may use any gear other than hook-and-line gear to 
engage in directed fishing for sablefish.
    (ii) Sablefish as prohibited species--(A) Trawl gear. When operators 
of vessels using trawl gear have harvested 5 percent of the TAC for 
sablefish in the GOA Eastern Regulatory Area during any year, further 
trawl catches of sablefish must be treated as prohibited species as 
provided by Sec. 679.21(b).
    (B) Other gear. Operators of vessels using gear types other than 
those specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section in the GOA 
Eastern Regulatory Area must treat any catch of sablefish as a 
prohibited species as provided by Sec. 679.21(b).
    (3) GOA Central and Western Areas; sablefish as prohibited species. 
Operators of vessels using gear types other than hook-and-line and trawl 
gear in the GOA Central and Western Regulatory Areas must treat any 
catch of sablefish in these areas as a prohibited species as provided by 
Sec. 679.21(b).
    (4) BSAI. (i) Operators of vessels using gear types other than hook-
and-line, longline pot, pot-and-line, or trawl gear in the BSAI must 
treat sablefish as a prohibited species as provided by Sec. 679.21(b).
    (ii) Longline pot gear is prohibited in directed fishing for 
sablefish from 0001 hrs, A.l.t., on June 1 until 1200 hrs, A.l.t., on 
June 30.
    (d) Trawl gear test areas--(1) General. For purposes of allowing 
pelagic and nonpelagic trawl fishermen to test trawl fishing gear, NMFS 
may establish, after consulting with the Council, locations for the 
testing of trawl fishing gear in areas that would otherwise be closed to 
trawling.
    (2) Trawl gear testing. For the purposes of this section, ``trawl 
gear testing'' means deploying trawl gear in areas designated in this 
paragraph (d) under the following conditions.
    (i) The codend shall be unzipped while trawl gear testing.
    (ii) Groundfish shall not be possessed on board when trawl gear 
testing.
    (iii) Observers aboard vessels during the time spent trawl gear 
testing shall not fulfill observer requirements at subpart E of this 
part.
    (3) Criteria. The establishment of test areas must comply with the 
following criteria:
    (i) Depth and bottom type must be suitable for testing the 
particular gear type.
    (ii) The areas must be outside State waters.
    (iii) The areas must be in locations not normally closed to fishing 
with that gear type.
    (iv) The areas must be in locations that are not usually fished 
heavily by that gear type.
    (v) The areas must not be within a designated Steller sea lion 
protection area at any time of the year.
    (4) Test areas. Trawl gear testing is allowed in the following areas 
(Figure 7 of this part) bounded by straight lines connecting the 
coordinates in the order listed, at all times:

    (e) Seabird avoidance gear and methods for hook-and-line vessels 
fishing for groundfish--(1) Applicability. The operator of a vessel that 
is required to obtain a Federal fisheries permit under Sec. 679.4(b)(1) 
must comply with the seabird avoidance measures in paragraphs (e)(2) and 
(e)(3) of this section while fishing for groundfish with hook-and-line 
gear in the BSAI, in the GOA, or in waters of the State of Alaska that 
are shoreward of the BSAI and the GOA.
    (2) The operator of a vessel described in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section must conduct fishing operations in the following manner:

[[Page 525]]

    (i) Use hooks that when baited, sink as soon as they are put in the 
water.
    (ii) If offal is discharged while gear is being set or hauled, it 
must be discharged in a manner that distracts seabirds from baited 
hooks, to the extent practicable. The discharge site on board a vessel 
must be either aft of the hauling station or on the opposite side of the 
vessel from the hauling station.
    (iii) Make every reasonable effort to ensure that birds brought on 
board alive are released alive and that wherever possible, hooks are 
removed without jeopardizing the life of the birds.
    (3) For a vessel greater than or equal to 26 ft (7.9 m) LOA, the 
operator of that vessel described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
must employ one or more of the following seabird avoidance measures:
    (i) Tow a streamer line or lines during deployment of gear to 
prevent birds from taking hooks;
    (ii) Tow a buoy, board, stick or other device during deployment of 
gear, at a distance appropriate to prevent birds from taking hooks. 
Multiple devices may be employed;
    (iii) Deploy hooks underwater through a lining tube at a depth 
sufficient to prevent birds from settling on hooks during deployment of 
gear; or
    (iv) Deploy gear only during the hours specified below, using only 
the minimum vessel's lights necessary for safety.

Hours That Hook-and-Line Gear Can Be Deployed for Specified Longitudes According to Paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of This

Sec. 679.25  Inseason adjustments.

    (a) General--(1) Types of adjustments. Inseason adjustments issued 
by NMFS under this section include:
    (i) Closure, extension, or opening of a season in all or part of a 
management area.
    (ii) Modification of the allowable gear to be used in all or part of 
a management area.
    (iii) Adjustment of TAC and PSC limits.
    (iv) Interim closures of statistical areas, or portions thereof, to 
directed fishing for specified groundfish species.
    (2) Determinations. (i) Any inseason adjustment taken under 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section must be based on a 
determination that such adjustments are necessary to prevent:
    (A) Overfishing of any species or stock of fish or shellfish;
    (B) Harvest of a TAC for any groundfish species or the taking of a 
PSC limit for any prohibited species that, on the basis of the best 
available scientific information, is found by NMFS to be incorrectly 
specified; or

[[Page 526]]

    (C) Underharvest of a TAC or gear share of a TAC for any groundfish 
species when catch information indicates that the TAC or gear share has 
not been reached.
    (ii) Any inseason closure of a statistical area, or portion thereof, 
under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, must be based upon a 
determination that such closures are necessary to prevent:
    (A) A continuation of relatively high bycatch rates of prohibited 
species specified under Sec. 679.21(b) in a statistical area, or portion 
thereof;
    (B) Take of an excessive share of PSC limits or bycatch allowances 
established under Sec. 679.21(d) and (e) by vessels fishing in a 
statistical area, or portion thereof;
    (C) Closure of one or more directed fisheries for groundfish due to 
excessive prohibited species bycatch rates occurring in a specified 
fishery operating within all or part of a statistical area; or
    (D) Premature attainment of established PSC limits or bycatch 
allowances and associated loss of opportunity to harvest the groundfish 
OY.
    (iii) The selection of the appropriate inseason management 
adjustments under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section must be 
from the following authorized management measures and must be based upon 
a determination by the Regional Administrator that the management 
adjustment selected is the least restrictive necessary to achieve the 
purpose of the adjustment:
    (A) Any gear modification that would protect the species in need of 
conservation, but that would still allow other fisheries to continue;
    (B) An inseason adjustment that would allow other fisheries to 
continue in noncritical areas and time periods;
    (C) Closure of a management area and season to all groundfish 
fishing; or
    (D) Reopening of a management area or season to achieve the TAC or 
gear share of a TAC for any of the target species or the ``other 
species category.
    (iv) The adjustment of a TAC or PSC limit for any species under 
paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section must be based upon a determination 
by the Regional Administrator that the adjustment is based upon the best 
available scientific information concerning the biological stock status 
of the species in question and that the currently specified TAC or PSC 
limit is incorrect. Any adjustment to a TAC or PSC limit must be 
reasonably related to the change in biological stock status.
    (v) The inseason closure of a statistical area, or a portion 
thereof, under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section shall not extend 
beyond a 60-day period unless information considered under paragraph (b) 
of this section warrants an extended closure period. Any closure of a 
statistical area, or portion thereof, to reduce prohibited species 
bycatch rates requires a determination by the Regional Administrator 
that the closure is based on the best available scientific information 
concerning the seasonal distribution and abundance of prohibited species 
and bycatch rates of prohibited species associated with various 
groundfish fisheries.
    (b) Data. All information relevant to one or more of the following 
factors may be considered in making the determinations required under 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:
    (1) The effect of overall fishing effort within a statistical area;
    (2) Catch per unit of effort and rate of harvest;
    (3) Relative distribution and abundance of stocks of groundfish 
species and prohibited species within all or part of a statistical area;
    (4) Condition of a stock in all or part of a statistical area;
    (5) Inseason prohibited species bycatch rates observed in groundfish 
fisheries in all or part of a statistical area;
    (6) Historical prohibited species bycatch rates observed in 
groundfish fisheries in all or part of a statistical area;
    (7) Economic impacts on fishing businesses affected; or
    (8) Any other factor relevant to the conservation and management of 
groundfish species or any incidentally caught species that are 
designated as prohibited species or for which a PSC limit has been 
specified.
    (c) Procedure. (1) No inseason adjustment issued under this section 
will take effect until--

[[Page 527]]

    (i) NMFS has filed the proposed adjustment for public inspection 
with the Office of the Federal Register; and
    (ii) NMFS has published the proposed adjustment in the Federal 
Register for public comment for a period of 30 days before it is made 
final, unless NMFS finds for good cause that such notification and 
public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.
    (2) If NMFS decides, for good cause, that an adjustment is to be 
made without affording a prior opportunity for public comment, public 
comments on the necessity for, and extent of, the adjustment will be 
received by the Regional Administrator for a period of 15 days after the 
effective date of notification.
    (3) During any such 15-day period, the Regional Administrator will 
make available for public inspection, during business hours, the 
aggregate data upon which an adjustment was based.
    (4) If written comments are received during any such 15-day period 
that oppose or protest an inseason adjustment issued under this section, 
NMFS will reconsider the necessity for the adjustment and, as soon as 
practicable after that reconsideration, will either--
    (i) Publish in the Federal Register notification of continued 
effectiveness of the adjustment, responding to comments received; or
    (ii) Modify or rescind the adjustment.
    (5) Notifications of inseason adjustments issued by NMFS under 
paragraph (a) of this section will include the following information:
    (i) A description of the management adjustment.
    (ii) Reasons for the adjustment and the determinations required 
under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) The effective date and any termination date of such 
adjustment. If no termination date is specified, the adjustment will 
terminate on the last day of the fishing year.

applicable technical and performance standards in appendix A to this 
part and the laboratory tests in the annex to appendix A to this part 
have been met.
    (iv) Verification of test results. Verification that a scale meets 
the laboratory evaluation and testing requirements in appendix A of this 
part and each of the influence quantity and disturbance tests as 
specified in the annex to appendix A to this part:
    (A) Test results and data on forms supplied by NMFS;
    (B) National Type Evaluation Program (NTEP) Certificates of 
Conformance, test results and data for a component of a scale or for the 
entire device. NTEP Certificates of Conformance, test results, and data 
may be submitted only in lieu of the specific influence factor tests 
conducted to obtain the NTEP Certificates of Conformance. Additional 
information must be submitted to verify compliance with the laboratory 
tests that are not performed under the NTEP; and/or
    (C) International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) 
Certificates of Conformance, test results and data.
    (2) Inspection of at-sea scales--(i) What is an inspection? An 
inspection is a visual assessment and test of a scale after it is 
installed on the vessel and while the vessel is tied up at a dock and 
not under power at sea to determine if the scale meets all of the 
applicable performance and technical requirements in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section and in appendix A to this part. A scale will be approved by 
the inspector if it meets all of the applicable performance and 
technical requirements in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and appendix 
A to this part.
    (ii) How often must a scale be inspected? Each scale must be 
inspected and approved before the vessel may participate in any fishery 
requiring the weighing of catch at sea with an approved scale. Each 
scale must be reinspected within 12 months of the date of the most 
recent inspection.

[[Page 532]]

    (iii) Who may perform scale inspections? Scales must be inspected by 
a scale inspector authorized by NMFS. A list of scale inspectors 
authorized by NMFS is available from the Regional Administrator upon 
request. NMFS authorizes two types of scale inspectors:
    (A) Inspectors from an agency designated by NMFS. Inspectors 
employed by a weights and measures agency designated by NMFS to perform 
scale inspections on behalf of NMFS. Scale inspections by such 
inspectors are paid for by NMFS.
    (B) Inspectors from other agencies. Inspectors employed by a U.S., 
state, or local weights and measures agency other than the weights and 
measures agency designated by NMFS and meeting the following 
requirements:
    (1) The inspector successfully completes training conducted by a 
scale inspector from the weights and measures agency designated by NMFS 
to perform scale inspections on behalf of NMFS. The training consists of 
observing a scale inspection conducted by a scale inspector designated 
by NMFS and conducting an inspection under the supervision of a scale 
inspector designated by NMFS. The inspector must obtain this training 
for each type of scale inspected.
    (2) The inspector notifies NMFS in writing that he/she meets the 
requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) prior to conducting any 
inspections.
    (3) Inspectors from agencies other than the weights and measures 
agency designated by NMFS to perform scale inspections on behalf of NMFS 
must notify the Regional Administrator of the date, time, and location 
of the scale inspection at least 3 working days before the inspection is 
conducted so that NMFS staff may have the opportunity to observe the 
inspection.
    (iv) How does a vessel owner arrange for a scale inspection? The 
time and place of the inspection may be arranged by contacting the 
authorized scale inspectors. Vessel owners must request a scale 
inspection at least 10 working days in advance of the requested 
inspection by contacting an authorized scale inspector at the address 
indicated on the list of authorized inspectors.
    (v) Where will scale inspections be conducted? Scale inspections by 
inspectors paid by NMFS will be conducted on vessels tied up at docks in 
Dutch Harbor, Alaska, and in the Puget Sound area of Washington State.
    (vi) Responsibilities of the vessel owner during a scale inspection. 
After the vessel owner has installed a model of scale that is on the 
Regional Administrator's list of scales eligible to be approved for 
weighing catch at sea, the vessel owner must:
    (A) Make the vessel and scale available for inspection by a scale 
inspector authorized by the Regional Administrator.
    (B) Provide a copy of the scale manual supplied by the scale 
manufacturer to the inspector at the beginning of the inspection.
    (C) Transport test weights, test material, and equipment required to 
perform the test to and from the inspector's vehicle and the location on 
the vessel where the scale is installed.
    (D) Apply test weights to the scale or convey test materials across 
the scale, if requested by the scale inspector.
    (E) Assist the scale inspector in performing the scale inspection 
and testing.
    (vii) Scale inspection report. A scale is approved for use when the 
scale inspector completes and signs a scale inspection report form 
verifying that the scale meets all of the requirements specified in this 
paragraph (b)(2) and appendix A to this part. Inspectors must use the 
scale inspection report form supplied by the weights and measures agency 
designated by NMFS to perform scale inspections on behalf of NMFS. The 
scale inspector must provide the original of this inspection report form 
to the vessel owner and a copy to NMFS. NMFS will maintain a list of all 
scales for which the inspection report form has been received and that 
are approved for use. The vessel owner is not required to submit the 
scale inspection report form to NMFS. However, the vessel owner must 
maintain a copy of the report form on board the vessel at all times when 
the processor or vessel is required to use a scale approved under this 
section. The scale inspection report form must be made

[[Page 533]]

available to the observer, NMFS personnel or an authorized officer, upon 
request. When in use, scales for which a scale inspection form has been 
completed and signed must also meet requirements described in paragraphs 
(b)(3) through (b)(6) of this section.
    (3) At-sea scale tests. The vessel owner must ensure that the vessel 
operator tests each scale or scale system used to weigh total catch one 
time during each 24-hour period in which fish are weighed on the scale 
to verify that the scale meets the MPEs specified in this paragraph 
(b)(3).
    (i) Belt scales and automatic hopper scales. (A) The MPE in the 
daily at-sea scale tests is plus or minus 3 percent of the known weight 
of the test material.
    (B) Test procedure. A material test must be conducted by weighing at 
least 400 kg of fish or an alternative material supplied by the scale 
manufacturer on the scale under test. The known weight of the test 
material must be determined by weighing it on a platform scale approved 
for use under paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
    (ii) Platform and hanging scales--(A) Maximum Permissible Error. The 
MPE for platform and hanging scales is plus or minus 0.5 percent of the 
known weight of the test material.
    (B) Test weights. Each test weight must have its weight stamped on 
or otherwise permanently affixed to it. The weight of each test weight 
must be certified by a National Institute of Standards and Technology 
approved metrology laboratory. A copy of the laboratory certification 
documents must be maintained on board the vessel at all times while the 
scale is required. The amount of test weights that must be provided by 
the vessel owner is specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(B)(1) and 
(b)(3)(ii)(B)(2) of this section.
    (1) Platform scales used as observer sampling scales or to determine 
the known weight of test materials. Any combination of test weights that 
will allow the scale to be tested at 10 kg, 25 kg, and 50 kg.
    (2) Scales used to weigh total catch. Test weights equal to the 
largest amount of fish that will be weighed on the scale in one 
weighment.
    (iii) Requirements for all scale tests. (A) Notify the observer at 
least 15 minutes before the time that the test will be conducted, and 
conduct the test while the observer is present.
    (B) Conduct the scale test by placing the test material or test 
weights on or across the scale and recording the following information 
on the at-sea scale test report form:
    (1) Vessel name;
    (2) Month, day, and year of test;
    (3) Time test started to the nearest minute;
    (4) Known weight of test material or test weights;
    (5) Weight of test material or test weights recorded by scale;
    (6) Percent error as determined by subtracting the known weight of 
the test material or test weights from the weight recorded on the scale, 
dividing that amount by the known weight of the test material or test 
weights, and multiplying by 100; and
    (7) Sea conditions at the time of the scale test.
    (C) Maintain the test report form on board the vessel until the end 
of the fishing year during which the tests were conducted, and make the 
report forms available to observers, NMFS personnel, or an authorized 
officer. In addition, the scale test report forms must be retained by 
the vessel owner for 3 years after the end of the fishing year during 
which the tests were performed. All scale test report forms must be 
signed by the vessel operator.
    (4) Scale maintenance. The vessel owner must ensure that the vessel 
operator maintains the scale in proper operating condition throughout 
its use; that adjustments made to the scale are made so as to bring the 
performance errors as close as practicable to a zero value; and that no 
adjustment is made that will cause the scale to weigh fish inaccurately.
    (5) Printed reports from the scale. The vessel owner must ensure 
that the vessel operator provides the printed reports required by this 
paragraph. Printed reports from the scale must be maintained on board 
the vessel until the end of the year during which the reports were made 
and be made available to observers, NMFS personnel, or an authorized 
officer. In addition, printed reports must be retained by the vessel 
owner for 3 years after the end of

[[Page 534]]

the year during which the printouts were made. All printed reports from 
the scale must be signed by the vessel operator.
    (i) Reports of catch weight and cumulative weight. Reports must be 
printed at least once each 24-hour period in which the scale is being 
used to weigh catch or before any information stored in the scale 
computer memory is replaced. The haul or set number recorded on the 
scale print-out must correspond with haul or set numbers recorded in the 
processor's daily cumulative production logbook. Scale weights must not 
be adjusted by the scale operator to account for the perceived weight of 
water, mud, debris, or other materials. The information that must be 
printed is described in Sections 2.3.1.8, 3.3.1.7, and 4.3.1.5 of 
appendix A to this part.
    (ii) Printed report from the audit trail. The printed report must 
include the information specified in sections 2.3.1.8, 3.3.1.7, and 
4.3.1.8 of appendix A to this part. The printed report must be provided 
to the authorized scale inspector at each scale inspection and must also 
be printed at any time upon request of the observer, the scale 
inspector, NMFS staff, or an authorized officer.
    (6) Scale installation requirements. The observer must be able to 
see the product on the scale and the scale indications at the same time.
    (7) Platform scales used as observer sampling scales or to determine 
the known weight of test materials. Platform scales used only as 
observer sampling scales or to determine the known weight of fish for a 
material test of another scale are required to meet all of the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and appendix A to this 
part except sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.1.5 of appendix A to this part 
(printer) or section 4.3.1.8 (audit trail) of appendix A to this part.
    (c) Scales approved by the State of Alaska. Scales used to weigh 
groundfish catch that are also required to be approved by the State of 
Alaska under Alaska Statutes 45.75 must meet the following requirements:
    (1) Verification of approval. The scale must display a valid State 
of Alaska sticker indicating that the scale was inspected and approved 
within the previous 12 months.
    (2) Visibility. The scale and scale display must be visible 
simultaneously to the observer. Observers, NMFS personnel, or an 
authorized officer must be allowed to observe the weighing of fish on 
the scale and be able to read the scale display at all times.
    (3) Printed scale weights. Printouts of the scale weight of each 
haul, set, or delivery must be made available to observers, NMFS 
personnel, or an authorized officer at the time printouts are generated 
and thereafter upon request for the duration of the fishing year. 
Printouts must be retained by the operator or manager as specified in 
Sec. 679.5(a)(15).
    (d) Observer sampling station--(1) Accessibility. All of the 
equipment required for an observer sampling station must be available to 
the observer at all times while a sampling station is required and the 
observer is aboard the vessel, except that the observer sampling scale 
may be used by vessel personnel to conduct material tests of the scale 
used to weigh total catch under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as 
long as the use of the observer's sampling scale by others does not 
interfere with the observer's sampling duties.
    (2) Location--(i) Motherships and catcher/processors or catcher 
vessels using trawl gear. The observer sampling station must be located 
within 4 m of the location from which the observer samples unsorted 
catch. Clear, unobstructed passage must be provided between the observer 
sampling station and the location where the observer samples unsorted 
catch.
    (ii) Vessels using nontrawl gear. The observer sampling station must 
be located within 5 m of the location where fish are brought on board 
the vessel, unless any location within this distance is unsafe for the 
observer. Clear, unobstructed passage must be provided between the 
observer sampling station and the location where the observer samples 
unsorted catch. NMFS will approve an alternative location if the vessel 
owner submits a written proposal describing the alternative location, 
the reasons why a location within 5 m of where fish are brought on board 
the vessel is unsafe, and if the proposed observer sampling station 
meets all

[[Page 535]]

other applicable requirements of this section.
    (3) Minimum work space. The observer must have a working area at 
least 1.8 m wide by 2.5 m long, including the observer's sampling table, 
for sampling and storage of fish to be sampled. The observer must be 
able to stand upright in the area in front of the table and scale.
    (4) Table. The observer sampling station must include a table at 
least 0.6 m deep, 1.2 m wide and 0.9 m high and no more than 1.1 m high. 
The entire surface area of the table must be available for use by the 
observer. Any area used for the observer sampling scale is in addition 
to the minimum space requirements for the table. The observer's sampling 
table must be secured to the floor or wall.
    (5) Observer sampling scale. The observer sampling station must 
include an electronic motion-compensated platform scale with a capacity 
of at least 50 kg located within 1 m of the observer's sampling table. 
The scale must be approved by NMFS under paragraph (b) of this section 
and must meet the maximum permissible error requirement specified in 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section when tested by the observer.
    (6) Other requirements. The sampling station must include floor 
grating, adequate lighting, and a hose that supplies fresh or sea water 
to the observer.
    (7) Requirements for sampling catch. On motherships and catcher/
processors using trawl gear, the conveyor belt conveying unsorted catch 
must have a removable board to allow fish to be diverted from the belt 
directly into the observer's sampling baskets. The diverter board must 
be located after the scale used to weigh total catch so that the 
observer can use this scale to weigh large samples.
    (8) Inspection of the observer sampling station. Each observer 
sampling station must be inspected and approved by NMFS prior to its use 
for the first time and then one time each year within 12 months of the 
date of the most recent inspection with the following exceptions. If the 
observer sampling station is moved or if the space or equipment 
available to the observer is reduced or removed, the observer sampling 
station inspection report issued under this section is no longer valid, 
and the observer sampling station must be reinspected and approved by 
NMFS. Inspection of the observer sampling station is in addition to 
inspection of the at-sea scales by an authorized scale inspector 
required at paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (i) How does a vessel owner arrange for an observer sampling station 
inspection? The time and place of the inspection may be arranged by 
submitting to NMFS a written request for an inspection. Inspections will 
be scheduled no later than 10 working days after NMFS receives a 
complete application for an inspection, including the following 
information:
    (A) Name and signature of the person submitting the application, and 
the date of the application.
    (B) Street address, business address, telephone number, and fax 
number of the person submitting the application.
    (C) Whether the vessel or processor has received an observer 
sampling scale inspection before and, if so, the date of the most recent 
inspection report.
    (D) Vessel name.
    (E) Federal fishery permit number.
    (F) Location of vessel where sampling station inspection is 
requested to occur, including street address and city.
    (G) For catcher/processors using trawl gear and motherships, a 
diagram drawn to scale showing the location(s) where all CDQ and PSQ 
will be weighed, the location where observers will sample unsorted 
catch, the location of the observer sampling station as described at 
paragraph (d) of this section, including the observer sampling scale, 
the name of the manufacturer, model of the scale to weigh total catch, 
and the observer sampling scale.
    (H) For all other vessels, a diagram drawn to scale showing the 
location(s) where catch comes on board the vessel, the location where 
observers will sample unsorted catch, the location of the observer 
sampling station, including the observer sampling scale, and the name of 
the manufacturer and model of the observer sampling scale.

[[Page 536]]

    (I) For all vessels, a copy of the most recent scale inspection 
report issued under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Where will observer sampling station inspections be conducted? 
Inspections will be conducted on vessels tied up at docks in Dutch 
Harbor, Alaska, and in the Puget Sound area of Washington State.
    (iii) Observer sampling station inspection report. An observer 
sampling station inspection report, valid for 12 months from the date it 
is signed by NMFS, will be issued to the vessel owner if the observer 
sampling station meets the requirements in this paragraph (d). The 
vessel owner must maintain a current observer sampling station 
inspection report on board the vessel at all times when the vessel is 
required to provide an observer sampling station approved for use under 
this paragraph (d). The observer sampling station inspection report must 
be made available to the observer, NMFS personnel, or to an authorized 
officer upon request.
    (e) Certified bins for volumetric estimates of catch weight--
    (1) Certification. The information required in this paragraph (e) 
must be prepared, dated, and signed by a licensed engineer with no 
financial interest in fishing, fish processing, or fish tendering 
vessels. Complete bin certification documents must be submitted to the 
Regional Administrator prior to harvesting or receiving groundfish from 
a fishery in which certified bins are required and must be on board the 
vessel and available to the observer at all times.
    (2) Specifications--(i) Measurement and marking. The volume of each 
bin must be determined by accurate measurement of the internal 
dimensions of the bin. The internal walls of the bin must be permanently 
marked and numbered in 10-cm increments indicating the level of fish in 
the bin in cm. All marked increments and numerals must be readable from 
the outside of the bin through a viewing port or hatch at all times. 
Marked increments are not required on the wall in which the viewing port 
is located, unless such increments are necessary to determine the level 
of fish in the bin from another viewing port. Bins must be lighted in a 
manner that allows marked increments to be read from the outside of the 
bin by an observer or authorized officer. For bin certification 
documents dated after July 6, 1998, the numerals at the 10-cm increment 
marks must be at least 4 cm high.
    (ii) Viewing ports. Each bin must have a viewing port or ports from 
which the internal bin markings and numerals on all walls of the bin can 
be seen from the outside of the bin, except that bin markings and 
numerals are not required on the wall in which the viewing port is 
placed, if that wall cannot be seen from any other viewing port in the 
bin.
    (3) Information required. For bin certification documents submitted 
after July 6, 1998, the person certifying the bins must provide:
    (i) The vessel name;
    (ii) The date the engineer measured the bins and witnessed the 
location of the marked increments and numerals;
    (iii) A diagram, to scale, of each bin showing the location of the 
marked increments on each internal wall of the bin, the location, and 
dimensions of each viewing port or hatch, and any additional information 
needed to estimate the volume of fish in the bin;
    (iv) Tables indicating the volume of each certified bin in cubic 
meters for each 10-cm increment marked on the sides of the bins;
    (v) Instructions for determining the volume of fish in each bin from 
the marked increments and table; and
    (vi) The person's name and signature and the date on which the 
completed bin certification documents were signed.
    (4) Recertification. The bin's volume and the marked and numbered 
increments must be recertified if the bin is modified in a way that 
changes its size or shape or if marking strips or marked increments are 
moved or added.
    (5) Operational requirements--(i) Placement of catch in certified 
bins. All catch must be placed in a bin certified under this paragraph 
(e) to estimate total catch weight prior to sorting. Refrigerated 
seawater tanks may be used for volumetric estimates only if the tanks 
comply with all other requirements of this paragraph (e). No adjustments 
of

[[Page 537]]

volume will be made for the presence of water in the bin or tank.
    (ii) Prior notification. Vessel operators must notify observers 
prior to any removal of fish from or addition of fish to each bin used 
for volumetric measurements of catch so that an observer may make bin 
volume estimates prior to fish being removed from or added to the bin. 
Once a volumetric estimate has been made, additional fish may not be 
added to the bin until at least half the original volume has been 
removed. Fish may not be removed from or added to a bin used for 
volumetric estimates of catch weight until an observer indicates that 
bin volume estimates have been completed and any samples of catch 
required by the observer have been taken.
    (iii) Fish from separate hauls or deliveries from separate 
harvesting vessels may not be mixed in any bin used for volumetric 
measurements of catch.
    (iv) The bins must not be filled in a manner that obstructs the 
viewing ports or prevents the observer from seeing the level of fish 
throughout the bin.

of halibut CDQ that are not required to have a Federal processor permit 
under Sec. 679.4(f), including the name of the buyer or processor, 
mailing address, telephone number, and location where halibut CDQ will 
be landed.
    (ii) Sources of data or methods for estimating CDQ and PSQ catch. 
The sources of data or methods that will be used to determine catch 
weight of CDQ and PSQ for each vessel or processor proposed as eligible 
under the CDP. For each vessel or processor, the CDP must specify 
whether the NMFS' standard sources of data set forth at 
Sec. 679.32(d)(2) or some other alternative will be used. For catcher 
vessels using nontrawl gear, the CDP must also specify whether the 
vessel will be retaining all groundfish CDQ catch (Option 1) or will be 
discarding some groundfish CDQ catch at sea (Option 2). The qualified 
applicant may propose the use of an alternative method such as the 
sorting and weighing of all catch by species on processor vessels or 
using larger sample sizes than could be collected by one observer. NMFS 
will review the proposal and approve it or notify the qualified 
applicant in writing if the proposed alternative does not meet these 
requirements. The qualified applicant may remove the vessel or processor 
for which the alternative method is proposed from the proposed CDP to 
facilitate approval of the CDP and add the vessel or processor to the 
approved CDP by substantial amendment at a later date. Alternatives to 
the requirement for a certified scale or an observer sampling station 
may not be proposed. NMFS will review the alternative proposal to 
determine if it meets all of the following requirements:
    (A) The alternative proposed must provide equivalent or better 
estimates than use of the NMFS standard data source would provide and 
the estimates must be independently verifiable;
    (B) Each haul or set on an observed vessel must be able to be 
sampled by an observer for species composition;
    (C) Any proposal to sort catch before it is weighed must assure that 
the sorting and weighing process will be monitored by an observer; and
    (D) The time required for the CDQ observer to complete sampling, 
data recording, and data communication duties shall not exceed 12 hours 
in each 24-hour period and the CDQ observer is required to sample no 
more than 9 hours in each 24-hour period.
    (iii) Amendments to the list of eligible vessels and processors. The 
list of eligible vessels and processors may be amended by submitting the 
information required in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section as 
an amendment to the approved CDP. A technical amendment may be used to 
remove any vessel

[[Page 540]]

from a CDP, to add any vessel to a CDP if the CDQ group will use NMFS' 
standard sources of data to determine CDQ and PSQ catch for the vessel, 
or to add any vessel to a CDP for which an alternative method of 
determining CDQ and PSQ catch has been approved by NMFS under an 
approved CDP for another CDQ group. A substantial amendment must be used 
to add a vessel to an approved CDP if the CDQ group submits a proposed 
alternative method of determining CDQ and PSQ catch for NMFS review.
    (6) CDQ planning--(i) Transition plan. A proposed CDP must include 
an overall plan and schedule for transition from reliance on CDQ 
allocations to self-sufficiency in fisheries. The plan for transition to 
self-sufficiency must be based on the qualified applicant's long-term 
revenue stream without CDQs.
    (ii) Post-allocation plan. [Reserved]
    (b) Public hearings on CDQ application. When the CDQ application 
period has ended, the State must hold a public hearing to obtain 
comments on the proposed CDPs from all interested persons. The hearing 
must cover the substance and content of proposed CDPs so that the 
general public, particularly the affected parties, have a reasonable 
opportunity to understand the impact of the proposed CDPs. The State 
must provide reasonable public notification of hearing date and 
location. At the time of public notification of the hearing, the State 
must make available for public review all State materials pertinent to 
the hearing.
    (c) Council consultation. Before the State sends its recommendations 
for approval of proposed CDPs to NMFS, the State must consult with the 
Council and make available, upon request, the proposed CDPs that are not 
part of the State's recommendations.
    (d) Review and approval of proposed CDPs. The State must transmit 
the proposed CDPs and its recommendations for approval of each of the 
proposed CDPs to NMFS, along with the findings and the rationale for the 
recommendations, by October 15 of the year prior to the first year of 
the proposed CDP, except in 1998, when CDPs for the 1998 through 2000 
multispecies groundfish CDQs must be submitted by July 6, 1998. The 
State shall determine in its recommendations for approval of the 
proposed CDPs that each proposed CDP meets all applicable requirements 
of this part. Upon receipt by NMFS of the proposed CDPs and the State's 
recommendations for approval, NMFS will review the proposed CDPs and 
approve those that it determines meet all applicable requirements. NMFS 
shall approve or disapprove the State's recommendations within 45 days 
of their receipt. In the event of approval of the CDP, NMFS will notify 
the State in writing that the proposed CDP is approved by NMFS and is 
consistent with all requirements for CDPs. If NMFS finds that a proposed 
CDP does not comply with the requirements of this part, NMFS must so 
advise the State in writing, including the reasons thereof. The State 
may submit a revised proposed CDP along with revised recommendations for 
approval to NMFS.
    (e) Transfer. CDQ groups may request that NMFS transfer CDQ 
allocations, CDQ, PSQ allocations, or PSQ from one group to another by 
each group filing an appropriate amendment to its CDP. Transfers of CDQ 
and PSQ allocations must be in whole integer percentages, and transfers 
of CDQ and PSQ must be in whole integer amounts. If NMFS approves both 
amendments, NMFS will make the requested transfer(s) by decreasing the 
account balance of the CDQ group from which the CDQ or PSQ species is 
transferred by the amount transferred and by increasing the account 
balance of the CDQ group receiving the transferred CDQ or PSQ species by 
the amount transferred. NMFS will not approve transfers to cover 
overages of CDQ or PSQ.
    (1) CDQ allocation. CDQ groups may request that NMFS transfer any or 
all of one group's CDQ allocation to another by each group filing an 
amendment to its CDP through the CDP substantial amendment process set 
forth at paragraph (g)(4) of this section. The CDQ allocation will be 
transferred as of January 1 of the calendar year following the calendar 
year NMFS approves the amendments of both groups and is effective for 
the duration of the CDPs.
    (2) CDQ. CDQ groups may request that NMFS transfer any or all of one

[[Page 541]]

group's CDQ for a calendar year to another by each group filing an 
appropriate amendment to its CDP. If the amount to be transferred is 10 
percent or less of a group's initial CDQ amount for that year, that 
group's request may be made through the CDP technical amendment process 
set forth at paragraph (g)(5) of this section. If the amount to be 
transferred is greater than 10 percent of a group's initial CDQ amount 
for the year, that group's request must be made through the CDP 
substantial amendment process set forth at paragraph (g)(4) of this 
section. The CDQ will be transferred as of the date NMFS approves the 
amendments of both groups and is effective only for the remainder of the 
calendar year in which the transfer occurs.
    (3) PSQ allocation. CDQ groups may request that NMFS transfer any or 
all of one group's PSQ allocation to another CDQ group through the CDP 
substantial amendment process set forth at paragraph (g)(4) of this 
section. Each group's request must be part of a request for the transfer 
of a CDQ allocation, and the requested amount of PSQ allocation must be 
the amount reasonably required for bycatch needs during the harvesting 
of the CDQ. Requests for the transfer of a PSQ allocation may be 
submitted to NMFS from January 1 through January 31. Requests for 
transfers of a PSQ allocation will not be accepted by NMFS at other 
times of the year. The PSQ allocation will be transferred as of January 
1 of the calendar year following the calendar year NMFS approves the 
amendments of both groups and is effective for the duration of the CDPs.
    (4) PSQ. CDQ groups may request that NMFS transfer any or all of one 
group's PSQ for one calendar year to another by each group filing an 
amendment to its CDP through the CDP substantial amendment process set 
forth at paragraph (g)(4) of this section. Each group's request must be 
part of a request for the transfer of CDQ, and the requested amount of 
PSQ must be the amount reasonably required for bycatch needs during the 
harvesting of the CDQ. Requests for the transfer of PSQ may be submitted 
to NMFS from January 1 through January 31. Requests for transfers of PSQ 
will not be accepted by NMFS at other times of the year. The PSQ will be 
transferred as of the date NMFS approves the amendments of both groups 
and is effective only for the remainder of the calendar year in which 
the transfer occurs.
    (f) CDQ group responsibilities. A CDQ group's responsibilities 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Direct and supervise all activities of the managing 
organization;
    (2) Maintain the capability to communicate with all vessels 
harvesting its CDQ and PSQ at all times;
    (3) Monitor the catch of each CDQ or PSQ;
    (4) Submit the CDQ catch report described at Sec. 679.5(n)(2);
    (5) Ensure that no CDQ, halibut PSQ, or crab PSQ is exceeded;
    (6) Ensure that the CDQ group's CDQ harvesting vessels and CDQ 
processors will:
    (i) Provide observer coverage, equipment, and operational 
requirements for CDQ catch monitoring;
    (ii) Provide for the communication of observer data from their 
vessels to NMFS and the CDQ representative;
    (iii) Maintain contact with the CDQ group for which it is harvesting 
CDQ and PSQ;
    (iv) Cease fishing operations when requested by the CDQ group; and
    (v) Comply with all requirements of this part while harvesting or 
processing CDQ species.
    (7) Comply with all requirements of this part.
    (g) Monitoring of CDPs--(1) Annual progress report. (i) The State 
must submit to NMFS, by October 31 of each year, an annual progress 
report for the previous calendar year for each CDP.
    (ii) Annual progress reports must be organized on a project-by-
project basis and include information for each CDQ project in the CDP 
describing how each scheduled milestone in the CDP has been met, and an 
estimation by the State of whether each of the CDQ projects in the CDP 
is likely to be successful.
    (iii) The annual report must include a description by the State of 
any problems or issues in the CDP that the State encountered during the 
annual report year.

[[Page 542]]

    (2) Annual budget report. (i) Each CDQ group must submit to NMFS an 
annual budget report by December 15 preceding the year for which the 
annual budget applies.
    (ii) An annual budget report is a detailed estimate of the income 
from the CDQ project and of the expenditures for each subsidiary, 
division, joint venture, partnership, investment activity, or CDQ 
project as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section for a 
calendar year. A CDQ group must identify the administrative costs for 
each CDQ project. The CDQ group's total administrative costs will be 
considered a separate CDQ project.
    (iii) An annual budget report is approved upon receipt by NMFS, 
unless disapproved by NMFS in writing by December 31. If disapproved, 
the annual budget report will be returned to the CDQ group for revision 
and resubmittal to NMFS.
    (3) Annual budget reconciliation report. A CDQ group must reconcile 
its annual budget by May 30 of the year following the year for which the 
annual budget applied. Reconciliation is an accounting of the annual 
budget's estimated income and expenditures with the actual income and 
expenditures, including the variance in dollars and variance in 
percentage for each CDQ project that is described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section.
    (4) Substantial amendments. A CDP is a working business plan and 
must be kept up to date.
    (i) Substantial amendments to a CDP require a written request by the 
CDQ group to the State and NMFS for approval of the amendment. The State 
must forward the amendment to NMFS with a recommendation as to whether 
it should be approved.
    (ii) NMFS will notify the State in writing of the approval or 
disapproval of the amendment within 30 days of receipt of both the 
amendment and the State's recommendation. Except for substantial 
amendments for the transfer of CDQ and PSQ, which are effective only for 
the remainder of the calendar year in which the transfer occurs (see 
paragraphs (e)(2) and (4) of this section), once a substantial amendment 
is approved by NMFS, the amendment will be effective for the duration of 
the CDP.
    (iii) If NMFS determines that the CDP, if changed, would no longer 
meet the requirements of this subpart, NMFS will notify the State in 
writing of the reasons why the amendment cannot be approved.
    (iv) For the purposes of this section, substantial amendments are 
defined as changes in a CDP, including, but not limited to:
    (A) Any change in the list of communities comprising the CDQ group 
or replacement of the managing organization.
    (B) A change in the CDP applicant's harvesting or processing 
partner.
    (C) Funding a CDP project in excess of $100,000 that is not part of 
an approved general budget.
    (D) More than a 20-percent increase in the annual budget of an 
approved CDP project.
    (E) More than a 20-percent increase in actual expenditures over the 
approved annual budget for administrative operations.
    (F) A change in the contractual agreement(s) between the CDQ group 
and its harvesting or processing partner or a change in a CDP project, 
if such change is deemed by the State or NMFS to be a material change.
    (G) Any transfer of a CDQ allocation, PSQ allocation, PSQ, or a 
transfer of more than 10 percent of a CDQ.
    (H) The addition of a vessel to a CDP if the CDQ group submits a 
proposed alternative method of determining CDQ and PSQ catch under 
paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section for NMFS review.
    (v) The request for approval of a substantial amendment to a CDP 
shall include the following information:
    (A) The background and justification for the amendment that explains 
why the proposed amendment is necessary and appropriate.
    (B) An explanation of why the proposed change to the CDP is a 
substantial amendment.
    (C) A description of the proposed amendment, explaining all changes 
to the CDP that result from the proposed amendment.
    (D) A comparison of the original CDP text, with the text of the 
proposed

[[Page 543]]

changes to the CDP, and the revised pages of the CDP for replacement in 
the CDP binder. The revised pages must have the revision date noted, 
with the page number on all affected pages. The table of contents may 
also need to be revised to reflect any changes in pagination.
    (E) Identification of any NMFS findings that would need to be 
modified if the amendment is approved, along with the proposed modified 
text.
    (F) A description of how the proposed amendment meets the 
requirements of this subpart. Only those CDQ regulations that are 
affected by the proposed amendment need to be discussed.
    (5) Technical amendments. Any change to a CDP that is not considered 
a substantial amendment under paragraph (g)(4)(iv) of this section is a 
technical amendment.
    (i) The CDQ group must notify the State in writing of any technical 
amendment. Such notification must include a copy of the pages of the CDP 
that would be revised by the amendment, with the text highlighted to 
show the proposed deletions and additions, and a copy of the CDP pages 
as they would be revised by the proposed amendment for insertion into 
the CDP binder. All revised CDP pages must include the revision date, 
amendment identification number, and CDP page number. The table of 
contents may also need to be revised to reflect any changes in 
pagination.
    (ii) The State must forward the technical amendment to NMFS with its 
recommendations for approval or disapproval of the amendment. A 
technical amendment is approved by NMFS and is effective when, after 
review, NMFS notifies the State in writing of the technical amendment's 
receipt and approval.
    (h) Suspension or termination of a CDP. An annual progress report, 
required under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, will be used by the 
State to review each CDP to determine whether the CDP, CDQ, and PSQ 
allocations thereunder should be continued, decreased, partially 
suspended, suspended, or terminated under the following circumstances:
    (1) If the State determines that the CDP will successfully meet its 
goals and objectives, the CDP may continue without any Secretarial 
action.
    (2) If the State recommends to NMFS that an allocation be decreased, 
the State's recommendation for decrease will be deemed approved if NMFS 
does not notify the State in writing within 30 days of receipt of the 
State's recommendation.
    (3) If the State determines that a CDP has not successfully met its 
goals and objectives or appears unlikely to become successful, the State 
may submit a recommendation to NMFS that the CDP be partially suspended, 
suspended, or terminated. The State must set out, in writing, the 
reasons for recommending suspension or termination of the CDP.
    (4) After review of the State's recommendation and reasons thereof, 
NMFS will notify the Governor, in writing, of approval or disapproval of 
the recommendation within 30 days of its receipt. In the case of 
suspension or termination, NMFS will publish notification in the Federal 
Register, with reasons thereof.

[63 FR 30403, June 4, 1998]

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 30403, June 4, 1998, Sec. 679.30 was 
revised. Section 679.30(a)(5)(i)(A)(2) contains information collection 
and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until 
approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 679.31  CDQ reserves.

    Portions of the CDQ and PSQ reserves for each subarea or district 
may be allocated for the exclusive use of CDQ applicants in accordance 
with CDPs approved by the Governor in consultation with the Council and 
approved by NMFS. NMFS will allocate no more than 33 percent of the 
total CDQ for all subareas and districts combined to any one applicant 
with an approved CDP application.
    (a) Pollock CDQ reserve (applicable through December 31, 1998). In 
the proposed and final harvest specifications required by 
Sec. 679.20(c), one-half of the pollock TAC placed in the reserve for 
each subarea or district of the BSAI will be apportioned to a CDQ 
reserve for each subarea or district.
    (b) Halibut CDQ reserve. (1) NMFS will annually withhold from IFQ 
allocation

[[Page 544]]

the proportions of the halibut catch limit that are specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section for use as a CDQ reserve.
    (2) Portions of the CDQ for each specified IPHC regulatory area may 
be allocated for the exclusive use of an eligible Western Alaska 
community or group of communities in accordance with a CDP approved by 
the Governor in consultation with the Council and approved by NMFS.
    (3) The proportions of the halibut catch limit annually withheld for 
the halibut CDQ program, exclusive of issued QS, and the eligible 
communities for which they shall be made available are as follows for 
each IPHC regulatory area:
    (i) Area 4B. In IPHC regulatory area 4B, 20 percent of the annual 
halibut quota shall be made available to eligible communities physically 
located in, or proximate to, this regulatory area.
    (ii) Area 4C. In IPHC regulatory area 4C, 50 percent of the halibut 
quota shall be made available to eligible communities physically located 
in IPHC regulatory area 4C.
    (iii) Area 4D. In IPHC regulatory area 4D, 30 percent of the annual 
halibut quota shall be made available to eligible communities located 
in, or proximate to, IPHC regulatory areas 4D and 4E.
    (iv) Area 4E. In IPHC regulatory area 4E, 100 percent of the halibut 
quota shall be made available to eligible communities located in, or 
proximate to, IPHC regulatory area 4E. A fishing trip limit of 6,000 lb 
(2.7 mt) applies to halibut CDQ harvesting in IPHC regulatory area 4E.
    (4) For the purposes of this section, ``proximate to'' an IPHC 
regulatory area means within 10 nm from the point where the boundary of 
the IPHC regulatory area intersects land.
    (c) Groundfish CDQ reserves. (See Sec. 679.20(b)(1)(iii))
    (d) Crab CDQ reserves. King and Tanner crab species in the Bering 
Sea and Aleutian Islands Area that have a guideline harvest level 
specified by the State of Alaska that is available for commercial 
harvest are apportioned to a crab CDQ reserve as follows:
    (1) For calendar year 2000, and thereafter, 7.5 percent;
    (2) For calendar year 1999 (applicable through December 31, 1999), 5 
percent; and
    (3) For calendar year 1998 (applicable through December 31, 1998), 
3.5 percent.
    (e) PSQ reserve. (See Sec. 679.21(e)(1)(i) and (e)(2)(ii)).
    (f) Reallocation of CDQ or PSQ reserves (Applicable through December 
31, 1998). If the Regional Administrator determines that any amount of a 
CDQ or PSQ reserve will not be used during the remainder of the 1998 
fishing year, the Regional Administrator may reallocate any unused 
amount of the CDQ reserve back to the non-specified reserve established 
by Sec. 679.20(b)(1)(ii) and may reallocate any unused amount of a PSQ 
reserve back to non-CDQ fisheries in proportion to those fisheries' 1998 
apportionment of PSC limits established by Sec. 679.21.
    (g) Non-specific CDQ reserve. Annually, NMFS will apportion 15 
percent of each squid, arrowtooth flounder, and ``other species'' CDQ 
for each CDQ group to a non-specific CDQ reserve. A CDQ group's non-
specific CDQ reserve must be for the exclusive use of that CDQ group. A 
release from the non-specific CDQ reserve to the CDQ group's squid, 
arrowtooth flounder, or ``other species'' CDQ is a technical amendment 
as described in Sec. 679.30(g)(5). The technical amendment must be 
approved before harvests relying on CDQ transferred from the non-
specific CDQ reserve may be conducted.

[63 FR 8361, Feb. 19, 1998, as amended at 63 FR 30407, June 4, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 679.32  Groundfish and halibut CDQ catch monitoring.

    (a) Applicability. (1) The CDQ group and the operator or manager of 
a buying station, the operator of a vessel, and the manager of a 
shoreside processor must comply with the requirements of this section 
for all CDQ and PSQ caught while groundfish CDQ fishing as defined at 
Sec. 679.2, with the exceptions listed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) 
of this section. In addition, the CDQ group is responsible for ensuring 
that vessels and processors listed as eligible on the CDQ group's 
approved CDP comply with all requirements of this section while 
harvesting or processing CDQ species.

[[Page 545]]

    (2) Pollock CDQ fishing in 1998 (applicable through December 31, 
1998). Regulations governing the catch of pollock CDQ while pollock CDQ 
fishing as defined in Sec. 679.2 in 1998 are in paragraph (e) of this 
section. The catch of pollock by vessels that are not pollock CDQ 
fishing as defined in Sec. 679.2 will not accrue against the pollock CDQ 
in 1998.
    (3) Fixed gear sablefish and halibut CDQ fishing in 1998 (applicable 
through December 31, 1998). Regulations governing the catch of sablefish 
and halibut CDQ by vessels using fixed gear in 1998 are in paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (b) PSQ catch. Time and area closures required once a CDQ group has 
reached its salmon PSQ or crab PSQ are listed in Sec. 679.7(d)(7) 
through (10). The catch of salmon or crab by vessels using other than 
trawl gear does not accrue to the PSQ for these species. The discard of 
halibut by vessels using pot or jig gear will not accrue to the halibut 
PSQ if this bycatch has been exempted from the halibut PSC limit under 
Sec. 679.21(e)(5) in the annual specifications published in the Federal 
Register.
    (c) Requirements for vessels and processors. In addition to 
complying with the minimum observer coverage requirements at 
Sec. 679.50(c)(4), operators of vessels groundfish CDQ fishing and 
managers or operators of shoreside processing plants or buying stations 
taking deliveries from vessels groundfish CDQ fishing must comply with 
the following requirements:
    (1) Catcher vessels without an observer. (i) Operators of catcher 
vessels less than 60 ft (18.29 m) LOA must retain all groundfish CDQ, 
halibut CDQ, and salmon PSQ until it is delivered to a processor that 
meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section. 
All halibut PSQ and crab PSQ must be discarded at sea. Operators of 
catcher vessels using trawl gear must report the at-sea discards of 
halibut PSQ or crab PSQ on the CDQ delivery report. Operators of catcher 
vessels using nontrawl gear must report the at-sea discards of halibut 
PSQ on the CDQ delivery report, unless exempted from accounting for 
halibut PSQ under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Catcher vessels delivering unsorted codends. Operators of 
catcher vessels delivering unsorted codends to trawl catcher/processors 
or motherships must retain all CDQ and PSQ species and deliver them to a 
catcher/processor or mothership that meets the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section.
    (2) Catcher vessels with observers. Operators of catcher vessels 
equal to or greater than 60 ft (18.29 m) LOA must comply with the 
following requirements:
    (i) If using trawl gear, the vessel operator must:
    (A) Retain all CDQ species and salmon PSQ until they are delivered 
to a processor that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) or (c)(4) 
of this section;
    (B) Retain all halibut and crab PSQ in a bin or other location until 
it is counted and sampled by a CDQ observer; and
    (C) Provide space on the deck of the vessel for the CDQ observer to 
sort and store catch samples and a place from which to hang the observer 
sampling scale.
    (ii) If using nontrawl gear, the vessel operator must either:
    (A) Option 1: Retain all CDQ species. Retain all CDQ species until 
they are delivered to a processor that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section and have all of the halibut 
PSQ counted by the CDQ observer and sampled for length or average 
weight; or
    (B) Option 2: Discard some CDQ species at sea. May discard some CDQ 
species at sea if the following requirements are met:
    (1) Observer sampling station. The vessel owner provides an observer 
sampling station that complies with Sec. 679.28(d) so that the CDQ 
observer can accurately determine the average weight of discarded CDQ 
species. A valid observer sampling station inspection report described 
at Sec. 679.28(d)(8) must be on board the vessel at all times when a 
sampling station is required; and
    (2) Species composition. Each CDQ set on vessels using hook-and-line 
gear is sampled for species composition by a CDQ observer.
    (3) Shoreside processors and buying stations. The operator of a 
buying station

[[Page 546]]

or the manager of a shoreside processor must comply with all of the 
following requirements:
    (i) Prior notice to observer of offloading schedule. Notify the CDQ 
observer of the offloading schedule of each groundfish CDQ delivery at 
least 1 hour prior to offloading to provide the CDQ observer an 
opportunity to monitor the sorting and weighing of the entire delivery.
    (ii) CDQ and PSQ by weight. Sort and weigh on a scale approved by 
the State of Alaska under Sec. 679.28(c) all groundfish and halibut CDQ 
or PSQ by species or species group.
    (iii) PSQ by number. Sort and count all salmon and crab PSQ.
    (iv) CDQ and PSQ sorting and weighing. Sorting and weighing of CDQ 
and PSQ must be monitored by a CDQ observer.
    (v) CDQ delivery report. Submit a CDQ delivery report described at 
Sec. 679.5(n)(1) for each delivery from vessels groundfish CDQ fishing 
as defined at Sec. 679.2.
    (4) Catcher/processors and motherships. The operator of a catcher/
processor or a mothership must comply with the following requirements:
    (i) Prior notice to observer of CDQ catch. Notify the CDQ 
observer(s) before CDQ catch is brought onboard the vessel and notify 
the CDQ observer(s) of the CDQ group and CDQ number associated with the 
CDQ catch.
    (ii) Observer sampling station. Provide an observer sampling station 
as described at Sec. 679.28(d). A valid observer sampling station 
inspection report described at Sec. 679.28(d)(8) must be on board the 
vessel at all times when a sampling station is required.
    (iii) Catcher/processors using trawl gear and motherships. The 
operator of a catcher/processor using trawl gear or of a mothership must 
weigh all catch on a scale that complies with the requirements of 
Sec. 679.28(b). A valid scale inspection report described at 
Sec. 679.28(b)(2) must be on board the vessel at all times when a scale 
is required. Catch from each CDQ haul must be weighed separately. Catch 
must not be sorted before it is weighed, unless a provision for doing so 
is approved by NMFS for the vessel in the CDP. Each CDQ haul must be 
sampled by a CDQ observer for species composition and the vessel 
operator must allow CDQ observers to use any scale approved by NMFS to 
weigh partial CDQ haul samples.
    (iv) Catcher/processors using nontrawl gear. Each CDQ set on a 
vessel using hook-and-line gear must be sampled by a CDQ observer for 
species composition and average weight.
    (d) Recordkeeping and reporting--(1) Catch record. The operator or 
manager of a buying station and the manager of a shoreside processor 
must submit to NMFS the CDQ delivery report required in 
Sec. 679.5(n)(1). The CDQ representative must submit to NMFS the CDQ 
catch report required in Sec. 679.5(n)(2). Additionally, all other 
applicable requirements in Sec. 679.5 for groundfish fishing must be 
met.
    (2) Verification of CDQ and PSQ catch reports. CDQ groups may 
specify the sources of data listed below as the sources they will use to 
determine CDQ and PSQ catch on the CDQ catch report by specifying ``NMFS 
standard sources of data'' in their CDP. In the case of a catcher vessel 
using nontrawl gear, the CDP must specify whether the vessel will be 
retaining all groundfish CDQ (Option 1) or discarding some groundfish 
CDQ species at sea (Option 2). CDQ species may be discarded at sea by 
these vessels only if the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of 
this section are met. NMFS will use the following sources to verify the 
CDQ catch reports, unless an alternative catch estimation procedure in 
the CDP is approved by NMFS under Sec. 679.30(a)(5)(ii).
    (i) Catcher vessels less than 60 ft (18.29 m) LOA. The weight or 
numbers of all CDQ and PSQ species will be the same as the information 
on the CDQ delivery report if all CDQ species and salmon PSQ are 
retained on board the vessel, delivered to a shoreside processor listed 
as eligible in the CDP, and sorted and weighed in compliance with 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Catcher vessels delivering unsorted codends. The weight and 
numbers of CDQ and PSQ species will be determined by applying the 
species composition sampling data collected for each CDQ haul by the CDQ 
observer on the mothership to the total weight of each CDQ haul as 
determined by weighing

[[Page 547]]

all catch from each CDQ haul on a scale approved under Sec. 679.28(b).
    (iii) Observed catcher vessels using trawl gear. The weight of 
halibut and numbers of crab PSQ discarded at sea will be determined by 
using the CDQ observer's sample data. The weight or numbers of all 
groundfish CDQ and salmon PSQ will be the same as the information 
submitted on the CDQ delivery report if all CDQ species and salmon PSQ 
are retained on board the vessel until delivered to a processor listed 
as eligible in the CDP, and sorted and weighed in compliance with 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (iv) Observed catcher vessels using nontrawl gear--(A) Option 1. The 
weight of halibut PSQ discarded at sea will be determined by using the 
CDQ observer's sample data. The weight of all groundfish CDQ will be the 
same as the information submitted on the CDQ delivery report if all CDQ 
species are retained on board the vessel until delivered to a processor, 
and sorted and weighed in compliance with paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section (Option 1); or
    (B) Option 2. The weight of halibut PSQ and all groundfish CDQ 
species will be determined by applying the CDQ observer's species 
composition sampling data to the estimate of total catch weight if any 
CDQ species are discarded at sea.
    (v) Catcher/processors using trawl gear and motherships. The weight 
and numbers of CDQ and PSQ species will be determined by applying the 
CDQ observer's species composition sampling data for each CDQ haul to 
the total weight of the CDQ haul as determined by weighing all catch 
from each CDQ haul on a scale certified under Sec. 679.28(b).
    (vi) Catcher/processors using nontrawl gear. The weight of halibut 
PSQ and all groundfish CDQ species will be determined by applying the 
CDQ observer's species composition sampling data to the estimate of 
total catch weight, if any CDQ species are discarded at sea.
    (e) Pollock CDQ (applicable through December 31, 1998)--(1) 
Applicability. The owner or operator of a vessel pollock CDQ fishing as 
defined at Sec. 679.2 and the owner or operator of a processor taking 
deliveries from vessels pollock CDQ fishing must comply with the 
requirements of this paragraph (e).
    (2) Catch of non-pollock. The catch of all non-pollock species for 
which a TAC or PSC limit is specified will accrue against the TACs and 
PSC limits for moratorium groundfish species. The owner or operator of a 
vessel that is pollock CDQ fishing and the owner or operator of a 
processor taking deliveries from vessels that are pollock CDQ fishing 
must comply with regulations governing maximum retainable bycatch 
amounts and prohibited species status in the moratorium groundfish 
fisheries at Sec. 679.20(d)(1)(iii).
    (3) Recordkeeping and reporting. The CDQ representative, the 
operator or manager of a buying station, the operator of a vessel, and 
the manager of a shoreside processor must submit all applicable reports 
in Sec. 679.5, including the CDQ delivery report and the CDQ catch 
report. Catch from the pollock CDQ fisheries must be identified 
separately from catch in other CDQ fisheries on the CDQ catch report. 
Harvest of species other than pollock in the pollock CDQ fisheries must 
not be reported on the CDQ catch report.
    (4) Observer coverage. Two observers are required on all catcher/
processors and motherships harvesting, processing, or taking deliveries 
of pollock CDQ; one observer is required on all catcher vessels 
harvesting pollock CDQ; and one observer is required in a shoreside 
processing plant while pollock CDQ is being delivered, sorted, or 
processed.
    (5) Estimation of the weight of pollock CDQ--(i) Shoreside 
processors and buying stations. All pollock CDQ delivered to a shoreside 
processor or buying station must be weighed on a scale approved by the 
State of Alaska under Sec. 679.28(c). The manager of each shoreside 
processor or buying station must notify the observer of the offloading 
schedule of each pollock CDQ delivery at least 1 hour prior to 
offloading to provide the observer an opportunity to monitor the 
weighing of the entire delivery.
    (ii) Motherships and catcher/processors. Operators of motherships 
and catcher/processors must provide holding bins and comply with the 
operational requirements at Sec. 679.28(e) in order for volumetric 
estimates of total catch weight to be made.

[[Page 548]]

    (f) Sablefish and halibut CDQ fisheries (applicable through December 
31, 1998)--(1) Applicability. The owner or operator of a vessel or 
processor harvesting or accepting deliveries of fixed gear sablefish or 
halibut CDQ in 1998 must comply with the requirements of this paragraph 
(f).
    (2) Catch of other groundfish. All groundfish for which a TAC is 
specified and all prohibited species caught while fixed gear sablefish 
and halibut CDQ fishing will accrue against the TACs and PSC limits for 
moratorium groundfish species. Regulations governing maximum retainable 
bycatch amounts and prohibited species status in the moratorium 
groundfish fisheries at Sec. 679.20(d)(1)(iii) must be complied with 
while fixed gear sablefish and halibut CDQ fishing.
    (3) Permits. The managing organization responsible for carrying out 
an approved CDP must have a halibut and/or sablefish CDQ permit issued 
by the Regional Administrator. A copy of the halibut and/or sablefish 
CDQ permit must be carried on any fishing vessel operated by, or for, 
the managing organization and be made available for inspection by an 
authorized officer. Such halibut and/or sablefish CDQ permit is non-
transferable and is effective for the duration of the CDP or until 
revoked, suspended, or modified.
    (4) CDQ cards. All individuals named on an approved CDP application 
must have a valid halibut and/or sablefish CDQ card issued by the 
Regional Administrator before landing any halibut and/or sablefish. Each 
halibut and/or sablefish CDQ card will identify a CDQ permit number and 
the individual authorized by the managing organization to land halibut 
and/or sablefish for debit against its CDQ allocation.
    (5) Alteration. No person may alter, erase, or mutilate a halibut 
and/or sablefish CDQ permit, card, registered buyer permit, or any valid 
and current permit or document issued under this part. Any such permit, 
card, or document that has been intentionally altered, erased, or 
mutilated is invalid.
    (6) Landings. Halibut and/or sablefish harvested pursuant to an 
approved CDP may be landed only by a person with a valid halibut and/or 
sablefish CDQ card, delivered only to a person with a valid registered 
buyer permit, and reported in compliance with Sec. 679.5(l)(1) and 
(l)(2).
    (7) Recordkeeping and reporting. Vessels and processors with Federal 
fisheries or processor permits under Sec. 679.4(f) must report all catch 
of groundfish, including sablefish CDQ, and prohibited species from the 
fixed gear sablefish and halibut CDQ fisheries on logbooks and weekly 
production reports required under Sec. 679.5.

[63 FR 30407, June 4, 1998]

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 30407, June 4, 1998, Sec. 679.32 was 
revised. Paragraph 679.32(c)(4)(i) contains information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval 
has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R04>
         Subpart D--Individual Fishing Quota Management Measures


<R05>
Sec. 679.40  Sablefish and halibut QS.

    The Regional Administrator shall annually divide the TAC of halibut 
and sablefish that is apportioned to the fixed gear fishery pursuant to 
the annual management measures published in the Federal Register 
pursuant to Sec. 300.62 of chapter III of this title and Sec. 679.20, 
minus the CDQ reserve, among qualified halibut and sablefish quota share 
holders, respectively.
    (a) Initial allocation of QS--(1) General. The Regional 
Administrator shall initially assign to qualified persons, on or after 
October 18, 1994, halibut and sablefish fixed gear fishery QS that are 
specific to IFQ regulatory areas and vessel categories. QS will be 
assigned as a block in the appropriate IFQ regulatory area and vessel 
category, if that QS would have resulted in an allocation of less than 
20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ for halibut or sablefish based on the 1994 TAC 
for fixed gear in those fisheries for specific IFQ regulatory areas and 
the QS pools of those fisheries for specific IFQ regulatory areas as of 
October 17, 1994.
    (2) Qualified person. (i) As used in this section, a ``qualified 
person'' means a ``person,'' as defined in Sec. 679.2:
    (A) That owned a vessel that made legal landings of halibut or 
sablefish, harvested with fixed gear, from any

[[Page 549]]

IFQ regulatory area in any QS qualifying year; or
    (B) That leased a vessel that made legal landings of halibut or 
sablefish, harvested with fixed gear, from any IFQ regulatory area in 
any QS qualifying year. A person who owns a vessel cannot be a qualified 
person based on the legal fixed gear landings of halibut or sablefish 
made by a person who leased the vessel for the duration of the lease.
    (ii) Qualified persons, or their successors-in-interest, must exist 
at the time of their application for QS.
    (iii) A former partner of a dissolved partnership or a former 
shareholder of a dissolved corporation who would otherwise qualify as a 
person may apply for QS in proportion to his or her interest in the 
dissolved partnership or corporation.
    (iv) Sablefish harvested within Prince William Sound, or under a 
State of Alaska limited entry program, will not be considered in 
determining whether a person is a qualified person.
    (3) Qualification for QS--(i) Year. A QS qualifying year is 1988, 
1989, or 1990.
    (ii) Vessel ownership. Evidence of vessel ownership shall be limited 
to the following documents, in order of priority:
    (A) For vessels required to be documented under the laws of the 
United States, the USCG abstract of title issued in respect of that 
vessel.
    (B) A certificate of registration that is determinative as to vessel 
ownership.
    (C) A bill of sale.
    (iii) Vessel lease. Conclusive evidence of a vessel lease will 
include a written vessel lease agreement or a notarized statement from 
the vessel owner and lease holder attesting to the existence of a vessel 
lease agreement at any time during the QS qualifying years. Conclusive 
evidence of a vessel lease must identify the leased vessel and indicate 
the name of the lease holder and the period of time during which the 
lease was in effect. Other evidence, which may not be conclusive, but 
may tend to support a vessel lease, may also be submitted.
    (iv) Ownership interest. Evidence of ownership interest in a 
dissolved partnership or corporation shall be limited to corporate 
documents (e.g., articles of incorporation) or notarized statements 
signed by each former partner, shareholder or director, and specifying 
their proportions of interest.
    (v) Legal landing of halibut or sablefish--(A) Definition. As used 
in this section, a ``legal landing of halibut or sablefish'' means 
halibut or sablefish harvested with fixed gear and landed in compliance 
with state and Federal regulations in effect at the time of the landing.
    (B) Documentation. Evidence of legal landings shall be limited to 
documentation of state or Federal catch reports that indicate the amount 
of halibut or sablefish harvested, the IPHC regulatory area or 
groundfish reporting area in which it was caught, the vessel and gear 
type used to catch it, and the date of harvesting, landing, or 
reporting. State catch reports are Alaska, Washington, Oregon, or 
California fish tickets. Federal catch reports are WPRs required under 
Sec. 679.5. Sablefish harvested within Prince William Sound or under a 
State of Alaska limited entry program will not be considered in 
determining qualification to receive QS, nor in calculating initial QS.
    (4) Calculation of initial QS--(i) Halibut QS. The Regional 
Administrator shall calculate the halibut QS for any qualified person in 
each IFQ regulatory area based on that person's highest total legal 
landings of halibut in each IPHC regulatory area for any 5 years of the 
7-year halibut QS base period 1984 through 1990. The sum of all halibut 
QS for an IFQ regulatory area will be the halibut QS pool for that area.
    (ii) Sablefish QS. The Regional Administrator shall calculate the 
sablefish QS for any qualified person in each IFQ regulatory area based 
on that person's highest total legal landings of sablefish in each 
groundfish reporting area for any 5 years of the 6-year sablefish QS 
base period 1985 through 1990. The sum of all sablefish QS for an IFQ 
regulatory area will be the sablefish QS pool for that area.
    (iii) CDQ program. Each initial QS calculation will be modified to 
accommodate the CDQ program prescribed at subpart C of this part.

[[Page 550]]

    (5) Assignment of QS to vessel categories--(i) LOA. Each qualified 
person's QS will be assigned to a vessel category based on the LOA of 
vessel(s) from which that person made fixed gear legal landings of 
groundfish or halibut in the most recent year of participation and the 
product type landed. As used in this paragraph (a)(5), ``the most recent 
year of participation'' means the most recent of 4 calendar years in 
which any groundfish or halibut were harvested using fixed gear, as 
follows: 1988, 1989, or 1990; or calendar year 1991 prior to September 
26, 1991.
    (ii) Vessel categories. QS and its associated IFQ assigned to vessel 
categories include:
    (A) Category A QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ 
cardholder to harvest and process IFQ species on a vessel of any length;
    (B) Category B QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ 
cardholder to harvest IFQ species on a vessel of any length, except as 
provided in Sec. 679.42(a);
    (C) Category C QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ 
cardholder to harvest IFQ species on a vessel less than or equal to 60 
ft (18.3 m) LOA:
    (D) Category D QS and associated IFQ, which authorizes an IFQ 
cardholder to harvest IFQ halibut on a vessel less than or equal to 35 
ft (10.7 m) LOA;
    (iii) QS assignment. A qualified person's QS will be assigned:
    (A) To vessel category A if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel processed any groundfish or 
halibut caught with fixed gear.
    (B) To vessel category B if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel was greater than 60 ft (18.3 
m) LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught with fixed 
gear.
    (C) To each applicable vessel category in proportion to the landings 
of halibut or sablefish made by that person if, at any time during their 
most recent year of participation, that person used more than one vessel 
in different categories.
    (iv) Sablefish QS. A qualified person's sablefish QS will be 
assigned:
    (A) To vessel category C if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel was less than or equal to 60 
ft (18.3 m) LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught 
with fixed gear.
    (B) To the vessel category in which halibut and groundfish were 
landed, or vessel categories in proportion to the total fixed gear 
landings of halibut and groundfish, if, at any time during the most 
recent year of participation, that person's vessel(s) makes no 
landing(s) of sablefish.
    (v) Halibut QS. A qualified person's halibut QS will be assigned:
    (A) To vessel category C if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel was less than or equal to 60 
ft (18.3 m), but greater than 35 ft (10.7 m), LOA and did not process 
any groundfish or halibut caught with fixed gear.
    (B) To vessel category D if, at any time during his/her most recent 
year of participation, that person's vessel was less than or equal to 35 
ft (10.7 m) LOA and did not process any groundfish or halibut caught 
with fixed gear.
    (C) To the vessel category in which groundfish were landed, or 
vessel categories in proportion to the total fixed gear landings of 
groundfish, if, at any time during the most recent year of 
participation, that person's vessel(s) makes no landing(s) of halibut.
    (vi) Both species QS. A qualified person's QS for both species will 
be assigned to the vessel category in which groundfish were landed in 
the most recent year of participation if, at any time during that year, 
that person landed halibut in one vessel category and sablefish in a 
different vessel category.
    (6) Application for initial QS--(i) Application form. Upon request, 
the Regional Administrator shall make available to any person an 
application form for an initial allocation of QS. The application form 
sent to the person requesting a QS allocation will include all data on 
that person's vessel ownership and catch history of halibut and 
sablefish that can be released to the applicant under current state and 
Federal confidentiality rules, and that are available to the Regional 
Administrator at the time of the request.

[[Page 551]]

    (ii) Application period. An application period of no less than 180 
days will be specified by notification in the Federal Register and other 
information sources that the Regional Administrator deems appropriate.
    (iii) Complete application. Complete applications received by the 
Regional Administrator will be acknowledged. An incomplete application 
will be returned to the applicant with specific kinds of information 
identified that are necessary to make it complete.
    (7) Insufficient documentation. Halibut and sablefish catch history, 
vessel ownership or lease data, and other information supplied by an 
applicant will be compared with data compiled by the Regional 
Administrator. If additional data presented in an application are not 
consistent with the data compiled by the Regional Administrator, the 
applicant will be notified of insufficient documentation. The applicant 
will have 90 days to submit corroborating documents (as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section) in support of his/her application or to 
resubmit a revised application. All applicants will be limited to one 
opportunity to provide corroborating documentation or a revised 
application in response to notification of insufficient documentation.
    (8) Verified data. Uncontested data in applications will be approved 
by the Regional Administrator. Based on these data, the Regional 
Administrator will calculate each applicant's initial halibut and 
sablefish QS, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for each IFQ 
regulatory area, respectively, and will add each applicant's halibut and 
sablefish QS for an IFQ regulatory area to the respective QS pool for 
that area.
    (9) Unverified data. Catch history, vessel ownership, or lease data 
that cannot be verified by the Regional Administrator, following the 
procedure described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, will not 
qualify for QS. An initial determination denying QS on the grounds that 
claimed catch history, vessel ownership or lease data were not verified 
may be appealed following the procedure described in Sec. 679.43. Quota 
share reflecting catch history, vessel ownership, or lease data that are 
contested between two or more applicants, at least one of which is 
likely to qualify for QS when the dispute is resolved, will be assigned 
to a reserve that will be considered part of the QS pool for the 
appropriate IFQ regulatory area. Any QS and IFQ that results from agency 
action resolving the dispute will be assigned to the prevailing 
applicant(s) pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), (b), and (c) of this 
section. If the assigned IFQ for the 1995 fishing season becomes moot by 
passage of time needed to resolve the dispute, the assignment of QS and 
IFQ for subsequent fishing seasons will be unaffected.
    (b) Annual allocation of IFQ. The Regional Administrator shall 
assign halibut or sablefish IFQs to each person holding unrestricted QS 
for halibut or sablefish, respectively, up to the limits prescribed in 
Sec. 679.42 (e) and (f). Each assigned IFQ will be specific to an IFQ 
regulatory area and vessel category, and will represent the maximum 
amount of halibut or sablefish that may be harvested from the specified 
IFQ regulatory area and by the person to whom it is assigned during the 
specified fishing year, unless the IFQ assignment is changed by the 
Regional Administrator within the fishing year because of an approved 
transfer or because all or part of the IFQ is sanctioned for violating 
rules of this part.
    (c) Calculation of annual IFQ allocation--(1) General. The annual 
allocation of IFQ to any person (person p) in any IFQ regulatory area 
(area a) will be equal to the product of the TAC of halibut or sablefish 
by fixed gear for that area (after adjustment for purposes of the 
Western Alaska CDQ Program) and that person's QS divided by the QS pool 
for that area. Overages will be subtracted from a person's IFQ pursuant 
to paragraph (d) of this section. Expressed algebraically, the annual 
IFQ allocation formula is as follows:

IFQ <INF>pa</INF> = [(fixed gear TAC<INF>a</INF> - CDQ 
reserve<INF>a</INF>)  x  (QS<INF>pa</INF>/QS pool<INF>a</INF>)] - 
overage of IFQ<INF>pa</INF>.

    (2) QS amounts. For purposes of calculating IFQs for any fishing 
year, the amount of a person's QS and the amount of the QS pool for any 
IFQ regulatory area will be the amounts on record with the Alaska 
Region, NMFS, as of 1200 hours, A.l.t., on January 31 of that year.

[[Page 552]]

    (3) IFQ permit. The Regional Administrator shall issue to each QS 
holder, pursuant to Sec. 679.4, an IFQ permit accompanied by a statement 
specifying the maximum amount of halibut and sablefish that may be 
harvested with fixed gear in a specified IFQ regulatory area and vessel 
category as of January 31 of that year. Such IFQ permits will be mailed 
to each QS holder at the address on record for that person after the 
beginning of each fishing year but prior to the start of the annual IFQ 
fishing season.
    (d) Ten-percent adjustment policy. A person's annual IFQ account 
will be adjusted in the year following a determination that the person 
harvested or landed IFQ species in an amount is greater than the amount 
available in the person's annual IFQ account and if the amount greater 
than the amount available does not exceed 10 percent of the amount 
available in the person's annual IFQ account at the time of landing. The 
adjustment would be a deduction of the amount of IFQ species harvested 
or landed that was determined to exceed the amount available in the 
person's annual IFQ account and will apply to any person to whom the 
affected IFQ is allocated in the year following the determination.
    (e) Underages. Underages of up to 10 percent of a person's total 
annual IFQ account for a current fishing year will be added to that 
person's annual IFQ account in the year following determination of the 
underage. This underage adjustment to the annual IFQ allocation will be 
specific to IFQ species, IFQ regulatory area, and vessel category for 
which an IFQ is calculated, and will apply to any person to whom the 
affected IFQ is allocated in the year following determination of an 
underage.
    (f) Harvesting privilege. Quota shares allocated or permits issued 
pursuant to this part do not represent either an absolute right to the 
resource or any interest that is subject to the ``takings'' provision of 
the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Rather, such quota shares 
or permits represent only a harvesting privilege that may be revoked or 
amended subject to the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and 
other applicable law.
    (g) Tagged halibut and sablefish. (1) Nothing contained in this part 
shall prohibit any person at any time from retaining and landing a 
Pacific halibut or sablefish that bears at the time of capture a 
research tag from any state, Federal, or international agency, provided 
that the halibut or sablefish is:
    (i) A Pacific halibut landed pursuant to 50 CFR 300.18; or
    (ii) A sablefish landed in accordance with the Tagged Groundfish 
Research Program.
    (2) Tagged halibut or sablefish landed pursuant to paragraphs (1)(i) 
or (1)(ii) of this section shall not be calculated as part of an 
individual's IFQ harvest or be debited against an individual's halibut 
or sablefish IFQ.

<R05>
Sec. 679.41  Transfer of quota shares and IFQ.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, transfer of QS or IFQ means any transaction requiring QS, or 
the use thereof in the form of IFQ, to pass from one person to another, 
permanently or for a fixed period of time.
    (2) Transactions requiring IFQ cards to be issued in the name of a 
vessel master employed by an individual or a corporation are not 
transfers of QS or IFQ.
    (b) Transfer procedure--(1) Application for transfer. An Application 
for Transfer of QS/IFQ (Application for Transfer) must be approved by 
the Regional Administrator before a person may use IFQ to harvest IFQ 
halibut or IFQ sablefish, whether the IFQ was the result of a direct 
transfer or the result of a QS transfer. An Application for Transfer 
will not be approved until the Regional Administrator has reviewed and 
approved the transfer agreement signed by the parties to the 
transaction. The Regional Administrator shall provide an Application for 
Transfer form to any person on request. Persons who submit an 
Application for Transfer to the Regional Administrator for approval will

for Transfer, and, if applicable, the reason(s) for disapproval, by mail 
posted on the date of that decision, unless another communication mode 
is requested on the Application for Transfer.
    (2) QS or IFQ accounts. QS or IFQ accounts affected by an 
Application for Transfer approved by the Regional Administrator will 
change on the date of approval. Any necessary IFQ permits will be sent 
with the notification of the Regional Administrator's decision.
    (c) Application for Transfer approval criteria. Except as provided 
in paragraph (f) of this section, an Application for Transfer will not 
be approved until the Regional Administrator has determined that:
    (1) The person applying for transfer received the QS or IFQ to be 
transferred:
    (i) By initial assignment by the Regional Administrator as provided 
in Sec. 679.40(a); or
    (ii) By approved transfer.
    (2) The person applying to receive the QS or IFQ meets the

    (e) Transfers of QS blocks--(1) General. A QS block must be 
transferred as an undivided whole, unless the size of the QS block 
exceeds the use limits specified at Sec. 679.42. If the QS block to be 
transferred exceeds the use limits specified at Sec. 679.42, the 
Regional Administrator will divide the block into two blocks, one block 
containing the maximum amount of QS allowable under the QS use limits 
and the other block containing the residual QS.
    (2) Sablefish. QS blocks for the same IFQ regulatory area and vessel 
category that represent less than 5,000 lb (2.3 mt) of sablefish IFQ, 
based on the 1996 TAC share for fixed gear sablefish in a specific IFQ 
regulatory area and the QS pool for that IFQ regulatory area on January 
31, 1996, may be consolidated into larger QS blocks provided that the 
consolidated blocks do not represent greater than 5,000 lbs (2.3 mt) of 
sablefish IFQ based on the preceding criteria. A consolidated block 
cannot be divided and is considered a single block for purposes of use 
and transferability. The maximum number of QS units that may be 
consolidated into a single QS block in each IFQ regulatory area is as 
follows:
    (i) Southeast Outside district: 33,270 QS.
    (ii) West Yakutat district: 43,390 QS.
    (iii) Central Gulf area: 46,055 QS.
    (iv) Western Gulf area: 48,410 QS.
    (v) Aleutian Islands subarea: 99,210 QS.
    (vi) Bering Sea subarea: 91,275 QS.
    (3) Halibut. QS blocks for the same IFQ regulatory area and vessel 
category that represent less than 3,000 lbs (1.4 mt) of halibut IFQ, 
based on the 1996 catch limit for halibut in a specific IFQ regulatory 
area and the QS pool for that IFQ regulatory area on January 31, 1996, 
may be consolidated into larger QS blocks provided that the consolidated 
blocks do not represent greater than 3,000 lbs (1.4 mt) of halibut IFQ 
based on the preceding criteria. A consolidated block cannot be divided 
and is considered a single block for purposes of use and 
transferability. The maximum number of QS units that may be consolidated 
into a single block in each IFQ regulatory area is as follows:
    (i) Area 2C: 19,992 QS.
    (ii) Area 3A: 27,912 QS.
    (iii) Area 3B: 44,193 QS.
    (iv) Subarea 4A: 22,947 QS.
    (v) Subarea 4B: 15,087 QS.
    (vi) Subarea 4C: 30,930 QS.
    (vii) Subarea 4D: 26,082 QS.
    (viii) Subarea 4E: 0 QS.
    (f) Transfer of QS or IFQ with restrictions. If QS or IFQ must be 
transferred as a result of a court order, operation of law, or as part 
of a security agreement, but the person receiving the QS or IFQ by 
transfer does not meet all of the eligibility requirements of this 
section, the Regional Administrator will approve the Application for 
Transfer with restrictions. The Regional Administrator will not assign 
IFQ resulting from the restricted QS to any person. IFQ with 
restrictions may not be used for harvesting halibut or sablefish with 
fixed gear. The QS or IFQ will remain restricted until:
    (1) The person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions meets 
the eligibility requirements of this section and the Regional 
Administrator approves an Application for Eligibility for that person; 
or
    (2) The Regional Administrator approves the Application for Transfer 
from the person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions to a person 
who meets the requirements of this section.
    (g) Transfer restrictions. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f) 
or paragraph (g)(2) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew 
members or who were initially issued QS assigned to vessel categories B, 
C, or D, and meet the other requirements in this section, may receive by 
transfer QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D, or the IFQ 
resulting from it.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, only 
persons who are IFQ crew members, and meet the other requirements in 
this section, may receive by transfer QS assigned to vessel categories 
B, C, or D, or the IFQ resulting from it, in IFQ regulatory area 2C for 
halibut or in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long. for 
sablefish.
    (3) Individuals who were initially issued QS assigned to vessel 
categories B, C, or D may transfer that QS to a corporation that is 
solely owned by the same individual. Such transfers of QS

[[Page 555]]

assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D in IFQ regulatory area 2C for 
halibut or in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long. for 
sablefish will be governed by the use provisions of Sec. 679.42(i); the 
use provisions pertaining to corporations at Sec. 679.42(j) shall not 
apply.
    (4) The Regional Administrator will not approve an Application for 
Transfer of QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D subject to a 
lease or any other condition of repossession or resale by the person 
transferring QS, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, or 
by court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement. 
The Regional Administrator may request a copy of the sales contract or 
other terms and conditions of transfer between two persons as 
supplementary information to the transfer application.
    (h) Transfer of IFQ. (1) Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, 
an Application for Transfer must be approved by the Regional 
Administrator before a person may use any IFQ that results from a direct 
transfer to harvest halibut or sablefish. After approving the 
Application for Transfer, the Regional Administrator will change any IFQ 
accounts affected by the approved transfer and issue all necessary IFQ 
permits.
    (2) (Applicable until January 2, 1998). A person may transfer no 
more than 10 percent of the total IFQ resulting from QS held by that 
person and assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D for any IFQ species 
in any IFQ regulatory area to one or more persons for any fishing year.
    (i) Transfer across catcher vessel categories--(1) CDQ compensation. 
Persons issued CDQ compensation QS in a catcher vessel category, 
pursuant to Sec. 679.41(j), and in an IFQ regulatory area in which they 
do not hold QS other than CDQ compensation QS, may use that CDQ 
compensation QS on any catcher vessel. This exemption from catcher 
vessel categories ends upon the first transfer of the CDQ compensation 
QS. CDQ compensation QS being transferred will be permanently assigned 
to a specific catcher vessel category as designated by the person 
receiving the transfer.
    (2) Redesignated catcher vessel category (Applicable until February 
24, 1997). Catcher vessel QS transferred as partial or total 
consideration for the transfer of CDQ compensation QS may be 
redesignated into a new catcher vessel category if the CDQ compensation 
QS being transferred can be used on any catcher vessel pursuant to the 
exemption in paragraph (i)(1) of this section and the person to which 
that CDQ compensation QS was issued is party to the transfer.
    (3) CDQ compensation QS definition. For purposes of this paragraph 
(i), CDQ compensation QS is QS issued as compensation for halibut and 
sablefish harvest privileges foregone due to the CDQ Program, as 
provided in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (j) Compensation for CDQ allocations. (1) The Regional Administrator 
will compensate persons that receive a reduced halibut QS in IPHC 
regulatory areas 4B, 4C, 4D, or 4E because of the halibut CDQ program by 
adding halibut QS from IPHC regulatory areas 2C, 3A, 3B, and 4A. This 
compensation of halibut QS from areas 2C, 3A, 3B, and 4A will be 
allocated in proportion to the amount of halibut QS foregone due to the 
CDQ allocation authorized by this section.
    (2) The Regional Administrator will compensate persons that receive 
a reduced sablefish QS in any BSAI IFQ regulatory area because of the 
sablefish CDQ program by taking sablefish QS from the IFQ regulatory 
areas of the GOA and allocating it in proportion to the loss suffered by 
persons in the BSAI area. Such additional compensation of sablefish QS 
will be allocated in proportion to the amount of sablefish QS foregone 
due to the CDQ allocation authorized by this section.
    (3) Persons initially issued QS for IFQ regulatory areas in which a 
portion of the TAC is allocated to the CDQ Program will be compensated 
for halibut and sablefish harvest privileges foregone due to the CDQ 
Program. If a person does not hold QS in an IFQ regulatory area on the 
date the compensation is issued, that person's compensation will be 
issued as unblocked. If a person does hold QS in an IFQ regulatory area 
on the date compensation is issued, that person's compensation

[[Page 556]]

will be added to their existing QS in that IFQ regulatory area. The 
resulting QS amount will be blocked or unblocked according to the 
criteria found at Sec. 679.40(a). Compensation will be calculated for 
each non-CDQ area using the following formula:
Q<INF>N</INF> = (Q<INF>C</INF> x QSP<INF>N</INF> x RATE)/
(SUM<INF>CDQ</INF>- [RATE x SUM<INF>TAC</INF>]) 
([1-RATE] x TAC<INF>AVE</INF>)(QSP<INF>C</INF> x 
[CDQ <INF>PCT</INF>-RATE])

Where:

Q<INF>N</INF> = quota share in non-CDQ area
Q<INF>C</INF> = quota share in CDQ area
QSP<INF>N</INF> = quota share pool in non-CDQ area (as existing on 
          January 31, 1995)
RATE = SUM<INF>CDQ</INF>/average of the TAC (1988-1994) for all CDQ and 
          non-CDQ areas
TAC<INF>AVE</INF> = average of the TAC (1988-1994) for CDQ area
QSP<INF>C</INF> = quota share pool in CDQ area (as existing on January 
          31, 1995)
CDQ<INF>PCT</INF> = CDQ percentage for CDQ area
SUM<INF>CDQ</INF> = sum [TAC<INF>AVE</INF> x CDQ<INF>PCT</INF>]
SUM<INF>TAC</INF> = sum [TAC<INF>AVE</INF>]
    (k) Transfer to the surviving spouse. (1) On the death of an 
individual who holds QS or IFQ, the surviving spouse receives all QS and 
IFQ held by the decedent by right of survivorship, unless a contrary 
intent was expressed by the decedent in a will that is probated. The 
Regional Administrator will approve an Application for Transfer to the 
surviving spouse when sufficient evidence has been provided to verify 
the death of the individual.
    (2) The Regional Administrator will approve, for 3 calendar years 
following the date of death of an individual, an Application for 
Transfer of IFQ from the surviving spouse to a person eligible to 
receive IFQ under the provisions of this section, notwithstanding the 
limitations on transfers of IFQ in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 47368, Sept. 4, 1998, Sec. 679.41 was 
amended by revising the section heading and adding headings to 
paragraphs (e) (1) through (3), effective Oct. 5, 1998.


<R05>
Sec. 679.42  Limitations on use of QS and IFQ.

    (a) IFQ regulatory area and vessel category. The QS or IFQ specified 
for one IFQ regulatory area must not be used in a different IFQ 
regulatory area. Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section or 
in Sec. 679.41(i)(1) of this part, the IFQ assigned to one vessel 
category must not be used to harvest IFQ species on a vessel of a 
different vessel category. Notwithstanding Sec. 679.40(a)(5)(ii) of this 
part, IFQ assigned to vessel Category B must not be used on any vessel 
less than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA to harvest IFQ halibut in IFQ 
regulatory area 2C or IFQ sablefish in the IFQ regulatory area east of 
140 deg. W. long. unless such IFQ derives from blocked QS units that 
result in IFQ of less than 5,000 lb (2.3 mt), based on the 1996 TAC for 
fixed gear specified for the IFQ halibut fishery and the IFQ sablefish 
fishery in each of these two regulatory areas.
    (b) Gear--(1) IFQ Fisheries. Halibut IFQ must be used only to 
harvest halibut with fishing gear authorized in Sec. 679.2. Sablefish 
fixed gear IFQ must not be used to harvest sablefish with trawl gear in 
any IFQ regulatory area, or with pot gear in any IFQ regulatory area of 
the GOA.
    (2) Seabird avoidance gear and methods. The operator of a vessel 
using gear authorized at Sec. 679.2 while fishing for IFQ halibut or 
hook-and-line gear while fishing for IFQ sablefish must comply with 
requirements for seabird avoidance gear and methods set forth at 
Sec. 679.24(e).
    (c) Requirements and deductions. (1) Any individual who harvests 
halibut or sablefish with fixed gear must:
    (i) Have a valid IFQ card.
    (ii) Be aboard the vessel at all times during the fishing operation.
    (iii) Sign any required fish ticket.
    (iv) Sign the IFQ landing report required by 
Secs. 679.5(l)(2)(ii)(C) and (iii)(B).
    (2) The scale weight of the halibut or sablefish product actually 
measured at the time of landing, required by Sec. 679.5(l)(2)(vi) to be 
included in the IFQ landing report, shall be the only source of 
information used by NMFS to debit an IFQ account. An IFQ account will be 
debited as indicated in Table 3 to this part.
    (i) Sablefish product. [Reserved]
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) Halibut conversion factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Emergency waiver. The requirement of paragraph (c) of this 
section for an individual IFQ card holder to be aboard the vessel during 
fishing operations and to sign the IFQ landing report may be waived in 
the event of extreme personal emergency involving the IFQ user during a 
fishing trip. The waiving of these requirements shall apply only to IFQ 
halibut or IFQ sablefish retained on the fishing trip during which such 
emergency occurred.
    (e) Sablefish QS use. (1) No person, individually or collectively, 
may use an amount of sablefish QS greater than 1 percent of the combined 
total sablefish QS for the GOA and BSAI IFQ regulatory areas, unless the 
amount in excess of 1 percent was received in the initial allocation of 
QS.
    (2) In the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long., no person, 
individually or collectively, may use more than 1 percent of the total 
amount of QS for this area, unless the amount in excess of 1 percent was 
received in the initial allocation of QS.
    (f) Halibut QS use. Unless the amount in excess of the following 
limits was received in the initial allocation of halibut QS, no person, 
individually or collectively, may use more than:
    (1) IFQ regulatory area 2C. 599,799 units of halibut QS.
    (2) IFQ regulatory areas 2C, 3A, and 3B. 1,502,823 units of halibut 
QS.
    (3) IFQ regulatory areas 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and 4E. 495,044 units of 
halibut QS.
    (g) Limitations on QS blocks--(1) Number of blocks per species. (i) 
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, no person, 
individually or collectively, may hold more than two blocks for each 
species in any IFQ regulatory area.
    (ii) If that person, individually or collectively, holds unblocked 
QS for a species in an IFQ regulatory area, such person may only hold 
one QS block for that species in that IFQ regulatory area.
    (2) Holding or to hold blocks of QS. For purposes of this section, 
``holding'' or ``to hold'' blocks of QS means being registered by NMFS 
as the person who received QS by initial assignment or approved 
transfer.
    (h) Vessel limitations--(1) Halibut. (i) Except as provided in 
paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, no vessel may be used, during any 
fishing year, to harvest more than one-half percent of the combined 
total catch limits of halibut for IFQ regulatory areas 2C, 3A, 3B, 4A, 
4B, 4C, 4D, and 4E.
    (ii) In IFQ regulatory area 2C, no vessel may be used to harvest 
more than 1 percent of the halibut catch limit for this area.
    (2) Sablefish. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of 
this section, no vessel may be used, during any fishing year, to harvest 
more than 1 percent of the combined fixed gear TAC of sablefish for the 
GOA and BSAI IFQ regulatory areas.
    (ii) In the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long., no vessel 
may be used to harvest more than 1 percent of the fixed gear TAC of 
sablefish for this area.
    (3) Excess. A person who receives an approved IFQ allocation of 
halibut or sablefish in excess of these limitations may nevertheless 
catch and retain all of that IFQ with a single vessel. However, two or 
more persons may not catch and retain their IFQs with one vessel in 
excess of these limitations.
    (i) Use of IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, 
or D by individuals. In addition to the requirements of paragraph (c) of 
this section, IFQ cards issued for IFQ resulting from QS assigned to 
vessel categories B, C, or D must be used only by the individual who 
holds the QS from which the associated IFQ is derived, except as 
provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
    (1) An individual who receives an initial allocation of QS assigned 
to vessel categories B, C, or D does not have to be on board and sign 
IFQ landing reports if that individual owns the vessel on which IFQ 
sablefish or halibut are harvested, and is represented on the vessel by 
a master employed by the individual who received the initial allocation 
of QS.

[[Page 558]]

    (2) The exemption provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section does 
not apply to individuals who receive an initial allocation of QS 
assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D for halibut in IFQ regulatory 
area 2C or for sablefish QS in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. 
W. long., and this exemption is not transferrable.
    (j) Use of IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, 
or D by corporations and partnerships. A corporation or partnership that 
receives an initial allocation of QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, 
or D may use the IFQ resulting from that QS and any additional QS 
acquired within the limitations of this section provided the corporation 
or partnership owns the vessel on which its IFQ is used, and it is 
represented on the vessel by a master employed by the corporation or 
partnership that received the initial allocation of QS. This provision 
is not transferrable and does not apply to QS assigned to vessel 
categories B, C, or D for halibut in IFQ regulatory area 2C or for 
sablefish in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 deg. W. long. that is 
transferred to a corporation or partnership. Such transfers of 
additional QS within these areas must be to an individual pursuant to 
Sec. 679.41(c) of this part and be used pursuant to paragraphs (c) and 
(i) of this section.
    (1) A corporation or partnership, except for a publicly-held 
corporation, that receives an initial allocation of QS assigned to 
vessel categories B, C, or D loses the exemption provided under 
paragraph (j) of this section on the effective date of a change in the 
corporation or partnership from that which existed at the time of 
initial allocation.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph (j), ``a change in the 
corporation or partnership'' means the addition of any new 
shareholder(s) or partner(s), except that a court appointed trustee to 
act on behalf of a shareholder or partner who becomes incapacitated is 
not a change in the corporation or partnership.
    (3) The Regional Administrator must be notified of a change in a 
corporation or partnership as defined in this paragraph (j) within 15 
days of the effective date of the change. The effective date of change, 
for purposes of this paragraph (j), is the date on which the new 
shareholder(s) or partner(s) may realize any corporate liabilities or 
benefits of the corporation or partnership.
    (4) QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, or D and IFQ resulting 
from that QS held in the name of a corporation or partnership that 
changes, as defined in this paragraph, must be transferred to an 
individual, as prescribed in Sec. 679.41 of this part, before it may be 
used at any time after the effective date of the change.
    (k) Processing of fish other than IFQ halibut and IFQ sablefish. 
Fish other than IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish may be processed on a 
vessel on which persons:
    (1) Are authorized to harvest IFQ halibut or IFQ sablefish based on 
allocations of IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel category A; or
    (2) Are authorized to harvest IFQ sablefish based on allocations of 
IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel categories B or C unless any 
person aboard the vessel is authorized to harvest IFQ halibut based on 
allocations of IFQ resulting from QS assigned to vessel categories B, C, 
or D.

Sec. 679.43  Determinations and appeals.

    (a) General. This section describes the procedure for appealing 
initial administrative determinations made under this subpart as well as 
Sec. 679.4(c), Sec. 679.4(g), and portions of subpart C of this part 
that apply to the halibut and sablefish CDQ program.
    (b) Who may appeal. Any person whose interest is directly and 
adversely affected by an initial administrative determination may file a 
written appeal. For purposes of this section, such persons will be 
referred to as ``applicant'' or ``appellant.''
    (c) Submission of appeals. Appeals must be in writing and must be 
submitted in original form to the Regional Administrator. Contact the 
Regional Administrator for appeals address. Appeals transmitted by 
electronic means will not be accepted.
    (d) Timing of appeals. (1) If an applicant appeals an initial 
administrative determination, the appeal must be filed not later than 60 
days after the date the determination is issued.
    (2) The time period within which an appeal may be filed begins to 
run on the date the initial administrative determination is issued. If 
the last day of the time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal 
holiday, the time period will extend to the close of business on the 
next business day.
    (e) Address of record. NMFS will establish as the address of record 
the address used by the applicant in initial correspondence to Chief, 
RAM Division, after the application period has begun. Notifications of 
all actions affecting the applicant after establishing an address of 
record will be mailed to that address, unless the applicant provides 
NMFS, in writing, with any changes to that address. NMFS bears no 
responsibility if a notification is sent to the address of record and is 
not received because the applicant's actual address has changed without 
notification to NMFS.
    (f) Statement of reasons for appeals. Applicants must timely submit 
a full written statement in support of the appeal, including a concise 
statement of the reasons the initial administrative determination has a 
direct and adverse effect on the applicant and should be reversed or 
modified. If the applicant requests a hearing on any issue presented in 
the appeal, such request for hearing must be accompanied by a concise 
written statement raising genuine and substantial issues of adjudicative 
fact for resolution and a list of available and specifically identified 
reliable evidence upon which the factual issues can be resolved. The 
appellate officer will limit his/her review to the issues stated in the 
appeal; all issues not set out in the appeal will be waived.
    (g) Hearings. The appellate officer will review the applicant's 
appeal and request for hearing, and has discretion to proceed as 
follows:
    (1) Deny the appeal;
    (2) Issue a decision on the merits of the appeal, if the record 
contains sufficient information on which to reach final judgment; or
    (3) Order that a hearing be conducted. The appellate officer may so 
order only if the appeal demonstrates the following:
    (i) There is a genuine and substantial issue of adjudicative fact 
for resolution at a hearing. A hearing will not be ordered on issues of 
policy or law.
    (ii) The factual issue can be resolved by available and specifically 
identified reliable evidence. A hearing will not be ordered on the basis 
of mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and 
contentions.
    (iii) The evidence described in the request for hearing, if 
established at hearing, would be adequate to justify

[[Page 560]]

resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the applicant. A 
hearing will not be ordered if the evidence described is insufficient to 
justify the factual determination sought, even if accurate.
    (iv) Resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the 
applicant is adequate to justify the action requested. A hearing will 
not be ordered on factual issues that are not determinative with respect 
to the action requested.
    (h) Types of hearings. If the appellate officer determines that a 
hearing should be held to resolve one or more genuine and substantial 
issues of adjudicative fact, he/she may order:
    (1) A written hearing, as provided in paragraph (m) of this section; 
or
    (2) An oral hearing, as provided in paragraph (n) of this section.
    (i) Authority of the appellate officer. The appellate officer is 
vested with general authority to conduct all hearings in an orderly 
manner, including the authority to:
    (1) Administer oaths.
    (2) Call and question witnesses.
    (3) Issue a written decision based on the record.
    (j) Evidence. All evidence that is relevant, material, reliable, and 
probative may be included in the record. Formal rules of evidence do not 
apply to hearings conducted under this section.
    (k) Appellate officers' decisions. The appellate officer will close 
the record and issue a decision after determining there is sufficient 
information to render a decision on the record of the proceedings and 
that all procedural requirements have been met. The decision must be 
based solely on the record of the proceedings. Except as provided in 
paragraph (o) of this section, an appellate officer's decision takes 
effect 30 days after it is issued and, upon taking effect, is the final 
agency action for purposes of judicial review.
    (l) Disqualification of an appellate officer. (1) The appellate 
officer will withdraw from an appeal at any time he/she deems himself/
herself disqualified.
    (2) The appellate officer may withdraw from an appeal on an 
appellant's motion if:
    (i) The motion is entered prior to the appellate officer's issuance 
of a decision; and
    (ii) The appellant demonstrates that the appellate officer has a 
personal bias or any other basis for disqualification.
    (3) If the appellate officer denies a motion to withdraw, he/she 
will so rule on the record.
    (m) Written hearing. (1) An appellate officer may order a written 
hearing under paragraph (h)(1) of this section if he/she:
    (i) Orders a hearing as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section; and
    (ii) Determines that the issues to be resolved at hearing can be 
resolved by allowing the appellant to present written materials to

    (i) Provide the appellant with notification that a written hearing 
has been ordered.
    (ii) Provide the appellant with a statement of issues to be 
determined at hearing.
    (iii) Provide the appellant with 30 days to file a written response. 
The appellant may also provide documentary evidence to support his/her 
position. The period to file a written response may be extended at the 
sole discretion of the appellate officer, if the appellant shows good 
cause for the extension.
    (3) The appellate officer may, after reviewing the appellant's 
written response and documentary evidence:
    (i) Order that an oral hearing be held, as provided in paragraph 
(h)(2) of this section, to resolve issues that cannot be resolved 
through the written hearing process;
    (ii) Request supplementary evidence from the appellant before 
closing the record; or
    (iii) Close the record.
    (4) The appellate officer will close the record and issue a decision 
after determining that the information on the record is sufficient to 
render a decision.
    (n) Oral hearing. (1) The appellate officer may order an oral 
hearing under paragraphs (h)(2) and (m)(3)(i) of this section if he/she:
    (i) Orders a hearing as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section; and

will be held in Juneau, AK, at the prescribed date and time, unless the 
appellate officer determines, based upon good cause shown, that a 
different place, date, or time will better serve the interests of 
justice. A continuance of the oral hearing may be ordered at the sole 
discretion of the appellate officer if the appellant shows good cause 
for the continuance.
    (3) The appellate officer may, either at his/her own discretion or 
on the motion of the appellant, order a pre-hearing conference, either 
in person or telephonically, to consider:
    (i) The simplification of issues.
    (ii) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions of facts, 
and agreements to the introduction of documents.
    (iii) The possibility of settlement or other means to facilitate 
resolution of the case.
    (iv) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the 
proceedings.
    (4) The appellate officer must provide the appellant with 
notification of a pre-hearing conference, if one is ordered, at least 30 
days in advance of the conference. All action taken at the pre-hearing 
conference will be made part of the record.
    (5) At the beginning of the oral hearing, the appellate officer may 
first seek to obtain stipulations as to material facts and the issues 
involved and may state any other issues on which he/she may wish to have 
evidence presented. Issues to be resolved at the hearing will be limited 
to those identified by the appellate officer as provided in paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section. The appellant will then be given an opportunity 
to present his/her case.
    (6) During the oral hearing, the appellant has the right to present 
reliable and material oral or documentary evidence and to conduct such 
cross-examination as may be required in the interests of justice.

given time by the appellate officer to submit any supplementary 
information that may assist in the resolution of the case.
    (8) The appellate officer will close the record and issue a decision 
after determining that the information on the record is sufficient to 
render a decision.
    (o) Review by the Regional Administrator. An appellate officer's 
decision is subject to review by the Regional Administrator, as provided 
in this paragraph (o).
    (1) The Regional Administrator may affirm, reverse, modify, or 
remand the appellate officer's decision before the 30-day effective date 
of the decision provided in paragraph (k) of this section.
    (2) The Regional Administrator may take any of these actions on or 
after the 30-day effective date by issuing a stay of the decision before 
the 30-day effective date. An action taken under paragraph (o)(1) of 
this section takes effect immediately.
    (3) The Regional Administrator must provide a written explanation 
why an appellate officer's decision has been reversed, modified, or 
remanded.
    (4) The Regional Administrator must promptly notify the appellant(s) 
of any action taken under this paragraph (o).
    (5) The Regional Administrator's decision to affirm, reverse, or 
modify an appellate officer's decision is a final agency action for 
purposes of judicial review.
    (p) Issuance of a non-transferable license. A non-transferable 
license will be issued to a person upon acceptance of his or her appeal 
of an initial administrative determination denying an application for a 
license for license limitation groundfish or crab species under 
Sec. 679.4(i). This non-transferable license authorizes a person to 
conduct directed fishing for groundfish or directed fishing for crab 
species and will have specific endorsements and designations

                 Subpart E--Groundfish Observer Program

    Source: 61 FR 56431, Nov. 1, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 679.50  Groundfish Observer Program.

    (a) General. Operators of vessels possessing a Federal fisheries 
permit under Sec. 679.4(b)(1) and processors that possess a Federal 
processor permit under Sec. 679.4(f)(1), must comply with this section. 
The owner of a fishing vessel subject to this part or a processor 
subject to this part must ensure that the operator or manager complies 
with this section and is jointly and severally liable for such 
compliance. Observer coverage for the CDQ fisheries obtained in 
compliance with paragraphs (c)(4) and (d)(4) of this section may not be 
used to comply with observer coverage requirements for non-CDQ 
groundfish fisheries specified in this section.
    (b) Purpose. The purpose of the Groundfish Observer Program is to 
allow observers to collect Alaska fisheries data deemed by the Regional 
Administrator to be necessary and appropriate for management, compliance 
monitoring, and research of groundfish fisheries and for the 
conservation of marine resources or their environment.
    (c) Observer requirements for vessels. (1) Observer coverage is 
required as follows:
    (i) A mothership of any length that processes 1,000 mt or more in 
round-weight equivalent of groundfish during a calendar month is 
required to have an observer aboard the vessel each day it receives or 
processes groundfish during that month.
    (ii) A mothership of any length that processes from 500 mt to 1,000 
mt in round-weight equivalent of groundfish during a calendar month is 
required to have an observer aboard the vessel at least 30 percent of 
the days it receives or processes groundfish during that month.
    (iii) Each mothership that receives pollock harvested by catcher 
vessels in the catcher vessel operational area during the second pollock 
season that starts on September 1 under Sec. 679.23(e)(2) is required to 
have a second observer aboard, in addition to the observer required 
under paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, for each day of 
the second pollock season until the chum salmon savings area is closed 
under Sec. 679.21(e)(7)(vi), or October 15, whichever occurs first.
    (iv) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or 
longer must carry an observer during 100 percent of its fishing days 
except for a vessel fishing for groundfish with pot gear as provided in 
paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section.
    (v) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel equal to or greater than 
60 ft (18.3 m) LOA, but less than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA, that participates 
for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish in a 
calendar quarter must carry an observer during at least 30 percent of 
its fishing days in that calendar quarter and at all times during at 
least one fishing trip in that calendar quarter for each of the 
groundfish fishery categories defined under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section in which the vessel participates.
    (vi) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel fishing with hook-and-
line gear that is required to carry an observer

[[Page 563]]

under paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section must carry an observer during 
at least one entire fishing trip using hook-and-line gear in the Eastern 
Regulatory Area of the GOA during each calendar quarter in which the 
vessel participates in a directed fishery for groundfish in the Eastern 
Regulatory Area using hook-and-line gear.
    (vii) A catcher/processor or catcher vessel equal to or greater than 
60 ft (18.3 m) LOA fishing with pot gear that participates for more than 
3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish in a calendar 
quarter must carry an observer during at least 30 percent of its fishing 
days while using pot gear in that calendar quarter and during at least 
one entire fishing trip using pot gear in a calendar quarter for each of 
the groundfish fishery categories defined under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section in which the vessel participates.
    (viii) Red King Crab Savings Area. (A) Any catcher/processor or 
catcher vessel used to fish for groundfish in the Red King Crab Savings 
area must carry an observer during 100 percent of its fishing days in 
which the vessel uses pelagic trawl gear, pot, jig, or longline gear.
    (B) Any catcher/processor or catcher vessel used to fish for 
groundfish in the Red King Crab Savings Subarea and subject to this 
subarea being open to vessels fishing for groundfish with non-pelagic 
trawl gear under Sec. 679.21(e)(3)(ii)(B), must carry an observer during 
100 percent of its fishing days in which the vessel uses non-pelagic 
trawl gear.
    (ix) Nearshore Bristol Bay Trawl Closure. Any catcher/processor or 
catcher vessel used to fish for groundfish in the Nearshore Bristol Bay 
Trawl Closure area must carry an observer during 100 percent of its 
fishing days in which the vessel uses trawl gear.
    (2) Groundfish fishery categories requiring separate coverage. 
Directed fishing for groundfish, during any fishing trip, that results:
    (i) Pollock fishery. In a retained catch of pollock that is greater 
than the retained catch of any other groundfish species or species group 
that is specified as a separate groundfish fishery under this paragraph 
(c)(2).
    (ii) Pacific cod fishery. In a retained catch of Pacific cod that is 
greater than the retained catch of any other groundfish species or 
species group that is specified as a separate groundfish fishery under 
this paragraph (c)(2).
    (iii) Sablefish fishery. In a retained catch of sablefish that is 
greater than the retained catch of any other groundfish species or 
species group that is specified as a separate groundfish fishery under 
this paragraph (c)(2).
    (iv) Rockfish fishery. In a retained aggregate catch of rockfish 
that is greater than the retained catch of any other groundfish species 
or species group that is specified as a separate groundfish fishery 
under this paragraph (c)(2).
    (v) Flatfish fishery. In a retained aggregate catch of all flatfish 
species, except Pacific halibut, that is greater than the retained catch 
of any other groundfish species or species group that is specified as a 
separate groundfish fishery under this paragraph (c)(2).
    (vi) Other species fishery. In a retained catch of groundfish that 
does not qualify as a pollock, Pacific cod, sablefish, rockfish, or 
flatfish fishery as defined under paragraphs (c)(2) (i) through (v) of 
this section.
    (3) Assignment of vessels to fisheries. At the end of any fishing 
trip, a vessel's retained catch of groundfish species or species groups 
for which a TAC has been specified under Sec. 679.20, in round-weight 
equivalent, will determine to which fishery category listed under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section the vessel is assigned.
    (i) Catcher/processors. A catcher/processor will be assigned to a 
fishery category based on the retained groundfish catch composition 
reported on the vessel's weekly production report submitted to the 
Regional Administrator under Sec. 679.5(i).
    (ii) Catcher vessel delivery in Federal waters. A catcher vessel 
that delivers to a mothership in Federal waters will be assigned to a 
fishery category based on the retained groundfish catch composition 
reported on the weekly production report submitted to the Regional 
Administrator for that week by the mothership under Sec. 679.5(i).

[[Page 564]]

    (iii) Catcher vessel delivery in Alaska State waters. A catcher 
vessel that delivers groundfish to a shoreside processor or to a 
mothership processor vessel in Alaska State waters will be assigned to a 
fishery category based on the retained groundfish catch composition 
reported on one or more ADF&G fish tickets as required under Alaska 
Statutes at A.S. 16.05.690.
    (4) Groundfish CDQ fisheries. Except as provided for under 
Sec. 679.32(e), the owner or operator of a vessel groundfish CDQ fishing 
as defined at Sec. 679.2 must comply with the following minimum observer 
coverage requirements each day that the vessel is used to harvest, 
transport, process, deliver, or take deliveries of CDQ or PSQ species. 
The time required for the CDQ observer to complete sampling, data 
recording, and data communication duties shall not exceed 12 hours in 
each 24-hour period and the CDQ observer is required to sample no more 
than 9 hours in each 24-hour period.
    (i) Motherships or catcher/processors using trawl gear. A mothership 
or catcher/processor using trawl gear must have at least two CDQ 
observers as described at paragraphs (h)(1)(i)(D) and (E) of this 
section aboard the vessel, at least one of whom must be certified as a 
lead CDQ observer.
    (ii) Catcher/processors using hook-and-line gear. A catcher/
processor using hook-and-line gear must have at least two CDQ observers 
as described at paragraphs (h)(1)(i)(D) and (E) of this section aboard 
the vessel, unless NMFS approves a CDP authorizing the vessel to carry 
only one CDQ observer. At least one of the CDQ observers must be 
certified as a lead CDQ observer. A CDP authorizing the vessel to carry 
only one lead CDQ observer may be approved by NMFS if the CDQ group 
supplies vessel logbook or observer data that demonstrates that one CDQ 
observer can sample each CDQ set for species composition in one 12-hour 
shift per fishing day. NMFS will not approve a CDP that would require 
the observer to divide a 12-hour shift into shifts of less than 6 hours.
    (iii) Catcher/processors using pot gear. A catcher/processor using 
pot gear must have at least one lead CDQ observer as described at 
paragraph (h)(1)(i)(E) of this section aboard the vessel.
    (iv) Catcher vessel. A catcher vessel equal to or greater than 60 ft 
(18.29 m) LOA, except a catcher vessel that delivers only unsorted 
codends to a processor or another vessel, must have at least one lead 
CDQ observer as described at paragraph (h)(1)(i)(E) of this section 
aboard the vessel.
    (d) Observer requirements for shoreside processors. Observer 
coverage is required as follows. A shoreside processor that:
    (1) Processes 1,000 mt or more in round-weight equivalent of 
groundfish during a calendar month is required to have an observer 
present at the facility each day it receives or processes groundfish 
during that month.
    (2) Processes 500 mt to 1,000 mt in round-weight equivalent of 
groundfish during a calendar month is required to have an observer 
present at the facility at least 30 percent of the days it receives or 
processes groundfish during that month.
    (3) Offloads pollock at more than one location on the same dock and 
has distinct and separate equipment at each location to process those 
pollock and that receives pollock harvested by catcher vessels in the 
catcher vessel operational area during the second pollock season that 
starts on September 1, under Sec. 679.23(e)(2), is required to have an 
observer, in addition to the observer required under paragraphs (d) (1) 
and (2) of this section, at each location where pollock is offloaded, 
for each day of the second pollock season until the chum salmon savings 
area is closed under Sec. 679.21(e)(7)(vi), or October 15, whichever 
occurs first.
    (4) Groundfish CDQ fisheries. Each shoreside processor required to 
have a Federal processor permit under Sec. 679.4(f) and taking 
deliveries of CDQ or PSQ from vessels groundfish CDQ fishing as defined 
at Sec. 679.2 must have at least one lead CDQ observer as described at 
paragraph (h)(1)(i)(E) of this section present at all times while CDQ is 
being received or processed. The time required for the CDQ observer to 
complete sampling, data recording, and data communication duties shall 
not exceed 12 hours in each 24-hour period, and the CDQ observer is 
required to

[[Page 565]]

sample no more than 9 hours in each 24-hour period.
    (e) Inseason adjustments in observer coverage requirements.
    (1) The Regional Administrator may adjust the observer coverage 
requirements set out under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section at any 
time to improve the accuracy, reliability, and availability of observer 
data, so long as the changes are based on one or more of the following:
    (i) A finding that fishing methods, times, or areas, or catch or 
bycatch composition for a specific fishery or fleet component have 
changed significantly, or are likely to change significantly.
    (ii) A finding that such modifications are necessary to improve data 
availability or quality in order to meet specific fishery management 
objectives.
    (2) Procedure. Observer coverage requirements may be adjusted in 
accordance with Sec. 679.25(c). NMFS must publish changes in observer 
coverage requirements in the Federal Register, with the reasons for the 
changes and any special instructions to vessels or shoreside processors 
required to carry observers, at least 10 calendar days prior to their 
effective date.
    (f) Responsibilities--(1) Vessel responsibilities. An operator of a 
vessel required to carry one or more observers must:
    (i) Accommodations and food. Provide, at no cost to observers or the 
United States, accommodations and food on the vessel for the observer or 
observers that are equivalent to those provided for officers, engineers,

    (j) Suspension and Decertification Process--(1) Applicability. This 
paragraph (j) sets forth the procedures for suspension and 
decertification of observers and observer contractors under this 
section.
    (2) Policy. (i) NMFS must certify responsible and qualified 
observers and observer contractors only. Suspension and decertification 
are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with this section, 
are appropriate means to effectuate this policy.

[[Page 571]]

    (ii) The serious nature of suspension and decertification requires 
that these actions be taken only in the public interest for the 
promotion of fishery conservation and management and not for purposes of 
punishment. NMFS may impose suspension or decertification only for the 
causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.
    (iii) In addition to suspension and decertification, observers and 
observer contractors who violate provisions of this part may be subject 
to penalties, fines, and other sanctions as authorized by law.
    (3) Public availability of suspension or decertification records. 
Public availability of suspension or decertification records will depend 
upon the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and other 
applicable law.
    (4) Effect and timing of suspension or decertification. (i) 
Observers or observer contractors decertified or suspended must not 
provide services prescribed by this section to vessels and shoreside 
processors.
    (ii) Suspension and decertification actions may be combined and 
imposed simultaneously.
    (iii) Suspension or decertification of observer contractors includes 
all divisions or other organizational elements of observer contractors, 
unless the suspension or decertification decision is limited by its 
terms to specific divisions or organizational elements. The suspending 
or decertifying official may, at his or her sole discretion, include any 
affiliates of observer contractors if they are specifically named and 
given written notice of the suspension or proposed decertification and 
an opportunity to respond under paragraph (j)(5)(iii)(B) or 
(j)(6)(iii)(C) of this section.
    (5) Suspension--(i) General. (A) The suspending official may, in the 
public interest, suspend observers or observer contractors for any of 
the causes in paragraph (j)(5)(ii) of this section, using the procedures 
in paragraph (j)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (B) Suspension may be imposed on the basis of adequate evidence, 
pending the completion of investigation or legal proceedings, when NMFS 
determines that immediate action is necessary. In assessing the adequacy 
of the evidence, the suspending official should consider how much 
information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, 
whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what 
inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result.
    (ii) Causes for suspension. The suspending official may suspend 
observers or observer contractors:
    (A) Upon a determination, based upon adequate evidence, that 
observers or observer contractors committed any acts or omissions 
constituting a cause for decertification under paragraph (j)(6)(ii) of 
this section; or
    (B) Upon indictment for any of the causes for decertification in 
(j)(6)(ii)(A)(1) or (j)(6)(ii)(B)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Procedures--(A) Review. The suspending official must review 
all available evidence and must promptly determine whether or not to 
proceed with suspension. The suspending official may refer the matter to 
the NMFS investigator for further investigation, or to the decertifying 
officer.
    (B) Notice of suspension. When observers or observer contractors and 
any specifically named affiliates are suspended, they must be 
immediately advised personally or by certified mail, return receipt 
requested, at the last known residence or place of business:
    (1) That they have been suspended and that the suspension is based 
on an indictment or other adequate evidence that observers or observer 
contractors have committed acts or omissions constituting grounds for 
suspension under (j)(5)(ii) of this section. Such acts or omissions may 
be described in terms sufficient to place observers or observer 
contractors on notice without disclosing NMFS' evidence.
    (2) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation and such decertification proceedings as 
may ensue.
    (3) Of the cause(s) relied upon under paragraph (j)(5)(ii) of this 
section for imposing suspension.
    (4) Of the effect of the suspension.
    (5) That, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the observers 
or observer contractors may submit, in writing, documentary evidence and 
argument in

[[Page 572]]

opposition to the suspension, including any additional specific 
documentary evidence that raises a genuine dispute over the material 
facts.
    (6) That additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts 
may be conducted unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment; or
    (ii) A determination is made, on the basis of NOAA General Counsel 
advice, that the substantial interests of the government in pending or 
contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension 
would be prejudiced.
    (C) Dispute. For suspensions not based on an indictment, if NMFS 
determines that the observers' or observer contractors' submission in 
opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the 
suspension and if no determination has been made, on the basis of NOAA 
General Counsel advice, that substantial interests of the government in 
pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the 
suspension would be prejudiced, the suspending official:
    (1) Must afford observers or observer contractors an opportunity to 
submit additional documentary evidence upon a showing that such 
documentary evidence was unavailable during the 30-day period following 
receipt of the notice of suspension.
    (2) May, at his or her sole discretion, afford observers or observer 
contractors an opportunity to appear in person, present witnesses, and 
confront any person NMFS presents. The suspending official must make an 
audio tape of the proceedings and make a copy available at cost to 
observers or observer contractors upon request, unless observers or 
observer contractors and NMFS, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for an audio tape.
    (D) Suspending official's decision. (1) The suspending official's 
decision must be based on all the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by observers or observer 
contractors on action based on an indictment:
    (i) In which observers or observer contractors' submissions do not 
raise a genuine dispute over material facts; or
    (ii) In which additional proceedings to determine disputed material 
facts have been denied on the basis of NOAA General Counsel advice.
    (2) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary as to 
disputed material facts, written findings of fact must be prepared. The 
suspending official must base the decision on the facts as found, 
together with any information and argument submitted by observers or 
observer contractors and any other information in the administrative 
record.
    (3) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part.
    (4) The suspending official's decision must be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (5) Prompt written notice of the suspending official's decision to 
affirm, modify, or terminate the notice of suspension issued under this 
paragraph (j)(5) must be served on observers or observer contractors and 
any affiliates involved, personally or by certified mail, return receipt 
requested, at the last known residence or place of business.
    (E) Period of suspension. (1) Suspension is for a temporary period 
pending the completion of any investigation and any ensuing legal 
proceedings or decertification proceedings, including any administrative 
review under paragraph (j)(7) of this section, unless sooner terminated 
by the suspending official or as provided under this paragraph (j). If 
suspension is in effect, the decertifying official will expedite any 
related decertification proceedings.
    (2) If legal proceedings or decertification proceedings are not 
initiated within 12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the 
suspension must be terminated.
    (F) Scope of suspension for observer contractors. The scope of 
suspension must be the same as that for decertification under paragraph 
(j)(6)(v), except that the procedures set out under paragraph (j)(5) 
must be used in imposing suspension.

[[Page 573]]

    (6) Decertification--(i) General. The decertifying official may, in 
the public interest, decertify observers or observer contractors for any 
of the causes in paragraph (j)(6)(ii) of this section using the 
procedures in paragraph (j)(6)(iii) of this section. The existence of a 
cause for decertification does not necessarily require that observers or 
observer contractors be decertified; the seriousness of the acts or 
omissions and any mitigating factors should be considered in making any 
decertification decision. The existence or nonexistence of any 
mitigating factors is not necessarily determinative of an observers' or 
observer contractors' present fitness. Accordingly, if a cause for 
decertification exists, observers or observer contractors have the 
burden of demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the decertifying 
official, present fitness and that decertification is not necessary.
    (ii) Causes for decertification--(A) Observers. (1) The decertifying 
official may decertify observers for a conviction of or civil judgment 
for the following:
    (i) Commission of fraud or other violation in connection with 
obtaining or attempting to obtain certification, or in performing the 
duties of observers as prescribed by NMFS;
    (ii) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, 
falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or 
receiving stolen property; or
    (iii) Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of integrity 
or honesty that seriously and directly affects the present fitness of 
observers.
    (2) The decertifying official may decertify observers, based upon a 
preponderance of the evidence, upon a determination that observers have:
    (i) Failed to satisfactorily perform the duties of observers as 
prescribed by NMFS; or
    (ii) Failed to abide by the standards of conduct for observers as 
prescribed under paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
    (B) Observer contractors. (1) The decertifying official may 
decertify observer contractors for a conviction of or civil judgment for 
the following:
    (i) Commission of fraud or other violation in connection with 
obtaining or attempting to obtain certification, or in performing the 
responsibilities and duties of observer contractors as prescribed under 
paragraph (i)(2) of this section;
    (ii) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, 
falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or 
receiving stolen property; or
    (iii) Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of business 
integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the 
present fitness of observer contractors.
    (2) The decertifying official may decertify observer contractors, 
based upon a preponderance of the evidence, upon a determination that 
observer contractors have:
    (i) Failed to satisfactorily perform the responsibilities and duties 
of observer contractors as prescribed under paragraph (i)(2) of this 
section; or
    (ii) A conflict of interest as set out under paragraph (i)(3) of 
this section.
    (iii) Procedures--(A) Investigation and referral. NMFS personnel 
must promptly report to the NMFS investigator matters appropriate for 
further investigation. The NMFS investigator must investigate matters so 
referred and submit the investigative material to the decertifying 
official or, if appropriate, to the suspending official.
    (B) Review. The decertifying official must review all available 
evidence and must promptly determine whether or not to proceed with 
decertification. The decertifying official may refer the matter to the 
NMFS investigator for further investigation or, if appropriate, to the 
suspending official.
    (C) Notice of proposed decertification. If the decertifying official 
determines to proceed with decertification, he or she must serve a 
notice of proposed decertification upon observers or observer 
contractors and any specifically named affiliates, personally or by 
certified mail, return receipt requested, at the last known residence or 
place of business, advising:
    (1) That decertification is being considered.
    (2) Of the reasons for the proposed decertification in terms 
sufficient to put observers or observer contractors on

[[Page 574]]

notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which it is based.
    (3) Of the cause(s) relied upon under paragraph (j)(6)(ii) of this 
section for proposing decertification.
    (4) That, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, observers or 
observer contractors may submit, in writing, documentary evidence and 
argument in opposition to the proposed decertification, including any 
additional specific documentary evidence that raises a genuine dispute 
over the material facts.
    (5) Of NMFS' procedures governing decertification decision making.
    (6) Of the effect of the issuance of the notice of proposed 
decertification.
    (7) Of the potential effect of an actual decertification.
    (D) Dispute. In actions not based upon a conviction or civil 
judgment, if it is found that observers' or observer contractors' 
submissions raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed 
decertification, the decertifying official:
    (1) Must afford observers or observer contractors an opportunity to 
submit additional documentary evidence upon a showing that such 
documentary evidence was unavailable during the 30-day period following 
receipt of the notice of proposed decertification.
    (2) May, at his or her sole discretion, afford observers or observer 
contractors an opportunity to appear in person, present witnesses, and 
confront any person NMFS presents. The decertifying official must make 
an audio tape of the proceedings and make a copy available at cost to 
observers or observer contractors upon request, unless observers or 
observer contractors and NMFS, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for an audio tape.
    (E) Decertifying official's decision. (1) In actions based upon a 
conviction or judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over 
material facts, the decertifying official must make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by observers or observer contractors. The decision must 
be made after receipt of any timely information and argument submitted 
by observers or observer contractors.
    (2) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary as to 
disputed material facts, written findings of fact must be prepared. The 
decertifying official must base the decision on the facts as found, 
together with any information and argument submitted by observers or 
observer contractors and any other information in the administrative 
record.
    (3) The decertifying official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The 
decertifying official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part.
    (4) The decertifying official's decision must be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (5) In any action in which the proposed decertification is not based 
upon a conviction or civil judgment, the cause for decertification may 
be established by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (F) Notice of decertifying official's decision. (1) If the 
decertifying official decides to impose decertification, observers or 
observer contractors and any affiliates involved must be given prompt 
notice personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the 
last known residence or place of business. Such notice must:
    (i) Refer to the notice of proposed decertification.
    (ii) Specify the reasons for decertification.
    (iii) Advise that the decertification is effective immediately, 
unless the decertifying official determines that there is a compelling 
reason for maintaining certification for a specified period under 
conditions and restrictions necessary and appropriate to protect the 
public interest or promote fishery conservation and management and 
states the reasons in the notice.
    (2) If decertification is not imposed, the decertifying official 
must promptly notify observers or observer contractors and any 
affiliates involved, by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the 
last known residence or place of business.

[[Page 575]]

    (iv) Period of decertification. (A) Decertification must be in force 
indefinitely or until rescinded.
    (B) The decertifying official may rescind decertification, upon 
observers' or observer contractors' request, supported by documentation, 
for reasons such as:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
decertification was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the decertification was 
imposed; or
    (5) Other reasons the decertifying official deems appropriate.
    (v) Scope of decertification. (A) The improper conduct of any 
officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual 
associated with observer contractors may be imputed to the observer 
contractors when the conduct occurred in connection with the performance 
of duties for or on behalf of observer contractors, or with observer 
contractors' knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. Observer contractors' 
acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct must be evidence of 
such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
    (B) The improper conduct of observer contractors may be imputed to 
any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other 
individual associated with observer contractors who participated in, 
knew of, or had reason to know of the observer contractors' conduct.
    (7) Administrative review of suspension or decertification.
    (i) Observers or observer contractors may petition for review of a 
suspension decision issued under paragraph (j)(5)(iii) of this section 
or a decertification decision issued under paragraph (j)(6)(iii) of this 
section within 30 days after the date the decision was served. The 
petition must be addressed to the appeals officer identified in the 
notice of suspension or decertification. Any petitioned suspension will 
remain in effect pending the appeals officer's written decision to 
affirm, modify or terminate the suspension.
    (ii) Administrative review is discretionary. Petitions for 
discretionary review may be filed only upon one or more of the following 
grounds:
    (A) A finding of material fact is clearly erroneous based upon the 
administrative record;
    (B) A substantial and important question of policy or discretion is 
involved; or
    (C) A prejudicial error has occurred.
    (iii) If the appeals officer declines review based on the written 
petition, observers or observer contractors must be immediately advised 
of the decision to decline review personally or by certified mail, 
return receipt requested, at the last known residence or place of 
business.
    (iv) If the appeals officer grants review based on the written 
petition, he or she may request further written explanation from 
observers, observer contractors, or the decertifying officer or 
suspending officer. The appeals officer will then render a written 
decision to affirm, modify, or terminate the suspension or 
decertification or return the matter to the suspending or decertifying 
official for further findings. The appeals officer must base the 
decision on the administrative records compiled under paragraphs (j)(5) 
or (j)(6) of this section, as appropriate. The appeals officer will 
serve the decision on observers or observer contractors and any 
affiliates involved, personally or by certified mail, return receipt 
requested, at the last known residence or place of business.
    (v) An appeals officer's decision imposing suspension, or 
decertification or an unpetitioned suspending, or decertifying 
official's decision is the final administrative decision of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce.
    (k) Release of observer data to the public--(1) Summary of weekly 
data. The following information collected by observers for each catcher 
processor and catcher vessel during any weekly reporting period may be 
made available to the public:
    (i) Vessel name and Federal permit number.
    (ii) Number of chinook salmon and ``other salmon'' observed.
    (iii) The ratio of total round weight of halibut or Pacific herring

                             1. Introduction

    (a) This appendix to part 679 contains the performance and technical 
requirements for scales to be approved by NMFS for use to weigh, at sea, 
catch from the groundfish fisheries off Alaska. The performance and 
technical requirements in this document have not been reviewed or 
endorsed by the National Conference on Weights and Measures. Regulations 
implementing the requirements of this appendix and additional 
requirements for and with respect to scales used to weigh catch at sea 
are found at 50 CFR 679.28(b).
    (b) Revisions, amendments, or additions to this appendix may be made 
after notice and opportunity for public comments. Send requests for 
revisions, amendments, or additions to the Sustainable Fisheries 
Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802.
    (c) Types of Scales Covered by Appendix--This appendix contains 
performance and technical requirements for belt, automatic hopper, 
platform, and hanging scales.

[[Page 578]]

    (d) Testing and Approval of Scales Used to Weigh Catch at Sea--
Scales used to weigh catch at sea are required to comply with four 
categories of performance and technical requirements: (1) Type 
evaluation; (2) initial inspection after installation while the vessel 
is tied up at a dock and is not under power at sea; (3) annual 
reinspection while the vessel is tied up at a dock and is not under 
power at sea; and (4) daily at-sea tests of the scale's accuracy. This 
appendix contains only the performance and technical requirements for 
type evaluation and initial and annual reinspections by an authorized 
scale inspector.

                             2. Belt Scales

    2.1  Applicability. The requirements in this section apply to a 
scale or scale system that employs a conveyor belt in contact with a 
weighing element to determine the weight of a bulk commodity being 
conveyed across the scale.
    2.2  Performance Requirements--2.2.1 Maximum Permissible Errors. For 
laboratory tests of a scale and initial inspections and annual 
reinspections of an installed scale when the vessel is tied up at a dock 
and is not under power at sea, the following maximum permissible errors 
(MPEs) are specified:
    2.2.1.1  Laboratory Tests. See annex A to this appendix A for 
procedures for disturbance tests and influence factors.
    a. Disturbances. <plus-minus>0.18 percent of the weight of the load 
totalized.
    b. Influence Factors. <plus-minus>0.25 percent of the weight of the 
load totalized.
    c. Temperature Effect at Zero Flow Rate. The difference between the 
values obtained at zero flow rate taken at temperatures that differ by 
10 deg. C <plus-minus>0.2 deg. C must not be greater than 0.035 percent 
of the weight of the load totalized at the maximum flow-rate for the 
time of the test.
    2.2.1.2  Zero Load Tests. For zero load tests conducted in a 
laboratory or on a scale installed on a vessel and conducted when the 
vessel is tied up at a dock and not under power at sea, <plus-minus>0.1 
percent of the value of the minimum totalized load or 1 scale division 
(d), whichever is greater.
    2.2.1.3  Material Tests. For material tests conducted in a 
laboratory or on a scale installed on a vessel and conducted when the 
vessel is tied up at a dock and not under power at sea, <plus-minus>1.0 
percent of the known weight of the test material.
    2.2.2  Minimum Flow Rate (Qmin). The minimum flow rate must be 
specified by the manufacturer and must not be greater than 35 percent of 
the rated capacity of the scale in kilograms per hour (kg/hr) or metric 
tons per hour (mt/hr).
    2.2.3  Minimum Totalized Load (<greek-S>min). The minimum totalized 
load must not be less than the greater of--
    a. Two percent of the load totalized in 1 hour at the maximum flow 
rate;
    b. The load obtained at the maximum flow rate in 1 revolution of the 
belt; or
    c. A load equal to 800 scale divisions (d).
    2.2.4  Influence Quantities. The following requirements apply to 
influence factor tests conducted in the laboratory.
    2.2.4.1  Temperature. A belt scale must comply with the performance 
and technical requirements at a range of temperatures from -10 deg. C to 
+40 deg. C. However, for special applications the temperature range may 
be different, but the range must not be less than 30 deg. C and must be 
so specified on the scale's descriptive markings.
    2.2.4.2  Power Supply. A belt scale must comply with the performance 
and technical requirements when operated within a range of -15 percent 
to +10 percent of the power supply specified on the scale's descriptive 
markings.
    2.3.1  Technical Requirements.
    2.3.1  Indicators and Printers.
    2.3.1.1  General. A belt scale must be equipped with an indicator 
capable of displaying both the weight of fish in each haul or set and 
the cumulative weight of all fish or other material weighed on the scale 
between annual inspections (``the cumulative weight''), a rate of flow 
indicator, and a printer. The indications and printed representations 
must be clear, definite, accurate, and easily read under all conditions 
of normal operation of the belt scale.
    2.3.1.2  Values Defined. If indications or printed representations 
are intended to have specific values, these must be defined by a 
sufficient number of figures, words, or symbols, uniformly placed with 
reference to the indications or printed representations and as close as 
practicable to the indications or printed representations but not so 
positioned as to interfere with the accuracy of reading.
    2.3.1.3  Units. The weight of each haul or set must be indicated in 
kilograms, and the cumulative weight must be indicated in either 
kilograms or metric tons and decimal subdivisions.
    2.3.1.4  Value of the Scale Division. The value of the scale 
division (d) expressed in a unit of weight must be equal to 1, 2, or 5, 
or a decimal multiple or sub-multiple of 1, 2, or 5.
    2.3.1.5  Range of Indication. The range of the weight indications 
and printed values for each haul or set must be from 0 kg to 999,999 kg 
and for the cumulative weight must be from 0 to 99,999 metric tons.
    2.3.1.6  Resettable and Non-resettable Values. The means to indicate 
the weight of fish in each haul or set must be resettable to zero. The 
means to indicate the cumulative weight must not be resettable to zero 
without breaking a security means and must be reset only upon direction 
of NMFS or an authorized scale inspector.

[[Page 579]]

    2.3.1.7  Rate of Flow Indicator. Permanent means must be provided to 
produce an audio or visual signal when the rate of flow is less than the 
minimum flow rate or greater than 98 percent of the maximum flow rate.
    2.3.1.8  Printed Information. The information printed must include--
    a. For catch weight:
    i. The vessel name;
    ii. The Federal fisheries or processor permit number of the vessel;
    iii. The haul or set number;
    iv. The month, day, year, and time (to the nearest minute) weighing 
catch from the haul or set started;
    v. The month, day, year, and time (to the nearest minute) weighing 
catch from the haul or set ended;
    vi. The total weight of catch in each haul or set;
    vii. The total cumulative weight of all fish or other material 
weighed on the scale; and
    viii. The date and time the information is printed.
    b. For the audit trail:
    i. The vessel name;
    ii. The Federal fisheries or processor permit number of the vessel;
    iii. The date and time (to the nearest minute) that the adjustment 
was made;
    iv. The name or type of adjustment being made; and
    v. The initial and final values of the parameter being changed.
    2.3.1.9  Permanence of Markings. All required indications, markings, 
and instructions must be distinct and easily readable and must be of 
such character that they will not tend to become obliterated or 
illegible.
    2.3.1.10  Power Loss. In the event of a power failure, means must be 
provided to retain in a memory the weight of fish in each haul or set 
for which a printed record has not yet been made, the cumulative weight, 
and the information on the audit trail.
    2.3.1.11  Adjustable Components. An adjustable component that when 
adjusted affects the performance or accuracy of the scale must be held

automatic operation. (See definition of hopper scale).
    Belt scale--A scale that employs a conveyor belt in contact with a 
weighing element to determine the weight of a bulk commodity being 
conveyed. It is generally a part of a system consisting of an input 
conveyor, the flow scale, and an output conveyor. The conveyor belt may 
be constructed of various materials, including vulcanized rubber, 
canvas, and plastic. The capacity is generally specified in terms of the

 Annex A to Appendix A to Part 679--Influence Quantity and Disturbance 
                                  Tests

    A.1  General--Included in this annex are tests that are intended to 
ensure that electronic scales can perform and function as intended in 
the environment and under the conditions specified. Each test indicates, 
where appropriate, the reference condition under which the intrinsic 
error is determined.
    A.2  Test Considerations
    A.2.1  All electronic scales of the same category must be subjected 
to the same performance test program.
    A.2.2  Tests must be carried out on fully operational equipment in 
its normal operational state. When equipment is connected in other than 
a normal configuration, the procedure must be mutually agreed to by NMFS 
and the applicant.
    A.2.3  When the effect of one factor is being evaluated, all other 
factors must be held relatively constant, at a value close to normal. 
The temperature is deemed to be relatively constant when the difference 
between the extreme temperatures noted during the test does not exceed 
5 deg. C and the variation over time does not exceed 5 deg. C per hour.
    A.2.4 Before the start of a test, the equipment under test (EUT) 
must be energized for a period of time at least equal to the warm-up 
time specified by the manufacturer. The EUT must remain energized 
throughout the duration of the test.

                        Test procedure in brief:

    A capacitor of 150 pF is charged by a suitable DC voltage source. 
The capacitor is then discharged through the EUT by connecting one 
terminal to ground (chassis) and the other via 150 ohms to surfaces 
which are normally accessible to the operator. This test is conducted 
during a weighing operation consisting of the following:
    For belt scales--while totalizing at the maximum flow rate at least 
the <greek-S><INF>min</INF> (or a time sufficient to complete the test).
    For platform, hanging, and automatic hopper scales--test with one 
small test load or simulated load.

                             Test severities

    Air Discharge: up to and including 8 kV.
    Contact Discharge: up to and including 6 kV.
    Number of test cycles: At least 10 discharges must be applied at 
intervals of at least 10 seconds between discharges.

                      Maximum allowable variations:

    The difference between the indication due to the disturbance and the 
indication without the disturbance either must not exceed the values 
indicated in sections 2.2.1.1 b., 3.2.1.1 b., and 4.2.1.1 b. of this 
appendix, or the EUT must detect and act upon a significant fault.
    Conduct of the test: Refer to the IEC Publication mentioned in 
section A.4 Bibliography (d) for detailed test procedures.
    Supplementary information to the IEC test procedures.
    Preconditioning: None required.

                            Condition of EUT:

    a. The EUT without a ground terminal must be placed on a grounded 
plate which projects beyond the EUT by at least 0.1 m on all sides. The 
ground connection to the capacitor must be as short as possible.
    b. Normal power supplied and ``on'' for a time period equal to or 
greater than the warm-up time specified by the manufacturer. Power is to 
be ``on'' for the duration of the test.
    c. The EUT must be operating under standard atmospheric conditions 
for testing.
    d. Adjust the EUT as close to a zero indication as practicable prior 
to the test.

                             Test sequence:

    a. Stabilize all factors at nominal reference conditions.
    b. Conduct test as indicated in this A.3.6 Test Sequence section and 
record the--
    i. Date and time,
    ii. Temperature,
    iii. Relative humidity,
    iv. Power supply voltage,
    v. Test load,
    vi. Indication,
    vii. Errors, and
    viii. Functions performance.
    c. Approach the EUT with the discharge electrode until discharge 
occurs and then remove it before the next discharge. Observe the effect 
of the discharge on the EUT and record, as appropriate.
    d. Repeat the above step at least nine times, making sure to wait at 
least 10 seconds between successive discharges. Observe the effect on 
the EUT and record as appropriate.
    e. Stabilize all factors at nominal reference conditions.
    f. Repeat the test and record the test data as indicated in this 
A.3.6 Test Sequence section.
    A.3.7  Electromagnetic Susceptibility
    Test method: Electromagnetic fields (radiated).

                           Object of the Test:

    To verify compliance with the provisions in this manual under 
conditions of electromagnetic fields.
    Reference to standard: See section A.4 Bibliography (g).

                        Test procedure in brief:

    a. The EUT is placed in an EMI chamber and tested under normal 
atmospheric conditions. This test is first conducted at one load in a 
static mode, and the frequencies at which susceptibility is evident are 
noted. Then tests are conducted at the problem frequencies, if any, 
during a weighing operation consisting of the following:
    For belt scales--while totalizing at the maximum flow rate at least 
the <greek-S><INF>min</INF> (or a time sufficient to complete the test). 
It is then exposed to electromagnetic field strengths as specified in 
the Test severities in this section A.3.7 of this annex to appendix A of 
this part.
    For platform, hanging, and automatic hopper scales--tested with one 
small test load.
    b. The field strength can be generated in various ways:
    i. The strip line is used at low frequencies (below 30 MHz or in 
some cases 150 MHz) for small EUT's;
    ii. The long wire is used at low frequencies (below 30 MHz) for 
larger EUT's;
    iii. Dipole antennas or antennas with circular polarization placed 1 
m from the EUT are used at high frequencies.
    c. Under exposure to electromagnetic fields the EUT is again tested 
as indicated above.
    Test severities: Frequency range: 26-1000 MHz.
    Field strength: 3 V/m.
    Modulation: 80 percent AM, 1 kHz sine wave.

[[Page 591]]

    Number of test cycles: Conduct test by continuously scanning the 
specified frequency range while maintaining the field strength.
    Maximum allowable variations: The difference between the indication 
due to the disturbance and the indication without the disturbance either 
must not exceed the values given in this manual, or the EUT must detect 
and act upon a significant fault.
    Conduct of the test: Refer to the IEC Publication referenced in 
section A.4 Bibliography (g) for detailed information on test 
procedures.
    Supplementary information to the IEC test procedures.

                            Test conditions:

    a. The specified field strength must be established prior to the 
actual testing (without the EUT in the field). At least 1 m of all 
external cables must be included in the exposure by stretching them 
horizontally from the EUT.
    b. The field strength must be generated in two orthogonal 
polarizations and the frequency range scanned slowly. If antennas with 
circular polarization, i.e., log-spiral or helical antennas, are used to 
generate the electromagnetic field, a change in the position of the 
antennas is not required. When the test is carried out in a shielded 
enclosure to comply with international laws prohibiting interference to 
radio communications, care needs to be taken to handle reflections from 
the walls. Anechoic shielding might be necessary.

                            Condition of EUT:

    a. Normal power supplied and ``on'' for a time period equal to or 
greater than the warm-up time specified by the manufacturer. Power is to 
be ``on'' for the duration of the test. The EUT must be operating under 
standard atmospheric conditions for testing.
    b. Adjust the EUT as close to a zero indication as practicable prior 
to the test.

                             Test sequence:

    a. Stabilize all factors at nominal reference conditions.
    b. Conduct the test as indicated in this A.3.7 Test Sequence section 
and record the--
    i. Date and time,
    ii. Temperature,
    iii. Relative humidity,
    iv. Test load,
    v. Indication,
    vi. Errors, and
    vii. Functions performance.
    c. Following the IEC test procedures, expose the EUT at zero load to 
the specified field strengths while slowly scanning the three indicated 
frequency ranges.
    d. Observe and record the effect on the EUT.
    e. Repeat the test and observe and record the effect.
    f. Stabilize all factors at nominal reference conditions.
    g. Repeat the test and record the test data.
