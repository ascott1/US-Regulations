                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                               THIS TITLE

    Title 48--Federal Acquisition Regulations System is composed of 
eight volumes. The chapters in these volumes are arranged as follows: 
Chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99), chapter 2 (parts 
201 to 251 and parts 252 to 299), chapters 3 to 6, chapters 7 to 14, 
chapters 15 to 28 and chapter 29 to end. The contents of these volumes 
represent all current regulations codified under this title of the CFR 
as of October 1, 1996.

    The Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 are those 
government-wide acquisition regulations jointly issued by the General 
Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Chapters 2 through 99 are 
acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 
1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency 
regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 
1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 
through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal 
acquisition regulations.

    The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations 
System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the 
user section 1.106 is reprinted in the Finding Aids section of the 
second volume containing chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99).

    The first volume containing chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51) includes an 
index to the Federal acquisition regulations.

    For this volume, Cheryl E. Sirofchuck was Chief Editor. The Code of 
Federal Regulations publication program is under the direction of 
Frances D. McDonald, assisted by Alomha S. Morris.

       Subpart 52.1--Instructions for Using Provisions and Clauses


<R05>
Sec. 52.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart (a) gives instructions for using part 52, including the 
explanation and use of provision and clause numbers, prescriptions, 
prefaces, and the matrix; (b) prescribes procedures for incorporating,

[48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983; 48 FR 43273, Sept. 22, 1983, as amended at 
55 FR 3887, Feb. 5, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 52.101  Using part 52.

    (a) Definitions. Alternate means a substantive variation of a basic 
provision or clause prescribed for use in a defined circumstance. It (1) 
adds wording to, (2) deletes wording from, or (3) substitutes specified 
wording for a portion of the basic provision or clause. The alternate 
version of a provision or clause is the basic provision or clause as 
changed by the addition, deletion, or substitution (see 52.105(a)).
    Contract clause or clause means a term or condition used in 
contracts or in both solicitations and contracts, and applying after 
contract award or both before and after award.
    Modification, as used in this subpart, means a minor change in the 
details of a provision or clause that is specifically authorized by the 
FAR and does not alter the substance of the provision or clause (see 
52.104).
    Solicitation provision or provision means a term or condition used 
only in solicitations and applying only before contract award.
    Substantially as follows or substantially the same as, when used in 
the prescription and preface of a provision or clause, means that 
authorization is granted to prepare and utilize a variation of that 
provision or clause to accommodate requirements that are peculiar to an 
individual acquisition; provided, that the variation includes the 
salient features of the FAR provision or clause, and is not inconsistent 
with the intent, principle, and substance of the FAR provision or clause 
or related coverage of the subject matter.
    (b) Numbering. (1) FAR provisions and clauses. Subpart 52.2 sets 
forth the texts of all FAR provisions and clauses, each in its own 
separate subsection. The subpart is arranged by subject matter, in the 
same order as, and keyed to, the parts of the FAR. Each FAR provision or 
clause is uniquely identified. All FAR provision and clause numbers 
begin with ``52.2,'' since the texts of all FAR provisions and clauses 
appear in subpart 52.2. The next two digits of the provision or clause 
number correspond to the number of the FAR subject part in which the 
provision or clause is prescribed. The FAR provision or clause number is 
then completed by a hyphen and a sequential number assigned within each 
section of subpart 52.2. The following example illustrates the makeup of 
the FAR provision or clause number:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY91.000

    (2) Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR.
    (i) Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR are--
    (A) Prescribed and included in authorized agency acquisition 
regulations issued within an agency to satisfy the specific needs of the 
agency as a whole;
    (B) Prescribed and included in a regulation issued by a 
suborganization of an agency to satisfy the needs of that particular 
suborganization; or
    (C) Developed for use at a suborganizational level of an agency, not 
meant for repetitive use, but intended to meet the needs of an 
individual acquisiton and, thus, impractical to include in either an 
agency or suborganization acquisition regulation. (See 1.301(c).)
    (ii) Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency 
acquisition regulations shall be in full text and the prescription for 
the use of each shall be included. Supplemental provisions or clauses 
published in agency acquisition regulations shall be numbered in the 
same manner in which FAR provisions and clauses are numbered except 
that--
    (A) If it is included in an agency acquisition regulation that is 
published in the Federal Register and is codified in Title 48, Code of 
Federal Regulations (48 CFR), the number shall be preceded by the 
chapter number within 48 CFR assigned by the CFR staff; and
    (B) The sequential number shall be ``70'' or a higher number (see 
1.303).

[[Page 14]]

    (iii) The sequential number at the end of the number of a provision 
or clause that supplements the FAR, like its counterpart at the end of 
any FAR provision or clause number, indicates the subsection location of 
the provision or clause in subpart 52.2 of the agency acquisition 
regulation that contains its full text. If, for example, an agency 
acquisition regulation contains only one provision followed by only one 
clause supplementing the FAR in its section 52.236 (Construction and 
Architect-Engineer Contracts), then the sequential numbers would be 
``70'' for the provision and ``71'' for the clause.
    (c) Prescriptions. Each provision or clause in subpart 52.2 is 
prescribed at that place in the FAR text where the subject matter of the 
provision or clause receives its primary treatment. The prescription 
includes all conditions, requirements, and instructions for using the 
provision or clause and its alternates, if any. The provision or clause 
may be referred to in other FAR locations.
    (d) Prefaces. Within subpart 52.2, each provision or clause is 
prefaced with (1) a cross-reference to the location in the FAR subject 
text that prescribes its use, and (2) directions for inserting it in 
solicitations and/or contracts.
    (e) Matrix. (1) The matrix in subpart 52.3 contains a column for 
each principal type and/or purpose of contract (e.g., fixed-price 
supply, cost reimbursement research and development). The matrix lists 
the--
    (i) Required solicitation provisions;
    (ii) Required-when-applicable solicitation provisions;
    (iii) Optional solicitation provisions;
    (iv) Required contract clauses;
    (v) Required-when-applicable contract clauses; and
    (vi) Optional contract clauses.
    (2) For each provision or clause listed, the matrix provides 
information on--
    (i) Whether incorporation by reference is or is not authorized;
    (ii) The section of the Uniform Contract Format (UCF) in which it is 
to be located, if it is used in an acquisition that is subject to the 
UCF;
    (iii) Its number;
    (iv) The citation of the FAR text that prescribes its use; and
    (v) Its title.
    (3) Since the matrix does not provide sufficient information to 
determine the applicability of a provision or clause in the ``required-
when-applicable'' and ``optional'' categories, contracting officers 
shall refer to the FAR text (cited in the matrix) that prescribes its 
use.
    (4) The FAR matrix may be reproduced at agency levels, and at 
subordinate levels, for the purpose of supplementing it with agency-
developed provisions and clauses. The resulting consolidated matrices 
may be included in agency acquisition regulations.
    (f) Dates. Since they are subject to revision from time to time, all 
provisions, clauses, and alternates are dated; e.g., (DEC 1983). To 
avoid questions concerning which version of any provision, clause, or 
alternate is operative in any given solicitation or contract, its date 
shall be included whether it is incorporated by reference or in full 
text.

52.102  Incorporating provisions and clauses.


<R05>
Sec. 52.102-1  Incorporation by reference.

    (a) Except as specified in 52.102-2, provisions and clauses may be 
incorporated by reference in solicitations and/or contracts if they are 
prescribed in--
    (1) The FAR and are authorized to be incorporated by reference (see 
subpart 52.3); or
    (2) An agency acquisition regulation published by--
    (i) The Secretary of Defense for use throughout the Department of 
Defense (DOD); or
    (ii) The head of an agency outside the DOD for agency-wide use.
    (b) The provisions and clauses referred to in 52.102-1(a) should be 
incorporated by reference to the maximum practical extent, rather than 
being incorporated in full text, even if they (1) are used with one or 
more alternates or on an optional basis, (2) are prescribed on a 
``substantially as follows'' or ``substantially the same as'' basis; 
provided, that they are used verbatim, or

[[Page 15]]

(3) require modification or the insertion by the Government of fill-in 
material (see 52.104). However, the contracting officer, upon request, 
shall provide the full text of any provision or clause incorporated by 
reference.
    (c) Provisions or clauses may not be incorporated by reference by 
being listed in the (1) provision at 52.252-3, Alterations in 
Solicitations, or (2) clause at 52.252-4, Alterations in Contract.

[48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 48990, Nov. 28, 1989; 
55 FR 3887, Feb. 5, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 52.102-2  Incorporation in full text.

    (a) A provision or clause shall be incorporated in solicitations 
and/or contracts in full text if it--
    (1) Requires completion by the offeror or prospective contractor;
    (2) Is a FAR provision or clause that will be used with an 
authorized deviation (see subpart 1.4);
    (3) Is a FAR provision or clause that is not authorized to be 
incorporated by reference (see subpart 52.3);
    (4) Is prescribed for use in an agency acquisition regulation 
published at levels below those specified in 52.102-1(a)(2);
    (5) Is a special provision or clause of the type described in 
52.101(b)(2)(i)(C);
    (6) Will be used in a specific acquisition or class of acquisitions 
covered by a written determination of the chief of the contracting 
office to restrict the use of incorporation by reference for valid 
reasons; or
    (7) Is prescribed on a ``substantially as follows'' or 
``substantially the same as'' basis in the FAR or an agency acquisition 
regulation specified in 52.102-1(a)(2), but will not be used verbatim.
    (b) Provisions and clauses of the type described in 
52.101(b)(2)(i)(C), if developed by an organizational element below that 
of the agency headquarters level, shall be subject to agency oversight 
through the agency procedure required by 1.202.
    (c) Provisions completed as annual representations and 
certifications are not required to be incorporated in solicitations in 
full text.

[48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 48990, Nov. 28, 1989; 
55 FR 3887, Feb. 5, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 52.103  Identification of provisions and clauses.

    (a) Whenever any FAR provision or clause is used without deviation 
in a solicitation or contract, whether it is incorporated by reference 
or in full text, it shall be identified by number, title, and date. This 
identification shall also be used if the FAR provision or clause is used 
with an authorized deviation, except that the contracting officer shall 
then insert ``(DEVIATION)'' after the date. Solicited firms and 
contractors will be advised of the meaning of this insertion through the 
use of the (1) provision at 52.252-5, Authorized Deviations in 
Provisions, or (2) clause at 52.252-6, Authorized Deviations in Clauses. 
The above mentioned provision and clause are prescribed in 52.107(e) and 
(f).
    (b) Any provision or clause that supplements the FAR whether it is 
incorporated by reference or in full text shall be clearly identified by 
number, title, date, and name of the regulation. When a supplemental 
provision or clause is used with an authorized deviation, insert 
``(DEVIATION)'' after the name of the regulation.
    (c) A provision or clause of the type described in 
52.101(b)(2)(i)(C) shall be identified by the title, date, and the name 
of the agency or suborganization within the agency that developed it.
    (d) Except for provisions or clauses covered by 52.103(c), the 
following hypothetical examples illustrate how a provision or clause 
that supplements the FAR shall be identified when it is incorporated in 
solicitations and/or contracts by reference or in full text:
    (1) If part 14 (Sealed Bidding) of the X Agency Acquisition 
Regulation, published in the Federal Register and codified as Chapter 99 
in 48 CFR, prescribes the use of a provision entitled ``Bid Envelopes,'' 
dated October 1983, and that provision is sequentially the first 
provision or clause appearing in Section 52.214 of the X Agency 
Acquisition Regulation, then the identification of that provision shall 
be ``9952.214-70--Bid Envelopes (OCT 1983).''
    (2) Assume that Y, a major organizational element of the X Agency, 
is authorized to issue the Y Acquisition Regulation, which is not 
published in

[[Page 16]]

the Federal Register and codified in 48 CFR. If part 36 (Construction 
and Architect-Engineer Contracts) of the Y Acquisition Regulation 
prescribes the use of a clause entitled ``Refrigerated Display Cases,'' 
dated March 1983, pertaining to a specialized type of construction work, 
and that clause is sequentially the second provision or clause appearing 
in Section 52.236 of the Y Acquisition Regulation, then the 
identification of that clause shall be ``52.236-71--Refrigerated Display 
Cases (MAR 1983)--Y Acquisition Regulation.''

[48 FR 42478, Sept. 19, 1983, as amended at 52 FR 9039, Mar. 20, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 52.104  Procedures for modifying and completing provisions and clauses.

    (a) Provisions and clauses shall not be modified unless the FAR 
authorizes their modification. Any such authorizations are contained in 
the provision or clause preface in subpart 52.2; for example--
    (1) ``In the following clause, the stated 60-day period may be 
varied from 30 to 90 days''; or
    (2) ```Task Order' or other appropriate designation may be 
substituted for `Schedule' wherever that word appears in the clause.''
    (b) When modifying provisions or clauses incorporated by reference, 
insert the changed wording directly below the title of the provision or 
clause identifying to the lowest level necessary (e.g., paragraph, 
sentence, word), to clearly indicate what is being modified.
    (c) When modifying provisions or clauses incorporated in full text, 
modify the language directly by substituting the changed wording as 
permitted.
    (d) When completing blanks in provisions or clauses incorporated by 
reference, insert the fill-in information directly below the title of 
the provision or clause identifying to the lowest level necessary to 
clearly indicate the blanks being filled in.
    (e) When completing blanks in provisions or clauses incorporated in 
full text, insert the fill-in information in the blanks of the provision 
or clause.


<R05>
Sec. 52.105  Procedures for using alternates.

    (a) A major variation in a provision or clause is accommodated by 
use of an alternate. All alternates to a given provision or clause are 
prescribed at the point in the FAR subject text where the provision or 
clause is itself prescribed. The alternates to each provision or clause 
are titled ``Alternate I,'' ``Alternate II,'' ``Alternate III,'' and so 
on. In subpart 52.2, the instructions for using these alternates appear 
after the basic provision or clause. A statement of the manner of and 
conditions for its use is given for each alternate. This statement shall 
be read in conjunction with the preface to the provision or clause.
    (b) When an alternate is used, its date shall be cited along with 
the date of the basic provision or clause; e.g., 52.209-3 FIRST ARTICLE 
APPROVAL--CONTRACTOR TESTING (OCT 1983)--ALTERNATE I (DEC 1983).
    (c) Under certain circumstances, a provision or clause may be used 
with two or more alternates. In these circumstances, each of the 
applicable alternates shall be cited, whether incorporated by reference 
or in full text; e.g., 52.209-3 FIRST ARTICLE APPROVAL--CONTRACTOR 
TESTING (OCT 1983)--ALTERNATE I (DEC 1983) AND ALTERNATE II (FEB 1984). 
However, under no circumstances may an alternate to a specific provision 
or clause be applied to any other provision or clause.


<R05>
Sec. 52.106  Derivations of FAR provisions and clauses.

    (a) Nearly all FAR provisions and clauses have been derived from 
Defense Acquisition Regulation (DAR) and/or Federal Procurement 
Regulations (FPR) provisions and clauses. In order to enable the user of 
this regulation to understand the derivation, a notation has been added 
at the bottom of each FAR provision or clause underneath the words 
``(End of provision)'' or ``(End of clause).'' The notation shows the 
nature of the derivation by one of the following codes:
    ``NM'' means new material not in the DAR or FPR.

[[Page 17]]

    ``R'' means the FAR coverage is rewritten from the DAR, FPR, or 
other material from which it is derived.
    ``AV'' means the FAR coverage repeats a provision or clause in the 
DAR, FPR, or other source almost verbatim. In the text of the provision 
or clause, titles of organizations, officials, or documents are changed 
or personal pronouns deleted. The language is substantially the same, 
with no substantive differences from that of the DAR, FPR, or other 
provision or clause from which it is derived.
    ``V'' means the FAR coverage repeats a DAR, FPR, or other provision 
or clause verbatim.
    (b) In addition, when the derivation is from the DAR or FPR, the 
citation (and date when appropriate) of the DAR or FPR provision or 
clause from which the FAR material is derived has been included. The 
acronyms DAR and FPR have not been used when citing these former 
provisions or clauses, since their citations are distinctive: DAR 
citations generally begin ``7-'' and are dated, while the FPR citations 
all begin ``1-'' and are undated.
    (c) When a provision or clause is revised or the FAR reissued, the 
derivation notations will be deleted.


<R05>
Sec. 52.107  Provisions and clauses prescribed in subpart 52.1.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.252-1, 
Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference, in solicitations in 
order to incorporate provisions by reference.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.252-2, 
Clauses Incorporated by Reference, in solicitations and contracts in 
order to incorporate clauses by reference.
    (c) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.252-3, 
Alterations in Solicitation, in solicitations in order to revise or 
supplement, as necessary, other parts of the solicitation that apply to 
the solicitation phase only, except for any provision authorized for use 
with a deviation.
    (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.252-4, 
Alterations in Contract, in solicitations and contracts in order to 
revise or supplement, as necessary, other parts of the contract, or 
parts of the solicitations that apply to the contract phase, except for 
any clause authorized for use with a deviation.
    (e) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.252-5, 
Authorized Deviations in Provisions, in solicitations that include any 
FAR or supplemental provision with an authorized deviation. Whenever any 
FAR or supplemental provision is used with an authorized deviation, the 
contracting officer shall identify it by the same number, title, and 
date assigned to the provision when it is used without deviation, 
include regulation name for any supplemental provision, except that the 
contracting officer shall insert ``(DEVIATION)'' after the date of the 
provision.
    (f) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.252-6, 
Authorized Deviations in Clauses, in solicitations and contracts that 
include any FAR or supplemental clause with an authorized deviation. 
Whenever any FAR or supplemental clause is used with an authorized 
deviation, the contracting officer shall identify it by the same number, 
title, and date assigned to the clause when it is used without 
deviation, include regulation name for any supplemental clause, except 
that the contracting officer shall insert ``(DEVIATION)'' after the date 
of the clause.

              Subpart 52.2--Text of Provisions and Clauses


<R05>
Sec. 52.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth the texts of all FAR provisions and clauses 
(see 52.101(b)(1)), and for each provision and clause, gives (a) a 
cross-reference to the location in the FAR that prescribes its use, and 
(b) directions for including it in solicitations and/or contracts.
52.201  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.202-1  Definitions.

    As prescribed in subpart 2.2, insert the following clause:

                         Definitions (Oct 1995)

    (a) Head of the agency (also called agency head) or Secretary means 
the Secretary (or Attorney General, Administrator, Governor,

[[Page 18]]

Chairperson, or other chief official, as appropriate) of the agency, 
including any deputy or assistant chief official of the agency, and the 
term authorized representative means any person, persons, or board 
(other than the Contracting Officer) authorized to act for the head of 
the agency or Secretary.
    (b) Commercial component means any component that is a commercial 
item.
    (c) Commercial item means--
    (1) Any item, other than real property, that is of a type 
customarily used for nongovernmental purposes and that--
    (i) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or
    (ii) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general 
public;
    (2) Any item that evolved from an item described in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this clause through advances in technology or performance and that is 
not yet available in the commercial marketplace, but will be available 
in the commercial marketplace in time to satisfy the delivery 
requirements under a Government solicitation;
    (3) Any item that would satisfy a criterion expressed in paragraphs 
(c)(1) or (c)(2) of this clause, but for--
    (i) Modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial 
marketplace; or
    (ii) Minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the 
commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements. 
``Minor'' modifications means modifications that do not significantly 
alter the nongovernmental function or essential physical characteristics 
of an item or component, or change the purpose of a process. Factors to 
be considered in determining whether a modification is minor include the 
value and size of the modification and the comparative value and size of 
the final product. Dollar values and percentages may be used as 
guideposts, but are not conclusive evidence that a modification is

agency, representative, or consultant, 6 years from the date such

    As prescribed in 3.104-10(c) insert the following clause:

   Price or Fee Adjustment for Illegal or Improper Activity (Sep 1990)

    (a) The Government, at its election, may reduce the price of a 
fixed-price type contract or contract modification and the total cost 
and fee under a cost-type contract or contract modification by the 
amount of profit or fee determined as set forth in paragraph (b) of this 
clause if the head of the contracting activity or his or her designee 
determines that there was a violation of subsection 27(a) of the Office 
of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 423), as 
implemented in the FAR. In the case of a contract modification, the fee 
subject to reduction is the fee specified in the particular contract 
modification at the time of execution, except as provided in 
subparagraph (b)(5) of this clause.
    (b) The price or fee reduction referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
clause shall be--
    (1) For cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, the amount of the fee 
specified in the contract at the time of award;
    (2) For cost-plus-incentive-fee conrtracts, the target fee specified 
in the contract at the time of award, notwithstanding any minimum fee or 
``fee floor'' specified in the contract.
    (3) For cost-plus-award-fee contracts--
    (i) The base fee established in the contract at the time of contract 
award;
    (ii) If no base fee is specified in the contract, 30 percent of the 
amount of each award fee otherwise payable to the Contractor for each 
award fee evaluation period or at each award fee determination point.
    (4) For fixed-price-incentive contracts, the Government may--
    (i) Reduce the contract target price and contract target profit both 
by an amount equal to the initial target profit specified in the 
contract at the time of contract award; or
    (ii) If an immediate adjustment to the contract target price and 
contract target profit would have a significant adverse impact on the 
incentive price revision relationship under the contract, or adversely 
affect the contract financing provisions, the Contracting Officer may 
defer such adjustment until establishment of the total final price of 
the contract. The total final price established in accordance with the 
incentive price revision provisions of the contract shall be reduced by 
an amount equal to the initial target profit specified in the contract 
at the time of contract award and such reduced price shall be the total 
final contract price.
    (5) For firm-fixed-price contracts or contract modifications, by 10 
percent of the initial contract price; 10 percent of the contract 
modification price; or a profit amount determined by the Contracting 
Officer from records or documents in existence prior to the date of the 
contract award or modification.
    (c) The Government may, at its election, reduce a prime contractor's 
price or fee in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (b) of this 
clause for violations of the Act by its subcontractors by an amount not 
to exceed the amount of profit or fee reflected in the subcontract at 
the time the subcontract was first definitively priced.
    (d) In addition to the remedies in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this 
clause, the Government may terminate this contract for default. The 
rights and remedies of the Government specified herein are not 
exclusive, and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided 
by law or under this contract.

connection with a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative 
agreement.
    (3) The prohibitions of the Act do not apply under the following 
conditions:
    (i) Agency and legislative liaison by own employees. (A) The 
prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in subparagraph (b)(1) of 
this clause, does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a covered Federal action if the payment is for agency and 
legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal 
action.
    (B) For purposes of subdivision (b)(3)(i)(A) of this clause, 
providing any information specifically requested by an agency or 
Congress is permitted at any time.
    (C) The following agency and legislative liaison activities are 
permitted at any time where they are not related to a specific 
solicitation for any covered Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency the qualities and characteristics 
(including individual demonstrations) of the person's products or 
services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities.
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the

agency's use.
    (D) The following agency and legislative liaison activities are 
permitted where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered 
Federal action--
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an 
agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended 
by Pub. L. 95-507, and subsequent amendments.
    (E) Only those services expressly authorized by subdivison 
(b)(3)(i)(A) of this clause are permitted under this clause.
    (ii) Professional and technical services. (A) The prohibition on the 
use of appropriated funds, in subparagraph (b)(1) of this clause, does 
not apply in the case of--
    (1) A payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or 
employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action or 
an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a 
covered Federal action, if payment is for professional or technical 
services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or 
negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal action 
or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition 
for receiving that Federal action.
    (2) Any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or 
employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action or 
an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a 
covered Federal action if the payment is for professional or technical 
services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or 
negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal action 
or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a

[[Page 27]]

condition for receiving that Federal action. Persons other than officers 
or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal 
action include consultants and trade associations.
    (B) For purposes of subdivision (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this clause, 
professional and technical services shall be limited to advice and 
analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For 
example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by 
a lawyer is allowable.
    Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her clients's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (C) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (D) Only those services expressly authorized by subdivisions 
(b)(3)(ii)(A) (1) and (2) of this clause are permitted under this 
clause.
    (E) The reporting requirements of FAR 3.803(a) shall not apply with 
respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly 
employed officers or employees of a person.
    (c) Disclosure. (1) The Contractor who requests or receives from an 
agency a Federal contract shall file with that agency a disclosure form, 
OMB standard form LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, if such person 
has made or has agreed to make any payment using nonappropriated funds 
(to include profits from any covered Federal action), which would be 
prohibited under subparagraph (b)(1) of this clause, if paid for with 
appropriated funds.
    (2) The Contractor shall file a disclosure form at the end of each 
calendar quarter in which there occurs any event that materially affects 
the accuracy of the information contained in any disclosure form 
previously filed by such person under subparagraph (c)(1) of this 
clause. An event that materially affects the accuracy of the information 
reported includes--
    (i) A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or 
expected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a covered 
Federal action; or
    (ii) A change in the person(s) or individual(s) influencing or 
attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or
    (iii) A change in the officer(s), employee(s), or Member(s) 
contacted to influence or attempt to influence a covered Federal action.
    (3) The Contractor shall require the submittal of a certification, 
and if required, a disclosure form by any person who requests or 
received any subcontract exceeding $100,000 under the Federal contract.
    (4) All subcontractor disclosure forms (but not certifications) 
shall be forwarded from tier to tier until received by the prime 
Contractor. The prime Contractor shall submit all disclosures to the 
Contracting Officer at the end of the calendar quarter in which the 
disclosure form is submitted by the subcontractor. Each subcontractor 
certification shall be retained in the subcontract file of the awarding 
Contractor.
    (d) Agreement. The Contractor agrees not to make any payment 
prohibited by this clause.
    (e) Penalties. (1) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited 
under paragraph (a) of this clause or who fails to file or amend the 
disclosure form to be filed or amended by paragraph (b) of this clause 
shall be subject to civil penalties as provided for by 31 U.S.C. 1352. 
An imposition of a civil penalty does not prevent the Government from 
seeking any other remedy that may be applicable.
    (2) Contractors may rely without liability on the representation 
made by their subcontractors in the certification and disclosure form.
    (f) Cost allowability. Nothing in this clause makes allowable or 
reasonable any costs which would otherwise be unallowable or 
unreasonable. Conversely, costs made specifically unallowable by the 
requirements in this clause will not be made allowable under any other 
provision.

                             (End of clause)

            Notice of Cost Comparison (Sealed-Bid) (Feb 1993)

    (a) This solicitation is part of a Government cost comparison to 
determine whether accomplishing the specified work under contract or by 
Government performance is more economical. If Government performance is 
determined to be more economical, this solicitation will be canceled and 
no contract will be awarded.
    (b) The Government's cost estimate for performance by the Government 
will be based on the work statement in this solicitation and will be 
submitted by designated agency personnel to the Contracting Officer in a 
sealed envelope not later than the time set for bid opening. At the 
public bid opening, the Contracting Officer will open the bids and the 
envelope containing the cost estimate for Government performance and 
announce the result. This announcement will be based on an initial 
comparison of the cost of Government performance with the cost of 
contract performance, as indicated on the cost comparison form.
    (c) The abstract of bids, completed cost comparison form, and 
detailed data supporting the cost estimate for Government performance 
will be made available to interested parties for review for a period of 
__________ [insert a number from 15 to 30, depending on the complexity 
of the matter (see 7.306(a)(1)(iv)] working days, beginning with the 
date the documents are available to interested parties. The Government 
will not make a final determination either for contract or Government 
performance during this period. During this period, directly affected 
parties may file with the Contracting Officer written requests, based on 
specific objections, for administrative review of the cost-comparison 
result under the agency appeals procedure. The appeals procedure shall 
be used only to resolve questions concerning the calculation of the cost 
comparison and will not apply to decisions regarding selection of one 
bidder in preference to another. Agency determinations under the appeals 
procedure shall be final.
    (d) After evaluation of bids and resolution of any requests under 
the appeals procedure, the Contracting Officer will either award a 
contract or cancel this solicitation. The completed cost comparison 
analysis will be made available to interested parties.
    (e) A cost estimate for Government performance is considered a bid 
for purposes of this solicitation's Late Modifications of Bids or 
Withdrawal of Bids provision, and a late modification that displaces an 
otherwise low cost estimate for Government performance shall not be 
considered.

    (a) This solicitation is part of a Government cost comparison to 
determine whether accomplishing the specified work under contract or by 
Government performance is more economical. If Government performance is 
determined to be more economical, this solicitation will be canceled and 
no contract will be awarded.

[[Page 31]]

    (b) The Government's cost estimate for performance by the Government 
will be based on the work statement in this solicitation and will be 
submitted by designated agency personnel to the Contracting Officer in a 
sealed envelope not later than the time set for receipt of initial 
proposals.
    (c) After completion of proposal evaluation, negotiation, and 
selection of the most advantageous proposal, the Contracting Officer, in 
the presence of the preparer of the cost estimate for Government 
performance, will open the sealed cost estimate envelope. These 
officials will make a cost comparison before public announcement. 
Depending on whether the cost comparison result favors performance under 
contract or Government performance, the procedure in either subparagraph 
(1) or (2) following applies:
    (1) If the result of the cost comparison favors performance under 
contract and administrative approval is obtained, the Contracting 
Officer will award a contract and publicly reveal the completed cost 
comparison form showing the cost estimate for Government performance, 
its detailed supporting data, and the Contractor's name. However, this 
award is conditioned on the offer remaining the more economical 
alternative after (i) completion of a public review period of ------ 
[insert a numeral from 15 to 30, depending upon the complexity of the 
matter (see 7.306(b)(3))] working days beginning with the date this 
information is available to interested parties and (ii) resolution of 
any requests for review under the agency appeals procedure (see 
paragraph (d) below). The Government assumes no liability for costs 
incurred during the periods specified in (i) and (ii). The Contracting 
Officer will then either notify the Contractor in writing that it may 
proceed with performance of the contract or will cancel the contract at 
no cost to the Government.
    (2) If the result of the cost comparison favors Government 
performance, the Contracting Officer will publicly disclose this result, 
the completed cost comparison form and its detailed supporting data, and 
the price of the offer most advantageous to the Government. After (i) 
completion of a public review period of ------ [insert a numeral from 15 
to 30, depending upon the complexity of the matter (see 7.306(b)(3)] 
working days beginning with the date this information is available to 
interested parties and (ii) resolution of any requests for review under 
the agency appeals procedure (see paragraph (d) below), the Contracting 
Officer will either cancel this solicitation or award a contract, as 
appropriate.
    (d) During the public review period, directly affected parties may 
file with the Contracting Officer written requests, based on specific 
objections, for administrative review of the cost comparison result 
under the agency appeals procedure. The appeals procedure shall be used 
only to resolve questions concerning the calculation of the cost 
comparison and will not apply to questions concerning award to one 
offeror in preference to another. Agency determinations under the 
appeals procedure shall be final.
    (e) A cost estimate for Government performance is considered a 
proposal for purposes of this solicitation's Late Submissions, 
Modifications, and Withdrawal of Proposals or Quotations provision, and 
a late modification that displaces an otherwise low cost estimate for 
Government performance shall not be considered.

(3):

    Required Sources for Jewel Bearings and Related Items (Apr 1984)

    (a) This clause applies only if supplies furnished under this 
contract contain jewel bearings or related items.
    (b) Jewel bearing, as used in this clause, means a piece of 
synthetic corundum (sapphire or ruby) of any shape, except a phonograph 
needle, that has one or more polished surfaces to provide supporting 
surfaces or low-friction contact areas for revolving, oscillating, or 
sliding parts in an instrument, mechanism, subassembly, or part. A jewel 
bearing may be unmounted or may be mounted into a ring or bushing. 
Examples are watch holes--olive, watch holes--straight, pallet stones, 
roller jewels (jewel pins), endstones (caps), vee (cone) jewels, 
instrument rings, cups, and double cups.
    Plant, as used in this clause, means the Government-owned, 
contractor-operated William Langer Plant, Rolla, ND 58367 (Phone: 701-
477-3193).
    Price list, as used in this clause, means the U.S. Government Jewel 
Bearing Price List, published periodically by the General Services 
Adminstration for jewel bearings produced by the Plant.
    Related item, as used in this clause, means a piece of synthetic

[[Page 33]]

ruby), other than a jewel bearing, that (1) is made from material 
produced by the Verneuil flame fusion process, (2) has a geometric shape 
up to a maximum of 1 inch in any dimension, (3) requires extremely close 
tolerances and highly polished surfaces identical to those involved in 
manufacturing jewel bearings, and (4) is either mounted in a retaining 
or supporting structure or unmounted. Examples are window, nozzle, 
guide, knife edge, knife edge plate, insulator domed pin, slotted 
insulator, sphere, ring gauge, spacer, disc, valve seat, rod, vee 
groove, D-shaped insulator, and notched plate.
    (c) All jewel bearings and related items required for the supplies 
to be furnished under this contract (or an equal quantity of the same 
type, size, and tolerances) shall be acquired from the following 
sources: jewel bearings from the Plant, unless the Plant declines or 
rejects the order; and related items from domestic manufacturers, 
including the Plant, if the items can be obtained from those sources. 
Sources other than the foregoing may be used if the foregoing sources 
decline or reject the order.
    (1) Orders may be placed with the Plant for individual contracts, 
for a combination of contracts, or for stock. If the order is for an 
individual contract, the prime contract number shall be placed on it.
    (2) Orders, and any supplements to orders, for items listed in the 
price list shall refer to the most recent price list and its date.
    (3) Requests for quotations for items not listed in the price list 
should be accompanied by drawings and forwarded to the Plant as soon as 
possible to ensure prompt quotation or rejection of the order.
    (d) At its option, the Plant may decline or reject all or part of a 
Contractor's or subcontractor's order. If the order is declined or 
rejected, the Contractor shall notify the contract administration office 
cognizant of this contract promptly in writing, enclosing a copy of the 
rejection notice. Unless the declination or rejection has been caused by 
current excessive and overdue Contractor indebtedness to the Plant as 
determined by the Plant, the Contracting Officer shall evaluate the 
impact and make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, in the 
delivery schedule, or in both, if one is warranted. This procedure shall 
also apply to orders for related items rejected by any other domestic 
manufacturer.
    (e) The Contractor agrees to insert this clause, including this 
paragraph (e), and the prime contract number in every subcontract unless 
the Contractor has positive knowledge that the subassembly, component, 
or part being purchased does not contain jewel bearings or related 
items.

Sec. 52.209-1  Qualification Requirements.

    As prescribed in 9.206-2, insert the following clause:

                  Qualification Requirements (Feb 1995)

    (a) Definition: Qualification Requirement, as used in this clause, 
means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance 
demonstration that must be completed before award.
    (b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or 
services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services 
requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an 
end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the 
product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets 
the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this 
contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the 
time of award whether or not the name of

[[Page 36]]

the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified 
products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. 
Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain 
all requirements that they or their products or services, or their 
subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become 
qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their 
abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.

(Name)__________________________________________________________________
(Address)_______________________________________________________________
    (c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered 
by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, 
the relevant information noted below should be provided.

Offeror's Name__________________________________________________________
Manufacturer's Name_____________________________________________________
Source's Name___________________________________________________________
Item Name_______________________________________________________________
Service Identification__________________________________________________
Test Number_____________________________________________________________
(to the extent known)
    (d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification 
requirement is not itself an end item under this contract, the product, 
manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of 
award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a 
subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in 
question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an 
applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of 
award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for 
default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is 
offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's 
best interests.
    (e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met 
the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products 
list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the 
offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this 
contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interest, award of 
this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit 
evidence of qualification.
    (f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a 
previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed 
requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in 
location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source 
requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be 
accomplished before the date of award.

 Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Proposed Debarment, and 
                 Other Responsibility Matters (Mar 1996)

belief, that--
    (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals--
    (A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed 
for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any 
Federal agency;
    (B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a 3-year period preceding this 
offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them 
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with 
obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, 
or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state 
antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission 
of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction 
of records, making false statements, tax evasion, or receiving stolen 
property; and
    (C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise 
criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission 
of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this 
provision.
    (ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a 3-year period 
preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default 
by any Federal agency.
    (2) Principals, for the purposes of this certification, means 
officers; directors; owners; partners; and, persons having primary 
management or supervisory responsibilities

[[Page 39]]

within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of 
a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar positions).
    This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an 
agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent certification may render the maker subject to prosecution 
under section 1001, title 18, United States Code.
    (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the 
Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror 
learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become 
erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
    (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this 
provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award 
under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered 
in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. 
Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such 
additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may 
render the Offeror nonresponsible.
    (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, 
the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The 
knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that 
which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course 
of business dealings.
    (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a 
material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when 
making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly 
rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies 
available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the 
contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

                       Time of Delivery (Jul 1995)

    (a) The Government requires delivery to be made according to the 
following schedule:

                        REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE                      
              [Contracting Officer insert specific details]

----------               ----------               ----------            
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, 
offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable 
delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will 
not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period 
specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The 
Government reserves the right to award under either the required 
delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror 
offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror 
proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule 
above will apply.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the 
solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer 
mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a 
binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the 
offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is 
dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for 
performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the 
date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting 
Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will 
evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date 
of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (i) five 
calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or 
(ii) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or 
notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term ``working 
day'' excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, 
the offered delivery date is later than the required

[[Page 44]]

delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the delivery schedule is expressed in 
terms of specific calendar dates or specific periods and is based on an 
assumed date of award, the contracting officer may substitute the 
following paragraph (b) for paragraph (b) of the basic clause. The time 
may be expressed by substituting on or before; during the months --; or 
not sooner than -- or later than -- as headings for the third column of 
paragraph (a) the basic clause.
    (b) The delivery dates or specific periods above are based on the 
assumption that the Government will make award by ---------- 
[Contracting Officer insert date]. Each delivery date in the delivery 
schedule above will be extended by the number of calendar days after the 
above date that the contract is in fact awarded. Attention is directed 
to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a 
written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to 
the successful offeror results in a binding contract. Therefore, the 
offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with 
the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of 
award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary 
mails.
    Alternate II (APR 1984). If the delivery schedule is expressed in 
terms of specific calendar dates or specific periods and is based on an 
assumed date the contractor will receive notice of award, the 
contracting officer may substitute the following paragraph (b) for 
paragraph (b) of the basic clause. The time may be expressed by 
substituting within days after the date of receipt of a written notice 
of award as the heading for the third column of paragraph (a) of the 
basic clause.
    (b) The delivery dates or specific periods above are based on the 
assumption that the successful offeror will receive notice of award by 
-------- [Contracting Officer insert date]. Each delivery date in the 
delivery schedule above will be extended by the number of calendar days 
after the above date that the Contractor receives notice of award; 
provided, that the Contractor promptly acknowledges receipt of notice of 
award.
    Alternate III (APR 1984). If the delivery schedule is to be based on 
the actual date the contractor receives a written notice of award, the 
contracting officer may delete paragraph (b) of the basic clause. The 
time may be expressed by substituting within days after the date of 
receipt of a written notice of award as the heading for the third column 
of paragraph (a) of the basic clause.

    (a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the 
following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it 
may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery 
schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must 
not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the 
Government's required delivery schedule as follows:

    Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or 
conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable 
required delivery period specified above, will be considered 
nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery 
schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.

may be expressed by substituting on or before; during the months ---- ; 
or not sooner than --, or later than -- as headings for the third column

assumption that the Government will make award by ---------- 
[Contracting Officer insert date]. Each delivery date in the delivery 
schedule above will be extended by the number of calendar days after the 
above date that the contract is in fact awarded. Attention is directed

officer may substitute the following paragraph (b) for paragraph (b) of 
the basic clause. The time may be expressed by substituting within days 
after the date of receipt of a written notice of award as the heading of

prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified 
for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an

items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific 
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not 
be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government 
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than 
the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror 
specifies otherwise in the offer.

delivery to a post office or common carrier (or, in shipment by other 
means, to the point of first receipt by the Government).
    (b) Responsibility for supplies. Title to the supplies shall vest in 
the Government upon delivery to a post office or common carrier for 
shipment to the specific destination. If shipment is by means other than 
Postal Service or common carrier, title to the supplies shall vest in 
the Government upon delivery to the point of first receipt by the 
Government. Notwithstanding any other provision of the contract, order, 
or blanket purchase agreement, the Contractor shall assume all 
responsibility and risk of loss for supplies (1) not received at 
destination, (2) damaged in transit, or (3) not conforming to purchase 
requirements. The Contractor shall either replace, repair, or correct 
those supplies promptly at the Contractor's expense, but only if 
instructions to do so are furnished by the Contracting Officer within 
180 days from the date title to the supplies vests in the Government.
    (c) Preparation of invoice. (1) Upon delivery of supplies to a post 
office or common carrier, (or, in shipments by other means, the point of 
first receipt by the Government) the Contractor shall prepare an invoice 
as provided in this contract, order, or blanket purchase agreement. In 
addition, the invoice shall be prominently marked FAST PAY.
    (2) If the purchase price excludes the cost of transportation, the 
Contractor shall enter the prepaid shipping cost on the invoice as a 
separate item. The cost of parcel post insurance will not be paid by the 
Government. If transportation charges are separately stated on the 
invoice, the Contractor agrees to retain related paid freight bills or 
other transportation billings paid separately for a period of 3 years 
and to furnish the bills to the Government when requested for audit 
purposes.
    (3) If this contract, order, or blanket purchase agreement requires 
the preparation of a receiving report on a prescribed form, the 
Contractor has the option of either preparing the receiving report on 
the prescribed form or including the following information on the 
invoice, in addition to that required in subparagraph (c)(1) above:
    (i) A statement in prominent letters NO RECEIVING REPORT PREPARED.
    (ii) Shipment number.
    (iii) Mode of shipment.
    (iv) At line item level, (A) national stock number and/or 
manufacturer's part number, (B) unit of measure, (C) Ship-To Point, (D) 
Mark-For Point if in contract, and (E) FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP document number 
if in contract.
    (4) If this contract, order or blanket purchase agreement does not 
require preparation of a receiving report on a prescribed form, the 
invoice will include at the line item level information at the line item 
level

[[Page 57]]

in addition to that required in subparagraph (c)(1) above:
    (i) Ship-To-Point.
    (ii) Mark-For-Point.
    (iii) FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP document number if in contract, in addition 
to that required in subparagraph (c)(1) above.
    (5) Where a receiving report is not required, a copy of the invoice 
will be included in each shipment.
    (d) Certification of invoice. The Contractor agrees that the 
submission of an invoice to the Government for payment is a 
certification that the supplies for which the Government is being billed 
have been shipped or delivered in accordance with shipping instructions 
issued by the ordering officer, in the quantities shown on the invoice, 
and that the supplies are in the quantity and of the quality designated 
by the contract, order, or blanket purchase agreement.
    (e) Fast pay container identification. All outer shipping containers 
shall be marked FAST PAY.

Sec. 52.214-7  Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Bids.

    As prescribed in 14.201-6(c)(3), insert the following provision:

   Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Bids (Aug 1996)

    (a) Any bid received at the office designated in the solicitation 
after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless 
it is received before award is made and it--
    (1) Was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the 
fifth calendar day before the date specified for receipt of bids (e.g., 
a bid submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of bids 
by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th);
    (2) Was sent by mail or, if authorized by the solicitation, was sent 
by telegram or via facsimile and it is determined by the Government that 
the late receipt was due solely to mishandling by the Government after 
receipt at the Government installation;
    (3) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service-
Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5:00 P.M. at the place of 
mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of 
bids. The term working days excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays; 
or
    (4) Was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized 
by the solicitation and was received by the Government not later than 
5:00 p.m., one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of 
bids.
    (b) Any modification or withdrawal of a bid is subject to the same 
conditions as in paragraph (a) of this provision.

[[Page 59]]

    (c) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of 
a late bid, modification, or withdrawal sent either by registered or 
certified mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both on 
the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. or 
Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the 
bid, modification, or withdrawal shall be processed as if mailed late. 
Postmark means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression 
(exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that is readily 
identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed 
by employees of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date of 
mailing. Therefore, bidders should request the postal clerk to place a 
legible hand cancellation bull's-eye postmark on both the receipt and 
the envelope or wrapper.
    (d) The only acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at 
the Government installation is the time/date stamp of that installation 
on the bid wrapper or other documentary evidence of receipt maintained 
by the installation.
    (e) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of 
a late bid, modification, or withdrawal sent by U.S. Postal Service 
Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee is the date 
entered by the post office receiving clerk on the Express Mail Next Day 
Service-Post Office to Addressee label and the postmark on the envelope 
or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal Service. 
Postmark has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (c) of this 
provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian Postal Service. 
Therefore, bidders should request the postal clerk to place a legible 
hand cancellation bull's-eye postmark on both the receipt and the 
envelope or wrapper.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this provision, a late 
modification of an otherwise successful bid that makes its terms more 
favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is 
received and may be accepted.
    (g) Bids may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including 
mailgram) received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of 
bids. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile bids, bids may be 
withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set 
for receipt of bids, subject to the conditions specified in the 
provision entitled Facsimile Bids. A bid may be withdrawn in person by a 
bidder or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set 
for receipt of bids, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is 
established and the person signs a receipt for the bid.
    (h) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal 
Government processes so as to cause postponement of the scheduled bid 
opening, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the 
solicitation or other notice of an extension of the opening date, the 
time specified for receipt of bids will be deemed to be extended to the 
same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on 
which normal Government processes resume.

invitations for bids:

                     Failure to Submit Bid (Jul 1995)

    Recipients of this solicitation not responding with a bid should not 
return this solicitation, unless it specifies otherwise. Instead, they 
should advise the issuing office by letter, postcard, or established 
electronic commerce methods, whether they want to receive future 
solicitations for similar requirements. If a recipient does not submit a 
bid and does not notify the issuing office that future solicitations are 
desired, the recipient's name may be removed from the applicable mailing 
list.

    As prescribed in 14.201-6(e)(2), insert the following provision:

                Contract Award--Sealed Bidding (Jul 1990)

    (a) The Government will evaluate bids in response to this 
solicitation without discussions and will award a contract to the 
responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the solicitation, will be 
most advantageous to the Government considering only price and the 
price-related factors specified elsewhere in the solicitation.
    (b) The Government may (1) reject any or all bids, (2) accept other 
than the lowest bid, and (3) waive informalities or minor irregularities 
in bids received.
    (c) The Government may accept any item or group of items of a bid, 
unless the bidder qualifies the bid by specific limitations. Unless 
otherwise provided in the Schedule, bids may be submitted for quantities 
less than those specified. The Government reserves the

[[Page 60]]

right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity 
offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the bidder specifies 
otherwise in the bid.
    (d) A written award or acceptance of a bid mailed or otherwise 
furnished to the successful bidder within the time for acceptance 
specified in the bid shall result in a binding contract without further 
action by either party.
    (e) The Government may reject a bid as nonresponsive if the prices 
bid are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. A bid 
is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less 
than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated in 
relation to cost for other work, and if there is a reasonable doubt that 
the bid will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government even 
though it may be the low evaluated bid, or if it is so unbalanced as to 
be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.

including, unless otherwise specified, packaging, packing, and 
preservation and (2) enter the extended price for the quantity of each 
item offered in the Amount column of the Schedule. In case of 
discrepancy between a unit price and an extended price, the unit price 
will be presumed to be correct, subject, however, to correction to the 
same extent and in the same manner as any other mistake.
    (d) Bids for supplies or services other than those specified will 
not be considered unless authorized by the solicitation.
    (e) Bidders must state a definite time for delivery of supplies or

         Contract Award--Sealed Bidding--Construction (Aug 1996)

    (a) The Government will evaluate bids in response to this

is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less 
than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated in 
relation to cost for other work, and if there is a reasonable doubt that 
the bid will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government even 
though it may be the low evaluated bid, or if it is so unbalanced as to 
be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.

invitations for bids if bid samples are required:

                          Bid Samples (Apr 1984)

    (a) Bid samples are item sample submissions required of bidders to 
show those characteristics of the offered products that cannot 
adequately be described by specifications or purchase descriptions 
(e.g., balance, facility of use, or pattern).
    (b) Bid samples, required elsewhere in this solicitation, must be 
furnished as part of the bid and must be received by the time specified 
for receipt of bids. Failure to furnish samples on time will require

considered under the Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of 
Bids provision of this solicitation.
    (c) Bid samples will be tested or evaluated to determine compliance 
with all the characteristics listed for examination in this 
solicitation. Failure of these samples to conform to the required 
characteristics will require rejection of the bid. Products delivered 
under any resulting contract must conform to (1) the approved sample for 
the characteristics listed for test or evaluation and (2) the 
specifications for all other characteristics.
    (d) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, bid samples 
shall be (1) submitted at no expense to the Government, and (2) returned 
at the bidder's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during 
preaward testing.

same plant in which the product previously acquired or tested was 
produced, add the following paragraph (e) to the basic provision:

    (e) At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the requirement 
for furnishing bid samples may be waived for a bidder if (1) the bid 
states that the offered product is the same as a product offered by the 
bidder to the ---------- [as appropriate, the Contracting Officer shall 
designate the contracting office or an alternate activity or office], 
and (2) the Contracting Officer determines that the previously offered 
product was accepted or tested and found to comply with specification 
and other requirements for technical acceptability conforming in every 
material respect with those in this solicitation.

product previously acquired or tested was produced, add the following 
paragraph (e) to the basic provision:

    (e) At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the requirements 
for furnishing bid samples may be waived for a bidder if (1) the bid 
states that the offered product is the same as a product offered by the 
bidder to the ---------- [as appropriate, the Contracting Officer shall 
designate the contracting office or an alternate activity or office] on 
a previous acquisition, (2) the Contracting Officer determines that the 
previously offered product was accepted or tested and found to comply 
with specification and other requirements for technical acceptability 
conforming in every material respect with those of this solicitation,

under a resulting contract at the same plant in which the previously 
acquired or tested product was produced.

    As prescribed in 14.201-6(p)(1), insert the following provision in 
invitations for bids if (a) descriptive literature is required to

required information will not be readily available unless it is 
submitted by bidders:

                    Descriptive Literature (Apr 1984)

    (a) Descriptive literature means information (e.g., cuts, 
illustrations, drawings, and brochures) that is submitted as part of a 
bid. Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of 
evaluation and award, details of the product offered that are specified 
elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such 
as (1) design; (2) materials; (3) components; (4) performance 
characteristics; and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction, 
or operation. The term includes only information required to determine 
the technical acceptability of the offered product. It does not include 
other information such as that used in determining the responsibility of 
a prospective Contractor or for operating or maintaining equipment.
    (b) Descriptive literature, required elsewhere in this solicitation, 
must be (1) identified to show the item(s) of the offer to which it 
applies and (2) received by the time specified in this solicitation for 
receipt of bids. Failure to submit descriptive literature on time will 
require rejection of the bid, except that late descriptive literature 
sent by mail may be considered under the Late Submissions, 
Modifications, and Withdrawals of Bids provision of this solicitation.
    (c) The failure of descriptive literature to show that the product 
offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation will require 
rejection of the bid.

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the possibility exists that the 
contracting officer may waive the requirement for furnishing descriptive 
literature for a bidder offering a previously supplied product that 
meets specification requirements of the current solicitation, add the 
following paragraphs (d) and (e).

    (d) At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the requirement 
for furnishing descriptive literature under this solicitation may be 
waived for any bidder that makes an affirmative representation in 
subparagraph (d)(1) below, if the Contracting Officer determines that 
the product supplied by the bidder under a prior contract meets the 
requirements of this solicitation.
    (1) The bidder represents that it {time}  has, {time}  has not 
[check applicable box] supplied a product to the ---------- [as 
appropriate, the Contracting Officer shall designate the contracting 
office or an alternate activity or office] under a prior contract that 
is the same as the product offered under this solicitation for which 
descriptive literature is required.
    (2) If the bidder checked has in paragraph (d)(1) above, and seeks a 
waiver of the requirement for submitting descriptive literature, the 
bidder must fill in the following information:
Prior contract number___________________________________________________
Date of prior contract__________________________________________________
Contract line item number of product supplied___________________________
Name and address of government activity to which delivery was made______
Date of final delivery of product supplied______________________________
    (e) Bidders must submit bids on the basis of required descriptive 
literature or on the basis of a previously supplied product under 
paragraph (d) above. A bidder submitting a bid on one of these two bases 
may not elect to have its bid considered on the alternative basis after 
the time specified for receipt of bids. A bidder's request for a waiver 
under paragraph (d) above will be disregarded if that bidder has 
submitted the descriptive literature required under this solicitation.

[[Page 64]]

            Evaluation of Bids for Multiple Awards (Mar 1990)

    In addition to other factors, bids will be evaluated on the basis of 
advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from 
making more than one award (multiple awards). It is assumed, for the 
purpose of evaluating bids, that $500 would be the administrative cost 
to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded 
under this solicitation, and individual awards will be for the items or 
combinations of items that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the 
Government, including the assumed administrative costs.

Sec. 52.214-23  Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Technical Proposals Under Two-Step Sealed Bidding.

    As prescribed in 14.201-6(r), insert the following provision:

Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Technical Proposals 
                Under Two-Step Sealed Bidding (Aug 1996)

    (a) Any technical proposal under step one of two-step sealed bidding 
received at the office designated in this solicitation after the exact 
time specified for receipt will not be considered unless it is received 
before the invitation for bids in step two is issued and it--
    (1) Was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the 
fifth calendar day before the date specified for receipt of technical 
proposals (e.g., technical proposal submitted in response to a 
solicitation requiring receipt of technical proposals by the 20th of the 
month must have been mailed by the 15th);
    (2) Was sent (i) by mail, or (ii) if authorized, by telegram 
(including mailgram) or via facsimile, and it is determined by the 
Government that the late receipt was due solely to mishandling by the 
Government after receipt at the Government installation;
    (3) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service-
Post Office To Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place of 
mailing 2 working days prior to the date specified for receipt of 
technical proposals. The term working days excludes weekends and U.S. 
Federal holidays;
    (4) Was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized 
by the solicitation and was received by the Government not later than 
5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of 
technical proposals; or
    (5) Is the only technical proposal received.
    (b) Any modification of a technical proposal is subject to the same 
conditions as in paragraph (a) of this provision, except that (1) the 
use of a telegram (or mailgram) is authorized, and (2) if the 
solicitation authorizes facsimile bids, technical proposals may be 
modified via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set 
for receipt of bids under step two, subject to the conditions specified 
in the provision entitled Facsimile Bids.
    (c) Technical proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or 
telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before the exact time 
set for receipt of bids under step two. If the solicitation authorizes 
facsimile bids, technical proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile 
received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of bids under 
step two, subject to the conditions specified in the provision entitled 
Facsimile Bids. Technical proposals may be withdrawn in person by the 
submitter or the submitter's authorized representative if, before the 
exact time set for receipt of bids in step two, the identity of the 
person requesting withdrawal is established and that person signs a 
receipt for the technical proposal.
    (d) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of 
a late technical proposal, modification, or withdrawal of a technical 
proposal sent either by registered or certified mail is the U.S. or 
Canadian Postal Service postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on 
the original receipt from the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service. Both 
postmarks must show a legible date, or the technical proposal, 
modification, or withdrawal of technical proposal shall be processed as 
if mailed late. Postmark means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed 
impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that is 
readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and 
affixed by employees of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date 
of mailing. Therefore, submitters of technical proposals should request 
the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's-eye 
postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
    (e) The only acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at 
the Government installation is the time/date stamp of that installation 
on the proposal wrapper or other documentary evidence of receipt 
maintained by the installation.
    (f) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of 
a late technical proposal, modification, or withdrawal sent by U.S. 
Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee is 
the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the Express Mail 
Next Day Service-

[[Page 65]]

Post Office to Addressee label and the postmark on the envelope or 
wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal Service. 
Postmark has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (d) of this 
provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian Postal Service. 
Therefore, submitters of technical proposals should request the postal 
clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's-eye postmark on both 
the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
    (g) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal 
Government processes so that technical proposals cannot be received at 
the office designated for receipt of technical proposals by the exact 
time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements 
preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension 
of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of technical 
proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day 
specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal 
Government processes resume. If no time is specified in the 
solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the 
designated Government office.

Sec. 52.214-27  Price Reduction for Defective Cost or Pricing Data--Modifications--Sealed Bidding.

   Price Reduction for Defective Cost or Pricing Data--Modifications--
                        Sealed Bidding (Oct 1995)

    (a) This clause shall become operative only for any modification to 
this contract involving aggregate increases and/or decreases in costs, 
plus applicable profits, expected to exceed the threshold for the 
submission of cost or pricing data at FAR 15.804-2(a)(1), except that 
this clause does not apply to a modification if an exception under FAR 
15.804-1 applies.
    (b) If any price, including profit, negotiated in connection with 
any modification under this clause, was increased by any significant 
amount because (1) the Contractor or a subcontractor furnished cost or 
pricing data that were not complete, accurate, and current as certified 
in its Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, (2) a subcontractor 
or prospective subcontractor furnished the Contractor cost or pricing 
data that were not complete, accurate, and current as certified in the 
Contractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, or (3) any of 
these parties furnished data of any description that were not accurate, 
the price shall be reduced accordingly and the contract shall be 
modified to reflect the reduction. This right to a price reduction is 
limited to that resulting from defects in data relating to modifications 
for which this clause becomes operative under paragraph (a) above.
    (c) Any reduction in the contract price under paragraph (b) above 
due to defective data from a prospective subcontractor that was not 
subsequently awarded the subcontract shall be limited to the amount, 
plus applicable overhead and profit markup, by which (1) the actual 
subcontract or (2) the actual cost to the Contractor, if there was no 
subcontract, was less than the prospective subcontract cost estimate 
submitted by the Contractor; provided, that the actual subcontract price 
was not itself affected by defective cost or pricing data.
    (d)(1) If the Contracting Officer determines under paragraph (b) of 
this clause that a price or cost reduction should be made, the 
Contractor agrees not to raise the following matters as a defense--
    (i) The Contractor or subcontractor was a sole source supplier or 
otherwise was in a superior bargaining position and thus the price of 
the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, 
and current cost or pricing data had been submitted;

after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless 
it is received before award is made and it--
    (1) Was sent by mail or, if authorized by the solicitation, was sent

favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is 
received and may be accepted.

mailgram) received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of 
bids. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile bids, bids may be 
withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set

Government processes so that technical proposals cannot be received at 
the office designated for receipt of technical proposals by the exact 
time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements 
preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension 
of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of technical

Sec. 52.215-10  Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Proposals.

    As prescribed in 15.407(c)(6), insert the following provision:

Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Proposals (Aug 1996)

    (a) Any proposal received at the office designated in the 
solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will not be 
considered unless it is received before award is made and it--
    (1) Was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the 
fifth calendar day before the date specified for receipt of offers 
(e.g., an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring 
receipt of offers by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 
15th);
    (2) Was sent by mail or, if authorized by the solicitation, was sent 
by telegram or via facsimile and it is determined by the Government that 
the late receipt was due solely to mishandling by the Government after 
receipt at the Government installation;
    (3) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service-
Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place of 
mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of 
proposals. The term working days excludes weekends and U.S. Federal 
holidays;
    (4) Was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized 
by the solicitation and was received by the Government not later than 
5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of 
proposals; or
    (5) Is the only proposal received.
    (b) Any modification of a proposal or quotation, except a 
modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request for best 
and final offer, is subject to the same conditions as in subparagraphs 
(a)(1), (2), and (3) of this provision.
    (c) A modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request 
for best and final offer received after the time and date specified in 
the request will not be considered unless received before award and the 
late receipt is due solely to mishandling by the Government after 
receipt at the Government installation.
    (d) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of 
a late proposal or modification sent either by U.S. Postal Service 
registered or certified mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service 
postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt 
from the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a 
legible date or the proposal, quotation, or modification shall be 
processed as if mailed late. Postmark means a printed, stamped, or 
otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine 
impression) that is readily identifiable without further action as 
having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. or Canadian 
Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, offerors or quoters 
should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation 
bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
    (e) The only acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at 
the Government installation is the time/date stamp of that installation 
on the proposal wrapper or other documentary evidence of receipt 
maintained by the installation.
    (f) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of 
a late offer, modification, or withdrawal sent by Express Mail Next Day 
Service-Post Office to Addressee is

[[Page 73]]

the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the Express Mail 
Next day Service-Post Office to Addressee label and the postmark on both 
the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal 
Service, Postmark has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (d) of 
this provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian Postal Service. 
Therefore, offerors or quoters should request the postal clerk to place 
a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and 
the envelope or wrapper.
    (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this provision, a late 
modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms 
more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is 
received and may be accepted.
    (h) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram 
(including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the 
solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn 
via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the 
conditions specified in the provision entitled Facsimile Proposals. 
Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized 
representative, if the representative's identity is made known and the 
representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.
    (i) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal 
Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office 
designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the 
solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of 
the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, 
the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be 
extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the 
first work day on which normal Government processes resume. If no time 
is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., 
local time, for the designated Government office.

used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall--
    (a) Mark the title page with the following legend:
    ``This proposal or quotation includes data that shall not be 
disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or 
disclosed--in whole or in part-- for any purpose other than to evaluate 
this proposal or quotation. If, however, a contract is awarded to this 
offeror or quoter as a result of--or in connection with-- the submission 
of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or 
disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This 
restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information 
contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without 
restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in 
sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]''; and
    (b) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following 
legend:
    ``Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to 
the restriction on the title page of this proposal or quotation.''

                     Preparation of Offers (Apr 1984)

    (a) Offerors are expected to examine the drawings, specifications, 
Schedule, and all instructions. Failure to do so will be at the 
offeror's risk.
    (b) Each offeror shall furnish the information required by the 
solicitation. The offeror shall sign the offer and print or type its 
name on the Schedule and each continuation sheet on which it makes an 
entry. Erasures or other changes must be initialed by the person signing 
the offer. Offers signed by an agent shall be accompanied by evidence of

[[Page 74]]

that agent's authority, unless that evidence has been previously 
furnished to the issuing office.
    (c) For each item offered, offerors shall (1) show the unit price/
cost, including, unless otherwise specified, packaging, packing, and 
preservation and (2) enter the extended price/cost for the quantity of 
each item offered in the Amount column of the Schedule. In case of 
discrepancy between a unit price/cost and an extended price/cost, the 
unit price/cost will be presumed to be correct, subject, however, to 
correction to the same extent and in the same manner as any other 
mistake.
    (d) Offers for supplies or services other than those specified will 
not be considered unless authorized by the solicitation.
    (e) Offerors must state a definite time for delivery of supplies or 
for performance of services, unless otherwise specified in the

              Explanation to Prospective Offerors (Apr 1984)

    Any prospective offeror desiring an explanation or interpretation of 
the solicitation, drawings, specifications, etc., must request it in 
writing soon enough to allow a reply to reach all prospective offerors 
before the submission of their offers. Oral explanations or instructions 
given before the award of the contract will not be binding. Any 
information given to a prospective offeror concerning a solicitation 
will be furnished promptly to all other prospective offerors as an 
amendment of the solicitation, if that information is necessary in 
submitting offers or if the lack of it would be prejudicial to any other 
prospective offerors.

submit an offer and does not notify the issuing office that future 
solicitations are desired, the recipient's name may be removed from the

Sec. 52.215-16  Contract Award.

    As prescribed in 15.407(d)(4), insert the following provision:

                        Contract Award (Oct 1995)

    (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this 
solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the 
solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, cost or price 
and other factors, specified elsewhere in this solicitation, considered.
    (b) The Government may (1) reject any or all offers if such action 
is in the public interest, (2) accept other than the lowest offer, and 
(3) waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
    (c) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a 
contract after conducting written or oral discussions with all 
responsible offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within 
the competitive range. However, each initial offer should contain the 
offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.
    (d) The Government may accept any item or group of items of an 
offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. 
Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may be submitted for 
quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right 
to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity 
offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror 
specifies otherwise in the offer.
    (e) A written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise 
furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance 
specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without 
further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration 
time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer, as 
provided in paragraph (d) above), whether or not there are negotiations 
after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received 
before award. Negotiations conducted after receipt of an offer do not 
constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
    (f) Neither financial data submitted with an offer, nor 
representations concerning facilities or financing, will form a part of 
the resulting contract. However, if the resulting contract contains a 
clause providing for price reduction for defective cost or pricing

[[Page 75]]

data, the contract price will be subject to reduction if cost or pricing 
data furnished is incomplete, inaccurate, or not current.
    (g) The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if 
the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or 
subline items. An offer is materially unbalanced when it is based on 
prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which are 
significantly overstated in relation to cost for other work, and if 
there is a reasonable doubt that the offer will result in the lowest 
overall cost to the Government, even though it may be the low evaluated 
offer, or it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance 
payment.
    (h) The Government may disclose the following information in post-
award debriefings to other offerors: (1) the overall evaluated cost or 
price and technical rating of the successful offeror; (2) the overall 
ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency 
during source selection; (3) a summary of the rationale for award; and 
(4) for acquisitions of commercial end items, the make and model of the 
item to be delivered by the successful offeror.

the following paragraph (d) for paragraph (d) of the basic provision:

    (d) The Government may accept any item or combination of items, 
unless doing so is precluded by a restrictive limitation in the 
solicitation or offer.

    Alternate II (OCT 1995). As prescribed in 15.407(d)(4)(ii), 
substitute the following paragraph (c) for paragraph (c) of the basic 
provision:

    (c) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a 
contract without discussions with offerors (except communications 
conducted for the purpose of minor clarification). Therefore, each 
initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or 
price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the 
right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting 
Officer to be necessary.

conditions, and provisions of the solicitation, may be excluded from 
consideration.
    (d) Facsimile proposals must contain the required signatures.
    (e) The Government reserves the right to make award solely on the 
facsimile proposal. However, if requested to do so by the Contracting 
Officer, the apparently successful offeror agrees to promptly submit the 
complete original signed proposal.

Pricing Data, (2) a subcontractor or prospective subcontractor furnished 
the Contractor cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, 
and current as certified in the Contractor's Certificate of Current Cost 
or Pricing Data, or (3) any of these parties furnished data of any

accordingly and the contract shall be modified to reflect the reduction.
    (b) Any reduction in the contract price under paragraph (a) above

this clause that a price or cost reduction should be made, the

the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, 
and current cost or pricing data had been submitted;
    (ii) The Contracting Officer should have known that the cost or 
pricing data in issue were defective even though the Contractor or 
subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the 
data to the attention of the Contracting Officer;
    (iii) The contract was based on an agreement about the total cost of 
the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item 
procured under the contract; or
    (iv) The Contractor or subcontractor did not submit a Certificate of 
Current Cost or Pricing Data.
    (2)(i) Except as prohibited by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this 
clause, an offset in an amount determined appropriate by the Contracting 
Officer based upon the facts shall be allowed against the amount of a 
contract price reduction if--
    (A) The Contractor certifies to the Contracting Officer that, to the 
best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, the Contractor is 
entitled to the offset in the amount requested; and
    (B) The Contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were 
available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or 
price of the modification) and that the data were not submitted before 
such date.
    (ii) An offset shall not be allowed if--
    (A) The understated data was known by the Contractor to be 
understated when the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data was 
signed; or
    (B) The Government proves that the facts demonstrate that the 
contract price would not have increased in the amount to be offset even 
if the available data had been submitted before the date of agreement on 
price.

the price of items for which payment was made prior to the date of the 
modification reflecting the price reduction, the Contractor shall be 
liable to

and shall pay the United States at the time such overpayment is repaid--
    (1) Simple interest on the amount of such overpayment to be computed

liable to and shall pay the United States at the time such overpayment 
is repaid--

[[Page 80]]

                   Integrity of Unit Prices (Oct 1995)

    (a) Any proposal submitted for the negotiation of prices for items 
of supplies shall distribute costs within contracts on a basis that 
ensures that unit prices are in proportion to the items' base costs 
(e.g., manufacturing or acquisition costs). Any method of distributing 
costs to line items that distorts unit prices shall not be used. For 
example, distributing costs equally among line items is not acceptable 
except when there is little or no variation in base cost. Nothing in 
this paragraph requires submission of cost or pricing data not otherwise 
required by law or regulation.
    (b) The requirement in paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply 
to any contract or subcontract item of supply for which the unit price 
is, or is based on, an established catalog or market price for a 
commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public or 
to an item qualifying for a commercial item exception to cost or pricing 
data. A price is based on an established catalog or market price only if 
the item being purchased is sufficiently similar to the catalog or 
market priced commercial item to ensure that any difference in prices 
can be identified and justified without resort to cost analysis.
    (c) The Offeror/Contractor shall also identify those supplies which 
it will not manufacture, or to which it will not contribute significant 
value, when requested by the Contracting Officer. However, the 
information shall not be required for commercial items sold in 
substantial quantities to the general public when the price is, or is 
based on, established catalog or market prices.
    (d) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, less 
paragraph (c), in all subcontracts.

pension plan or otherwise recapture such pension fund assets. If pension 
fund assets revert to the Contractor or are constructively received by 
it under a termination or otherwise, the Contractor shall make a refund 
or gift a credit to the Government for its equitable share of the gross 
amount withdrawn. The Government's equitable share shall reflect the 
Government's participation in pension costs through those contracts for 
which cost or pricing data (see 15.804 of the Federal Acquisition

the contemplated contract, if the criteria for allowability in 
subparagraph 31.205-10(a)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation are

    (a) Any proposal received at the office designated in the 
solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will not be 
considered unless it is received before award is made and it--
    (1) Was sent by mail or, if authorized by the solicitation, was sent 
by telegram or via facsimile, and it is determined by the Government the 
late receipt was due solely to mishandling by the Government after 
receipt at the Government installation;
    (2) Was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized 
by the solicitation and was received by the Government not later than 
5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of 
proposals; or
    (3) Is the only proposal received.
    (b) Any modification of a proposal or quotation, except a 
modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request for best 
and final offer, is subject to the same conditions as in subparagraph 
(a)(1) of this provision.
    (c) A modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request 
for best and final offer received after the time and date specified in 
the request will not be considered unless received before award and the 
late receipt was due solely to mishandling by the Government after 
receipt at the installation.
    (d) The only acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at 
the Government installation is the time/date stamp of the installation 
on the proposal wrapper or other documentary evidence of receipt 
maintained by the installation.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this provision, a late 
modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms 
more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is 
received and may be accepted.

[[Page 82]]

    (f) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram 
(including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the 
solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn 
via facsimile at any time before award, subject to the conditions 
specified in the provision entitled Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may 
be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if 
the representative's identity is made known and the representative signs 
a receipt for the proposal before award.
    (g) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal 
Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office 
designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the 
solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of 
the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, 
the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be 
extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the 
first work day on which normal Government processes resume. If no time 
is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., 
local time, for the designated Government office.

cost or pricing data, offerors may submit a written request for 
exception by submitting the information described in the following 
subparagraphs. The Contracting Officer may require additional supporting 
information, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether an 
exception should be granted, and whether the price is fair and 
reasonable.
    (i) Information relative to an exception granted for prior or 
repetitive acquisitions.
    (ii) Catalog price information as follows:
    (A) Attach a copy of or identify the catalog and its date, or the

to the general public. This may include sales order, contract, shipment, 
invoice, actual recorded sales or other records that are verifiable. In 
addition, if the basis of the price proposal is sales of essentially the 
same commercial item by affiliates, other manufacturers or vendors, 
those sales may be included. The offeror shall explain the basis of each 
offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price. 
When substantial general public sales have also been made at prices 
other than catalog or price list prices, the offeror shall indicate how 
the proposed price relates to the price of such recent sales in 
quantities similar to the proposed quantities.

representative the right to examine, at any time before award, books, 
records, documents, or other directly pertinent records to verify any 
request for an exception under this provision, and the reasonableness of

granted an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing 
data, the following applies:

it was previously submitted to the contracting office.
    (v) Information on modifications of contracts or subcontracts for 
commercial items.
    (A) If (1) The original contract or subcontract was granted an

prices of commercial items, or prices set by law or regulation; and (2) 
the modification (to the contract or subcontract) is not exempted based 
on one of these exceptions, then the Contractor may provide information

commercial item to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of an 
item other than a commercial item.
    (B) For a commercial item exception, the Contractor may provide

established price. Each corresponding contract unit price shall be 
decreased by the same percentage that the established price is

after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established 
price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly. The Contractor 
shall certify (1) on each invoice that each unit price stated in it 
reflects all decreases required by this clause or (2) on the final 
invoice that all required price decreases have been applied as required 
by this clause.
    (c) If the Contractor's applicable established price is increased 
after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be 
increased, upon the Contractor's written request to the Contracting 
Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, 
and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following 
limitations:
    (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under 
this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit 
price.
    (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective (i) on the 
effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if 
the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request within 
10 days thereafter or (ii) if the written request is received later, on 
the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.
    (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities 
scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of 
the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that 
date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.
    (4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be 
executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies 
the increase in the applicable established price.

insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts when the 
conditions specified in 16.203-4(b)(1)(i) through (iii) apply (but see

    (a) The Contractor warrants that the supplies identified as line 
items ------------ [offeror insert Schedule line item number] in the 
Schedule are, except for modifications required by the contract 
specifications, supplies for which it has an established price. The term 
established price means a price that (1) is an established catalog or 
market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the 
general public, (2) meets the criteria of subsection 15.804-1 of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and (3) is the net price after 
applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor. The 
Contractor further warrants that, as of the date of this contract, any 
difference between the unit prices stated in the contract for these line 
items and the Contractor's established prices for like quantities of the 
nearest commercial equivalents are due to compliance with contract 
specifications and with any contract requirements for preservation, 
packaging, and packing beyond standard commercial practice.
    (b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of 
the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable 
established price. Each corresponding contract unit price (exclusive of 
any part of the unit price that reflects modifications resulting from 
compliance with specifications or with requirements for preservation, 
packaging, and packing beyond standard commercial practice) shall be 
decreased by the same percentage that the established price is 
decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and 
after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established 
price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly. The Contractor 
shall certify (1) on each invoice that each unit price stated in it 
reflects all decreases required by this clause or (2) in the final 
invoice that all required price decreases have been applied as required 
by this clause.
    (c) If the Contractor's applicable established price is increased 
after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price 
(exclusive of any part of the unit price resulting from compliance with 
specifications or with requirements for preservation, packaging, and 
packing beyond standard commercial practice) shall be increased, upon 
the Contractor's written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same 
percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract 
shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations:
    (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under 
this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit 
price.
    (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective (i) on the 
effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if 
the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request within 
10 days thereafter or (ii) if the written request is received later, on 
the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.
    (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities 
scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of 
the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that 
date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.
    (4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be 
executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies 
the increase in the applicable established price.
    (5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written 
request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either 
party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the 
requested increase.
    (d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in 
subparagraph (c)(5) above, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, 
the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract 
delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at 
the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph 
(c) above.

Sec. 52.216-4  Economic Price Adjustment--Labor and Material.

    As prescribed in 16.203-4(c), when contracting by negotiation, 
insert a clause that is substantially the same as the following clause 
in solicitations and contracts when the conditions specified in 16.203-
4(c)(1)(i) through (iv) apply (but see 16.203-4(c)(2)). The clause may 
be modified by increasing the 10-percent limit on aggregate increases 
specified in subparagraph (c)(4), upon approval by the chief of the 
contracting office.

         Economic Price Adjustment--Labor and Material (Apr 1984)

    (a) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer if, at any 
time during contract performance, the rates of pay for labor (including 
fringe benefits) or the unit prices for material shown in the Schedule 
either increase or decrease. The Contractor shall furnish this notice 
within 60 days after the increase or decrease, or within any additional 
period that the Contracting Officer may approve in writing, but not 
later than the date of final payment under this contract. The notice 
shall include the Contractor's proposal for an adjustment in the 
contract unit prices to be negotiated under paragraph (b) below, and 
shall include, in the form required by the Contracting Officer, 
supporting data explaining the cause, effective date, and amount of the 
increase or decrease and the amount of the Contractor's adjustment 
proposal.
    (b) Promptly after the Contracting Officer receives the notice and 
data under paragraph (a) above, the Contracting Officer and the 
Contractor shall negotiate a price adjustment in the contract unit 
prices and its effective date. However, the Contracting Officer may 
postpone the negotiations until an accumulation of increases and 
decreases in the labor rates (including fringe benefits) and unit prices 
of material shown in the Schedule results in an adjustment allowable 
under subparagraph (c)(3) below. The Contracting Officer shall modify 
this contract (1) to include the price adjustment and its effective date 
and (2) to revise the labor rates (including fringe benefits) or unit 
prices of material as shown in the Schedule to reflect the increases or 
decreases resulting from the adjustment. The Contractor shall continue 
performance pending agreement on, or determination of, any adjustment 
and its effective date.
    (c) Any price adjustment under this clause is subject to the 
following limitations:
    (1) Any adjustment shall be limited to the effect on unit prices of 
the increases or decreases in the rates of pay for labor (including 
fringe benefits) or unit prices for material shown in the Schedule. 
There shall be no adjustment for (i) supplies or services for which the 
production cost is not affected by such changes, (ii) changes in rates 
or unit prices other than those shown in the Schedule, or (iii) changes 
in the quantities of labor or material used from those shown in the 
Schedule for each item.
    (2) No upward adjustment shall apply to supplies or services that 
are required to be delivered or performed before the effective date of 
the adjustment, unless the Contractor's failure to deliver or perform 
according to the delivery schedule results from causes beyond the 
Contractor's control and without its fault or negligence, within the 
meaning of the Default clause.
    (3) There shall be no adjustment for any change in rates of pay for 
labor (including fringe benefits) or unit prices for material which 
would not result in a net change of at least 3 percent of the then-
current total contract price. This limitation shall not apply, however, 
if, after final delivery of all contract line items, either party 
requests an adjustment under paragraph (b) above.
    (4) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price made 
under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original unit 
price. There is no percentage limitation on the amount of decreases that 
may be made under this clause.
    (d) The Contractor shall include with the final invoice a 
certification that the Contractor either (1) has not experienced a 
decrease in rates of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) or unit 
prices for material shown in the Schedule or (2) has given notice of all 
such decreases in compliance with paragraph (a) above.
    (e) The Contracting Officer may examine the Contractor's books, 
records, and other supporting data relevant to the cost of labor 
(including fringe benefits) and material during all reasonable times 
until the end of 3 years after the date of final payment under this 
contract or the time periods specified in subpart 4.7 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whichever is earlier.

Sec. 52.216-5  Price Redetermination--Prospective.

    As prescribed in 16.205-4, when contracting by negotiation, insert 
the following clause in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price 
contract is

[[Page 89]]

contemplated and the conditions specified in 16.205-2 and 16.205-3(a) 
through (d) apply:

              Price Redetermination--Prospective (Oct 1995)

    (a) General. The unit prices and the total price stated in this 
contract shall be periodically redetermined in accordance with this 
clause, except that (1) the prices for supplies delivered and services 
performed before the first effective date of price redetermination (see 
paragraph (c) below) shall remain fixed and (2) in no event shall the 
total amount paid under this contract exceed any ceiling price included 
in the contract.
    (b) Definition. Costs, as used in this clause, means allowable costs 
in accordance with part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
in effect on the date of this contract.
    (c) Price redetermination periods. For the purpose of price 
redetermination, performance of this contract is divided into successive 
periods. The first period shall extend from the date of the contract to 
----------, [see Note (1)] and the second and each succeeding period 
shall extend for -------- [insert appropriate number] months from the 
end of the last preceding period, except that the parties may agree to 
vary the length of the final period. The first day of the second and 
each succeeding period shall be the effective date of price 
redetermination for that period.
    (d) Data submission. (1) Not more than -------- nor less than ------
-- [see Note (2)] days before the end of each redetermination period, 
except the last, the Contractor shall submit--
    (i) Proposed prices for supplies that may be delivered or services 
that may be performed in the next succeeding period, and--
    (A) An estimate and breakdown of the costs of these supplies or 
services on Standard Form 1411, Contract Pricing Proposal Cover Sheet 
(Cost or Pricing Data Required), or in any other form on which the 
parties may agree;
    (B) Sufficient data to support the accuracy and reliability of this 
estimate; and
    (C) An explanation of the differences between this estimate and the 
original (or last preceding) estimate for the same supplies or services; 
and
    (ii) A statement of all costs incurred in performing this contract 
through the end of the -------- month [see Note (3)] before the 
submission of proposed prices, on Standard Form 1411, Contract Pricing 
Proposal Cover Sheet (or in any other form on which the parties may 
agree), with sufficient supporting data to disclose unit costs and cost 
trends for--
    (A) Supplies delivered and services performed; and
    (B) Inventories of work in process and undelivered contract supplies 
on hand (estimated to the extent necessary).
    (2) The Contractor shall also submit, to the extent that it becomes 
available before negotiations on redetermined prices are concluded--
    (i) Supplemental statements of costs incurred after the date stated 
in subdivision (d)(1)(ii) above for--
    (A) Supplies delivered and services performed; and
    (B) Inventories of work in process and undelivered contract supplies 
on hand (estimated to the extent necessary); and
    (ii) Any other relevant data that the Contracting Officer may 
reasonably require.
    (3) If the Contractor fails to submit the data required by 
subparagraphs (1) and (2) above, within the time specified, the 
Contracting Officer may suspend payments under this contract until the 
data are furnished. If it is later determined that the Government has 
overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the 
Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days after the end of 
the data submittal period, the amount of the excess shall bear interest, 
computed from the date the data were due to the date of repayment, at 
the rate established in accordance with the Interest clause.
    (e) Price redetermination. Upon the Contracting Officer's receipt of 
the data required by paragraph (d) above, the Contracting Officer and 
the Contractor shall promptly negotiate to redetermine fair and 
reasonable prices for supplies that may be delivered or services that 
may be performed in the period following the effective date of price 
redetermination.
    (f) Contract modifications. Each negotiated redetermination of 
prices shall be evidenced by a modification to this contract, signed by 
the Contractor and the Contracting Officer, stating the redetermined 
prices that apply during the redetermination period.
    (g) Adjusting billing prices. Pending execution of the contract 
modification (see paragraph (f) above), the Contractor shall submit 
invoices or vouchers in accordance with the billing prices stated in 
this contract. If at any time it appears that the then-current billing 
prices will be substantially greater than the estimated final prices, or 
if the Contractor submits data showing that the redetermined price will 
be substantially greater than the current billing prices, the parties 
shall negotiate an appropriate decrease or increase in billing prices. 
Any billing price adjustment shall be reflected in a contract 
modification and shall not affect the redetermination of prices under 
this clause. After the contract modification for price redetermination 
is executed, the total amount paid or to be paid on all invoices or 
vouchers shall be adjusted to reflect the

[[Page 90]]

agreed-upon prices, and any requested additional payments, refunds, or 
credits shall be made promptly.
    (h) Quarterly limitation on payments statement. This paragraph (h) 
applies only during periods for which firm prices have not been 
established.
    (1) Within 45 days after the end of the quarter of the Contractor's 
fiscal year in which a delivery is first made (or services are first 
performed) and accepted by the Government under this contract, and for 
each quarter thereafter, the Contractor shall submit to the contract 
administration office (with a copy to the contracting office and the 
cognizant contract auditor) a statement, cumulative from the beginning 
of the contract, showing--
    (i) The total contract price of all supplies delivered (or services 
performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices 
have been established;
    (ii) The total costs (estimated to the extent necessary) reasonably 
incurred for, and properly allocable solely to, the supplies delivered 
(or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which 
final prices have not been established;
    (iii) The portion of the total interim profit (used in establishing 
the initial contract price or agreed to for the purpose of this 
paragraph (h)) that is in direct proportion to the supplies delivered 
(or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which 
final prices have not been established; and
    (iv) The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies 
delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government 
(including amounts applied or to be applied to liquidate progress 
payments).
    (2) The statement required by subparagraph (1) above need not be 
submitted for any quarter for which either no costs are to be reported 
under subdivision (1) (ii) above, or revised billing prices have been 
established in accordance with paragraph (g) above, and do not exceed 
the existing contract price, the Contractor's price-redetermination 
proposal, or a price based on the most recent quarterly statement, 
whichever is least.
    (3) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing 
greater payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under 
subdivision (1)(iv) above exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as 
computed in accordance with subdivisions (1)(i), (ii), and (iii) above, 
the Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the 
amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this 
refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the 
Contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or 
credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the excess has 
been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then that portion 
may, instead of being refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress 
payment account, consistent with the Progress Payments clause. The 
Contractor shall provide complete details to support any claimed 
reductions in refunds.
    (4) If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 
45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that 
the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay 
the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days 
after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount of the 
excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly 
statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in 
accordance with the Interest clause.
    (i) Subcontracts. No subcontract placed under this contract may 
provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. The 
Contractor shall--
    (1) Insert in each price redetermination or incentive price revision 
subcontract the substance of paragraph (h) above, and of this paragraph 
(i), modified to omit mention of the Government and to reflect the 
position of the Contractor as purchaser and of the subcontractor as 
vendor, and to omit that part of subparagraph (h)(3) above relating to 
tax credits; and
    (2) Include in each cost-reimbursement subcontract a requirement 
that each lower-tier price redetermination or incentive price revision 
subcontract contain the substance of paragraph (h) above, and this 
paragraph (i), modified as required by subparagraph (1) above.
    (j) Disagreements. If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer 
fail to agree upon redetermined prices for any price redetermination 
period within 60 days (or within such other period as the parties agree) 
after the date on which the data required by paragraph (d) above are to 
be submitted, the Contracting Officer shall promptly issue a decision in 
accordance with the Disputes clause. For the purpose of paragraphs (f), 
(g), and (h) above, and pending final settlement of the disagreement on 
appeal, by failure to appeal, or by agreement, this decision shall be 
treated as an executed contract modification. Pending final settlement, 
price redetermination for subsequent periods, if any, shall continue to 
be negotiated as provided in this clause.
    (k) Termination. If this contract is terminated, prices shall 
continue to be established in accordance with this clause for (1) 
completed supplies and services accepted by the Government and (2) those 
supplies and services not terminated under a partial termination. All 
other elements of the termination shall be resolved in accordance with 
other applicable clauses of this contract.

[[Page 91]]

                             (End of clause)

 NOTES:
    (1) Express in terms of units delivered, or as a date; but in either 
case the period should end on the last day of a month.
    (2) Insert the numbers of days chosen so that the Contractor's 
submission will be late enough to reflect recent cost experience (taking 
into account the Contractor's accounting system), but early enough to 
permit review, audit (if necessary), and negotiation before the start of 
the prospective period.
    (3) Insert first, except that second may be inserted if necessary to 
achieve compatibility with the Contractor's accounting system.

Sec. 52.216-6  Price Redetermination--Retroactive.

    As prescribed in 16.206-4, insert the following clause:

              Price Redetermination--Retroactive (Oct 1995)

    (a) General. The unit price and the total price stated in this 
contract shall be redetermined in accordance with this clause, but in no 
event shall the total amount paid under this contract exceed ---------- 
[insert dollar amount of ceiling price].
    (b) Definition. Costs, as used in this clause, means allowable costs 
in accordance with part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
in effect on the date of this contract.
    (c) Data submission. (1) Within -------- [Contracting Officer insert 
number of days] days after delivery of all supplies to be delivered and 
completion of all services to be performed under this contract, the 
Contractor shall submit--
    (i) Proposed prices;
    (ii) A statement on Standard Form 1411, Contract Pricing Proposal 
Cover Sheet (Cost or Pricing Data Required), or in any other form on 
which the parties may agree, of all costs incurred in performing the 
contract; and
    (iii) Any other relevant data that the Contracting Officer may 
reasonably require.
    (2) If the Contractor fails to submit the data required by 
subparagraph (1) above within the time specified, the Contracting 
Officer may suspend payments under this contract until the data are 
furnished. If it is later determined that the Government has overpaid 
the Contractor, the excess shall be repaid to the Government 
immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days after the end of the data 
submittal period, the amount of the excess shall bear interest, computed 
from the date the data were due to the date of repayment, at the rate 
established in accordance with the Interest clause.
    (d) Price determination. Upon the Contracting Officer's receipt of 
the data required by paragraph (c) above, the Contracting Officer and 
the Contractor shall promptly negotiate to redetermine fair and 
reasonable prices for supplies delivered and services performed by the 
Contractor under this contract.
    (e) Contract modification. The negotiated redetermination of price 
shall be evidenced by a modification to this contract, signed by the 
Contractor and the Contracting Officer.
    (f) Adjusting billing prices. Pending execution of the contract 
modification (see paragraph (e) above), the Contractor shall submit 
invoices or vouchers in accordance with billing prices stated in this 
contract. If at any time it appears that the then-current billing prices 
will be substantially greater than the estimated final prices, or if the 
Contractor submits data showing that the redetermined prices will be 
substantially greater than the current billing prices, the parties shall 
negotiate an appropriate decrease or increase in billing prices. Any 
billing price adjustment shall be reflected in a contract modification 
and shall not affect the redetermination of prices under this clause. 
After the contract modification for price redetermination is executed, 
the total amount paid or to be paid on all invoices or vouchers shall be 
adjusted to reflect the agreed-upon prices, and any resulting additional 
payments, refunds, or credits shall be made promptly.
    (g) Quarterly limitation on payments statement. This paragraph (g) 
shall apply until final price redetermination under this contract has 
been completed.
    (1) Within 45 days after the end of the quarter of the Contractor's 
fiscal year in which a delivery is first made (or services are first 
performed) and accepted by the Government under this contract, and for 
each quarter thereafter, the Contractor shall submit to the contract 
administration office (with a copy to the contracting office and the 
cognizant contract auditor), a statement, cumulative from the beginning 
of the contract, showing--
    (i) The total contract price of all supplies delivered (or services 
performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices 
have been established;
    (ii) The total costs (estimated to the extent necessary) reasonably 
incurred for, and properly allocable solely to, the supplies delivered 
(or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which 
final prices have not been established;
    (iii) The portion of the total interim profit (used in establishing 
the initial contract price or agreed to for the purpose of this 
paragraph (g)) that is in direct proportion to the supplies delivered 
(or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which 
final prices have not been established; and

[[Page 92]]

    (iv) The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies 
delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government 
(including amounts applied or to be applied to liquidate progress 
payments).
    (2) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing 
greater payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under 
subdivision (1)(iv) above exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as 
computed in accordance with subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) above, the 
Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the 
amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this 
refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the 
contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or 
credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the excess has 
been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then that portion 
may, instead of being refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress 
payment account, consistent with the Progress Payments clause. The 
Contractor shall provide complete details to support any claimed 
reduction in refunds.
    (3) If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 
45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that 
the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay 
the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days 
after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount of the 
excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly 
statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in 
accordance with the Interest clause.
    (h) Subcontracts. No subcontract placed under this contract may 
provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. The 
Contractor shall--
    (1) Insert in each price redetermination or incentive price revision 
subcontract the substance of paragraph (g) above, and of this paragraph 
(h), modified to omit mention of the Government and to reflect the 
position of the Contractor as purchaser and of the subcontractor as 
vendor, and to omit that part of subparagraph (g)(2) above relating to 
tax credits; and
    (2) Include in each cost-reimbursement subcontract a requirement 
that each lower-tier price redetermination or incentive price revision 
subcontract contain the substance of paragraph (g) above, and of this 
paragraph (h) modified as required by subparagraph (1) above.
    (i) Disagreements. If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer 
fail to agree upon redetermined prices within 60 days (or within such 
other period as the parties agree) after the date on which the data 
required by paragraph (c) above are to be submitted, the Contracting 
Officer shall promptly issue a decision in accordance with the Disputes 
clause. For the purpose of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) above, and 
pending final settlement of the disagreement on appeal, by failure to 
appeal, or by agreement, this decision shall be treated as an executed 
contract modification.
    (j) Termination. If this contract is terminated before price 
redetermination, prices shall be established in accordance with this 
clause for completed supplies and services not terminated. All other 
elements of the termination shall be resolved in accordance with other 
applicable clauses of this contract.

Sec. 52.216-7  Allowable Cost and Payment.

    As prescribed in 16.307(a), insert the following clause:

                  Allowable Cost and Payment (Aug 1996)

    (a) Invoicing. The Government shall make payments to the Contractor 
when requested as work progresses, but (except for small business 
concerns) not more often than once every 2 weeks, in amounts determined 
to be allowable by the Contracting Officer in accordance with subpart 
31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date 
of this contract and the terms of this contract. The Contractor may 
submit to an authorized representative of the Contracting Officer, in 
such form and reasonable detail as the representative may require, an 
invoice or voucher supported by a statement of the claimed allowable 
cost for performing this contract.
    (b) Reimbursing costs. (1) For the purpose of reimbursing allowable 
costs (except as provided in subparagraph (2) below, with respect to 
pension, deferred profit sharing, and employee stock ownership plan 
contributions), the term costs includes only--
    (i) Those recorded costs that, at the time of the request for 
reimbursement, the Contractor has paid by cash, check, or other form of 
actual payment for items or services purchased directly for the 
contract;
    (ii) When the Contractor is not delinquent in paying costs of 
contract performance in the ordinary course of business, costs incurred, 
but not necessarily paid, for--
    (A) Materials issued from the Contractor's inventory and placed in 
the production process for use on the contract;
    (B) Direct labor;
    (C) Direct travel;
    (D) Other direct in-house costs; and
    (E) Properly allocable and allowable indirect costs, as shown in the 
records maintained by the Contractor for purposes of obtaining 
reimbursement under Government contracts; and

[[Page 93]]

    (iii) The amount of progress payments that have been paid to the 
Contractor's subcontractors under similar cost standards.
    (2) Contractor contributions to any pension or other postretirement 
benefit, profit-sharing or employee stock ownership plan funds that are 
paid quarterly or more often may be included in indirect costs for 
payment purposes: Provided, That the Contractor pays the contribution to 
the fund within 30 days after the close of the period covered. Payments 
made 30 days or more after the close of a period shall not be included 
until the Contractor actually makes the payment. Accrued costs for such 
contributions that are paid less often than quarterly shall be excluded 
from indirect costs for payment purposes until the Contractor actually 
makes the payment.
    (3) Notwithstanding the audit and adjustment of invoices or vouchers 
under paragraph (g) below, allowable indirect costs under this contract 
shall be obtained by applying indirect cost rates established in 
accordance with paragraph (d) below.
    (4) Any statements in specifications or other documents incorporated 
in this contract by reference designating performance of services or 
furnishing of materials at the Contractor's expense or at no cost to the 
Government shall be disregarded for purposes of cost-reimbursement under 
this clause.
    (c) Small business concerns. A small business concern may be paid 
more often than every 2 weeks and may invoice and be paid for recorded 
costs for items or services purchased directly for the contract, even 
though the concern has not yet paid for those items or services.
    (d) Final indirect cost rates. (1) Final annual indirect cost rates 
and the appropriate bases shall be established in accordance with 
subpart 42.7 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect for 
the period covered by the indirect cost rate proposal.
    (2) The Contractor shall, within 90 days after the expiration of 
each of its fiscal years, or by a later date approved by the Contracting 
Officer, submit to the cognizant Contracting Officer responsible for 
negotiating its final indirect cost rates and, if required by agency 
procedures, to the cognizant audit activity proposed final indirect cost 
rates for that period and supporting cost data specifying the contract 
and/or subcontract to which the rates apply. The proposed rates shall be 
based on the Contractor's actual cost experience for that period. The 
appropriate Government representative and Contractor shall establish the 
final indirect cost rates as promptly as practical after receipt of the 
Contractor's proposal.
    (3) The Contractor and the appropriate Government representative 
shall execute a written understanding setting forth the final indirect 
cost rates. The understanding shall specify (i) the agreed-upon final 
annual indirect cost rates, (ii) the bases to which the rates apply, 
(iii) the periods for which the rates apply, (iv) any specific indirect 
cost items treated as direct costs in the settlement, and (v) the 
affected contract and/or subcontract, identifying any with advance 
agreements or special terms and the applicable rates. The understanding 
shall not change any monetary ceiling, contract obligation, or specific 
cost allowance or disallowance provided for in this contract. The 
understanding is incorporated into this contract upon execution.
    (4) Failure by the parties to agree on a final annual indirect cost 
rate shall be a dispute within the meaning of the Disputes clause.
    (e) Billing rates. Until final annual indirect cost rates are 
established for any period, the Government shall reimburse the 
Contractor at billing rates established by the Contracting Officer or by 
an authorized representative (the cognizant auditor), subject to 
adjustment when the final rates are established. These billing rates--
    (1) Shall be the anticipated final rates; and
    (2) May be prospectively or retroactively revised by mutual 
agreement, at either party's request, to prevent substantial overpayment 
or underpayment.
    (f) Quick-closeout procedures. Quick-closeout procedures are 
applicable when the conditions in FAR 42.708(a) are satisfied.
    (g) Audit. At any time or times before final payment, the 
Contracting Officer may have the Contractor's invoices or vouchers and 
statements of cost audited. Any payment may be (1) reduced by amounts 
found by the Contracting Officer not to constitute allowable costs or 
(2) adjusted for prior overpayments or underpayments.
    (h) Final payment. (1) The Contractor shall submit a completion 
invoice or voucher, designated as such, promptly upon completion of the 
work, but no later than one year (or longer, as the Contracting Officer 
may approve in writing) from the completion date. Upon approval of that 
invoice or voucher, and upon the Contractor's compliance with all terms 
of this contract, the Government shall promptly pay any balance of 
allowable costs and that part of the fee (if any) not previously paid.
    (2) The Contractor shall pay to the Government any refunds, rebates, 
credits, or other amounts (including interest, if any) accruing to or 
received by the Contractor or any assignee under this contract, to the 
extent that those amounts are properly allocable to costs for which the 
Contractor has been reimbursed by the Government. Reasonable expenses 
incurred by the Contractor for securing refunds, rebates, credits, or 
other amounts shall be allowable costs if approved by the Contracting 
Officer. Before final payment under this contract, the Contractor

[[Page 94]]

and each assignee whose assignment is in effect at the time of final 
payment shall execute and deliver--
    (i) An assignment to the Government, in form and substance 
satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, of refunds, rebates, credits, 
or other amounts (including interest, if any) properly allocable to 
costs for which the Contractor has been reimbursed by the Government 
under this contract; and
    (ii) A release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and 
employees from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of 
or under this contract, except--
    (A) Specified claims stated in exact amounts, or in estimated 
amounts when the exact amounts are not known;
    (B) Claims (including reasonable incidental expenses) based upon 
liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of the 
performance of this contract; provided, that the claims are not known to 
the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and that the 
Contractor gives notice of the claims in writing to the Contracting 
Officer within 6 years following the release date or notice of final 
payment date, whichever is earlier; and
    (C) Claims for reimbursement of costs, including reasonable 
incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the patent clauses 
of this contract, excluding, however, any expenses arising from the 
Contractor's indemnification of the Government against patent liability.

    (b) Payment of the fixed fee shall be made in installments based 
upon the percentage of completion of the work as determined from 
estimates submitted to and approved by the Contracting Officer, but 
subject to the withholding provisions of paragraph (c) below.
    (c) After the payment of 85 percent of the fixed fee, the 
Contracting Officer may withhold further payment of fee until a reserve 
is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers 
necessary to protect the Government's interest. This reserve shall not 
exceed 15 percent of the total fixed fee or $100,000, whichever is less.

                             (End of clause)

Sec. 52.216-10  Incentive Fee.

    As prescribed in 16.307(d), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract 
(other than a facilities contract) is contemplated:

                         Incentive Fee (Apr 1984)

    (a) General. The Government shall pay the Contractor for performing 
this contract a fee determined as provided in this contract.
    (b) Target cost and target fee. The target cost and target fee 
specified in the Schedule are subject to adjustment if the contract is 
modified in accordance with paragraph (d) below.
    (1) Target cost, as used in this contract, means the estimated cost 
of this contract as initially negotiated, adjusted in accordance with 
paragraph (d) below.
    (2) Target fee, as used in this contract, means the fee initially 
negotiated on the assumption that this contract would be performed for a 
cost equal to the estimated cost initially negotiated, adjusted in 
accordance with paragraph (d) below.
    (c) Withholding of payment. Normally, the Government shall pay the 
fee to the Contractor as specified in the Schedule. However, when the 
Contracting Officer considers that performance or cost indicates that 
the Contractor will not achieve target, the Government shall pay on the 
basis of an appropriate lesser fee. When the Contractor demonstrates 
that performance or cost clearly

[[Page 95]]

indicates that the Contractor will earn a fee significantly above the 
target fee, the Government may, at the sole discretion of the 
Contracting Officer, pay on the basis of an appropriate higher fee. 
After payment of 85 percent of the applicable fee, the Contracting 
Officer may withhold further payment of fee until a reserve is set aside 
in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect 
the Government's interest. This reserve shall not exceed 15 percent of 
the applicable fee or $100,000, whichever is less.
    (d) Equitable adjustments. When the work under this contract is 
increased or decreased by a modification to this contract or when any 
equitable adjustment in the target cost is authorized under any other 
clause, equitable adjustments in the target cost, target fee, minimum 
fee, and maximum fee, as appropriate, shall be stated in a supplemental 
agreement to this contract.
    (e) Fee payable. (1) The fee payable under this contract shall be 
the target fee increased by -------- [Contracting Officer insert 
Contractor's participation] cents for every dollar that the total 
allowable cost is less than the target cost or decreased by -------- 
[Contracting Officer insert Contractor's participation] cents for every 
dollar that the total allowable cost exceeds the target cost. In no 
event shall the fee be greater than -------- [Contracting Officer insert 
percentage] percent or less than -------- [Contracting Officer insert 
percentage] percent of the target cost.
    (2) The fee shall be subject to adjustment, to the extent provided 
in paragraph (d) above, and within the minimum and maximum fee 
limitations in subparagraph (1) above, when the total allowable cost is 
increased or decreased as a consequence of (i) payments made under 
assignments or (ii) claims excepted from the release as required by 
paragraph (h)(2) of the Allowable Cost and Payment clause.
    (3) If this contract is terminated in its entirety, the portion of 
the target fee payable shall not be subject to an increase or decrease 
as provided in this paragraph. The termination shall be accomplished in 
accordance with other applicable clauses of this contract.
    (4) For the purpose of fee adjustment, total allowable cost shall 
not include allowable costs arising out of--
    (i) Any of the causes covered by the Excusable Delays clause to the 
extent that they are beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of the Contractor or any subcontractor;
    (ii) The taking effect, after negotiating the target cost, of a 
statute, court decision, written ruling, or regulation that results in 
the Contractor's being required to pay or bear the burden of any tax or 
duty or rate increase in a tax or duty;
    (iii) Any direct cost attributed to the Contractor's involvement in 
litigation as required by the Contracting Officer pursuant to a clause 
of this contract, including furnishing evidence and information 
requested pursuant to the Notice and Assistance Regarding Patent and 
Copyright Infringement clause;
    (iv) The purchase and maintenance of additional insurance not in the 
target cost and required by the Contracting Officer, or claims for 
reimbursement for liabilities to third persons pursuant to the 
Insurance--Liability to Third Persons clause;
    (v) Any claim, loss, or damage resulting from a risk for which the 
Contractor has been relieved of liability by the Government Property 
clause; or
    (vi) Any claim, loss, or damage resulting from a risk defined in the 
contract as unusually hazardous or as a nuclear risk and against which 
the Government has expressly agreed to indemnify the Contractor.
    (5) All other allowable costs are included in total allowable cost 
for fee adjustment in accordance with this paragraph (e), unless 
otherwise specifically provided in this contract.
    (f) Contract modification. The total allowable cost and the adjusted 
fee determined as provided in this clause shall be evidenced by a 
modification to this contract signed by the Contractor and Contracting 
Officer.
    (g) Inconsistencies. In the event of any language inconsistencies 
between this clause and provisioning documents or Government options 
under this contract, compensation for spare parts or other supplies and 
services ordered under such documents shall be determined in accordance 
with this clause.

                             (End of clause)

    As prescribed in 16.307(f), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when a cost-sharing contract (other than a

is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers 
necessary to protect the Government's interest. This reserve shall not 
exceed one percent of the Government's share of the total estimated cost 
shown in the Schedule or $100,000, whichever is less.

                             (End of clause)

<R05>
Sec. 52.216-13  Allowable Cost and Payment--Facilities.

    As prescribed in 16.307(g), insert the following clause:

            Allowable Cost and Payment--Facilities (Aug 1996)

    (a) General. (1) For the performance of any work, duty, or 
obligation specified in this contract to be at Government expense, the 
Government shall pay the Contractor all allowable costs as determined by 
the Contracting Officer in accordance with the contract terms and 
section 31.106 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on 
the contract date.
    (2) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this contract, the 
failure of this contract to provide for reimbursement does not preclude 
the Contractor from including, as part of the price or cost under any 
other Government contract or subcontract, an allocable portion of the 
costs incurred for any work, duty, or obligation performed under this 
contract, but not reimbursable under it.
    (b) Invoicing. The Government shall make payments to the Contractor 
when requested once each month. The Contractor may submit to an 
authorized representative of the Contracting Officer, in such form and 
reasonable detail as the representative may require, an invoice or 
voucher supported by a statement of the claimed allowable cost for the 
performance of this contract.
    (c) Negotiated indirect costs. Notwithstanding the audit and 
adjustment of invoices or vouchers under paragraph (f) below, allowable 
indirect costs under this contract shall be obtained by applying final 
indirect cost rates established as follows:
    (1) Final annual indirect cost rates and the appropriate bases shall 
be established in accordance with subpart 42.7 of the FAR in effect for 
the period covered by the indirect cost rate proposal.
    (2) The Contractor shall, within 90 days after the expiration of 
each of its fiscal years, or by a later date approved by the Contracting 
Officer, submit to the Contracting Officer and to the cognizant audit 
activity proposed final indirect cost rates for that period and 
supporting cost and data specifying the contract and/or subcontract to 
which the rates apply. The proposed rates shall be based on the 
Contractor's actual cost experience for that period. The appropriate 
Government representative and the Contractor shall establish the final 
indirect cost rates as promptly as practical after receipt of the 
contractor's proposal.
    (3) The Contractor and the appropriate Government representative 
shall execute a written understanding setting forth the final indirect 
cost rates. The understanding shall specify (i) the agreed-upon final 
annual indirect cost rates, (ii) the bases to which the rates apply, 
(iii) the periods for which the rates apply, (iv) any specific indirect 
cost items treated as direct costs in the settlement, and (v) the 
affected contract and/or subcontract, identifying any with advance 
agreements or special terms and the applicable rates. The understanding 
shall not change any monetary ceiling, contract obligation, or specific 
cost allowance or disallowance provided for in this contract. The 
understanding is incorporated into this contract upon execution.

[[Page 97]]

    (4) Failure by the parties to agree on a final annual indirect cost 
rate shall be a dispute within the meaning of the Disputes clause.
    (d) Billing rates. Until final annual indirect cost rates are 
established for any period, the Government shall reimburse the 
Contractor at billing rates established by the Contracting Officer or by 
an authorized representative (the cognizant auditor), subject to 
adjustment when the final rates are established. These billing rates--
    (1) Shall be the anticipated final rates; and
    (2) May be prospectively or retroactively revised by mutual 
agreement, at either party's request, to prevent substantial overpayment 
or underpayment.
    (e) Quick-closeout procedures. Quick-closeout procedures are 
applicable when the conditions in FAR 42.708(a) are satisfied.
    (f) Audit. At any time or times before final payment, the 
Contracting Officer may have the Contractor's invoices or vouchers and 
statements of cost audited. Any payment may be (1) reduced by amounts 
found by the Contracting Officer not to constitute allowable costs or 
(2) adjusted for prior overpayments or underpayments.
    (g) Assignments and releases. The Contractor shall pay to the 
Government any refunds, rebates, credits, or other amounts (including 
interest, if any) accruing to or received by the Contractor or any 
assignee under this contract, to the extent that those amounts are 
properly allocable to costs for which the Contractor has been reimbursed 
by the Government. Reasonable expenses incurred by the Contractor for 
securing refunds, rebates, credits, or other amounts shall be allowable 
costs if approved by the Contracting Officer. Before final payment under 
this contract, the Contractor and each assignee shall execute and 
deliver--
    (1) An assignment to the Government, in form and substance 
satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, of refunds, rebates, credits, 
or other amounts (including interest, if any) properly allocable to 
costs for which the Contractor has been reimbursed by the Government 
under this contract; and
    (2) A release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and 
employees from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of 
or under this contract, except--
    (i) Specified claims stated in exact amounts, or in estimated 
amounts when the exact amounts are not known;
    (ii) Claims (including reasonable incidental expenses) based upon 
liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of 
performance of this contract; provided that the claims are not known to 
the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and that the 
Contractor gives notice of the claims in writing to the Contracting 
Officer within 6 years following the release date or notice of final 
payment date, whichever is earlier; and
    (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs, including related expenses, 
incurred by the Contractor under the patent clauses of this contract, 
excluding, however, any expenses arising from the Contractor's 
indemnification of the Government against patent liability.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the contract is for facilities 
acquisition, and the Contracting Officer considers it appropriate, add 
the following paragraphs (g) and (h) to the basic clause, and 
redesignate paragraph (g) of the basic clause as paragraph (i):

    (g) Withholding. After payment of 80 percent of the total estimated 
cost shown in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may withhold payment 
of allowable costs until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the 
Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's 
interest. This reserve shall not exceed one percent of the total 
estimated cost shown in the Schedule or $100,000, whichever is less.
    (h) Final Payment. The Contractor shall submit a completion invoice 
or voucher, designated as such, no later than one year (or longer, as 
the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the completion 
date. Upon approval of the invoice or voucher, and upon the Contractor's 
compliance with all terms of this contract, the Government shall 
promptly pay any balance of allowable costs not previously paid.

contemplated:

          Allowable Cost and Payment--Facilities Use (Apr 1984)

    (a) For the performance of any work, duty, or obligations specified 
in this contract to be at Government expense, the Government shall pay 
the Contractor all allowable costs as determined by the Contracting 
Officer in accordance with the contract terms and section 31.106 of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the contract date.
    (b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this contract, the 
failure of this contract to provide for reimbursement does not preclude 
the Contractor from including, as

[[Page 98]]

part of the price or cost under any other Government contract or 
subcontract, an allocable portion of the costs incurred for any work, 
duty, or obligation performed under this contract, but not reimbursed 
under it.

Sec. 52.216-15  Predetermined Indirect Cost Rates.

    As prescribed in 16.307(i), insert the following clause:

               Predetermined Indirect Cost Rates (Aug 1996)

    (a) Notwithstanding the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this 
contract, the allowable indirect costs under this contract shall be 
obtained by applying predetermined indirect cost rates to bases agreed 
upon by the parties, as specified below.
    (b) Not later than 90 days after the expiration of the Contractor's 
fiscal year (or other period specified in the Schedule), the Contractor 
shall submit to the cognizant Contracting Officer under subpart 42.7 of 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and, if required by agency 
procedures, to the cognizant Government audit activity, proposed 
predetermined indirect cost rates and supporting cost data. The proposed 
rates shall be based on the Contractor's actual cost experience during 
that fiscal year or other period specified in the Schedule. Negotiation 
of predetermined indirect cost rates shall begin as soon as practical 
after receipt of the contractor's proposal.
    (c) Allowability of costs and acceptability of cost allocation 
methods shall be determined in accordance with FAR subpart 31.3 in 
effect on the date of this contract.
    (d) Predetermined rate agreements in effect on the date of this 
contract shall be incorporated into the contract Schedule. The 
Contracting Officer and Contractor shall negotiate rates for subsequent 
periods and execute a written indirect cost rate agreement setting forth 
the results. The agreement shall specify (1) the agreed-upon 
predetermined indirect cost rates, (2) the bases to which the rates 
apply, (3) the period for which the rates apply, and (4) the specific 
items treated as direct costs or any changes in the items previously 
agreed to be direct costs. The indirect cost rate agreement shall not 
change any monetary ceiling, contract obligation, or specific cost 
allowance or disallowance provided for in this contract. The agreement 
is incorporated into this contract upon execution.
    (e) Pending establishment of predetermined indirect cost rates for 
any fiscal year (or other period agreed to by the parties), the 
Contractor shall be reimbursed either at the rates fixed for the 
previous fiscal year (or other period) or at billing rates acceptable to 
the Contracting Officer, subject to appropriate adjustment when the 
final rates for that period are established.
    (f) Any failure by the parties to agree on any predetermined 
indirect cost rates under this clause shall not be considered a dispute 
within the meaning of the Disputes clause. If for any fiscal year (or 
other period specified in the Schedule) the parties fail to agree to 
predetermined indirect cost rates, the allowable indirect costs shall be 
obtained by applying final indirect cost rates established in accordance 
with the Allowable Cost and Payment clause.
    (g) Allowable indirect costs for the period from the beginning of 
performance until the end of the Contractor's fiscal year (or other 
period specified in the Schedule) shall be obtained using the 
predetermined indirect cost rates and the bases shown in the Schedule.

                             (End of clause)

Sec. 52.216-16  Incentive Price Revision--Firm Target.

    As prescribed in 16.405(a), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price incentive (firm target) 
contract is contemplated. For items to be subject to incentive price 
revision, show in the contract Schedule the target cost, target profit, 
and target price for each item.

             Incentive Price Revision--Firm Target (Apr 1984)

    (a) General. The supplies or services identified in the Schedule as 
Items ---------- [Contracting Officer insert Schedule line item numbers] 
are subject to price revision in accordance with this clause; provided, 
that in no event shall the total final price of these items exceed the 
ceiling price of -------- dollars ($------). Any supplies or services 
that are to be (1) ordered separately under, or otherwise added to, this 
contract and (2) subject to price revision in accordance with the terms 
of this clause shall be identified as such in a modification to this 
contract.
    (b) Definition. Costs, as used in this clause, means allowable costs 
in accordance with part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
in effect on the date of this contract.
    (c) Data submission. (1) Within -------- [Contracting Officer insert 
number of days] days after the end of the month in which the Contractor 
has delivered the last unit of supplies and completed the services 
specified by item number in paragraph (a) above, the Contractor shall 
submit on Standard Form 1411 or in any other form on which the parties 
agree--

[[Page 99]]

    (i) A detailed statement of all costs incurred up to the end of that 
month in performing all work under the items;
    (ii) An estimate of costs of further performance, if any, that may 
be necessary to complete performance of all work under the items;
    (iii) A list of all residual inventory and an estimate of its value; 
and
    (iv) Any other relevant data that the Contracting Officer may 
reasonably require.
    (2) If the Contractor fails to submit the data required by 
subparagraph (1) above within the time specified and it is later 
determined that the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the 
Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government immediately. Unless 
repaid within 30 days after the end of the data submittal period, the 
amount of the excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the 
data were due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in 
accordance with the Interest clause.
    (d) Price revision. Upon the Contracting Officer's receipt of the 
data required by paragraph (c) above, the Contracting Officer and the 
Contractor shall promptly establish the total final price of the items 
specified in (a) above by applying to final negotiated cost an 
adjustment for profit or loss, as follows:
    (1) On the basis of the information required by paragraph (c) above, 
together with any other pertinent information, the parties shall 
negotiate the total final cost incurred or to be incurred for supplies 
delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and 
which are subject to price revision under this clause.
    (2) The total final price shall be established by applying to the 
total final negotiated cost an adjustment for profit or loss, as 
follows:
    (i) If the total final negotiated cost is equal to the total target 
cost, the adjustment is the total target profit.
    (ii) If the total final negotiated cost is greater than the total 
target cost, the adjustment is the total target profit, less ------ 
[Contracting Officer insert percent] percent of the amount by which the 
total final negotiated cost exceeds the total target cost.
    (iii) If the final negotiated cost is less than the total target 
cost, the adjustment is the total target profit plus ---- [Contracting 
Officer insert percent] percent of the amount by which the total final 
negotiated cost is less than the total target cost.
    (e) Contract modification. The total final price of the items 
specified in paragraph (a) above shall be evidenced by a modification to 
this contract, signed by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer. 
This price shall not be subject to revision, notwithstanding any changes 
in the cost of performing the contract, except to the extent that--
    (1) The parties may agree in writing, before the determination of 
total final price, to exclude specific elements of cost from this price 
and to a procedure for subsequent disposition of those elements; and
    (2) Adjustments or credits are explicitly permitted or required by 
this or any other clause in this contract.
    (f) Adjusting billing prices. (1) Pending execution of the contract 
modification (see paragraph (e) above), the Contractor shall submit 
invoices or vouchers in accordance with billing prices as provided in 
this paragraph. The billing prices shall be the target prices shown in 
this contract.
    (2) If at any time it appears from information provided by the 
contractor under subparagraph (g)(2) below that the then-current billing 
prices will be substantially greater than the estimated final prices, 
the parties shall negotiate a reduction in the billing prices. 
Similarly, the parties may negotiate an increase in billing prices by 
any or all of the difference between the target prices and the ceiling 
price, upon the Contractor's submission of factual data showing that 
final cost under this contract will be substantially greater than the 
target cost.
    (3) Any billing price adjustment shall be reflected in a contract 
modification and shall not affect the determination of the total final 
price under paragraph (d) above. After the contract modification 
establishing the total final price is executed, the total amount paid or 
to be paid on all invoices or vouchers shall be adjusted to reflect the 
total final price, and any resulting additional payments, refunds, or 
credits shall be made promptly.
    (g) Quarterly limitation on payments statement. This paragraph (g) 
shall apply until final price revision under this contract has been 
completed.
    (1) Within 45 days after the end of each quarter of the Contractor's 
fiscal year in which a delivery is first made (or services are first 
performed) and accepted by the Government under this contract, and for 
each quarter thereafter, the Contractor shall submit to the contract 
administration office (with a copy to the contracting office and the 
cognizant contract auditor) a statement, cumulative from the beginning 
of the contract, showing--
    (i) The total contract price of all supplies delivered (or services 
performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices 
have been established;
    (ii) The total costs (estimated to the extent necessary) reasonably 
incurred for, and properly allocable solely to, the supplies delivered 
(or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which 
final prices have not been established;
    (iii) The portion of the total target profit (used in establishing 
the initial contract price or agreed to for the purpose of this 
paragraph (g)) that is in direct proportion to the supplies delivered 
(or services performed)

[[Page 100]]

and accepted by the Government and for which final prices have not been 
established--increased or decreased in accordance with subparagraph 
(d)(2) above, when the amount stated under subdivision (ii), immediately 
above, differs from the aggregate target costs of the supplies or 
services; and
    (iv) The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies 
delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government 
(including amounts applied or to be applied to liquidate progress 
payments).
    (2) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing 
greater payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under 
subdivision (1)(iv) above exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as 
computed in accordance with subdivisions (1)(i), (ii), and (iii) above, 
the Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the 
amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this 
refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the 
Contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or 
credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the excess has 
been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then that portion 
may, instead of being refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress 
payment account consistent with the Progress Payments clause. The 
Contractor shall provide complete details to support any claimed 
reductions in refunds.
    (3) If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 
45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that 
the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay 
the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days 
after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount of the 
excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly 
statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in 
accordance with the Interest clause.
    (h) Subcontracts. No subcontract placed under this contract may 
provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. The 
Contractor shall--
    (1) Insert in each price redetermination or incentive price revision 
subcontract the substance of paragraph (g), above, and of this paragraph 
(h), modified to omit mention of the Government and to reflect the 
position of the Contractor as purchaser and of the subcontractor as 
vendor, and to omit that part of subparagraph (g)(2) above relating to 
tax credits; and
    (2) Include in each cost-reimbursement subcontract a requirement 
that each lower-tier price redetermination or incentive price revision 
subcontract contain the substance of paragraph (g) above and of this 
paragraph (h), modified as required by subparagraph (1) above.
    (i) Disagreements. If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer 
fail to agree upon the total final price within 60 days (or within such 
other period as the Contracting Officer may specify) after the date on 
which the data required by paragraph (c) above are to be submitted, the 
Contracting Officer shall promptly issue a decision in accordance with 
the Disputes clause.
    (j) Termination. If this contract is terminated before the total 
final price is established, prices of supplies or services subject to 
price revision shall be established in accordance with this clause for 
(1) completed supplies and services accepted by the Government and (2) 
those supplies and services not terminated under a partial termination. 
All other elements of the termination shall be resolved in accordance 
with other applicable clauses of this contract.
    (k) Equitable adjustment under other clauses. If an equitable 
adjustment in the contract price is made under any other clause of this 
contract before the total final price is established, the adjustment 
shall be made in the total target cost and may be made in the maximum 
dollar limit on the total final price, the total target profit, or both. 
If the adjustment is made after the total final price is established, 
only the total final price shall be adjusted.
    (l) Exclusion from target price and total final price. If any clause 
of this contract provides that the contract price does not or will not 
include an amount for a specific purpose, then neither any target price 
nor the total final price includes or will include any amount for that 
purpose.
    (m) Separate reimbursement. If any clause of this contract expressly 
provides that the cost of performance of an obligation shall be at 
Government expense, that expense shall not be included in any target 
price or in the total final price, but shall be reimbursed separately.
    (n) Taxes. As used in the Federal, State, and Local Taxes clause or 
in any other clause that provides for certain taxes or duties to be 
included in, or excluded from, the contract price, the term contract 
price includes the total target price or, if it has been established, 
the total final price. When any of these clauses requires that the 
contract price be increased or decreased as a result of changes in the 
obligation of the Contractor to pay or bear the burden of certain taxes 
or duties, the increase or decrease shall be made in the total target 
price or, if it has been established, in the total final price, so that 
it will not affect the Contractor's profit or loss on this contract.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the contract calls for supplies or 
services to be ordered under a provisioning document

[[Page 101]]

or Government option and the prices are to be subject to the incentive 
price revision described in the basic clause, add the following 
paragraph (o) to the basic clause:
    (o) Provisioning and options. Parts, other supplies, or services 
that are to be furnished under this contract on the basis of a 
provisioning document or Government option shall be subject to price 
revision in accordance with this clause. Any prices established for 
these parts, other supplies, or services under a provisioning document 
or Government option shall be treated as target prices. Target cost and 
profit covering these parts, other supplies, or services may be 
established separately, in the aggregate, or in any combination, as the 
parties may agree.

Sec. 52.216-17  Incentive Price Revision--Successive Targets.

    As prescribed in 16.405(b), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price incentive (successive 
target) contract is contemplated. For items to be subject to incentive 
price revision, show in the contract Schedule the initial target cost, 
initial target profit, and initial target price for each item.

         Incentive Price Revision--Successive Targets (Apr 1984)

    (a) General. The supplies or services identified in the Schedule as 
Items -------- [Contracting Officer insert line item numbers] are 
subject to price revision in accordance with this clause; provided, that 
in no event shall the total final price of these items exceed the 
ceiling price of -------- dollars ($------). The prices of these items 
shown in the Schedule are the initial target prices, which include an 
initial target profit of -------- [Contracting Officer insert percent] 
percent of the initial target cost. Any supplies or services that are to 
be (1) ordered separately under, or otherwise added to, this contract 
and (2) subject to price revision in accordance with this clause shall 
be identified as such in a modification to this contract.
    (b) Definition. Costs, as used in this clause, means allowable costs 
in accordance with part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
in effect on the date of this contract.
    (c) Submitting data for establishing the firm fixed price or a final 
profit adjustment formula. (1) Within -------- [Contracting Officer 
insert number of days] days after the end of the month in which the 
Contractor has completed ---- [see Note 1], the Contractor shall submit 
the following data:
    (i) A proposed firm fixed price or total firm target price for 
supplies delivered and to be delivered and services performed and to be 
performed.
    (ii) A detailed statement of all costs incurred in the performance 
of this contract through the end of the month specified above, on 
Standard Form 1411 (or in any other form on which the parties may 
agree), with sufficient supporting data to disclose unit costs and cost 
trends for--
    (A) Supplies delivered and services performed; and
    (B) Inventories of work in process and undelivered contract supplies 
on hand (estimated to the extent necessary).
    (iii) An estimate of costs of all supplies delivered and to be 
delivered and all services performed and to be performed under this 
contract, using the statement of costs incurred plus an estimate of 
costs to complete performance, on Standard Form 1411 (or in any other 
form on which the parties may agree), together with--
    (A) Sufficient data to support the accuracy and reliability of the 
estimate; and
    (B) An explanation of the differences between this estimate and the 
original estimate used to establish the initial target prices.
    (2) The Contractor shall also submit, to the extent that it becomes 
available before negotiations establishing the total firm price are 
concluded--
    (i) Supplemental statements of costs incurred after the end of the 
month specified in subparagraph (1) above for--
    (A) Supplies delivered and services performed; and
    (B) Inventories of work in process and undelivered contract supplies 
on hand (estimated to the extent necessary); and
    (ii) Any other relevant data that the Contracting Officer may 
reasonably require.
    (3) If the Contractor fails to submit the data required by 
subparagraphs (1) and (2) above within the time specified and it is 
later determined that the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the 
Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government immediately. Unless 
repaid within 30 days after the end of the data submittal period, the 
amount of the excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the 
data were due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in 
accordance with the Interest clause.
    (d) Establishing firm fixed price or final profit adjustment 
formula. Upon the Contracting Officer's receipt of the data required by 
paragraph (c) above the Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall 
promptly establish either a firm fixed price or a profit adjustment 
formula for determining final profit, as follows:
    (1) The parties shall negotiate a total firm target cost, based upon 
the data submitted under paragraph (c) above.

[[Page 102]]

    (2) If the total firm target cost is more than the total initial 
target cost, the total initial target profit shall be decreased. If the 
total firm target cost is less than the total initial target cost, the 
total initial target profit shall be increased. The initial target 
profit shall be increased or decreased by -------- percent [see Note 2] 
of the difference between the total initial target cost and the total 
firm target cost. The resulting amount shall be the total firm target 
profit; provided, that in no event shall the total firm target profit be 
less than ---- percent or more than ---- percent [Contracting Officer 
insert percents] of the total initial target cost.
    (3) If the total firm target cost plus the total firm target profit 
represent a reasonable price for performing that part of the contract 
subject to price revision under this clause, the parties may agree on a 
firm fixed price, which shall be evidenced by a contract modification 
signed by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer.
    (4) Failure of the parties to agree to a firm fixed price shall not 
constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause. If agreement is not 
reached, or if establishment of a firm fixed price is inappropriate, the 
Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall establish a profit 
adjustment formula under which the total final price shall be 
established by applying to the total final negotiated cost an adjustment 
for profit or loss, determined as follows:
    (i) If the total final negotiated cost is equal to the total firm 
target cost, the adjustment is the total firm target profit.
    (ii) If the total final negotiated cost is greater than the total 
firm target cost, the adjustment is the total firm target profit, less 
---- percent of the amount by which the total final negotiated cost 
exceeds the total firm target cost.
    (iii) If the total final negotiated cost is less than the total firm 
target cost, the adjustment is the total firm target profit, plus ---- 
percent of the amount by which the total final negotiated cost is less 
than the total firm target cost.
    (iv) The total firm target cost, total firm target profit, and the 
profit adjustment formula for determining final profit shall be 
evidenced by a modification to this contract signed by the Contractor 
and the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Submitting data for final price revision. Unless a firm fixed 
price has been established in accordance with paragraph (d) above within 
-------- [Contracting Officer insert number of days] days after the end 
of the month in which the Contractor has delivered the last unit of 
supplies and completed the services specified by item number in 
paragraph (a) above, the Contractor shall submit on Standard Form 1411 
(or in any other form on which the parties agree)--
    (1) A detailed statement of all costs incurred up to the end of that 
month in performing all work under the items;
    (2) An estimate of costs of further performance, if any, that may be 
necessary to complete performance of all work under the items;
    (3) A list of all residual inventory and an estimate of its value; 
and
    (4) Any other relevant data that the Contracting Officer may 
reasonably require.
    (f) Final price revision. Unless a firm fixed price has been agreed 
to in accordance with paragraph (d) above, the Contractor and the 
Contracting Officer shall, promptly after submission of the data 
required by paragraph (e) above, establish the total final price, as 
follows:
    (1) On the basis of the information required by paragraph (e) above, 
together with any other pertinent information, the parties shall 
negotiate the total final cost incurred or to be incurred for the 
supplies delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the 
Government and which are subject to price revision under this clause.
    (2) The total final price shall be established by applying to the 
total final negotiated cost an adjustment for final profit or loss 
determined as agreed upon under subparagraph (d)(4) above.
    (g) Contract modification. The total final price of the items 
specified in paragraph (a) above shall be evidenced by a modification to 
this contract, signed by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer. 
This price shall not be subject to revision, notwithstanding any changes 
in the cost of performing the contract, except to the extent that--
    (1) The parties may agree in writing, before the determination of 
total final price, to exclude specific elements of cost from this price 
and to a procedure for subsequent disposition of these elements; and
    (2) Adjustments or credits are explicitly permitted or required by 
this or any other clause in this contract.
    (h) Adjustment of billing prices. (1) Pending execution of the 
contract modification (see paragraph (e) above), the Contractor shall 
submit invoices or vouchers in accordance with billing prices as 
provided in this paragraph. The billing prices shall be the initial 
target prices shown in this contract until firm target prices are 
established under paragraph (d) above. When established, the firm target 
prices shall be used as the billing prices.
    (2) If at any time it appears from information provided by the 
contractor under subparagraph (i)(1) below that the then-current billing 
prices will be substantially greater than the estimated final prices, 
the parties shall negotiate a reduction in the billing prices. 
Similarly, the parties may negotiate an increase in billing prices by 
any or all of the difference between the target prices and

[[Page 103]]

the ceiling price, upon the Contractor's submission of factual data 
showing that the final cost under this contract will be substantially 
greater than the target cost.
    (3) Any adjustment of billing prices shall be reflected in a 
contract modification and shall not affect the determination of any 
price under paragraph (d) or (f) above. After the contract modification 
establishing the total final price is executed, the total amount paid or 
to be paid on all invoices or vouchers shall be adjusted to reflect the 
total final price, and any resulting additional payments, refunds, or 
credits shall be made promptly.
    (i) Quarterly limitation on payments statement. This paragraph (i) 
shall apply until a firm fixed price or a total final price is 
established under subparagraph (d)(3) or (f)(2).
    (1) Within 45 days after the end of each quarter of the Contractor's 
fiscal year in which a delivery is first made (or services are first 
performed) and accepted by the Government under this contract, and for 
each quarter thereafter, the Contractor shall submit to the contract 
administration office (with a copy to the contracting office and the 
cognizant contract auditor) a statement, cumulative from the beginning 
of the contract, showing--
    (i) The total contract price of all supplies delivered (or services 
performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices 
have been established;
    (ii) The total cost (estimated to the extent necessary) reasonably 
incurred for, and properly allocable solely to, the supplies delivered 
(or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which 
final prices have not been established;
    (iii) The portion of the total interim profit (used in establishing 
the initial contract price or agreed to for the purpose of this 
paragraph (i)) that is in direct proportion to the supplies delivered 
(or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which 
final prices have not been established--increased or decreased in 
accordance with subparagraph (d)(4) above when the amount stated under 
subdivision (ii), immediately above, differs from the aggregate firm 
target costs of the supplies or services; and
    (iv) The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies 
delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government 
(including amounts applied or to be applied to liquidate progress 
payments).
    (2) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing 
greater payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under 
subdivision (1)(iv) above exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as 
computed in accordance with subdivisions (1)(i), (ii), and (iii) above, 
the Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the 
amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this 
refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the 
Contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or 
credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the excess has 
been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then that portion 
may, instead of being refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress 
payment account consistent with the Progress Payments clause. The 
Contractor shall provide complete details to support any claimed 
reductions in refunds.
    (3) If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 
45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that 
the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay 
the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days 
after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount of the 
excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly 
statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in 
accordance with the Interest clause.
    (j) Subcontracts. No subcontract placed under this contract may 
provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. The 
Contractor shall--
    (1) Insert in each price redetermination or incentive price revision 
subcontract the substance of paragraph (i) above, and of this paragraph 
(j), modified to omit mention of the Government and to reflect the 
position of the Contractor as purchaser and of the subcontractor as 
vendor, and to omit that part of subparagraph (i)(2) above relating to 
tax credits; and
    (2) Include in each cost-reimbursement subcontract a requirement 
that each lower-tier price redetermination or incentive price revision 
subcontract contain the substance of paragraph (i) above, and of this 
paragraph (j), modified as required by subparagraph (j)(1), immediately 
above.
    (k) Disagreements. If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer 
fail to agree upon (1) a total firm target cost and a final profit 
adjustment formula or (2) a total final price, within 60 days (or within 
such other period as the Contracting Officer may specify) after the date 
on which the data required in paragraphs (c) and (e) above are to be 
submitted, the Contracting Officer shall promptly issue a decision in 
accordance with the Disputes clause.
    (l) Termination. If this contract is terminated before the total 
final price is established, prices of supplies or services subject to 
price revision shall be established in accordance with this clause for 
(1) completed supplies and services accepted by the Government and (2) 
those supplies or services not terminated under a partial termination. 
All other elements of the termination shall

[[Page 104]]

be resolved in accordance with other applicable clauses of this 
contract.
    (m) Equitable adjustments under other clauses. If an equitable 
adjustment in the contract price is made under any other clause of this 
contract before the total final price is established, the adjustment 
shall be made in the total target cost and may be made in the maximum 
dollar limit on the total final price, the total target profit, or both. 
If the adjustment is made after the total final price is established, 
only the total final price shall be adjusted.
    (n) Exclusion from target price and total final price. If any clause 
of this contract provides that the contract price does not or will not 
include an amount for a specific purpose, then neither any target price 
nor the total final price includes or will include any amount for that 
purpose.
    (o) Separate reimbursement. If any clause of this contract expressly 
provides that the cost of performance of an obligation shall be at 
Government expense, that expense shall not be included in any target 
price or in the total final price, but shall be reimbursed separately.
    (p) Taxes. As used in the Federal, State, and Local Taxes clause or 
in any other clause that provides for certain taxes or duties to be 
included in, or excluded from, the contract price, the term contract 
price includes the total target price or, if it has been established, 
the total final price. When any of these clauses requires that the 
contract price be increased or decreased as a result of changes in the 
obligation of the Contractor to pay or bear the burden of certain taxes 
or duties, the increase or decrease shall be made in the total target 
price or, if it has been established, in the total final price, so that 
it will not affect the Contractor's profit or loss on this contract.

                             (End of clause)

    NOTES:
 (1) The degree of completion may be based on a percentage of contract 
performance or any other reasonable basis.
 (2) The language may be changed to describe a negotiated adjustment 
pattern under which the extent of adjustment is not the same for all 
levels of cost variation.

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the contract calls for supplies or 
services to be ordered under a provisioning document or Government 
option and the prices are to be subject to the incentive price revision 
described in the basic clause, add the following paragraph (q) to the 
basic clause:
    (q) Provisioning and options. Parts, other supplies, or services 
that are to be furnished under this contract on the basis of a 
provisioning document or Government option shall be subject to price 
revision in accordance with this clause. Any prices established for 
these parts, other supplies, or services under a provisioning document 
or Government option shall be treated as initial target prices, or 
target prices as agreed upon and stipulated in the pricing document 
supporting the provisioning or added items. Initial or firm target costs 
and profits and final prices covering these parts, other supplies, or 
services may be established separately, in the aggregate, or in any 
combination, as the parties may agree.

``issued'' when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders 
may be issued orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods 
only if authorized in the Schedule.

    As prescribed in 16.506(b), insert a clause substantially the same 
as follows:

                      Order Limitations (Oct 1995)

    (a) Minimum order. When the Government requires supplies or services 
covered by this contract in an amount of less than -------- [insert 
dollar figure or quantity], the Government is not obligated to purchase, 
nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services

above.
    (c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the 
Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any 
one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the 
maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) above.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) above, the Contractor 
shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in 
paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering 
office within ------ days after issuance, with written notice stating 
the Contractor's intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and 
the reasons. Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the 
supplies or services from another source.

the supplies or services specified, and effective for the period stated, 
in the Schedule.
    (b) The Government shall order the quantity of supplies or services 
specified in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall furnish them when 
ordered. Delivery or performance shall be at locations designated in 
orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause and the Schedule.
    (c) Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order 
Limitations clause or in the Schedule, there is no limit on the number 
of orders that may be issued. The Government may issue orders requiring 
delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.
    (d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract 
and not completed within that time shall be completed by the Contractor 
within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the 
Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to 
that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the 
contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be 
required to make any deliveries under this contract after -------- 
[insert date].

Sec. 52.216-21  Requirements.

    As prescribed in 16.506(d), insert the following clause:

                         Requirements (Oct 1995)

    (a) This is a requirements contract for the supplies or services 
specified, and effective for the period stated, in the Schedule. The 
quantities of supplies or services specified in the Schedule are 
estimates only and are not purchased by this contract. Except as this 
contract may otherwise provide, if the Government's requirements do not 
result in orders in the quantities described as estimated or maximum in 
the Schedule, that fact shall not constitute the basis for an equitable 
price adjustment.
    (b) Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by 
orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause. Subject to any 
limitations in the Order Limitations clause or elsewhere in this 
contract, the Contractor shall furnish to the Government all supplies or 
services specified in the Schedule and called for by orders issued in 
accordance with the Ordering clause. The Government may issue orders 
requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple 
locations.
    (c) Except as this contract otherwise provides, the Government shall 
order from the Contractor all the supplies or services specified in the 
Schedule that are required to be purchased by the Government activity or 
activities specified in the Schedule.
    (d) The Government is not required to purchase from the Contractor 
requirements in excess of any limit on total orders under this contract.
    (e) If the Government urgently requires delivery of any quantity of 
an item before the earliest date that delivery may be specified under 
this contract, and if the Contractor will not accept an order providing 
for the accelerated delivery, the Government may acquire the urgently 
required goods or services from another source.
    (f) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract 
and not completed within that period shall be completed by the 
Contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall 
govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with 
respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed 
during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor 
shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after 
-------- [insert date].

[[Page 106]]

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the requirements contract is for 
nonpersonal services and related supplies and covers estimated 
requirements that exceed a specific Government activity's internal 
capability to produce or perform, substitute the following paragraph (c) 
for paragraph (c) of the basic clause:
    (c) The estimated quantities are not the total requirements of the 
Government activity specified in the Schedule, but are estimates of 
requirements in excess of the quantities that the activity may itself 
furnish within its own capabilities. Except as this contract otherwise 
provides, the Government shall order from the Contractor all of that 
activity's requirements for supplies and services specified in the 
Schedule that exceed the quantities that the activity may itself furnish 
within its own capabilities.
    Alternate II (APR 1984). If the requirements contract includes 
subsistence for both Government use and resale in the same Schedule, and 
similar products may be acquired on a brand-name basis, add the 
following paragraph (g) to the basic clause:
    (g) The requirements referred to in this contract are for items to 
be manufactured according to Government specifications. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary stated in the contract, the Government may 
acquire similar products by brand name from other sources for resale.
    Alternate III (OCT 1995). If the requirements contract involves a 
partial small business set-aside, substitute the following paragraph (c) 
for paragraph (c) of the basic clause:
    (c) The Government's requirements for each item or subitem of 
supplies or services described in the Schedule are being purchased 
through one non-set-aside contract and one set-aside contract. 
Therefore, the Government shall order from each Contractor approximately 
one-half of the total supplies or services specified in the Schedule 
that are required to be purchased by the specified Government activity 
or activities. The Government may choose between the set-aside 
Contractor and the non-set-aside Contractor in placing any particular 
order. However, the Government shall allocate successive orders, in 
accordance with its delivery requirements, to maintain as close a ratio 
as is reasonably practicable between the total quantities ordered from 
the two Contractors.
    Alternate IV (OCT 1995). If the contract includes subsistence for 
both Government use and resale in the same Schedule and similar products 
may be acquired on a brand-name basis and the contract also involves a 
partial small business set-aside, substitute the following paragraph (c)

contract referred to in this letter contract, the Government shall 
promptly reimburse the Contractor for all allowable costs under this 
contract at the following rates:
    (1) One hundred percent of approved costs representing progress

in this contract.
    (c) Invoicing. Payments shall be made promptly to the Contractor 
when requested as work progresses, but (except for small business 
concerns) not more often than every 2 weeks, in amounts approved by the 
Contracting Officer. The Contractor may submit to an authorized 
representative of the Contracting Officer, in such form and reasonable 
detail as the representative may require, an invoice or voucher

Contractor in the performance of this contract.
    (d) Allowable costs. For the purpose of determining allowable costs,

payment for items or services purchased directly for the contract;

    As prescribed in 17.109(a), insert the following clause:

            Cancellation Under Multiyear Contracts (Jul 1996)

    (a) Cancellation, as used in this clause, means that the Government 
is canceling its requirements for all supplies or services in program 
years subsequent to that in which notice of cancellation is provided. 
Cancellation shall occur by the date or within the time period specified 
in the Schedule, unless a later date is agreed to, if the Contracting 
Officer (1) notifies the Contractor that funds are not available for 
contract performance for any subsequent program year, or (2) fails to 
notify the Contractor that funds are available for performance of the 
succeeding program year requirement.
    (b) Except for cancellation under this clause or termination under 
the Default clause, any reduction by the Contracting Officer in the 
requirements of this contract shall be considered a termination under 
the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause.
    (c) If cancellation under this clause occurs, the Contractor will be 
paid a cancellation charge not over the cancellation ceiling specified 
in the Schedule as applicable at the time of cancellation.
    (d) The cancellation charge will cover only (1) costs (i) incurred 
by the Contractor and/or subcontractor, (ii) reasonably necessary for 
performance of the contract, and (iii) that would have been equitably 
amortized over the entire multiyear contract period but, because of the 
cancellation, are not so amortized, and (2) a reasonable profit or fee 
on the costs.
    (e) The cancellation charge shall be computed and the claim made for 
it as if the claim were being made under the Termination for Convenience 
of the Government clause of this contract. The Contractor shall submit 
the claim promptly but no later than 1 year from the date (1) of 
notification of the nonavailability of funds, or (2) specified in the 
Schedule by which notification of the availability of additional funds 
for the next succeeding program year is required to be issued, whichever 
is earlier, unless extensions in writing are granted by the Contracting 
Officer.
    (f) The Contractor's claim may include--
    (1) Reasonable nonrecurring costs (see Subpart 15.8 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation) which are applicable to and normally would have 
been amortized in all supplies or services which are multiyear 
requirements;
    (2) Allocable portions of the costs of facilities acquired or 
established for the conduct of the work, to the extent that it is 
impracticable for the Contractor to use the facilities in its commercial 
work, and if the costs are not charged to the contract through overhead 
or otherwise depreciated;
    (3) Costs incurred for the assembly, training, and transportation to 
and from the job site of a specialized work force; and
    (4) Costs not amortized solely because the cancellation had 
precluded anticipated benefits of Contractor or subcontractor learning.
    (g) The claim shall not include--
    (1) Labor, material, or other expenses incurred by the Contractor or 
subcontractors for performance of the canceled work;
    (2) Any cost already paid to the Contractor;
    (3) Anticipated profit or unearned fee on the canceled work; or
    (4) For service contracts, the remaining useful commercial life of 
facilities. ``Useful commercial life'' means the commercial utility of 
the facilities rather than their physical life with due consideration 
given to such factors as location of facilities, their specialized 
nature, and obsolescence.
    (h) This contract may include an Option clause with the period for 
exercising the option limited to the date in the contract for 
notification that funds are available for the next succeeding program 
year. If so, the Contractor agrees not to include in option quantities 
any costs of a startup or nonrecurring nature that have been fully set 
forth in the contract. The Contractor further agrees that the option 
quantities will reflect only those recurring costs and a reasonable 
profit or fee necessary to furnish the additional option quantities.
    (i) Quantities added to the original contract through the Option 
clause of this contract shall be included in the quantity canceled for 
the purpose of computing allowable cancellation charges.

    (a) Definitions.
    Small business concern, as used in this clause, means a concern, 
including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not 
dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government 
contracts, and qualified as a small business under the size standards in

    (b) General. (1) A portion of this requirement, identified elsewhere 
in this solicitation, has been set aside for award to one or more small 
business concerns.
    (2) Offers on the non-set-aside portion will be evaluated first and

    (4) The contractor(s) for the set-aside portion will be selected 
from among the small business concerns that submitted responsive offers 
on the non-set-aside portion. Negotiations will be conducted with the 
concern that submitted the lowest responsive offer on the non-set-aside 
portion. If the negotiations are not successful or if only part of the

Sec. 52.219-8  Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns.

    As prescribed in 19.708(a), insert the following clause:

Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business 
                           Concerns (Oct 1995)

    (a) It is the policy of the United States that small business 
concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals and small business concerns owned 
and controlled by women shall have the maximum practicable opportunity 
to participate in performing contracts let by any Federal agency, 
including contracts and subcontracts for subsystems, assemblies, 
components, and related services for major systems. It is further the 
policy of the United States that its prime contractors establish 
procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the 
terms of their subcontracts with small business concerns, small business 
concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals and small business concerns owned and controlled by women.
    (b) The Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the 
awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient 
contract performance. The Contractor further agrees to cooperate in any 
studies or surveys as may be conducted by the United States Small 
Business Administration or the awarding agency of the United States as 
may be necessary to determine the extent of the Contractor's compliance 
with this clause.
    (c) As used in this contract, the term small business concern shall 
mean a small business as defined pursuant to section 3 of the Small 
Business Act and relevant regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. The 
term small business concern owned and controlled by socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals shall mean a small business 
concern (1) which is at least 51 percent unconditionally owned by one or 
more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; or, in the 
case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 per centum of the stock 
of which is unconditionally owned by one or more socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals; and (2) whose management and 
daily business operations are controlled by one or more of such 
individuals. This term also means a small business concern that is at 
least 51 percent unconditionally owned by an economically disadvantaged 
Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian Organization, or a publicly owned 
business having at least 51 percent of its stock unconditionally owned 
by one of these entities which has its management and daily business 
controlled by members of an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe or 
Native Hawaiian Organization, and which meets the requirements of 13 CFR 
part 124. The Contractor shall presume that socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals include Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, 
Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, Subcontinent Asian Americans, 
and other minorities, or any other individual found to be disadvantaged 
by the Administration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business 
Act. The Contractor shall presume that socially and economically 
disadvantaged entities also include Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian 
Organizations.
    (d) The term ``small business concern owned and controlled by 
women'' shall mean a small business concern (i) which is at least

[[Page 114]]

51 percent owned by one or more women, or, in the case of any publicly 
owned business, at least 51 percent of the stock of which is owned by 
one or more women, and (ii) whose management and daily business 
operations are controlled by one or more women; and
    (e) Contractors acting in good faith may rely on written 
representations by their subcontractors regarding their status as a 
small business concern, a small business concern owned and controlled by 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or a small business 
concern owned and controlled by women.

Sec. 52.219-9  Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

    As prescribed in 19.708(b), insert the following clause:

Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting 
                             Plan (Aug 1996)

    (a) This clause does not apply to small business concerns.
    (b) Commercial product, as used in this clause, means a product in 
regular production that is sold in substantial quantities to the general 
public and/or industry at established catalog or market prices. It also 
means a product which, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, 
differs only insignificantly from the Contractor's commercial product.
    Subcontract, as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than 
one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a 
Federal Government prime Contractor or subcontractor calling for 
supplies or services required for performance of the contract or 
subcontract.
    (c) The offeror, upon request by the Contracting Officer, shall 
submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan, where applicable, which 
separately addresses subcontracting with small business concerns, with 
small disadvantaged business concerns and with women-owned small 
business concerns. If the offeror is submitting an individual contract 
plan, the plan must separately address subcontracting with small 
business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-
owned small business concerns with a separate part for the basic 
contract and separate parts for each option (if any). The plan shall be 
included in and made a part of the resultant contract. The 
subcontracting plan shall be negotiated within the time specified by the 
Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate the subcontracting 
plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.
    (d) The offeror's subcontracting plan shall include the following:
    (1) Goals, expressed in terms of percentages of total planned 
subcontracting dollars, for the use of small business concerns, small 
disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns 
as subcontractors. The offeror shall include all subcontracts that 
contribute to contract performance, and may include a proportionate 
share of products and services that are normally allocated as indirect 
costs.
    (2) A statement of--
    (i) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted;
    (ii) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small business 
concerns;
    (iii) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small 
disadvantaged business concerns; and
    (iv) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to women-owned small 
business concerns.
    (3) A description of the principal types of supplies and services to 
be subcontracted, and an identification of the types planned for 
subcontracting to (i) small business concerns, (ii) small disadvantaged 
business concerns and (iii) women-owned small business concerns.
    (4) A description of the method used to develop the subcontracting 
goals in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause.
    (5) A description of the method used to identify potential sources 
for solicitation purposes (e.g., existing company source lists, the 
Procurement Automated Source System (PASS) of the Small Business 
Administration, the National Minority Purchasing Council Vendor 
Information Service, the Research and Information Division of the 
Minority Business Development Agency in the Department of Commerce, or 
small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business concerns trade 
associations). A firm may rely on the information contained in PASS as 
an accurate representation of a concern's size and ownership 
characteristics for purposes of maintaining a small business source 
list. A firm may rely on PASS as its small business source list. Use of 
the PASS as its source list does not relieve a firm of its 
responsibilities (e.g., outreach, assistance, counseling, publicizing 
subcontracting opportunities) in this clause.
    (6) A statement as to whether or not the offeror included indirect 
costs in establishing subcontracting goals, and a description of the 
method used to determine the proportionate share of indirect costs to be 
incurred with (i) small business concerns, (ii) small disadvantaged 
business concerns, and (iii) women-owned small business concerns.

[[Page 115]]

    (7) The name of the individual employed by the offeror who will 
administer the offeror's subcontracting program, and a description of 
the duties of the individual.
    (8) A description of the efforts the offeror will make to assure 
that small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business concerns 
have an equitable opportunity to compete for subcontracts.
    (9) Assurances that the offeror will include the clause in this 
contract entitled ``Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-
Owned Small Business Concerns'' in all subcontracts that offer further 
subcontracting opportunities, and that the offeror will require all 
subcontractors (except small business concerns) who receive subcontracts 
in excess of $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction of any public 
facility) to adopt a plan similar to the plan agreed to by the offeror.
    (10) Assurances that the offeror will (i) cooperate in any studies 
or surveys as may be required, (ii) submit periodic reports in order to 
allow the Government to determine the extent of compliance by the 
offeror with the subcontracting plan, (iii) submit Standard Form (SF) 
294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts, and/or SF 295, 
Summary Subcontract Report, in accordance with the instructions on the 
forms, and (iv) ensure that its subcontractors agree to submit Standard 
Forms 294 and 295.
    (11) A recitation of the types of records the offeror will maintain 
to demonstrate procedures that have been adopted to comply with the 
requirements and goals in the plan, including establishing source lists; 
and a description of its efforts to locate small, small disadvantaged 
and women-owned small business concerns and award subcontracts to them. 
The records shall include at least the following (on a plant-wide or 
company-wide basis, unless otherwise indicated):
    (i) Source lists (e.g., PASS), guides, and other data that identify 
small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business concerns.
    (ii) Organizations contacted in an attempt to locate sources that 
are small, small disadvantaged or women-owned small business concerns.
    (iii) Records on each subcontract solicitation resulting in an award 
of more than $100,000, indicating (A) whether small business concerns 
were solicited and if not, why not, (B) whether small disadvantaged 
business concerns were solicited and if not, why not, (C) whether women-
owned small business concerns were solicited and if not, why not, and 
(D) if applicable, the reason award was not made to a small business 
concern.
    (iv) Records of any outreach efforts to contact (A) trade 
associations, (B) business development organizations, and (C) 
conferences and trade fairs to locate small, small disadvantaged and 
women-owned small business sources.
    (v) Records of internal guidance and encouragement provided to 
buyers through (A) workshops, seminars, training, etc., and (B) 
monitoring performance to evaluate compliance with the program's 
requirements.
    (vi) On a contract-by-contract basis, records to support award data 
submitted by the offeror to the Government, including the name, address, 
and business size of each subcontractor. Contractors having company or 
division-wide annual plans need not comply with this requirement.
    (e) In order to effectively implement this plan to the extent 
consistent with efficient contract performance, the Contractor shall 
perform the following functions:
    (1) Assist small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business 
concerns by arranging solicitations, time for the preparation of bids, 
quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules so as to facilitate 
the participation by such concerns. Where the contractor's lists of 
potential small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business 
subcontractors are excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to 
give all such small business concerns an opportunity to compete over a 
period of time.
    (2) Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities 
of small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business concerns in 
all ``make-or-buy'' decisions.
    (3) Counsel and discuss subcontracting opportunities with 
representatives of small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small 
business firms.
    (4) Provide notice to subcontractors concerning penalties and 
remedies for misrepresentations of business status as small, small 
disadvantaged or women-owned small business for the purpose of obtaining 
a subcontract that is to be included as part or all of a goal contained 
in the Contractor's subcontracting plan.
    (f) A master subcontracting plan on a plant or division-wide basis 
which contains all the elements required by paragraph (d) of this 
clause, except goals, may be incorporated by reference as a part of the 
subcontracting plan required of the offeror by this clause; provided, 
(1) the master plan has been approved, (2) the offeror ensures that the 
master plan is updated as necessary and provides copies of the approved 
master plan, including evidence of its approval, to the Contracting 
Officer, and (3) goals and any deviations from the master plan deemed 
necessary by the Contracting Officer to satisfy the requirements of this 
contract are set forth in the individual subcontracting plan.
    (g)(1) If a commercial product is offered, the subcontracting plan 
required by this clause may relate to the offeror's production

[[Page 116]]

generally, for both commercial and noncommercial products, rather than 
solely to the Government contract. In these cases, the offeror shall, 
with the concurrence of the Contracting Officer, submit one company-wide 
or division-wide annual plan.
    (2) The annual plan shall be reviewed for approval by the agency 
awarding the offeror its first prime contract requiring a subcontracting 
plan during the fiscal year, or by an agency satisfactory to the 
Contracting Officer.
    (3) The approved plan shall remain in effect during the offeror's 
fiscal year for all of the offeror's commercial products.
    (h) Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting 
plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting 
Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of 
the contract.
    (i) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good 
faith with (1) the clause of this contract entitled ``Utilization Of 
Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns,'' or 
(2) an approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach 
of the contract.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (OCT 1995). When contracting by sealed bidding rather 
than by negotiation, substitute the following paragraph (c) for 
paragraph (c) of the basic clause:

    (c) The apparent low bidder, upon request by the Contracting 
Officer, shall submit a subcontracting plan, where applicable, which 
separately addresses subcontracting with small business concerns, with 
small disadvantaged business concerns and with women-owned small 
business concerns. If the bidder is submitting an individual contract 
plan, the plan must separately address subcontracting with small 
business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned 
small business concerns, with a separate part for the basic contract and 
separate parts for each option (if any). The plan shall be included in 
and made a part of the resultant contract. The subcontracting plan shall 
be submitted within the time specified by the Contracting Officer. 
Failure to submit the subcontracting plan shall make the bidder 
ineligible for the award of a contract.

    Alternate II (MAR 1996). As prescribed in 19.708(b)(1), substitute 
the following paragraph (c) for paragraph (c) of the basic clause:

    (c) Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall 
include a subcontracting plan, which separately addresses subcontracting 
with small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and 
women-owned small business concerns. If the offeror is submitting an 
individual contract plan, the plan must separately address 
subcontracting with small business concerns, small disadvantaged 
business concerns and women-owned small business concerns with a 
separate part for the basic contract and separate parts for each option 
(if any). The plan shall be included in and made a part of the resultant 
contract. The subcontracting plan shall be negotiated within the time 
specified by the Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate a 
subcontracting plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a 
contract.

    As prescribed in 19.708(c)(1), insert the following clause:

               Incentive Subcontracting Program (Oct 1995)

    (a) Of the total dollars it plans to spend under subcontracts, the 
Contractor has committed itself in its subcontracting plan to try to 
award a certain percentage to small business concerns, a certain 
percentage to small disadvantaged business concerns and a certain 
percentage to women-owned small business concerns.
    (b) If the Contractor exceeds its subcontracting goals in performing 
this contract, it will receive -------- [insert the appropriate number 
between 0 and 10] percent of the dollars in excess of each goal in the 
plan, unless the Contracting Officer determines that the excess was not 
due to the Contractor's efforts (e.g., a subcontractor cost overrun 
caused the actual subcontract amount to exceed that estimated in the 
subcontracting plan, or the award of subcontracts that had been planned 
but had not been disclosed in the subcontracting plan during contract 
negotiations). Determinations made under this paragraph are not subject 
to the Disputes clause.
    (c) If this is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, the sum of the fixed 
fee and the incentive fee earned under this contract may not exceed the 
limitations in subpart 15.9 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Regulation (FAR) 22.300) shall require or permit any such laborers or

any liabilities of such Contractor or subcontractor for unpaid wages and 
liquidated damages as provided in the provisions set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this clause.
    (d) Payrolls and basic records. (1) The Contractor or subcontractor 
shall maintain payrolls and basic payroll records during the course of

contract. Such records shall contain the name and address of each such

    (a) All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of 
the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a 
week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except 
such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the 
Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR part 3)), the full 
amount of wages and bona fide fringe benefits (or cash equivalents 
thereof) due at time of payment computed at rates not less than those 
contained in the wage determination of the Secretary of Labor which is 
attached hereto and made a part hereof, regardless of any contractual 
relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and 
such laborers and mechanics. Contributions made or costs reasonably 
anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits under section 1(b)(2) of the 
Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages 
paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (d) of this clause; also, regular contributions made or costs 
incurred for more than a weekly period (but not less often than 
quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which cover the particular 
weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during 
such period. Such laborers and mechanics shall be paid not less than the 
appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits in the wage determination for 
the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill, 
except as provided in the clause entitled Apprentices and Trainees. 
Laborers or mechanics performing work in more than one classification 
may be compensated at the rate specified for each classification for the 
time actually worked therein; provided, that the employer's payroll 
records accurately set forth the time spent in each classification in 
which work is performed. The wage determination (including any 
additional classifications and wage rates conformed under paragraph (b) 
of this clause) and the Davis-Bacon poster (WH-1321) shall be posted at 
all times by the Contractor and its subcontractors at the site of the 
work in a prominent and accessible place where it can be easily seen by 
the workers.
    (b)(1) The Contracting Officer shall require that any class of 
laborers or mechanics, which is not listed in the wage determination and 
which is to be employed under the

[[Page 124]]

contract shall be classified in conformance with the wage determination. 
The Contracting Officer shall approve an additional classification and 
wage rate and fringe benefits therefor only when all the following 
criteria have been met:
    (i) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not 
performed by a classification in the wage determination.
    (ii) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction 
industry.
    (iii) The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe 
benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in 
the wage determination.
    (iv) With respect to helpers, such a classification prevails in the 
area in which the work is performed.
    (2) If the Contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed 
in the classification (if known), or their representatives, and the 
Contracting Officer agree on the classification and wage rate (including 
the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), a report 
of the action taken shall be sent by the Contracting Officer to the 
Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards 
Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210. The 
Administrator or an authorized representative will approve, modify, or 
disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of 
receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the 
Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is 
necessary.
    (3) In the event the Contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be 
employed in the classification, or their representatives, and the 
Contracting Officer do not agree on the proposed classification and wage 
rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where 
appropriate), the Contracting Officer shall refer the questions, 
including the views of all interested parties and the recommendation of 
the Contracting Officer, to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour 
Division for Determination. The Administrator, or an authorized 
representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and 
so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer 
within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.
    (4) The wage rate (including fringe benefits, where appropriate) 
determined pursuant to subparagraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause 
shall be paid to all workers performing work in the classification under 
this contract from the first day on which work is performed in the 
classification.
    (c) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a 
class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not 
expressed as an hourly rate, the Contractor shall either pay the benefit 
as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide 
fringe benefit or an hourly cash equivalent thereof.
    (d) If the Contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other 
third person, the Contractor may consider as part of the wages of any 
laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in 
providing bona fide fringe benefits under a plan or program; provided, 
that the Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the 
Contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have 
been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the Contractor to set aside 
in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the 
plan or program.

Sec. 52.222-7  Withholding of Funds.

    As prescribed in 22.407(a), insert the following clause:

                     Withholding of Funds (Feb 1988)

    The Contracting Officer shall, upon his or her own action or upon 
written request of an authorized representative of the Department of 
Labor, withhold or cause to be withheld from the Contractor under this 
contract or any other Federal contract with the same Prime Contractor, 
or any other federally assisted contract subject to Davis-Bacon 
prevailing wage requirements, which is held by the same Prime 
Contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be 
considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics, including 
apprentices, trainees, and helpers, employed by the Contractor or any 
subcontractor the full amount of wages required by the contract. In the 
event of failure to pay any laborer or mechanic, including any 
apprentice, trainee, or helper, employed or working on the site of the 
work, all or part of the wages required by the contract, the Contracting 
Officer may, after written notice to the Contractor, take such action as 
may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, 
advance, or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.

Sec. 52.222-8  Payrolls and Basic Records.

    As prescribed in 22.407(a), insert the following clause:

[[Page 125]]

                 Payment for Overtime Premiums (Feb 1988)

    (a) Payrolls and basic records relating thereto shall be maintained 
by the Contractor during the course of the work and preserved for a 
period of 3 years thereafter for all laborers and mechanics working at 
the site of the work. Such records shall contain the name, address, and 
social security number of each such worker, his or her correct 
classification, hourly rates of wages paid (including rates of 
contributions or costs anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits or cash 
equivalents thereof of the types described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the 
Davis-Bacon Act), daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions 
made, and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary of Labor has found, 
under paragraph (d) of the clause entitled Davis-Bacon Act, that the 
wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs 
reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program 
described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the Contractor 
shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such 
benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially 
responsible, and that the plan or program has been communicated in 
writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show 
the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such 
benefits. Contractors employing apprentices or trainees under approved 
programs shall maintain written evidence of the registration of 
apprenticeship programs and certification of trainee programs, the 
registration of the apprentices and trainees, and the ratios and wage 
rates prescribed in the applicable programs.
    (b)(1) The Contractor shall submit weekly for each week in which any 
contract work is performed a copy of all payrolls to the Contracting 
Officer. The payrolls submitted shall set out accurately and completely 
all of the information required to be maintained under paragraph (a) of 
this clause. This information may be submitted in any form desired. 
Optional Form WH-347 (Federal Stock Number 029-005-00014-1) is available 
for this purpose and may be purchased from the Superintendent of 
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. The 
Prime Contractor is responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls 
by all subcontractors.
    (2) Each payroll submitted shall be accompanied by a Statement of 
Compliance, signed by the Contractor or subcontractor or his or her 
agent who pays or supervises the payment of the persons employed under 
the contract and shall certify--
    (i) That the payroll for the payroll period contains the information 
required to be maintained under paragraph (a) of this clause and that 
such information is correct and complete;
    (ii) That each laborer or mechanic (including each helper, 
apprentice, and trainee) employed on the contract during the payroll 
period has been paid the full weekly wages earned, without rebate, 
either directly or indirectly, and that no deductions have been made 
either directly or indirectly from the full wages earned, other than 
permissible deductions as set forth in the Regulations, 29 CFR part 3; 
and
    (iii) That each laborer or mechanic has been paid not less than the 
applicable wage rates and fringe benefits or cash equivalents for the 
classification of work performed, as specified in the applicable wage 
determination incorporated into the contract.
    (3) The weekly submission of a properly executed certification set 
forth on the reverse side of Optional Form WH-347 shall satisfy the 
requirement for submission of the Statement of Compliance required by 
subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause.
    (4) The falsification of any of the certifications in this clause 
may subject the Contractor or subcontractor to civil or criminal 
prosecution under section 1001 of title 18 and section 3729 of title 31 
of the United States Code.
    (c) The Contractor or subcontractor shall make the records required 
under paragraph (a) of this clause available for inspection, copying, or 
transcription by the Contracting Officer or authorized representatives 
of the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor. The Contractor or 
subcontractor shall permit the Contracting Officer or representatives of 
the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor to interview 
employees during working hours on the job. If the Contractor or 
subcontractor fails to submit required records or to make them 
available, the Contracting Officer may, after written notice to the 
Contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension 
of any further payment. Furthermore, failure to submit the required 
records upon request or to make such records available may be grounds 
for debarment action pursuant to 29 CFR 5.12.

Sec. 52.222-9  Apprentices and Trainees.

    As prescribed in 22.407(a), insert the following clause:

                   Apprentices and Trainees (Feb 1988)

    (a) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than 
the predetermined rate for the work they performed when they are 
employed pursuant to and individually registered in a bona fide 
apprenticeship program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, 
Employment and

[[Page 126]]

Training Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with 
a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Bureau, or if a person 
is employed in his or her first 90 days of probationary employment as an 
apprentice in such an apprenticeship program, who is not individually 
registered in the program, but who has been certified by the Bureau of 
Apprenticeship and Training or a State Apprenticeship Agency (where 
appropriate) to be eligible for probationary employment as an 
apprentice. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen on the job 
site in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio 
permitted to the Contractor as to the entire work force under the 
registered program. Any worker listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage 
rate, who is not registered or otherwise employed as stated in this 
paragraph, shall be paid not less than the applicable wage determination 
for the classification of work actually performed. In addition, any 
apprentice performing work on the job site in excess of the ratio 
permitted under the registered program shall be paid not less than the 
applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the work actually 
performed. Where a Contractor is performing construction on a project in 
a locality other than that in which its program is registered, the 
ratios and wage rates (expressed in percentages of the journeyman's 
hourly rate) specified in the Contractor's or subcontractor's registered 
program shall be observed. Every apprentice must be paid at not less 
than the rate specified in the registered program for the apprentice's 
level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeyman hourly 
rate specified in the applicable wage determination. Apprentices shall 
be paid fringe benefits in accordance with the provisions of the 
apprenticeship program. If the apprenticeship program does not specify 
fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid the full amount of fringe 
benefits listed on the wage determination for the applicable 
classification. If the Administrator determines that a different 
practice prevails for the applicable apprentice classification, fringes 
shall be paid in accordance with that determination. In the event the 
Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or a State Apprenticeship Agency 
recognized by the Bureau, withdraws approval of an apprenticeship 
program, the Contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize 
apprentices at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work 
performed until an acceptable program is approved.
    (b) Trainees. Except as provided in 29 CFR 5.16, trainees will not 
be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work 
performed unless they are employed pursuant to and individually 
registered in a program which has received prior approval, evidenced by 
formal certification by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and 
Training Administration. The ratio of trainees to journeymen on the job 
site shall not be greater than permitted under the plan approved by the 
Employment and Training Administration. Every trainee must be paid at 
not less than the rate specified in the approved program for the 
trainee's level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeyman 
hourly rate specified in the applicable wage determination. Trainees 
shall be paid fringe benefits in accordance with the provisions of the 
trainee program. If the trainee program does not mention fringe 
benefits, trainees shall be paid the full amount of fringe benefits 
listed in the wage determination unless the Administrator of the Wage 
and Hour Division determines that there is an apprenticeship program 
associated with the corresponding journeyman wage rate in the wage 
determination which provides for less than full fringe benefits for 
apprentices. Any employee listed on the payroll at a trainee rate who is 
not registered and participating in a training plan approved by the 
Employment and Training Administration shall be paid not less than the 
applicable wage rate in the wage determination for the classification of 
work actually performed. In addition, any trainee performing work on the 
job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program 
shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate in the wage 
determination for the work actually performed. In the event the 
Employment and Training Administration withdraws approval of a training 
program, the Contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize trainees 
at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work performed 
until an acceptable program is approved.
    (c) Equal employment opportunity. The utilization of apprentices, 
trainees, and journeymen under this clause shall be in conformity with 
the equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, 
and 29 CFR part 30.

[[Page 130]]

 Notice of Requirement for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment 
                         Opportunity (Apr 1984)

    (a) The offeror's attention is called to the Equal Opportunity 
clause and the Affirmative Action Compliance Requirements for 
Construction clause of this solicitation.
    (b) The goals for minority and female participation, expressed in 
percentage terms for the Contractor's aggregate workforce in each trade 
on all construction work in the covered area, are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Goals for minority participation    Goals for female participation for
           for each trade                         each trade            
------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------                     ----------------                   
[Contracting Officer shall insert    [Contracting Officer shall insert  
 goals]                               goals]                            
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    These goals are applicable to all the Contractor's construction work 
performed in the covered area. If the Contractor performs construction 
work in a geographical area located outside of the covered area, the 
Contractor shall apply the goals established for the geographical area 
where the work is actually performed. Goals are published periodically 
in the Federal Register in notice form, and these notices may be 
obtained from any Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs office.
    (c) The Contractor's compliance with Executive Order 11246, as 
amended, and the regulations in 41 CFR 60-4 shall be based on (1) its 
implementation of the Equal Opportunity clause, (2) specific affirmative 
action obligations required by the clause entitled Affirmative Action 
Compliance Requirements for Construction, and (3) its efforts to meet 
the goals. The hours of minority and female employment and training must 
be substantially uniform throughout the length of the contract, and in 
each trade. The Contractor shall make a good faith effort to employ 
minorities and women evenly on each of its projects. The transfer of 
minority or female employees or trainees from Contractor to Contractor, 
or from project to project, for the sole purpose of meeting the 
Contractor's goals shall be a violation of the contract, Executive Order 
11246, as amended, and the regulations in 41 CFR 60-4. Compliance with 
the goals will be measured against the total work hours performed.
    (d) The Contractor shall provide written notification to the 
Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, within 10 
working days following award of any construction subcontract in excess 
of $10,000 at any tier for construction work under the contract 
resulting from this solicitation. The notification shall list the--
    (2) Name, address, and telephone number of the subcontractor;
    (i) Employer's identification number of the subcontractor;
    (3) Estimated dollar amount of the subcontract;
    (4) Estimated starting and completion dates of the subcontract; and
    (5) Geographical area in which the subcontract is to be performed.
    (e) As used in this Notice, and in any contract resulting from this 
solicitation, the covered area is -------- [Contracting Officer shall 
insert description of the geographical areas where the contract is to be 
performed, giving the State, county, and city].

establishment, affirmative action programs required by the rules and 
regulations of the Secretary of Labor (41 CFR 60-1 and 60-2), or (b) it

    (8) The Contractor shall permit access to its books, records, and 
accounts by the contracting agency or the Office of Federal Contract 
Compliance Programs (OFCCP) for the purposes of investigation to 
ascertain the Contractor's compliance with the applicable rules,

Sec. 52.222-27  Affirmative Action Compliance Requirements for Construction.

    As prescribed in 22.810(f), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts for construction that will include the 
clause at 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity, and the amount of the contract 
is expected to be in excess of $10,000:

  Affirmative Action Compliance Requirements for Construction (Apr 1984)

    (a) Definitions.
    Covered area, as used in this clause, means the geographical area 
described in the solicitation for this contract.
    Director, as used in this clause, means Director, Office of Federal 
Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), United States Department of Labor, 
or any person to whom the Director delegates authority.
    Employer identification number, as used in this clause, means the 
Federal Social Security number used on the employer's quarterly federal 
tax return, U.S. Treasury Department Form 941.
    Minority, as used in this clause, means--
    (1) American Indian or Alaskan Native (all persons having origins in 
any of the original peoples of North America and maintaining 
identifiable tribal affiliations through membership and participation or 
community identification).
    (2) Asian and Pacific Islander (all persons having origins in any of 
the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian 
Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands);
    (3) Black (all persons having origins in any of the black African 
racial groups not of Hispanic origin); and
    (4) Hispanic (all persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central 
or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of 
race).
    (b) If the Contractor, or a subcontractor at any tier, subcontracts 
a portion of the work involving any construction trade, each such 
subcontract in excess of $10,000 shall include this clause and the 
Notice containing the goals for minority and female participation stated 
in the solicitation for this contract.
    (c) If the Contractor is participating in a Hometown Plan (41 CFR 
60-4) approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in a covered area, either 
individually or through an association, its affirmative action 
obligations on all work in the plan area (including goals) shall comply 
with the plan for those trades that have unions participating in the 
plan. Contractors must be able to demonstrate participation in, and 
compliance with, the provisions of the plan. Each Contractor or 
subcontractor participating in an approved plan is also required to 
comply with its obligations under the Equal Opportunity clause, and to 
make a good faith effort to achieve each goal under the plan in each 
trade in which it has employees. The overall good-faith performance by 
other Contractors or subcontractors toward a goal in an approved plan 
does not excuse any Contractor's or subcontractor's failure to make 
good-faith efforts to achieve the plan's goals.
    (d) The Contractor shall implement the affirmative action procedures 
in subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause. The goals stated in 
the solicitation for this contract are expressed as percentages of the 
total hours of employment and training of minority and female 
utilization that the Contractor should reasonably be able to achieve in 
each construction trade in which it has employees in the covered area. 
If the Contractor performs construction work in a geographical area 
located outside of the covered area, it shall apply the goals 
established for the geographical area where that work is actually 
performed. The Contractor is expected to make substantially uniform 
progress toward its goals in each craft.
    (e) Neither the terms and conditions of any collective bargaining 
agreement, nor the failure by a union with which the Contractor has a 
collective bargaining agreement, to refer minorities or women shall 
excuse the Contractor's obligations under this clause, Executive Order 
11246, as amended, or the regulations thereunder.
    (f) In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and 
trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, apprentices and trainees 
must be employed by the Contractor during the training period, and the 
Contractor must have made a commitment to employ the apprentices and 
trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the 
availability of employment opportunities. Trainees must be trained 
pursuant to training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor.
    (g) The Contractor shall take affirmative action to ensure equal 
employment opportunity. The evaluation of the Contractor's compliance 
with this clause shall be based upon its effort to achieve maximum 
results from its actions. The Contractor shall document these efforts 
fully and implement affirmative action steps at least as extensive as 
the following:
    (1) Ensure a working environment free of harassment, intimidation, 
and coercion at all sites and in all facilities where the Contractor's 
employees are assigned to work. The Contractor, if possible, will assign 
two or more women to each construction project. The Contractor shall 
ensure that foremen,

[[Page 133]]

superintendents, and other onsite supervisory personnel are aware of and 
carry out the Contractor's obligation to maintain such a working 
environment, with specific attention to minority or female individuals 
working at these sites or facilities.
    (2) Establish and maintain a current list of sources for minority 
and female recruitment. Provide written notification to minority and 
female recruitment sources and community organizations when the 
Contractor or its unions have employment opportunities available, and 
maintain a record of the organizations' responses.
    (3) Establish and maintain a current file of the names, addresses, 
and telephone numbers of each minority and female off-the-street 
applicant, referrals of minorities or females from unions, recruitment 
sources, or community organizations, and the action taken with respect 
to each individual. If an individual was sent to the union hiring hall 
for referral and not referred back to the Contractor by the union or, if 
referred back, not employed by the Contractor, this shall be documented 
in the file, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may 
have taken.
    (4) Immediately notify the Director when the union or unions with 
which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement has not 
referred back to the Contractor a minority or woman sent by the 
Contractor, or when the Contractor has other information that the union 
referral process has impeded the Contractor's efforts to meet its 
obligations.
    (5) Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in 
training programs for the area that expressly include minorities and 
women, including upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee 
programs relevant to the Contractor's employment needs, especially those 
programs funded or approved by the Department of Labor. The Contractor 
shall provide notice of these programs to the sources compiled under 
subparagraph (g)(2) above.
    (6) Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy by--
    (i) Providing notice of the policy to unions and to training, 
recruitment, and outreach programs, and requesting their cooperation in 
assisting the Contractor in meeting its contract obligations;
    (ii) Including the policy in any policy manual and in collective 
bargaining agreements;
    (iii) Publicizing the policy in the company newspaper, annual 
report, etc.;
    (iv) Reviewing the policy with all management personnel and with all 
minority and female employees at least once a year; and
    (v) Posting the policy on bulletin boards accessible to employees at 
each location where construction work is performed.
    (7) Review, at least annually, the Contractor's equal employment 
policy and affirmative action obligations with all employees having 
responsibility for hiring, assignment, layoff, termination, or other 
employment decisions. Conduct review of this policy with all onsite 
supervisory personnel before initiating construction work at a job site. 
A written record shall be made and maintained identifying the time and 
place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter discussed, 
and disposition of the subject matter.
    (8) Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy externally 
by including it in any advertising in the news media, specifically 
including minority and female news media. Provide written notification 
to, and discuss this policy with, other Contractors and subcontractors 
with which the Contractor does or anticipates doing business.
    (9) Direct recruitment efforts, both oral and written, to minority, 
female, and community organizations, to schools with minority and female 
students, and to minority and female recruitment and training 
organizations serving the Contractor's recruitment area and employment 
needs. Not later than 1 month before the date for acceptance of 
applications for apprenticeship or training by any recruitment source, 
send written notification to organizations such as the above, describing 
the openings, screening procedures, and tests to be used in the 
selection process.
    (10) Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit 
minority persons and women. Where reasonable, provide after-school, 
summer, and vacation employment to minority and female youth both on the 
site and in other areas of the Contractor's workforce.
    (11) Validate all tests and other selection requirements where 
required under 41 CFR 60-3.
    (12) Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at 
least of all minority and female personnel for promotional 
opportunities. Encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for, 
through appropriate training, etc., opportunities for promotion.
    (13) Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work 
assignments, and other personnel practices, do not have a discriminatory 
effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment-related 
activities to ensure that the Contractor's obligations under this 
contract are being carried out.
    (14) Ensure that all facilities and company activities are 
nonsegregated except that separate or single-user toilet and necessary 
changing facilities shall be provided to assure privacy between the 
sexes.
    (15) Maintain a record of solicitations for subcontracts for 
minority and female construction contractors and suppliers, including 
circulation of solicitations to minority and female contractor 
associations and other business associations.

[[Page 134]]

    (16) Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors' 
adherence to and performance under the Contractor's equal employment 
policy and affirmative action obligations.
    (h) The Contractor is encouraged to participate in voluntary 
associations that may assist in fulfilling one or more of the 
affirmative action obligations contained in subparagraphs (g)(1) through 
(16). The efforts of a contractor association, joint contractor-union, 
contractor-community, or similar group of which the contractor is a 
member and participant may be asserted as fulfilling one or more of its 
obligations under subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16), provided the 
Contractor--
    (1) Actively participates in the group;
    (2) Makes every effort to ensure that the group has a positive 
impact on the employment of minorities and women in the industry;
    (3) Ensures that concrete benefits of the program are reflected in 
the Contractor's minority and female workforce participation;
    (4) Makes a good-faith effort to meet its individual goals and 
timetables; and
    (5) Can provide access to documentation that demonstrates the 
effectiveness of actions taken on behalf of the Contractor. The 
obligation to comply is the Contractor's, and failure of such a group to 
fulfill an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor's 
noncompliance.
    (i) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for 
women shall be established. The Contractor is required to provide equal 
employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority 
groups, both male and female, and all women, both minority and 
nonminority. Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation of 
Executive Order 11246, as amended, if a particular group is employed in 
a substantially disparate manner.
    (j) The Contractor shall not use goals or affirmative action 
standards to discriminate against any person because of race, color, 
religion, sex, or national origin.
    (k) The Contractor shall not enter into any subcontract with any 
person or firm debarred from Government contracts under Executive Order 
11246, as amended.
    (l) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for 
violation of this clause and of the Equal Opportunity clause, including 
suspension, termination, and cancellation of existing subcontracts, as 
may be imposed or ordered under Executive Order 11246, as amended, and 
its implementing regulations, by the OFCCP. Any failure to carry out 
these sanctions and penalties as ordered shall be a violation of this 
clause and Executive Order 11246, as amended.
    (m) The Contractor in fulfilling its obligations under this clause 
shall implement affirmative action procedures at least as extensive as 
those prescribed in paragraph (g) above, so as to achieve maximum 
results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity. If the 
Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of Executive Order 
11246, as amended, the implementing regulations, or this clause, the 
Director shall take action as prescribed in 41 CFR 60-4.8.
    (n) The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to--
    (1) Monitor all employment-related activity to ensure that the 
Contractor's equal employment policy is being carried out;
    (2) Submit reports as may be required by the Government; and
    (3) Keep records that shall at least include for each employee the 
name, address, telephone number, construction trade, union affiliation 
(if any), employee identification number, social security number, race, 
sex, status (e.g., mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or laborer), 
dates of changes in status, hours worked per week in the indicated 
trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed. 
Records shall be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable 
form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy this 
requirement, separate records are not required to be maintained.
    (o) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a limitation upon 
the application of other laws that establish different standards of 
compliance or upon the requirements for the hiring of local or other 
area residents (e.g., those under the Public Works Employment Act of 
1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program).

the Contractor shall not enter into a first-tier subcontract for an

writing from the Contracting Officer a clearance that the proposed 
subcontractor is in compliance with equal opportunity requirements and 
therefore is eligible for award.

Sec. 52.222-29  Notification of Visa Denial.

    As prescribed in 22.810(h), insert the following clause in contracts 
that will include the clause at 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity, if the 
Contractor is required to perform in or on behalf of a foreign country:

                  Notification of Visa Denial (Apr 1984)

    It is a violation of Executive Order 11246, as amended, for a 
Contractor to refuse to employ any applicant or not to assign any person 
hired in the United States, on the basis that the individual's race, 
color, religion, sex, or national origin is not compatible with the 
policies of the country where the work is to be performed or for whom 
the work will be performed (41 CFR 60-1.10). The Contractor agrees to 
notify the Department of State, Washington, DC. Attention: Director, 
Bureau of Politico- Military Affairs, and the Director, Office of 
Federal Contract Compliance Programs, when it has knowledge of any 
employee or potential employee being denied an entry visa to a country 
in which the Contractor is required to perform this contract, and it 
believes the denial is attributable to the race, color, religion, sex, 
or national origin of the employee or potential employee.

    As prescribed in 22.1308, insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when the contract is for $10,000 or more or

    (a) Definitions.
    Appropriate office of the State employment service system, as used 
in this clause, means the local office of the Federal-State national 
system of public employment offices assigned to serve the area where the 
employment opening is to be filled, including the District of Columbia, 
Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Trust 
Territory of the Pacific Islands.
    Openings that the Contractor proposes to fill from within its own 
organization, as used in this clause, means employment openings for 
which no one outside the Contractor's organization (including any 
affiliates, subsidiaries, and the parent companies) will be considered 
and includes any openings that the Contractor proposes to fill from 
regularly established recall lists.
    Openings that the Contractor proposes to fill under a customary and 
traditional employer-union hiring arrangement, as used in this clause, 
means employment openings that the Contractor proposes to fill from 
union halls, under their customary and traditional employer-union hiring 
relationship.
    Suitable employment openings, as used in this clause--
    (1) Includes, but is not limited to, openings that occur in jobs 
categorized as--
    (i) Production and nonproduction;
    (ii) Plant and office;
    (iii) Laborers and mechanics;
    (iv) Supervisory and nonsupervisory;
    (v) Technical; and
    (vi) Executive, administrative, and professional positions 
compensated on a salary basis of less than $25,000 a year; and
    (2) Includes full-time employment, temporary employment of over 3 
days, and part-time employment, but not openings that the Contractor 
proposes to fill from within its own organization or under a customary 
and traditional employer-union hiring arrangement, nor openings in an 
educational institution that are restricted to students of that 
institution.
    (b) General. (1) Regarding any position for which the employee or 
applicant for employment is qualified, the Contractor shall not 
discriminate against the individual because the individual is a special 
disabled or Vietnam Era veteran. The Contractor agrees to take 
affirmative action to employ, advance in employment, and otherwise treat 
qualified special disabled and Vietnam Era veterans without 
discrimination based upon their disability or veterans' status in all 
employment practices such as--
    (i) Employment;
    (ii) Upgrading;
    (iii) Demotion or transfer;
    (iv) Recruitment;
    (v) Advertising;
    (vi) Layoff or termination;
    (vii) Rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and

    (c) Listing openings. (1) The Contractor agrees to list all suitable 
employment openings existing at contract award or occurring during 
contract performance, at an appropriate office of the State employment 
service system in the locality where the opening occurs. These openings 
include those occurring at any Contractor facility, including one not 
connected with performing this contract. An independent corporate 
affiliate is exempt from this requirement.
    (2) State and local government agencies holding Federal contracts of 
$10,000 or more shall also list all their suitable openings with the 
appropriate office of the State employment service.
    (3) The listing of suitable employment openings with the State 
employment service system is required at least concurrently with using 
any other recruitment source or effort and involves the obligations of 
placing a bona fide job order, including accepting referrals of veterans 
and nonveterans. This listing does not require hiring any particular job 
applicant or hiring from any particular group of job applicants and is 
not intended to relieve the Contractor from any requirements of 
Executive orders or regulations concerning nondiscrimination in 
employment.
    (4) Whenever the Contractor becomes contractually bound to the 
listing terms of this clause, it shall advise the State employment 
service system, in each State where it has establishments, of the name 
and location of each hiring location in the State. As long as the 
Contractor is contractually bound to these terms and has so advised the 
State system, it need not advise the State system of subsequent 
contracts. The Contractor may advise the State system when it is no 
longer bound by this contract clause.
    (5) Under the most compelling circumstances, an employment opening 
may not be suitable for listing, including situations when (i) the 
Government's needs cannot reasonably be supplied, (ii) listing would be 
contrary to national security, or (iii) the requirement of listing would 
not be in the Government's interest.

employment openings which occur and are filled outside the 50 States, 
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands, American 
Samoa, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
    (2) The terms of paragraph (c) above of this clause do not apply to 
openings that the Contractor proposes to fill from within its own 
organization or under a customary and traditional employer-union hiring 
arrangement. This exclusion does not apply to a particular opening once 
an employer decides to consider applicants outside of its own 
organization or employer-union arrangement for that opening.
    (e) Postings. (1) The Contractor agrees to post employment notices 
stating (i) the Contractor's obligation under the law to take 
affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified special 
disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam era, and (ii) the rights 
of applicants and employees.
    (2) These notices shall be posted in conspicuous places that are 
available to employees and applicants for employment. They shall be in a 
form prescribed by the Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs, Department of Labor (Director), and provided by or through the 
Contracting Officer.
    (3) The Contractor shall notify each labor union or representative 
of workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other 
contract understanding, that the Contractor is bound by the terms of the 
Act, and is committed to take affirmative action to employ, and advance 
in employment, qualified special disabled and Vietnam Era veterans.
    (f) Noncompliance. If the Contractor does not comply with the 
requirements of this clause, appropriate actions may be taken under the 
rules, regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary issued pursuant 
to the Act.
    (g) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the terms of this 
clause in every subcontract or purchase order of $10,000 or more unless 
exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary. The 
Contractor shall act as specified by the Director to enforce the terms, 
including action for noncompliance.

    Alternate I (APR 1984). As prescribed in 22.1308(b), if the agency

accordance with 22.1303(a) or 22.1303(b), add the following as a 
preamble to the clause:

Contractor shall act as specified by the Director to enforce the terms, 
including action for noncompliance.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). As prescribed in 22.1408(b), when the agency

    (a) The contractor shall report at least annually, as required by 
the Secretary of Labor, on:
    (1) The number of special disabled veterans and the number of

52.222-38--52.222-40  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.222-41  Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended.

    As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause:

           Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended (May 1989)

    (a) Definitions. Act, as used in this clause, means the Service 
Contract Act of 1965, as amended (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.).
    Contractor, as used in this clause or in any subcontract, shall be 
deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term Government 
Prime Contractor.
    Service employee, as used in this clause, means any person engaged 
in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a 
bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these 
terms are defined in part 541 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, 
as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual 
relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or 
subcontractor and such persons.
    (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following 
provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and 
regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 4). This clause does 
not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the 
Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in 
subpart C of 29 CFR part 4.
    (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the 
performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor 
shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be 
furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe 
benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized 
representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this 
contract.
    (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the 
Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not 
listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the 
work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in 
the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship 
(i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted 
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage 
determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the 
monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined 
pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c).
    (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor 
prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of 
employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request 
for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the 
Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of 
employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall 
review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the 
completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the 
agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives 
or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), 
and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment 
Standards Administration U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour 
Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a 
final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of 
receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt 
that additional time is necessary.
    (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage 
and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who 
shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected 
employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of 
such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage 
determination.
    (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates 
that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage 
determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used 
may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the 
circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which 
rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes 
or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also 
be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay 
systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from 
other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the 
establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay 
relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on 
the skill required and the duties performed.

[[Page 139]]

    (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an 
option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where 
a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in 
question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to 
the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous 
conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average 
(mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the 
wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used 
on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and 
those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously 
applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished 
in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract 
work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the 
Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in 
subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed.
    (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in 
any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage 
specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 
as amended.
    (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this 
subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees 
performing in the classification from the first day on which contract 
work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the 
unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested 
parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division 
retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work 
shall be a violation of the Act and this contract.
    (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with subparagraph (c)(2) of 
this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination 
of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which 
shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees 
commenced contract work.
    (3) Adjustment of Compensation. If the term of this contract is more 
than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to 
be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract 
shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once 
every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour 
Division.
    (d) Obligation to Furnish Fringe Benefits. The Contractor or 
subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits 
specified in the attachment or determined under subparagraph (c)(2) of 
this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe 
benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in 
accordance with subpart D of 29 CFR part 4.
    (e) Minimum Wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for 
this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this 
contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract 
(regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the 
minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any 
subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment 
of a higher wage to any employee.
    (f) Successor Contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract 
subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were 
furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and 
fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in 
the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting 
forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, 
neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall 
pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless 
of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor 
contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such 
collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been 
entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued 
wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and 
fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or 
subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing 
obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the 
Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, 
after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe 
benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance 
with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the 
locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective 
bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the 
predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length 
negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures 
provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and parts 6 and 8 that some or all 
of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor 
Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at 
variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in 
the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable 
to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not 
entered into as

[[Page 140]]

a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new 
or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates 
and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the 
contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the 
Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Board of Service 
Contract Appeals, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such 
issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract 
(53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued 
solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such 
determination shall be effective as of the date of the final 
administrative decision.
    (g) Notification to Employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor 
under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work 
on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits 
required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage 
determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the 
Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent 
and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this 
requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this 
contract.
    (h) Safe and Sanitary Working Conditions. The Contractor or 
subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by 
this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under 
working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of 
the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or 
dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The 
Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health 
standards applied under 29 CFR part 1925.
    (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing 
work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the 
completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and 
transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour 
Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the 
following:
    (i) For each employee subject to the Act--
    (A) Name and address and social security number;
    (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of 
monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of 
payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly 
compensation;
    (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and
    (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or 
weekly compensation of each employee.
    (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage 
determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits 
determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or 
authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this 
clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this 
clause will fulfill this requirement.
    (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had 
been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this 
clause.
    (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract 
for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the 
Wage and Hour Division.
    (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records 
for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations 
and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, 
the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and 
notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of 
any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases.
    (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the 
Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the 
worksite during normal working hours.
    (j) Pay Periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each 
employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without 
subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or 
Regulations, 29 CFR part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These 
payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of 
the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay 
period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-
monthly.
    (k) Withholding of Payments and Termination of Contract. The 
Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the 
Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract 
with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the 
Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer 
decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the 
Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any 
employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits 
due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or 
by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the 
Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or 
advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any 
failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds 
for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such 
event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for 
completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any 
additional cost.

[[Page 141]]

    (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all 
subcontracts subject to the Act.
    (m) Collective Bargaining Agreements Applicable to Service 
Employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any 
service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any 
subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective 
bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in 
which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor 
shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full 
information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe 
benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees 
engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining 
agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the 
contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at 
such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or 
amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of 
contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after 
negotiation thereof.
    (n) Seniority List. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any 
contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees 
may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and 
subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit 
provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) 
or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall 
furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names, of all 
service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during 
the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain 
anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current 
or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The 
Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor 
Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract.
    (o) Rulings and Interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the 
Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR part 4.
    (p) Contractor's Certification. (1) By entering into this contract, 
the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he 
or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the 
Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded 
Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 
of the Act.
    (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or 
firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of 
the Act.
    (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the 
U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001.
    (q) Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions Involving Employment. 
Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of 
this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with 
the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the 
Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its 
amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the 
public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of 
Government business.
    (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning 
capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency or injury may 
be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by 
section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe 
benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) 
of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed 
for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped 
persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 
of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by 
the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).
    (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the 
employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or 
handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor 
Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay 
under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but 
without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or 
supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures 
prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor 
Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).
    (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such 
certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 
528.
    (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than 
the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed 
and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program 
registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the 
U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a 
State, under a program registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and 
Training, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of 
Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an 
approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits 
contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman 
classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid 
apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of 
progress set forth in the registered

[[Page 142]]

program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's 
rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio 
of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft 
classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the 
Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program.
    (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee 
customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may 
have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the 
minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, 
in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and 
Regulations 29 CFR part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not 
exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January l, 1981. To use this provision--
    (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit 
allowance before the credit is utilized;
    (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually 
or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer 
elects to take a credit for tips received);
    (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee 
receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage 
through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and
    (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any 
predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of 
section 4(c) of the Act.
    (t) Disputes Concerning Labor Standards. The U.S. Department of 
Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving 
disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be 
resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause 
of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include 
disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the 
contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or 
their representatives.

Sec. 52.222-43   Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Act--Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option Contracts).

    As prescribed in 22.1006(c)(1), insert the following clause:

  Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Act--Price Adjustment 
             (Multiple Year and Option Contracts) (May 1989)

    (a) This clause applies to both contracts subject to area prevailing 
wage determinations and contracts subject to collective bargaining 
agreements.
    (b) The Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract do not 
include any allowance for any contingency to cover increased costs for 
which adjustment is provided under this clause.
    (c) The wage determination, issued under the Service Contract Act of 
1965, as amended, (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.), by the Administrator, Wage 
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department 
of Labor, current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or 
the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this 
contract. If no such determination has been made applicable to this 
contract, then the Federal minimum wage as established by section 
6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 
206) current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or the 
beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract.
    (d) The contract price or contract unit price labor rates will be 
adjusted to reflect the Contractor's actual increase or decrease in 
applicable wages and fringe benefits to the extent that the increase is 
made to comply

[[Page 143]]

with or the decrease is voluntarily made by the Contractor as a result 
of:
    (1) The Department of Labor wage determination applicable on the 
anniversary date of the multiple year contract, or at the beginning of 
the renewal option period. For example, the prior year wage 
determination required a minimum wage rate of $4.00 per hour. The 
Contractor chose to pay $4.10. The new wage determination increases the 
minimum rate to $4.50 per hour. Even if the Contractor voluntarily 
increases the rate to $4.75 per hour, the allowable price adjustment is 
$.40 per hour;
    (2) An increased or decreased wage determination otherwise applied 
to the contract by operation of law; or
    (3) An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of l938 that is 
enacted after award of this contract, affects the minimum wage, and 
becomes applicable to this contract under law.
    (e) Any adjustment will be limited to increases or decreases in 
wages and fringe benefits as described in paragraph (c) of this clause, 
and the accompanying increases or decreases in social security and 
unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but shall not 
otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, 
overhead, or profit.
    (f) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any 
increase claimed under this clause within 30 days after receiving a new 
wage determination unless this notification period is extended in 
writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall promptly notify 
the Contracting Officer of any decrease under this clause, but nothing 
in the clause shall preclude the Government from asserting a claim 
within the period permitted by law. The notice shall contain a statement 
of the amount claimed and any relevant supporting data, including 
payroll records, that the Contracting Officer may reasonably require. 
Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price or contract unit price 
labor rates shall be modified in writing. The Contractor shall continue 
performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment 
and its effective date.
    (g) The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall 
have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, 
documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 
3 years after final payment under the contract.

Sec. 52.222-46  Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees.

    As prescribed in 22.1103, insert the following provision:

    Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees (Feb 1993)

    (a) Recompetition of service contracts may in some cases result in 
lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or 
furnished professional employees. This lowering can be detrimental in 
obtaining the quality of professional services needed for adequate 
contract performance. It is therefore in the Government's best interest 
that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR 541, be properly and 
fairly compensated. As a part of their proposals, offerors will submit a 
total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits 
proposed for the professional employees who will work under the 
contract. The Government will evaluate the plan to assure that it 
reflects a sound management approach and understanding of the contract 
requirements. This evaluation will include an assessment of the 
offeror's ability to provide uninterrupted high-quality work. The 
professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its 
impact upon recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency 
with a total plan for compensation. Supporting information will include 
data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and 
studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in 
establishing the total compensation structure.
    (b) The compensation levels proposed should reflect a clear 
understanding of work to be performed and should indicate the capability 
of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and keep suitably 
qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or 
ranges must take into account differences in skills, the complexity of 
various disciplines, and professional job difficulty. Additionally, 
proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of 
predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated on the basis 
of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and 
availability of required competent professional service employees. 
Offerors are cautioned that lowered compensation for essentially the 
same professional work may indicate lack of sound management judgment 
and lack of understanding of the requirement.
    (c) The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of 
the work force to be employed on this contract. Professional 
compensation that is unrealistically low or not in reasonable 
relationship to the various job categories, since it may impair the 
Contractor's ability to attract and retain competent professional 
service employees, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend 
the complexity of the contract requirements.
    (d) Failure to comply with these provisions may constitute 
sufficient cause to justify rejection of a proposal.

                           (End of provision)

incorporated herein, the bidders/offerors shall consider the economic 
terms of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the incumbent 
Contractor ____________ and the ____________ (union). If the economic 
terms of the collective bargaining agreement or the collective 
bargaining agreement itself is not attached to the solicitation, copies 
can be obtained from the Contracting Officer. Pursuant to Department of 
Labor Regulation, 29 CFR 4.1b and paragraph (g) of the clause at 52.222-
41, Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, the economic terms of that 
agreement will apply to the contract resulting from this solicitation, 
notwithstanding the absence of a wage determination reflecting such 
terms, unless it is determined that the agreement was not the result of 
arm's length negotiations or that after a hearing pursuant to section 
4(c) of the Act, the economic terms of the agreement are substantially 
at variance with the wages prevailing in the area.

    (a) The following certification shall be checked:

                              Certification

    The offeror certifies (  )/does not certify (  ) that:
    (1) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are 
commercial items which are used regularly for other than Government 
purposes, and are sold or traded by the Contractor in substantial 
quantities to the general public in the course of normal business 
operations;
    (2) The contract services are furnished at prices which are, or are 
based on, established catalog or market prices for the maintenance, 
calibration, and/or repair of certain information technology, scientific 
and medical and/or office and business equipment. An ``established 
catalog price'' is a price (including discount price) recorded in a 
catalog, price list, schedule, or other verifiable and established 
record that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the 
Contractor and is either published or otherwise available for inspection 
by customers. An ``established market price'' is a current price, 
established in the course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and 
sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated by data from sources 
independent of the manufacturer or Contractor; and
    (3) The Contractor utilizes the same compensation (wage and fringe 
benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the 
contract as the Contractor uses for equivalent employees servicing the 
same equipment of commercial customers.
    (b) If a negative certification is made and a Service Contract Act 
wage determination is not attached to the solicitation, the Contractor 
shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible.
    (c) Failure to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this 
clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph 
(b) of this clause may render the bid or offer nonresponsive.

place of performance was unknown when the solicitation was issued. In 
addition to places or areas identified in wage determinations, if any, 
attached to the solicitation, wage determinations have also been 
requested for the following: ____________ (insert places or areas). The

clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and 
resubmit the data.
    (f) Neither the requirements of this clause nor any act or failure 
to act by the Government shall relieve the Contractor of any 
responsibility or liability for the safety of Government, Contractor, or 
subcontractor personnel or property.
    (g) Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the Contractor 
from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, 
ordinances, and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and 
permits) in connection with hazardous material.
    (h) The Government's rights in data furnished under this contract 
with respect to hazardous material are as follows:
    (1) To use, duplicate and disclose any data to which this clause is 
applicable. The purposes of this right are to--
    (i) Apprise personnel of the hazards to which they may be exposed in 
using, handling, packaging, transporting, or disposing of hazardous 
materials;
    (ii) Obtain medical treatment for those affected by the material; 
and
    (iii) Have others use, duplicate, and disclose the data for the 
Government for these purposes.
    (2) To use, duplicate, and disclose data furnished under this 
clause, in accordance with subparagraph (h)(1) of this clause, in 
precedence over any other clause of this contract providing for rights 
in data.
    (3) The Government is not precluded from using similar or identical 
data acquired from other sources.

(MSDS's), meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) and the latest 
version of Federal Standard No. 313, for all hazardous materials 
identified in paragraph (b) of this clause.
    (1) For items shipped to consignees, the Contractor shall include a 
copy of the MSDS with the packing list or other suitable shipping 
document which accompanies each shipment. Alternatively, the Contractor 
is permitted to transmit MSDS's to consignees in advance of receipt of 
shipments by consignees, if authorized in writing by the Contracting 
Officer.
    (2) For items shipped to consignees identified by mailing address as 
agency depots, distribution centers or customer supply centers, the

Sec. 52.225-5  Buy American Act--Construction Materials.

    As prescribed in 25.205, insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts for construction inside the United States:

           Buy American Act--Construction Materials (May 1992)

    (a) The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10) provides that the Government 
give preference to domestic construction material.
    Components, as used in this clause, means those articles, materials, 
and supplies incorporated directly into construction materials.
    Construction material, as used in this clause, means an article, 
material, or supply brought to the construction site for incorporation 
into the building or work. Construction material also includes an item 
brought to the site pre-assembled from articles, materials or supplies. 
However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire 
alarm, and audio evacuation systems,

[[Page 157]]

which are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work 
and which are produced as a complete system, shall be evaluated as a 
single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the 
individual parts or components of such systems are delivered to the 
construction site.
    Domestic construction material, as used in this clause, means (1) an 
unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United 
States, or (2) a construction material manufactured in the United 
States, if the cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured 
in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its 
components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind as 
the construction materials determined to be unavailable pursuant to 
subparagraph 25.202(a)(3) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
shall be treated as domestic.
    (b) The Contractor agrees that only domestic construction material 
will be used by the Contractor, subcontractors, materialmen, and 
suppliers in the performance of this contract, except for foreign 
construction materials, if any, listed in this contract.
    (The foregoing requirements are administered in accordance with 
Executive Order No. 10582, dated December 17, 1954, as amended, and 
subpart 25.2 of the FAR).

Sec. 52.225-7  Balance of Payments Program.

    As prescribed in 25.305(c), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts for acquiring supplies or services for use 
outside the United States, unless one or more of the exceptions in 
25.302(b) applies or the acquisition is made under the Trade Agreeements 
Act of 1979 (see subpart 25.4):

                  Balance of Payments Program (Apr 1984)

    (a) This clause implements the Balance of Payments Program by 
providing a preference for domestic end products or services over 
foreign end products or services.
    Components, as used in this clause, means those articles, materials, 
and supplies directly incorporated into the end products.
    Domestic end product, as used in this clause, means--
    (1) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United 
States; or
    (2) An end product manufactured in the United States, if the cost of 
its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States 
exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of 
foreign origin of the same class or kind as those that the agency 
determines are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States 
in sufficient reasonably available commercial quantities of a 
satisfactory quality shall be treated as domestic. Components of unknown 
origin shall be considered foreign. Scrap generated, collected, and 
prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic.
    Domestic services, as used in this clause, means services performed 
in the United States. If services provided under a single contract are 
performed both in and outside the United States, they shall be 
considered domestic if 25 percent or less of their total cost is 
attributable to services (including incidental supplies used in 
connection with these services) performed outside the United States.

[[Page 158]]

    End product, as used in this clause, means an article, material, or 
supply acquired for public use under this contract.
    Foreign end product, as used in this clause, means a product other 
than a domestic end product.
    (b) The contractor agrees that there will be delivered under this 
contract only domestic end products or services unless, in its offer, it 
specified delivery of foreign end products or services in the provision 
entitled Balance of Payments Program Certificate. An offer based on 
supplying a foreign end product or service, if accepted, will permit the 
contractor to supply a product or service without regard to the 
requirements of this clause.
    (c) Offers will be evaluated in accordance with paragraph 25.303(b) 
of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

                           (List as necessary)

    (c) Offers will be evaluated by giving certain preferences to 
domestic end products, designated country end products, NAFTA country 
end products, and Caribbean Basin country end products over other end

excluded end product listed in paragraph (b) of this provision, offerors

designated or NAFTA country end products, or Caribbean Basin country end 
products. Products that are not identified and certified below will not

  Buy American Act--Trade Agreements--Balance of Payments Program (Jan 
                                  1996)

    (a) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10), the 
Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2501-2582), the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182, 107 
Stat. 2057) and the Balance of Payments Program by providing a 
preference for domestic end products over foreign end products, except 
for certain foreign end products which meet the requirements for 
classification as designated, NAFTA, or Caribbean Basin country end 
products.
    Caribbean Basin country end product, as used in this clause, means 
an article that: (1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a 
Caribbean Basin country (as defined in 25.401 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR)), or (2) in the case of an article which consists in 
whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality, 
has been substantially transformed into a new and different article of 
commerce with

[[Page 159]]

a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles 
from which it was so transformed. The term refers to a product offered 
for purchase under a supply contract, but for purposes of calculating 
the value of the end product includes services (except transportation 
services) incidental to its supply; provided, that the value of those 
incidental services does not exceed that of the product itself. The term 
excludes products that are excluded from duty-free treatment for 
Caribbean countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 
U.S.C. 2703(b)). These exclusions presently consist of (i) textiles and 
apparel articles that are subject to textile agreements; (ii) footwear, 
handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather wearing apparel 
not designated as eligible articles for the purpose of the Generalized 
System of Preferences under title V of the Trade Act of 1974; (iii) 
tuna, prepared or preserved in any manner in airtight containers; (iv) 
petroleum, or any product derived from petroleum; and (v) watches and 
watch parts (including cases, bracelets and straps), of whatever type 
including, but not limited to, mechanical, quartz digital or quartz 
analog, if such watches or watch parts contain any material that is the 
product of any country to which the Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(TSUS) column 2 rates of duty apply.
    Components, as used in this clause, means those articles, materials, 
and supplies incorporated directly into the end products.
    Designated country end product, as used in this clause, means an 
article that (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the 
designated country (as defined in 25.401 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR)), or (2) in the case of an article which consists in 
whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality, 
has been substantially transformed into a new and different article of 
commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the 
article or articles from which it was so transformed. The term refers to 
a product offered for purchase under a supply contract, but for purposes 
of calculating the value of the end product includes services (except 
transportation services) incidental to its supply; provided, that the 
value of those incidental services does not exceed that of the product 
itself.
    Domestic end product, as used in this clause, means (1) an 
unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States, or 
(2) an end product manufactured in the United States, if the cost of its 
components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 
50 percent of the cost of all its components. A component shall also be 
considered to have been mined, produced, or manufactured in the United 
States (regardless of its source in fact) if the end product in which it 
is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and the component 
is of a class or kind (i) determined by the Government to be not mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and 
reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality, or 
(ii) to which the agency head concerned has determined that it would be 
inconsistent with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the 
Buy American Act.
    Eligible product, as used in this clause, means a designated, North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or Caribbean Basin country end 
product.
    End products, as used in this clause, means those articles, 
materials, and supplies to be acquired under this contract for public 
use.
    Foreign end product, as used in this clause, means an end product 
other than a domestic end product.
    NAFTA country, as used in this clause, means Canada or Mexico.
    NAFTA country end product, as used in this clause, means an article 
that (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a NAFTA 
country, or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in 
part of materials from another country or instrumentality, has been 
substantially transformed in a NAFTA country into a new and different 
article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of 
the article or articles from which it was transformed. The term refers 
to a product offered for purchase under a supply contract, but for 
purposes of calculating the value of the end product includes services 
(except transportation services) incidental to its supply; provided, 
that the value of those incidental services does not exceed that of the 
product itself.
    (b) The Contracting Officer has determined that the Trade Agreements 
Act and NAFTA apply to this acquisition. Unless otherwise specified, the 
Acts apply to all items in the schedule. The Contractor agrees to 
deliver under this contract only domestic end products unless, in its 
offer, it specifies delivery of foreign end products in the provision 
entitled ``Buy American Act--Trade Agreements--Balance of Payments 
Program Certificate.'' An offer certifying that a designated, NAFTA, or 
Caribbean Basin country end product will be supplied requires the 
Contractor to supply a designated, NAFTA, or Caribbean Basin country end 
product or, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product. 
Contractors may not supply a foreign end product for the line items 
subject to the Trade Agreements Act unless--
    (1) The foreign end product is an eligible product (see FAR 25.401);
    (2) The Contracting Officer determines that offers of domestic end 
products or of eligible products are either not received or are 
insufficient to fulfill the Government's requirements; or

[[Page 160]]

    (3) A waiver is granted under section 302 of the Trade Agreements 
Act of 1979 (see FAR 25.402(c)).
    (c) Offers will be evaluated in accordance with the policies and 
procedures of subpart 25.4 of the FAR.

of any purchase of foreign supplies (including, without limitation, raw 
materials, components, and intermediate assemblies) in excess of $10,000 
that are to be imported into the customs territory of the United States 
for delivery to the Government or for incorporation into end items to be 
delivered under this contract. The notice shall be furnished to the 
Contracting Officer at least 20 days before the importation and shall 
identify (i) the foreign supplies, (ii) the estimated amount of duty, 
and (iii) the country of origin.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer determines that these supplies should 
be entered duty-free, the Contracting Officer shall notify the 
Contractor within 10 days.
    (3) Except as otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, the 
contract price shall be reduced by (or the allowable cost shall not 
include) the amount of duty that would be payable if the supplies were 
not entered duty-free.
    (c) Paragraph (b) above shall not apply to purchases of foreign 
supplies if (1) they are identical in nature with items purchased by the 
Contractor or any subcontractor in connection with its commercial 
business and (2) segregation of these supplies to ensure use only on 
Government contracts containing duty-free entry provisions is not 
economical or feasible.
    (d) The Contractor warrants that all supplies for which duty-free 
entry is to be claimed are intended to be delivered to the Government or 
incorporated into the end items to be delivered under this contract, and

scrap or salvage or as a result of a competitive sale authorized by the 
Contracting Officer.
    (e) The Government agrees to execute any required duty-free entry 
certificates for items specified in this contract or approved by the 
Contracting Officer and to assist the Contractor in obtaining duty-free 
entry of the supplies.
    (f) All shipping documents covering the supplies to be entered duty-
free shall consign the shipments to the contracting agency in care of 
the Contractor and shall include the delivery address of the Contractor 
(or contracting agency, if appropriate). The documents shall bear the

    (2) Identification of carrier.
    (3) The notation ``UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, ------ [agency] ------,

Customs, please release shipment under 19 CFR 142 and notify ------ 
[cognizant contract administration office] ------ for execution of 
Customs Forms 7501 and 7501-A and any required duty-free entry

District Director of Customs at the port of entry.
    (h) The Contractor agrees to notify in writing the cognizant 
contract administration office immediately upon notification from the 
Contracting Officer that duty-free entry will be accorded (or, if the 
duty-free supplies

[[Page 161]]

were listed in the contract Schedule, upon award by the Contractor to 
the overseas supplier). The notice shall identify (1) the foreign 
supplies, (2) the country of origin, (3) the contract number, and (4)

[[Page 164]]

    Components means those articles, materials, and supplies 
incorporated directly into the end products.
    Domestic end product means (1) an unmanufactured end product mined 
or produced in the United States, or (2) an end product manufactured in 
the United States, if the cost of its components mined, produced, or 
manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all 
its components. A component shall also be considered to have been mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source 
in fact) if the end product in which it is incorporated is manufactured 
in the United States and the component is of a class or kind (i) 
determined by the Government, to be not mined, produced, or manufactured 
in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial 
quantities of a satisfactory quality, or (ii) to which the agency head 
concerned has determined that it would be inconsistent with the public 
interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American Act.
    End products means those articles, materials, and supplies to be 
acquired under this contract for public use.
    Foreign end product means an end product other than a domestic end 
product.
    North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) country means Canada or 
Mexico.
    NAFTA country end product means an article that (1) is wholly the 
growth, product, or manufacture of a NAFTA country, or (2) in the case 
of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from 
another country or instrumentality, has been substantially transformed 
in a NAFTA country into a new and different article of commerce with a 
name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles 
from which it was transformed. The term refers to a product offered for 
purchase under a supply contract, but for purposes of calculating the 
value of the end product includes services (except transportation 
services) incidental to its supply; provided, that the value of those 
incidental services does not exceed that of the product itself.
    (b) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10), the 
North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103-182, 
107 Stat. 2057), and the Balance of Payments Program by providing a 
preference for domestic end products over foreign end products, except 
for certain foreign end products which meet the requirements for 
classification as NAFTA country end products.
    (c) The Contracting Officer has determined that the NAFTA applies to 
this acquisition. Unless otherwise specified, the Act applies to all 
items in the schedule. The Contractor agrees to deliver under this 
contract only domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specifies 
delivery of foreign end products in the provision entitled ``Buy 
American Act--North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act--
Balance of Payments Program Certificate.'' An offer specifying that a 
NAFTA country end product will be supplied requires the Contractor to 
supply a NAFTA country end product or, at the Contractor's option, a 
domestic end product.

and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use

its contract.
    (1) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor, acting in good 
faith, may rely on the self-certification of an Indian organization or 
Indian-owned economic enterprise as to its eligibility, unless an

must assert its request for an adjustment prior to completion of 
contract performance.

the contract and the availability of funds, shall authorize an incentive 
payment of 5 percent of the amount paid to the subcontractor.

Government shall determine whether, for reasons of national security, 
the application should be placed under an order of secrecy, sealed in 
accordance with the provision of 35 U.S.C. 181-188, or the issuance of a 
patent otherwise delayed under pertinent United States statutes or 
regulations. The Contractor shall observe any instructions of the 
Contracting Officer regarding the manner of delivery of the patent 
application to the United States Patent Office, but the Contractor shall 
not be denied the right to file the application. If the Contracting 
Officer shall not have given any such instructions within 30 days from 
the date of mailing or other transmittal of the proposed application, 
the Contractor may file the application.
    (b) Before filing a patent application in the United States 
disclosing any subject matter of this contract classified Confidential, 
the Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a copy of the

national security, the application should be placed under an order of 
secrecy or the issuance of a patent should be otherwise delayed under 
pertinent United States statutes or regulations.

reasons of security, the Contractor shall not file, or cause to be 
filed, in any country other than in the United States as provided in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause, an application or registration 
for a patent containing any of the subject matter of this contract 
without first obtaining written approval of the Contracting Officer.
    (d) When filing any patent application coming within the scope of 
this clause, the Contractor shall observe all applicable security 
regulations covering the transmission of classified subject matter and

transmitting the application to the United States Patent Office, the 
Contractor shall by separate letter identify by agency and number the 
contract or contracts that require security classification markings to 
be placed on the application.

Sec. 52.227-11  Patent Rights-Retention by the Contractor (Short Form).

    As prescribed in 27.303(a), insert the following clause:

    Patent Rights-Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (Jun 1989)

    (a) Definitions.
    (1) Invention  means any invention or discovery which is or may be 
patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the United States 
Code, or any novel variety of plant which is or may be protected under 
the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.).
    (2) Made when used in relation to any invention means the conception 
of first actual reduction to practice of such invention.
    (3) Nonprofit organization means a university or other institution 
of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and 
exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code 
(26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any nonprofit scientific or educational 
organization qualified under a state nonprofit organization statute.
    (4) Practical application means to manufacture, in the case of a 
composition of product; to practice, in the case of a process or method, 
or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, 
under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being 
utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or 
Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.
    (5) Small business firm means a small business concern as defined at 
section 2 of Pub. L. 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations 
of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. For the 
purpose of this clause, the size standards for small business concerns 
involved in Government procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 
and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used.
    (6) Subject invention means any invention of the contractor 
conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of 
work under this contract, provided that in the case of a variety of 
plant, the date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the 
Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during 
the period of contract performance.
    (b) Allocation of principal rights. The Contractor may retain the 
entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject 
invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. 
With respect to any subject invention in which the Contractor retains 
title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have 
practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention 
throughout the world.
    (c) Invention disclosure, election of title, and filing of patent 
application by contractor. (1) The Contractor will disclose each subject 
invention to the Federal agency within 2 months after the inventor 
discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent 
matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written 
report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was 
made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical 
detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time 
of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, 
chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The 
disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of 
the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been 
submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for 
publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to 
the agency, the contractor will promptly notify the agency of the 
acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or 
of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor.
    (2) The Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain 
title to any such invention by notifying the Federal agency within 2 
years of disclosure to the Federal agency. However, in any case where 
publication, on sale or public use has initiated the 1 year statutory 
period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the 
United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the 
agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the 
statutory period.
    (3) The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a 
subject invention to which it elects to retain title within 1 year after 
election of title, or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory 
period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United 
States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will 
file patent applications in additional countries or international patent 
offices within either 10 months of the corresponding initial patent 
application or 6 months from the date permission is granted by the 
Commissioner of

[[Page 171]]

Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such 
filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
    (4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure election, and 
filing under subparagraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at 
the discretion of the agency, be granted.
    (d) Conditions when the government may obtain title. The Contractor 
will convey to the Federal agency, upon written request, title to any 
subject invention--
    (1) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the 
subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this 
clause, or elects not to retain title; provided, that the agency may 
only request title within 60 days after learning of the failure of the 
Contractor to disclose or elect within the specified times.
    (2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent 
applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; 
provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application 
in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, 
but prior to its receipt of the written request of the Federal agency, 
the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country.
    (3) In any country in which the Contractor decided not to continue 
the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, 
or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a 
subject invention.
    (e) Minimum rights to Contractor and protection of the Contractor 
right to file. (1) The Contractor will retain a nonexclusive royalty-
free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the 
Government obtains title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the 
invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. 
The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiary and 
affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the 
Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the 
same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so 
at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only 
with the approval of the Federal Agency, except when transferred to the 
successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the 
invention pertains.
    (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by 
the funding Federal agency to the extent necessary to achieve 
expeditious practical application of subject invention pursuant to an 
application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 
applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing 
regulations (if any). This license will not be revoked in that field of 
use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved 
practical application and continues to make the benefits of the 
invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any 
foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of the 
funding Federal agency to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or 
the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical 
application in that foreign country.
    (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the funding 
Federal agency will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its 
intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be 
allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by the funding 
Federal agency for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice 
to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The 
Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable 
regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and agency regulations, if any, 
concerning the licensing revocation of modification of the license.
    (f) Contractor action to protect the government's interest. (1) The 
Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to 
the Federal agency all instruments necessary to (i) establish or confirm 
the rights the government has throughout the world in those subject 
inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title, and (ii) 
convey title to the Federal agency when requested under paragraph (d) of 
this clause and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection 
throughout the world in that subject invention.
    (2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its 
employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose 
promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the 
administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the 
Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the 
Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of 
this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent 
applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's 
rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, 
as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this 
clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee 
agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of 
reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent 
applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
    (3) The Contractor will notify the Federal agency of any decisions 
not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance 
fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, 
in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the 
response period required by the relevant patent office.

[[Page 172]]

    (4) The Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of 
any United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon 
covering a subject invention, the following statement, ``The invention 
was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded 
by (identify the Federal agency). The Government has certain rights in 
the invention.''
    (g) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor will include this clause, 
suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, 
regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work to 
be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit 
organization. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the 
Contractor in this clause, and the Contractor will not, as part of the 
consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the 
subcontractor's subject inventions.
    (2) The Contractor will include in all other subcontracts, 
regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work 
the patent rights clause required by subpart 27.3.
    (3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, the agency, 
subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of 
the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the 
subcontractor and the Federal agency with respect to the matters covered 
by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is 
intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in 
connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.
    (h) Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. The Contractor 
agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than 
annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at 
obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its 
licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding 
the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross 
royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and 
information as the agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also 
agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by the agency 
in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the agency in 
accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 
202(c)(5), the agency agrees it will not disclose such information to 
persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.
    (i) Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any 
assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any 
subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that 
any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use 
of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the 
United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an 
agreement may be waived by the Federal agency upon a showing by the 
Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have 
been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that 
would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or 
that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially 
feasible.
    (j) March-in rights. The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any 
subject invention in which it has acquired title, the Federal agency has 
the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any 
supplemental regulations of the agency to require the Contractor, an 
assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a 
nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of 
use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are 
reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor, assignee, or 
exclusive licensee refuses such a request the Federal agency has the 
right to grant such a license itself if the Federal agency determines 
that--
    (1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has 
not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject 
invention in such field of use;
    (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs 
which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their 
licensees;
    (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use 
specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not 
reasonably satisifed by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
    (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by 
paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived or because 
a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention 
in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
    (k) Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations. 
If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that--
    (1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be 
assigned without the approval of the Federal agency, except where such 
assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary 
functions the management of inventions, provided that such assignee will 
be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;
    (2) The Contractor will share royalties collected on a subject 
invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors 
(when the agency deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is 
assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
    (3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor 
with respect to

[[Page 173]]

subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to 
inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions will 
be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and
    (4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances 
to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business 
firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when 
licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the 
small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention 
which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to 
practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are 
not small business firms; provided, that the Contractor is also 
satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources 
to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a 
preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the 
contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of 
Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions 
regarding small business applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate 
changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the 
Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary's review discloses that the 
Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the 
requirements of this subparagraph (k)(4).

Sec. 52.227-12  Patent Rights--Retention by the Contractor (Long Form)

    As prescribed at 27.303(b), insert the following clause:

    Patent Rights--Retention by the Contractor (Long Form) (Jun 1989)

    (a) Definitions.
    Invention means any invention or discovery which is or may be 
patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the United States 
Code or any novel variety of plant

[[Page 174]]

that is or may be protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 
U.S.C. 2321 et seq.).
    Made when used in relation to any invention means the conception or 
first actual reduction to practice of such invention.
    Nonprofit organization means a domestic university or other 
institution of higher education or an organization of the type described 
in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 
501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal 
Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any nonprofit scientific or 
educational organization qualified under a state nonprofit organization 
statute.
    Practical application means to manufacture in the case of a 
composition or product, to practice in the case of a process or method, 
or to operate in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, 
under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being 
utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or 
Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.
    Small business firm means a small business concern as defined at 
section 2 of Pub. L. 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 532) and implementing regulations 
of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. For the 
purpose of this clause, the size standards for small business concerns 
involved in Government procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 
and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used.
    Subject invention means any invention of the Contractor conceived or 
first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under this 
contract; provided, that in the case of a variety of plant, the date of 
determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the Plant Variety 
Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the period of 
contract performance.
    (b) Allocation of principal rights. The Contractor may elect to 
retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to 
each subject invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 
U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the 
Contractor elects to retain title, the Federal Government shall have a 
nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice 
or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject 
invention throughout the world.
    (c) Invention disclosure, election of title, and filing of patent 
applications by Contractor. (1) The Contractor shall disclose each 
subject invention to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the 
inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for 
patent matters or within 6 months after the Contractor becomes aware 
that a subject invention has been made, whichever is earlier. The 
disclosure to the Contracting Officer shall be in the form of a written 
report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was 
made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical 
detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time 
of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, 
chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. 
The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale, or public 
use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention 
has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been 
accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after 
disclosure to the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall promptly 
notify the Contracting Officer of the acceptance of any manuscript 
describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use 
planned by the Contractor.
    (2) The Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain 
title to any such invention by notifying the Federal agency at the time 
of disclosure or within 8 months of disclosure, as to those countries 
(including the United States) in which the Contractor will retain title; 
provided, that in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has 
initiated the 1-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection 
can still be obtained in the United States, the period of election of 
title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 
days prior to the end of the statutory period.
    (3) The Contractor shall file its initial patent application on an 
elected invention within 1 year after election or, if earlier, prior to 
the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be 
obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public 
use. The Contractor shall file patent applications in additional 
countries (including the European Patent Office and under the Patent 
Cooperation Treaty) within either 10 months of the corresponding initial 
patent application or 6 months from the date permission is granted by 
the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent 
applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
    (4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure to the 
Contracting Officer, election, and filing may, at the discretion of the 
funding Federal agency, be granted, and will normally be granted unless 
the Contracting Officer has reason to believe that a particular 
extension would prejudice the Government's interest.
    (d) Conditions when the Government may obtain title. The Contractor 
shall convey to the Federal agency, upon written request, title to any 
subject invention--
    (1) If the Contractor elects not to retain title to a subject 
invention;
    (2) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect the subject 
invention within the times

[[Page 175]]

specified in paragraph (c) above (the agency may only request title 
within 60 days after learning of the Contractor's failure to report or 
elect within the specified times);
    (3) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent 
applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) above; 
provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application 
in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) above, but prior 
to its receipt of the written request of the Federal agency, the 
Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country; or
    (4) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue 
the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, 
or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a 
subject invention.
    (e) Minimum rights to Contractor. (1) The Contractor shall retain a 
nonexclusive, royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject 
invention to which the Government obtains title except if the Contractor 
fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in 
paragraph (c) above. The Contractor's license extends to its domestic 
subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of 
which the Contractor is a part and includes the right to grant 
sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally 
obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is 
transferable only with the approval of the funding Federal agency except 
when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's 
business to which the invention pertains.
    (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by 
the funding Federal agency to the extent necessary to achieve 
expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to 
an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 
applicable provisions in the Federal Property Management Regulations and 
agency licensing regulations (if any). This license shall not be revoked 
in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor 
has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of 
the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any 
foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of the 
funding Federal agency to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or 
its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical 
applciation in that foreign country.
    (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the funding 
Federal agency shall furnish the Contractor a written notice of its 
intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor shall be 
allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by the funding 
Federal agency for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice 
to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The 
Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable agency 
licensing regulations and 37 CFR 404 concerning the licensing of 
Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or 
modification of its license.
    (f) Contractor action to protect the Government's interest. (1) The 
Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to 
the Federal agency all instruments necessary to (i) establish or confirm 
the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject 
inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title, and (ii) 
convey title to the Federal agency when requested under paragraph (d) 
above and subparagraph (n)(2) below, and to enable the Government to 
obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.
    (2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its 
employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose 
promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the 
administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the 
Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the 
Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) 
above, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications 
on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the 
subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, 
the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) above. The Contractor 
shall instruct such employees through employee agreements or other 
suitable educational programs on the importance of reporting inventions 
in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to 
U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
    (3) The Contractor shall notify the Federal agency of any decision 
not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance 
fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, 
in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the 
response period required by the relevant patent office.
    (4) The Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of 
any United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon 
covering a subject invention, the following statement: ``This invention 
was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded 
by (identify the Federal agency). The Government has certain rights in 
this invention.''
    (5) The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective 
procedures to assure that subject inventions are promptly identified and 
disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters within 
6 months of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, 
whichever occurs first in

[[Page 176]]

performance of work under this contract. These procedures shall include 
the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other 
records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or 
the first actual reduction to practice of subject inventions, and 
records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing the 
inventions are followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the 
Contracting Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and 
for determination as to their effectiveness.
    (6) The Contractor agrees, when licensing a subject invention, to 
arrange to avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government 
funds, including funds derived through Military Assistance Program of 
the Government or otherwise derived through the Government, to refund 
any amounts received as royalty charges on the subject invention in 
acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government, and to provide for 
such refund in any instrument transferring rights in the invention to 
any party.
    (7) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the 
following:
    (i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be 
specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, 
listing subject inventions during that period and certifying that all 
subject inventions have been disclosed or that there are no such 
inventions.
    (ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the 
contracted work, listing all subject inventions or certifying that there 
were no such inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any tier 
containing a patent rights clause or certifying that there were no such 
subcontracts.
    (8) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in 
writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a 
patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable 
patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, 
and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such 
subcontract, and no more frequently than annually, a listing of the 
subcontracts that have been awarded.
    (9) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to 
accept one of the clauses in subparagraph (g)(1) or (2) below, the 
Contractor (i) shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting 
Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and 
other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter 
and (ii) shall not proceed with such subcontracting without the written 
authorization of the Contracting Officer.
    (10) The Contractor shall provide, upon request, the filing date, 
serial number and title, a copy of the patent application (including an 
English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and 
patent number and issue date for any subject invention for which the 
Contractor has retained title.
    (11) Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an 
irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application 
file.
    (g) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor shall include the clause at 
52.227-11 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), suitably modified 
to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for 
experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small 
business firm or nonprofit organization. The subcontractor shall retain 
all rights provided for the Contractor in this clause, and the 
Contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for awarding the 
subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
    (2) The Contractor shall include this clause (FAR 52.227-12) in all 
other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, 
or research work.
    (3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, when the prime award 
with the Federal agency was a contract (but not a grant or cooperative 
agreement), the agency, subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the 
mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a 
contract between the subcontractor and the Federal agency with respect 
to those matters covered by this clause.
    (h) Reporting utilization of subject inventions. The Contractor 
agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than 
annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at 
obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its 
licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding 
the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross 
royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and 
information as the agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also 
agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by the agency 
in connection with any march-in proceedings undertaken by the agency in 
accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. To the extent data or 
information supplied under this paragraph is considered by the 
Contractor, its licensee or assignee to be privileged and confidential 
and is so marked, the agency agrees that, to the extent permitted by 
law, it shall not disclose such information to persons outside the 
Government.
    (i) Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any 
assignee will grant to any person the

[[Page 177]]

exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United 
States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject 
invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. 
However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may 
be waived by the Federal agency upon a showing by the Contractor or its 
assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to 
grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be 
likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under 
the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
    (j) March-in rights. The Contractor agrees that with respect to any 
subject invention in which it has acquired title, the Federal agency has 
the right in accordance with the procedures in FAR 27.304-1(g) to 
require the Contractor, an assignee, or exclusive licensee of a subject 
invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive 
license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, 
upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the 
Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, the 
Federal agency has the right to grant such a license itself if the 
Federal agency determines that--
    (1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has 
not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject 
invention in such field of use;
    (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs 
which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their 
licensees;
    (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use 
specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not 
reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees,; or
    (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by 
paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived or because 
a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention 
in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
    (k) Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations. 
[Reserved]
    (l) Communications. (Complete according to agency instructions.)
    (m) Other inventions. Nothing contained in this clause shall be 
deemed to grant to the Government any rights with respect to any 
invention other than a subject invention.
    (n) Examination of records relating to inventions. (1) The 
Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 
years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine 
any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of 
the Contractor relating to the conception or first reduction to practice 
of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this 
contract to determine whether--
    (i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;
    (ii) The Contractor has established and maintains the procedures 
required by subparagraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this clause; and
    (iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the 
procedures.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer determines that an inventor has not 
disclosed a subject invention to the Contractor in accordance with the 
procedures required by subparagraph (f)(5) of this clause, the 
Contracting Officer may, within 60 days after the determination, request 
title in accordance with subparagraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this clause. 
However, if the Contractor establishes that the failure to disclose did 
not result from the Contractor's fault or negligence, the Contracting 
Officer shall not request title.
    (3) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor 
invention which the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject 
invention, the Contractor may be required to disclose the invention to 
the agency for a determination of ownership rights.
    (4) Any examination of records under this paragraph shall be subject 
to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the 
information involved.
    (o) Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to 
subcontracts). (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, 
the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold 
payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount 
of the contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the 
Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for 
identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to subparagraph 
(f)(5) above;
    (ii) Disclose any subject invention pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1) 
above;
    (iii) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to subdivision 
(f)(7)(i) above; or
    (iv) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to 
subparagraph (f)(8) of this clause.
    (2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting 
Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever 
deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other 
information required by this clause.
    (3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the 
Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of 
subject inventions required by subparagraph (c)(1) above, an acceptable 
final report pursuant to subdivision (f)(7)(ii) above, and all past due 
confirmatory instruments.

[[Page 178]]

    (4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums 
withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld 
under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is 
being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding 
of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed 
as a waiver of any Government right.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (JUN 1989). As prescribed in 27.303(b)(2), add the 
following sentence at the end of paragraph (b) of the basic clause:

    The license shall include the right of the Government to sublicense 
foreign governments, their nationals, and international organizations 
pursuant to the following treaties or international agreements: 
.........*
    [*Contracting Officer complete with the names of applicable existing 
treaties or international agreements. The above language is not intended 
to apply to treaties or agreements that are in effect on the date of the 
award but are not listed.]

    Alternate II (JUNE 1989). As prescribed in 27.303(b)(2), add the 
following sentence at the end of paragraph (b) of the basic clause:

    The agency reserves the right to unilaterally amend this contract to 
identify specific treaties or international agreements entered into or 
to be entered into by the Government after the effective date of this 
contract and effectuate those license or other rights which are 
necessary for the Government to meet its obligations to foreign 
governments, their nationals, and international organizations under such 
treaties or international agreement with respect to subject inventions 
made after the date of the amendment.

Sec. 52.227-13  Patent Rights--Acquisition by the Government.

    As prescribed at 27.303(c), insert the following clause:

         Patent Rights--Acquisition by the Government (Jun 1989)

    (a) Definitions.
    Invention, as used in this clause, means any invention or discovery 
which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of 
the United States Code or any novel variety of plant that is or may be 
protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et 
seq.).
    Subject invention, as used in this clause, means any invention of 
the Contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the 
performance of work under this contract; provided, that in the case of a 
variety of plant, the date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) 
of the Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur 
during the period of contract performance.

    Practical application, as used in this clause, means to manufacture, 
in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a 
process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; 
and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the 
invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent 
permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on 
reasonable terms.
    (b) Allocations of principal rights. (1) Assignment to the 
Government. The Contractor agrees to assign to the Government the entire 
right, title, and interest throughout the world in and to each subject 
invention, except to the extent that rights are retained by the 
Contractor under subparagraph (b)(2) and paragraph (d) below.
    (2) Greater rights determinations (i) The Contractor, or an 
employee-inventor after consultation with the Contractor, may retain 
greater rights than the nonexclusive license provided in paragraph (d) 
below, in accordance with the procedures of paragraph 27.304-1(a) of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). A request for a determination of 
whether the Contractor or the employee-inventor is entitled to retain 
such greater rights must be submitted to the Head of the Contracting 
Agency or designee at the time of the first disclosure of the invention 
pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2) below, or not later than 8 months 
thereafter, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the 
Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor. 
Each determination of greater rights under this contract normally shall 
be subject to paragraph (c) below, and to the reservations and 
conditions deemed to be appropriate by the Head of the Contracting 
Agency or designee.
    (ii) Upon request, the Contractor shall provide the filing date, 
serial number and title, a copy of the patent application (including an 
English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and 
patent number and issue date for any subject invention in any country 
for which the Contractor has retained title.
    (iii) Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an 
irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application 
file.

[[Page 179]]

    (c) Minimum rights acquired by the Government. (1) With respect to 
each subject invention to which the Contractor retains principal or 
exclusive rights, the Contractor agrees as follows:
    (i) The Contractor hereby grants to the Government a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have 
practiced each subject invention throughout the world by or on behalf of 
the Government of the United States (including any Government agency).
    (ii) The Contractor agrees that with respect to any subject 
invention in which it has acquired title, the Federal agency has the 
right in accordance with the procedures in FAR 27.304-1(g) to require 
the Contractor, an assignee, or exclusive licensee of a subject 
invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive 
license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, 
upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the 
Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, the 
Federal agency has the right to grant such a license itself if the 
Federal agency determines that--
    (A) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has 
not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject 
invention in such field of use;
    (B) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs 
which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their 
licensees;
    (C) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use 
specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not 
reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
    (D) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by 
paragraph (i) of this clause has neither been obtained nor waived or 
because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject 
invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
    (iii) The Contractor agrees to submit on request periodic reports no 
more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention 
or on efforts at obtaining such utilization of a subject invention or on 
efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the 
Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include 
information regarding the status of development, date of first 
commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and 
such other data and information as the agency may reasonably specify. 
The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be 
requested by the agency in connection with any march-in proceedings 
undertaken by the agency in accordance with subdivision (ii) above. To 
the extent data or information supplied under this section is considered 
by the Contractor, its licensee, or assignee to be privileged and 
confidential and is so marked, the agency agrees that, to the extent 
permitted by law, it will not disclose such information to persons 
outside the Government.
    (iv) The Contractor agrees, when licensing a subject invention, to 
arrange to avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government 
funds, including funds derived through a Military Assistance Program of 
the Government or otherwise derived through the Government, to refund 
any amounts received as royalty charges on a subject invention in 
acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government, and to provide for 
such refund in any instrument transferring rights in the invention to 
any party.
    (v) The Contractor agrees to provide for the Government's paid-up 
license pursuant to subdivision (i) above in any instrument transferring 
rights in a subject invention and to provide for the granting of 
licenses as required by subdivision (ii) above, and for the reporting of 
utilization information as required by subdivision (iii) above, whenever 
the instrument transfers principal or exclusive rights in a subject 
invention.
    (2) Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) shall be deemed to grant 
to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other than a 
subject invention.
    (d) Minimum rights to the Contractor. (1) The Contractor is hereby 
granted a revocable nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent 
application filed in any country on a subject invention and any 
resulting patent in which the Government obtains title, unless the 
Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention within the times 
specified in subparagraph (e)(2) below. The Contractor's license extends 
to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the 
corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part and includes the 
right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the 
Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was 
awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the 
funding Federal agency except when transferred to the successor of that 
part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
    (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by 
the funding Federal agency to the extent necessary to achieve 
expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to 
an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 
applicable provisions in 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing 
regulations. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or 
the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical 
application and continues to make the benefits of the invention 
reasonably accessible to

[[Page 180]]

the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or 
modified at the discretion of the funding Federal agency to the extent 
the Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or 
affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign 
country.
    (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the funding 
Federal agency will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its 
intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be 
allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by the funding 
Federal agency for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice 
to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The 
Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable agency 
licensing regulations and 37 CFR part 404 concerning the licensing of 
Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or 
modification of its license.
    (4) When the Government has the right to receive title, and does not 
elect to secure a patent in a foreign country, the Contractor may elect 
to retain such rights in any foreign country in which the Government 
elects not to secure a patent, subject to the Government's rights in 
subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause.
    (e) Invention identification, disclosures, and reports. (1) The 
Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures 
to assure that subject inventions are promptly identified and disclosed 
to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters within 6 months 
of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever 
occurs first in the performance of work under this contract. These 
procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or 
equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to 
document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of 
subject inventions, and records that show that the procedures for 
identifying and disclosing the inventions are followed. Upon request, 
the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of 
such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their 
effectiveness.
    (2) The Contractor shall disclose each subject invention to the 
Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in 
writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters or, if 
earlier, within 6 months after the Contractor becomes aware that a 
subject invention has been made, but in any event before any on sale, 
public use, or publication of such invention known to the Contractor. 
The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written report 
and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and 
the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail 
to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time of the 
disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, 
biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. The 
disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale, or public use 
of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has 
been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted 
for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure 
to the agency, the Contractor shall promptly notify the agency of the 
acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or 
of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor.
    (3) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the 
following:
    (i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be 
specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, 
listing subject inventions during that period, and certifying that all 
subject inventions have been disclosed (or that there are not such 
inventions) and that the procedures required by subparagraph (e)(1) 
above have been followed.
    (ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the 
contracted work, listing all subject inventions or certifying that there 
were no such inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any tier 
containing a patent rights clause or certifying that there were no such 
subcontracts.
    (4) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its 
employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose 
promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the 
administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the 
Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the 
Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) 
above, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications 
on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the 
subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, 
the information required by subparagraph (2) above.
    (5) The Contractor agrees subject to FAR 27.302(i) that the 
Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and 
all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished 
pursuant to this clause.
    (f) Examination of records relating to inventions. (1) The 
Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 
years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine 
any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of 
the Contractor relating to the

[[Page 181]]

conception or first actual reduction to practice of inventions in the 
same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine 
whether--
    (i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;
    (ii) The Contractor has established and maintains the procedures 
required by subparagraphs (e)(1) and (4) of this clause; and
    (iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the 
procedures.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor 
invention which the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject 
invention, the Contractor may be required to disclose the invention to 
the agency for a determination of ownership rights.
    (3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject 
to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the 
information involved.
    (g) Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to 
subcontracts). (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, 
the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold 
payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount 
of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in 
the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for 
identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to subparagraph 
(e)(1) above;
    (ii) Disclose any subject invention pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2) 
above;
    (iii) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to subdivision 
(e)(3)(i) above; or
    (iv) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to 
subparagraph (h)(4) below.
    (2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting 
Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever 
deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other 
information required by this clause.
    (3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the 
Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of 
subject inventions required by subparagraph (e)(2) above, and acceptable 
final report pursuant to subdivision (e)(3)(ii) above, and all past due 
confirmatory instruments.
    (4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums 
withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld 
under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is 
being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding 
of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed 
as a waiver of any Government rights.
    (h) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor shall include this clause 
(suitably modified to identify the parties) in all subcontracts, 
regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work. 
The subcontractor shall retain all rights provided for the Contractor in 
this clause, and the Contractor shall not, as part of the consideration 
for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's 
subject inventions.
    (2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to 
accept such a clause the Contractor--
    (i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting 
Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and 
other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; 
and
    (ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written 
authorization of the Contracting Officer.
    (3) In the case of subcontracts at any tier, the agency, 
subcontractor, and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the 
parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the 
subcontractor and the Federal agency with respect to those matters 
covered by this clause.
    (4) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in 
writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a 
patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable 
patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, 
and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such 
subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the 
subcontracts that have been awarded.
    (i) Preference for United States industry. Unless provided 
otherwise, no Contractor that receives title to any subject invention 
and no assignee of any such Contractor shall grant to any person the 
exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United 
States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject 
invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. 
However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the 
Government upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that reasonable 
but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar 
terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture 
substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances 
domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (JUN 1989). As prescribed in 27.303(c)(3), add the

information incidental to contract administration, such as financial, 
administrative, cost or pricing, or management information.
    Form, fit, and function data, as used in this clause, means data 
relating to items, components, or processes that are sufficient to 
enable physical and functional interchangeability, as well as data 
identifying source, size, configuration, mating, and attachment 
characteristics, functional characteristics, and performance 
requirements; except that for computer software it means data 
identifying source, functional characteristics, and performance 
requirements but specifically excludes the source code, algorithm, 
process, formulae, and flow charts of the software.
    Limited rights, as used in this clause, means the rights of the 
Government in limited rights data as set forth in the Limited Rights 
Notice of subparagraph (g)(2) if included in this clause.
    Limited rights data, as used in this clause, means data (other than 
computer software) that embody trade secrets or are commercial or 
financial and confidential or privileged, to the extent that such data 
pertain to items, components, or processes developed at private expense, 
including minor modifications thereof.
    Restricted computer software, as used in this clause, means computer 
software developed at private expense and that is a trade secret; is 
commercial or financial and is confidential or privileged; or is 
published copyrighted computer software; including minor modifications 
of such computer software.
    Restricted rights, as used in this clause, means the rights of the 
Government in restricted computer software, as set forth in a Restricted 
Rights Notice of subparagraph (g)(3) if included in this clause, or as 
otherwise may be provided in a collateral agreement incorporated in and 
made part of this contract, including minor modifications of such 
computer software.
    Technical data, as used in this clause, means data (other than 
computer software) which are of a scientific or technical nature.
    Unlimited rights, as used in this clause, means the right of the 
Government to use, disclose, reproduce, prepare derivative works,

publicly, in any manner and for any purpose, and to have or permit 
others to do so.
    (b) Allocations of rights. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) 
of this clause regarding copyright, the Government shall have unlimited 
rights in--
    (i) Data first produced in the performance of this contract;
    (ii) Form, fit, and function data delivered under this contract;
    (iii) Data delivered under this contract (except for restricted 
computer software) that constitute manuals or instructional and training 
material for installation, operation, or routine maintenance and repair 
of items, components, or processes delivered or furnished for use under 
this contract; and
    (iv) All other data delivered under this contract unless provided 
otherwise for limited rights data or restricted computer software in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this clause.
    (2) The Contractor shall have the right to--
    (i) Use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or publish any 
data first produced or specifically used by the Contractor in the 
performance of this contract, unless provided otherwise in paragraph (d) 
of this clause;

[[Page 183]]

    (iii) Substantiate use of, add or correct limited rights, restricted 
rights, or copyright notices and to take other appropriate action, in 
accordance with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause; and
    (iv) Establish claim to copyright subsisting in data first produced 
in the performance of this contract to the extent provided in 
subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause.
    (c) Copyright. (1) Data first produced in the performance of this 
contract. Unless provided otherwise in paragraph (d) of this clause, the 
Contractor may establish, without prior approval of the Contracting 
Officer, claim to copyright subsisting in scientific and technical 
articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance 
of this contract and published in academic, technical or professional 
journals, symposia proceedings or similar works. The prior, express 
written permission of the Contracting Officer is required to establish 
claim to copyright subsisting in all other data first produced in the 
performance of this contract. When claim to copyright is made, the 
Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notices of 17 U.S.C. 401 
or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract 
number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as 
well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a 
published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. For data other than 
computer software the Contractor grants to the Government, and others 
acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide 
license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, 
distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display 
publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. For computer software, the 
Contractor grants to the Government and others acting in its behalf, a 
paid-up nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted 
computer software to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform 
publicly and display publicly by or on behalf of the Government.
    (2) Data not first produced in the performance of this contract. The 
Contractor shall not, without prior written permission of the 
Contracting Officer, incorporate in data delivered under this contract 
any data not first produced in the performance of this contract and 
which contains the copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402, unless the 
Contractor identifies such data and grants to the Government, or 
acquires on its behalf, a license of the same scope as set forth in 
subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause; provided, however, that if such data 
are computer software the Government shall acquire a copyright license 
as set forth in subparagraph (g)(3) of this clause if included in this 
contract or as otherwise may be provided in a collateral agreement 
incorporated in or made part of this contract.
    (3) Removal of copyright notices. The Government agrees not to 
remove any copyright notices placed on data pursuant to this paragraph 
(c), and to include such notices on all reproductions of the data.
    (d) Release, publication and use of data. (1) The Contractor shall 
have the right to use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or 
publish any data first produced or specifically used by the Contractor 
in the performance of this contract, except to the extent such data may 
be subject to the Federal export control or national security laws or 
regulations, or unless otherwise provided in this paragraph of this 
clause or expressly set forth in this contract.
    (2) The Contractor agrees that to the extent it receives or is given 
access to data necessary for the performance of this contract which 
contain restrictive markings, the Contractor shall treat the data in 
accordance with such markings unless otherwise specifically authorized 
in writing by the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Unauthorized marking of data. (1) Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this contract concerning inspection or acceptance, if any 
data delivered under this contract are marked with the notices specified 
in subparagraph (g)(2) or (g)(3) of this clause and use of such is not 
authorized by this clause, or if such data bears any other restrictive 
or limiting markings not authorized by this contract, the Contracting 
Officer may at any time either return the data to the Contractor, or 
cancel or ignore the markings. However, the following procedures shall 
apply prior to canceling or ignoring the markings.
    (i) The Contracting Officer shall make written inquiry to the 
Contractor affording the Contractor 30 days from receipt of the inquiry 
to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the 
markings;
    (ii) If the Contractor fails to respond or fails to provide written 
justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the 
30-day period (or a longer time not exceeding 90 days approved in 
writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown), the Government 
shall have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time after 
said period and the data will no longer be made subject to any 
disclosure prohibitions.
    (iii) If the Contractor provides written justification to 
substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in 
subdivision (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer shall 
consider such written justification and determine whether or not the 
markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer 
determines that the markings are authorized, the Contractor shall be so 
notified in writing. If the Contracting Officer determines, with 
concurrence of the head of the contracting activity,

[[Page 184]]

that the markings are not authorized, the Contracting Officer shall 
furnish the Contractor a written determination, which determination 
shall become the final agency decision regarding the appropriateness of 
the markings unless the Contractor files suit in a court of competent 
jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's 
decision. The Government shall continue to abide by the markings under 
this subdivision (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either 
by the Contracting Officer's determination becoming final (in which 
instance the Government shall thereafter have the right to cancel or 
ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made 
subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the 
matter by court decision if suit is filed.
    (2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in subparagraph 
(e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with agency 
regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) 
if necessary to respond to a request thereunder.
    (3) This paragraph (e) does not apply if this contract is for a 
major system or for support of a major system by a civilian agency other 
than NASA and the U.S. Coast Guard agency subject to the provisions of 
Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 
1949.
    (4) Except to the extent the Government's action occurs as the 
result of final disposition of the matter by a court of competent 
jurisdiction, the Contractor is not precluded by this paragraph (e) from 
bringing a claim under the Contract Disputes Act, including pursuant to 
the Disputes clause of this contract, as applicable, that may arise as 
the result of the Government removing or ignoring authorized markings on 
data delivered under this contract.
    (f) Omitted or incorrect markings.
    (1) Data delivered to the Government without either the limited 
rights or restricted rights notice as authorized by paragraph (g) of 
this clause, or the copyright notice required by paragraph (c) of this 
clause, shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights, 
and the Government assumes no liability for the disclosure, use, or 
reproduction of such data. However, to the extent the data has not been 
disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Contractor may 
request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting 
Officer for good cause shown) after delivery of such data, permission to 
have notices placed on qualifying data at the Contractor's expense, and 
the Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Contractor--
    (i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be 
applied;
    (ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent;
    (iii) Establishes that the use of the proposed notice is authorized; 
and
    (iv) Acknowledges that the Government has no liability with respect 
to the disclosure, use, or reproduction of any such data made prior to 
the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice.
    (2) The Contracting Officer may also (i) permit correction at the 
Contractor's expense of incorrect notices if the Contractor identifies 
the data on which correction of the notice is to be made, and 
demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized, or (ii) correct any 
incorrect notices.
    (g) Protection of limited rights data and restricted computer 
software.
    (1) When data other than that listed in subdivisions (b)(1) (i), 
(ii), and (iii) of this clause are specified to be delivered under this 
contract and qualify as either limited rights data or restricted 
computer software, if the Contractor desires to continue protection of 
such data, the Contractor shall withhold such data and not furnish them 
to the Government under this contract. As a condition to this 
withholding, the Contractor shall identify the data being withheld and 
furnish form, fit, and function data in lieu thereof. Limited rights 
data that are formatted as a computer data base for delivery to the 
Government are to be treated as limited rights data and not restricted 
computer software.
    (2)--(3)  [Reserved]
    (h) Subcontracting. The Contractor has the responsibility to obtain 
from its subcontractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill 
the Contractor's obligations to the Government under this contract. If a 
subcontractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government such 
rights, the Contractor shall promptly bring such refusal to the 
attention of the Contracting Officer and not proceed with subcontract 
award without further authorization.
    (i) Relationship to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall 
imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as 
affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to 
the Government.

    Alternate I (JUN 1987). As prescribed in 27.409(b), substitute the 
following definition for Limited Rights Data in paragraph (a) of the 
clause:

    Limited rights data, as used in this clause, means data (other than 
computer software) developed at private expense that embody trade 
secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged.

    Alternate II (JUN 1987). As prescribed in 27.409(c), insert the 
following subparagraph (g)(2) in the clause:

    (g)(2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (g)(1) of this clause, the 
contract may identify and

[[Page 185]]

specify the delivery of limited rights data, or the Contracting Officer 
may require by written request the delivery of limited rights data that 
has been withheld or would otherwise be withholdable. If delivery of 
such data is so required, the Contractor may affix the following Limited 
Rights Notice to the data and the Government will thereafter treat the 
data, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this 
clause, in accordance with such Notice:

                    Limited Rights Notice (Jun 1987)

    (a) These data are submitted with limited rights under Government 
Contract No. ______ (and subcontract______, if appropriate). These data 
may be reproduced and used by the Government with the express limitation 
that they will not, without written permission of the Contractor, be 
used for purposes of manufacture nor disclosed outside the Government; 
except that the Government may disclose these data outside the 
Government for the following purposes, if any, provided that the 
Government makes such disclosure subject to prohibition against further 
use and disclosure: [Agencies may list additional purposes as set forth 
in 27.404(d)(1) or if none, so state]
    (b) This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of these data, 
in whole or in part.

                             (End of notice)

    Alternate III (JUN 1987). As prescribed in 27.409(d), insert the 
following subparagraph (g)(3) in the clause:

    (g)(3)(i) Notwithstanding subparagraph (g)(1) of this clause, the

withheld pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, for purposes of 
verifying the Contractor's assertion pertaining to the limited rights or 
restricted rights status of the data or for evaluating work performance. 
Where the Contractor whose data are to be inspected demonstrates to the 
Contracting Officer that there would be a possible conflict of interest 
if the inspection were made by a particular representative, the 
Contracting Officer shall designate an alternate inspector.

    As prescribed in 27.409(g), insert the following provision in 
solicitations that include the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Data--
General:

 Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software 
                               (Jun 1987)

    (a) This solicitation sets forth the work to be performed if a 
contract award results, and the Government's known delivery requirements 
for data (as defined in FAR 27.401). Any resulting contract may also 
provide the Government the option to order additional data under the 
Additional Data Requirements clause at 52.227-16 of the FAR, if included 
in the contract. Any data delivered under the resulting contract will be 
subject to the Rights in Data--General clause at 52.227-14 that is to be 
included in this contract. Under the latter clause, a Contractor may 
withhold from delivery data that qualify as limited rights data or 
restricted computer software, and deliver form, fit, and function data 
in lieu thereof. The latter clause also may be used with its Alternates 
II and/or III to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted 
computer software, marked with limited rights or restricted rights 
notices, as appropriate. In addition, use of Alternate V with this 
latter clause provides the Government the right to inspect such data at 
the Contractor's facility.
    (b) As an aid in determining the Government's need to include any of 
the aforementioned Alternates in the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in 
Data--General, the offeror's response to this solicitation shall, to the 
extent feasible, complete the representation in paragraph (b) of this 
provision to either state that none of the data qualify as limited 
rights data or restricted computer software, or identify which of the 
data qualifies as limited rights data or restricted computer software. 
Any identification of limited rights data or restricted computer 
software in the offeror's response is not determinative of the status of 
such data should a contract be awarded to the offeror.

                  Representation Concerning Data Rights

    Offeror has reviewed the requirements for the delivery of data or 
software and states (offeror check appropriate block)--
    {time}   None of the data proposed for fulfilling such requirements 
qualifies as limited rights data or restricted computer software.
    {time}  Data proposed for fulfilling such requirements qualify as 
limited rights data or restricted computer software and are identified 
as follows:
_______________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________

    Note: Limited rights data and Restricted computer software are 
defined in the contract clause entitled Rights In Data--General.

under this contract, order any data first produced or specifically used 
in the performance of this contract.
    (b) The Rights in Data--General clause or other equivalent included 
in this contract is applicable to all data ordered under this Additional

this contract, or data which are specifically identified in this 
contract as not subject to this clause.
    (c) When data are to be delivered under this clause, the Contractor 
will be compensated for converting the data into the prescribed form,

    (a) Scope of clause. This clause shall apply to all technical data 
(as defined in the Rights in Data--General clause included in this 
contract) that have been specified in this contract as being subject to 
this clause. It shall apply to all such data delivered, or required to 
be delivered, at any time during contract performance or within 3 years

items at any time during the period covered by this clause.
    (b) Technical data certification. (1) All technical data that are

its knowledge and belief the technical data delivered herewith under 
Government contract No.______ (and subcontract ______, if appropriate) 
are complete, accurate, and comply with the requirements of the contract 
concerning such technical data.

                         (End of certification)

    (2) The Government shall rely on the certification set out in 
subparagraph (b)(1) of this clause in accepting delivery of the 
technical data, and in consideration thereof may, at any time during the 
period covered by this clause, request correction of any deficiencies 
which are not in compliance with contract requirements. Such corrections 
shall be made at the expense of the Contractor. Unauthorized markings on 
data shall not be considered a deficiency for the purpose of this 
clause, but will be treated in accordance with paragraph (e) of the 
Rights in Data--General clause included in this contract.
    (c) Technical data revision. The Contractor also agrees, at the 
request of the Contracting Officer, to revise technical data that are 
subject to this clause to reflect engineering design changes made during 
the performance of this contract and affecting the form, fit, and 
function of any item (other than technical data) delivered under this 
contract. The Contractor may submit a request for an equitable 
adjustment to the terms and conditions of this contract for any 
revisions to technical data made pursuant to this paragraph.
    (d) Withholding of payment. (1) At any time before final payment 
under this contract the

[[Page 192]]

Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment 
until a reserve not exceeding $100,000 or 5 percent of the amount of 
this contract, whichever is less, if in the Contracting Officer's 
opinion respecting any technical data that are subject to this clause, 
the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Make timely delivery of such technical data as required by this 
contract;
    (ii) Provide the certification required by subparagraph (b)(1) of 
this clause;
    (iii) Make the corrections required by subparagraph (b)(2) of this

    (iv) Make revisions requested under paragraph (c) of this clause.
    (2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting 
Officer has determined that the Contractor has delivered the data and/or 
has made the required corrections or revisions. Withholding shall not be 
made if the failure to make timely delivery, and/or the deficiencies 
relating to delivered data, arose out of causes beyond the control of 
the Contractor and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.
    (3) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums 
withheld up to the sums authorized in subparagraph (d)(1) of this 
clause. The withholding of any amount under this paragraph, or the 
subsequent payment thereof, shall not be construed as a waiver of any 
Government rights.

under this contract, such workers' compensation insurance or security as 
the Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.) requires and (b) continue 
to maintain it until performance is completed. The Contractor shall 
insert, in all subcontracts under this contract to which the Defense

contract performed outside the United States and the Secretary of Labor 
waives the applicability of the Defense Base Act (see 28.305(d)):

    Workers' Compensation and War-Hazard Insurance Overseas (Apr 1984)

    (a) This paragraph applies if the Contractor employs any person who, 
but for a waiver granted by the Secretary of Labor, would be subject to 
workers' compensation insurance under the Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. 
1651 et seq.). On behalf of employees for whom the applicability of the 
Defense Base Act has been waived, the Contractor shall (1) provide, 
before commencing performance under this contract, at least that 
workers' compensation insurance or the equivalent as the laws of the 
country of which these employees are nationals may require and (2) 
continue to maintain it until performance is completed. The Contractor 
shall insert, in all subcontracts under this contract to which the 
Defense Base Act would apply but for the waiver, a clause similar to 
this paragraph (a) (including this sentence) imposing upon those 
subcontractors this requirement to provide such workers' compensation 
insurance coverage.
    (b) This paragraph applies if the Contractor or any subcontractor 
under this contract employs any person who, but for a waiver granted by 
the Secretary of Labor, would be subject to the War Hazards Compensation 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). On behalf of employees for whom the 
applicability of the Defense Base Act (and hence that of the War Hazards 
Compensation Act) has been waived, the Contractor shall, subject to 
reimbursement as provided elsewhere in this contract, afford the same 
protection as that provided in the War Hazards Compensation Act, except 
that the level of benefits shall conform to any law or international 
agreement controlling the benefits to which the employees may be 
entitled. In all other respects, the standards of the War Hazards 
Compensation Act shall apply; e.g., the definition of war-hazard risks 
(injury, death, capture, or detention as the result of a war hazard as 
defined in the Act), proof of loss, and exclusion of benefits otherwise 
covered by workers' compensation insurance or the equivalent. Unless the 
Contractor elects to assume directly the liability to subcontractor 
employees created by this clause, the Contractor shall insert, in all 
subcontracts under this

[[Page 194]]

contract to which the War Hazards Compensation Act would apply but for 
the waiver, a clause similar to this paragraph (b) (including this 
sentence) imposing upon those subcontractors this requirement to provide 
war-hazard benefits.

clause; and
    (2) For certain liabilities (and expenses incidental to such 
liabilities) to third persons not compensated by insurance or otherwise 
without regard to and as an exception to the limitation of cost or the 
limitation of funds clause of this contract. These liabilities must 
arise out of the performance of this contract, whether or not caused by 
the negligence of the Contractor or of the Contractor's agents, 
servants, or employees, and must be represented by final judgments or 
settlements approved in writing by the Government. These liabilities are 
for--

    (ii) Death or bodily injury.

sufficient to meet deficiencies.

expenses incidental to such liabilities)--
    (1) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the

one plant or separate location in which this contract is being 
performed; or
    (iii) A separate and complete major industrial operation in 
connection with the performance of this contract.

restrict the right of the Contractor to be reimbursed for the cost of 
insurance maintained by the Contractor in connection with the 
performance of this contract, other than insurance required in 
accordance with this clause; provided, that such cost is allowable under 
the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract.
    (g) If any suit or action is filed or any claim is made against the 
Contractor, the cost and expense of which may be reimbursable to the 
Contractor under this contract, and the risk of which is then uninsured 
or is insured for less than the amount claimed, the Contractor shall--
    (1) Immediately notify the Contracting Officer and promptly furnish 
copies of all pertinent papers received;
    (2) Authorize Government representatives to collaborate with counsel 
for the insurance carrier in settling or defending the claim when the

litigation, if required by the Government, when the liability is not 
insured or covered by bond. The Contractor may, at its own expense, be 
associated with the Government representatives in any such claim or 
litigation.

Certificates to each vendor in New Mexico selling tangible personal 
property to the Contractor for use in the performance of this contract. 
Failure to provide a Type 15 Nontaxable Transaction Certificate to

Nontaxable Transaction Certificate if such property is not used for 
Federal purposes.

governed by the principles of this clause. Accordingly, compensating tax 
shall be due from the Contractor only if such property is not used for 
Federal purposes.

Department and, at the discretion of the (*------), may participate in 
any matters or proceedings pertaining to this clause or the above-

its own representative nor does it obligate the (*------) to represent 
its Contractor.
    (h) The Contractor agrees to insert the substance of this clause, 
including this paragraph (h), in each subcontract which meets the 
criteria in 29.401-6(b) (1) through (3) of the Federal Acquisition

should the Agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of this clause be 
terminated; provided, however, that such termination shall not nullify 
obligations already incurred prior to the date of termination.

Sec. 52.230-2  Cost Accounting Standards.

    As prescribed in 30.201-4(a), insert the following clause:

                  Cost Accounting Standards (Apr 1996)

    (a) Unless the contract is exempt under 48 CFR 9903.201-1 and 
9903.201-2, the provisions of 48 CFR part 9903 are incorporated herein 
by reference and the Contractor, in connection with this contract, 
shall--
    (1) (CAS-covered Contracts Only) By submission of a Disclosure 
Statement, disclose in writing the Contractor's cost accounting 
practices as required by 48 CFR 9903.202-1 through 9903.202-5, including 
methods of distinguishing direct costs from indirect costs and the basis 
used for allocating indirect costs. The practices disclosed for this 
contract shall be the same as the practices currently disclosed and 
applied on all other contracts and subcontracts being performed by the 
Contractor and which contain a Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) clause. 
If the Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that the 
Disclosure Statement contains trade secrets and commercial or financial 
information which is privileged and confidential, the Disclosure 
Statement shall be protected and shall not be released outside of the 
Government.
    (2) Follow consistently the Contractor's cost accounting practices 
in accumulating and reporting contract performance cost data concerning 
this contract. If any change in cost accounting practices is made for 
the purposes of any contract or subcontract subject to CAS requirements, 
the change must be applied prospectively to this contract and the 
Disclosure Statement must be amended accordingly. If the contract price 
or cost allowance of this contract is affected by such changes, 
adjustment shall be made in accordance with subparagraph (a)(4) or 
(a)(5) of this clause, as appropriate.
    (3) Comply with all CAS, including any modifications and 
interpretations indicated thereto contained in 48 CFR part 9904 in 
effect on the date of award of this contract or, if the Contractor has 
submitted cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price 
as shown on the Contractor's signed certificate of current cost or 
pricing data. The Contractor shall also comply with any CAS (or 
modifications to CAS) which hereafter become applicable to a contract or 
subcontract of the Contractor. Such compliance shall be required 
prospectively from the date of applicability to such contract or 
subcontract.
    (4)(i) Agree to an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes 
clause of this contract if the contract cost is affected by a change 
which, pursuant to subparagraph (a)(3) of this clause, the Contractor is 
required to make to the Contractor's established cost accounting 
practices.
    (ii) Negotiate with the Contracting Officer to determine the terms 
and conditions under which a change may be made to a cost accounting 
practice, other than a change made

[[Page 208]]

under other provisions of subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause; provided 
that no agreement may be made under this provision that will increase 
costs paid by the United States.
    (iii) When the parties agree to a change to a cost accounting 
practice, other than a change under subdivision (a)(4)(i) of this 
clause, negotiate an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes 
clause of this contract.
    (5) Agree to an adjustment of the contract price or cost allowance, 
as appropriate, if the Contractor or a subcontractor fails to comply 
with an applicable Cost Accounting Standard, or to follow any cost 
accounting practice consistently and such failure results in any 
increased costs paid by the United States. Such adjustment shall provide 
for recovery of the increased costs to the United States, together with 
interest thereon computed at the annual rate established under section 
6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621) for such 
period, from the time the payment by the United States was made to the 
time the adjustment is effected. In no case shall the Government recover 
costs greater than the increased cost to the Government, in the 
aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment, 
unless the Contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of 
which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of price 
negotiations and which it failed to disclose to the Government.
    (b) If the parties fail to agree whether the Contractor or a 
subcontractor has complied with an applicable CAS in 48 CFR part 9904 or 
a CAS rule or regulation in 48 CFR part 9903 and as to any cost 
adjustment demanded by the United States, such failure to agree will 
constitute a dispute under the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601).
    (c) The Contractor shall permit any authorized representatives of 
the Government to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or 
records relating to compliance with the requirements of this clause.
    (d) The Contractor shall include in all negotiated subcontracts 
which the Contractor enters into, the substance of this clause, except 
paragraph (b), and shall require such inclusion in all other 
subcontracts, of any tier, including the obligation to comply with all 
CAS in effect on the subcontractor's award date or if the subcontractor 
has submitted cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on 
price as shown on the subcontractor's signed Certificate of Current Cost 
or Pricing Data. This requirement shall apply only to negotiated 
subcontracts in excess of $500,000 where the price negotiated is not 
based on--
    (1) Established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in 
substantial quantities to the general public; or
    (2) Prices set by law or regulation, and except that the requirement 
shall not apply to negotiated subcontracts otherwise exempt from the 
requirement to include a CAS clause as specified in 48 CFR 9903.201-1.

    (1) Comply with the requirements of 48 CFR 9904.401, Consistency in 
Estimating, Accumulating, and Reporting Costs; 48 CFR 9904.402, 
Consistency in Allocating Costs Incurred for the Same Purpose; 48 CFR 
9904.405, Accounting for Unallowable Costs; and 48 CFR 9904.406, Cost 
Accounting Standard-Cost Accounting Period, in effect on the date of 
award of this contract as indicated in 48 CFR part 9904.
    (2) (CAS-covered Contracts Only) If it is a business unit of a 
company required to submit a Disclosure Statement, disclose in writing 
its cost accounting practices as required by 48 CFR 9903.202-1 through 
9903.202-5. If the Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that 
the Disclosure Statement contains trade secrets and commercial or 
financial information which is privileged and confidential, the 
Disclosure Statement shall be protected and shall not be released 
outside of the Government.
    (3)(i) Follow consistently the Contractor's cost accounting 
practices. A change to such practices may be proposed, however, by 
either the Government or the Contractor, and the Contractor agrees to 
negotiate with the Contracting Officer the terms and conditions under 
which a change may be made. After the terms and conditions under which 
the change is to be made have been agreed to, the change must be applied 
prospectively to this contract, and the Disclosure Statement, if 
affected, must be amended accordingly.
    (ii) The Contractor shall, when the parties agree to a change to a 
cost accounting practice and the Contracting Officer has made the 
finding required in 48 CFR 9903.201-6(b), that the change is desirable 
and not detrimental to the interests of the Government, negotiate an 
equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract. 
In the absence of the required finding, no agreement may be made under 
this contract clause that will increase costs paid by the United States.

[[Page 209]]

    (4) Agree to an adjustment of the contract price or cost allowance, 
as appropriate, if the Contractor or a subcontractor fails to comply 
with the applicable CAS or to follow any cost accounting practice, and 
such failure results in any increased costs paid by the United States. 
Such adjustment shall provide for recovery of the increased costs to the 
United States together with interest thereon computed at the annual rate 
of interest established under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 
U.S.C. 6621), from the time the payment by the United States was made to 
the time the adjustment is effected.
    (b) If the parties fail to agree whether the Contractor has complied 
with an applicable CAS, rule, or regulation as specified in 48 CFR parts 
9903 and 9904 and as to any cost adjustment demanded by the United 
States, such failure to agree will constitute a dispute under the 
Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601).
    (c) The Contractor shall permit any authorized representatives of 
the Government to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, and 
records relating to compliance with the requirements of this clause.
    (d) The Contractor shall include in all negotiated subcontracts, 
which the Contractor enters into, the substance of this clause, except 
paragraph (b), and shall require such inclusion in all other 
subcontracts of any tier, except that--
    (1) If the subcontract is awarded to a business unit which pursuant 
to 48 CFR 9903.201 is required to follow all CAS, the clause entitled 
``Cost Accounting Standards'' set forth in FAR 52.230-2, shall be 
inserted in lieu of this clause; or
    (2) This requirement shall apply only to negotiated subcontracts in 
excess of $500,000 where the price negotiated is not based on--
    (i) Established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in 
substantial quantities to the general public; or
    (ii) Price set by law or regulation; or
    (3) The requirement shall not apply to negotiated subcontracts 
otherwise exempt from the requirement to include a CAS clause as 
specified in 48 CFR 9903.201-1.

           Consistency in Cost Accounting Practices (Aug 1992)

    The Contractor agrees that it will consistently follow the cost

in increased cost paid by the U.S. Government. Interest shall be 
computed at the annual rate of interest established under section 6621 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621) from the time 
payment by the Government was made to the time adjustment is effected.

Sec. 52.230-5  Cost Accounting Standards--Educational Institution.

    As prescribed in 30.201-4(e), insert the following clause:

      Cost Accounting Standards--Educational Institution (Apr 1996)

    (a) Unless the contract is exempt under 48 CFR 9903.201-1 and 
9903.201-2, the provisions of 48 CFR Part 9903 are incorporated herein 
by reference and the Contractor, in connection with this contract, 
shall--
    (1) (CAS-covered contracts only). If a business unit of an 
educational institution required to submit a Disclosure Statement, 
disclose in writing the Contractor's cost accounting practices as 
required by 48 CFR 9903.202-1 through 9903.202-5, including methods of 
distinguishing direct costs from indirect costs and the basis used for 
accumulating and allocating indirect costs. The practices disclosed for 
this contract shall be the same as the practices currently disclosed and 
applied on all other contracts and subcontracts being performed by the 
Contractor and which contain a Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) clause. 
If the Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that the 
Disclosure Statement contains trade secrets, and commercial or financial 
information which is privileged and confidential, the Disclosure 
Statement shall be protected and shall not be released outside of the 
Government.
    (2) Follow consistently the Contractor's cost accounting practices 
in accumulating and reporting contract performance cost data concerning 
this contract. If any change in cost accounting practices is made for 
the purposes of any contract or subcontract subject to CAS requirements, 
the change must be applied prospectively to this contract and the 
Disclosure Statement, if required, must be amended accordingly. If an 
accounting principle change mandated under Office of

[[Page 210]]

Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21, Cost Principles for 
Educational Institutions, requires that a change in the Contractor's 
cost accounting practices be made after the date of this contract award, 
the change must be applied prospectively to this contract and the 
Disclosure Statement, if required, must be amended accordingly. If the 
contract price or cost allowance of this contract is affected by such 
changes, adjustment shall be made in accordance with subparagraph (a)(4) 
or (a)(5) of this clause, as appropriate.
    (3) Comply with all CAS, including any modifications and 
interpretations indicated thereto contained in 48 CFR Part 9905 in 
effect on the date of award of this contract or, if the Contractor has 
submitted cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price 
as shown on the Contractor's signed certificate of current cost or 
pricing data. The Contractor shall also comply with any CAS (or 
modifications to CAS) which hereafter become applicable to a contract or 
subcontract of the Contractor. Such compliance shall be required 
prospectively from the date of applicability to such contract or 
subcontract.
    (4)(i) Agree to an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes 
clause of this contract if the contract cost is affected by a change 
which, pursuant to subparagraph (a)(3) of this clause, the Contractor is 
required to make to the Contractor's established cost accounting 
practices.
    (ii) Negotiate with the Contracting Officer to determine the terms 
and conditions under which a change may be made to a cost accounting 
practice, other than a change made under other provisions of 
subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause; provided that no agreement may be 
made under this provision that will increase costs paid by the United 
States.
    (iii) When the parties agree to a change to a cost accounting 
practice, other than a change under subdivision (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iv) 
of this clause, negotiate an equitable adjustment as provided in the 
Changes clause of this contract.
    (iv) Agree to an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes 
clause of this contract, if the contract cost is materially affected by 
an OMB Circular A-21 accounting principle amendment which, on becoming 
effective after the date of contract award, requires the Contractor to 
make a change to the Contractor's established cost accounting practices.
    (5) Agree to an adjustment of the contract price or cost allowance, 
as appropriate, if the Contractor or a subcontractor fails to comply 
with an applicable Cost Accounting Standard, or to follow any cost 
accounting practice consistently and such failure results in any 
increased costs paid by the United States. Such adjustment shall provide 
for recovery of the increased costs to the United States, together with 
interest thereon computed at the annual rate established under section 
6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621) for such 
period, from the time the payment by the United States was made to the 
time the adjustment is effected. In no case shall the Government recover 
costs greater than the increased cost to the Government, in the 
aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment, 
unless the Contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of 
which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of price 
negotiations and which it failed to disclose to the Government.
    (b) If the parties fail to agree whether the Contractor or a 
subcontractor has complied with an applicable CAS or a CAS rule or 
regulation in 48 CFR Part 9903, and as to any cost adjustment demanded 
by the United States, such failure to agree will constitute a dispute 
under the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601).
    (c) The Contractor shall permit any authorized representatives of 
the Government to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or 
records relating to compliance with the requirements of this clause.
    (d) The Contractor shall include in all negotiated subcontracts 
which the Contractor enters into, the substance of this clause, except 
paragraph (b), and shall require such inclusion in all other 
subcontracts, of any tier, including the obligation to comply with all 
applicable CAS in effect on the subcontractor's award date or, if the 
subcontractor has submitted cost or pricing data, on the date of final 
agreement on price as shown on the subcontractor's signed Certificate of 
Current Cost or Pricing Data, except that--
    (1) If the subcontract is awarded to a business unit which pursuant 
to 48 CFR 9903.201-2 is subject to other types of CAS coverage, the 
substance of the applicable clause set forth in 48 CFR 9903.201-4 shall 
be inserted; and
    (2) This requirement shall apply only to negotiated subcontracts in 
excess of $500,000 where the price negotiated is not based on--
    (i) Established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in 
substantial quantities to the general public; or
    (ii) Prices set by law or regulation, and except that the 
requirement shall not apply to negotiated subcontracts otherwise exempt 
from the requirement to include a CAS clause as specified in 48 CFR 
9903.201-1.

outlined in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this clause:
    (a) Submit to the Contracting Officer a description of any cost 
accounting practice change, the total potential impact of the change on 
contracts containing a CAS clause, and a general dollar magnitude of the 
change which identifies the potential shift of costs between CAS-covered

plus-fixed fee, etc.) and other contractor business activity. As related 
to CAS-covered contracts, the analysis should identify the potential 
impact on funds of the various Agencies/Departments (i.e., Department of 
Energy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Army, Navy, Air 
Force, other Department of Defense, other Government) as follows:

52.230-2, Cost Accounting Standards, and FAR 52.230-5, Cost Accounting 
Standards--Educational Institution; or with subparagraph (a)(3) of the 
clause at FAR 52.230-3, Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting 
Practices, not less than 60 days (or such other date as may be mutually 
agreed to) before the effective date of the proposed change.
    (3) For any failure to comply with an applicable CAS or to follow a 
disclosed practice (as contemplated by subparagraph (a)(5) at FAR 
52.230-2, Cost Accounting Standards, and FAR 52.230-5, Cost Accounting 
Standards--Educational Institution; or by subparagraph (a)(4) at FAR 
52.230-3, Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practice):
    (i) Within 60 days (or such other date as may be mutually agreed to) 
after the date of agreement with the initial finding of noncompliance, 
or
    (ii) In the event of Contractor disagreement with the initial 
finding of noncompliance, within 60 days of the date the Contractor is 
notified by the Contracting Officer of the determination of 
noncompliance.
    (b) After an ACO, or cognizant Federal agency official, 
determination of materiality, submit a cost impact proposal in the form 
and manner specified by the Contracting Officer within 60 days (or such 
other date as may be mutually agreed to) after the date of determination 
of the adequacy and compliance of a change submitted pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this clause. The cost impact proposal shall be in 
sufficient detail to permit evaluation, determination, and negotiation 
of the cost impact upon each separate CAS-covered contract and 
subcontract.
    (1) Cost impact proposals submitted for changes in cost accounting 
practices required in accordance with subparagraph (a)(3) and 
subdivision (a)(4)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.230-2, Cost Accounting 
Standards; or subparagraph (a)(3) and subdivisions (a)(4)(i) or

Educational Institution; shall identify the applicable standard or cost 
principle and all contracts and subcontracts containing the clauses 
entitled Cost Accounting Standards or Cost Accounting Standards--
Educational Institution, which have an award date before the effective 
date of that standard or cost principle.
    (2) Cost impact proposals submitted for any change in cost 
accounting practices proposed in accordance with subdivisions (a)(4) 
(ii) or (iii) of the clauses at FAR 52.230-2, Cost Accounting Standards, 
and FAR 52.230-5, Cost Accounting Standards--Educational Institution; or 
with subparagraph (a)(3) of the clause at FAR 52.230-3, Disclosure and 
Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices; shall identify all contracts 
and subcontracts containing the clauses at FAR 52.230-2, Cost Accounting 
Standards, FAR 52.230-5, Cost Accounting Standards--Educational 
Institution, and FAR 52.230-3, Disclosure and Consistency of Cost 
Accounting Practices.
    (3) Cost impact proposals submitted for failure to comply with an 
applicable CAS or to follow a disclosed practice as contemplated by 
subparagraph (a)(5) of the clauses at FAR 52.230-2, Cost Accounting 
Standards, and FAR 52.230-5, Cost Accounting Standards--Educational 
Institution; or by subparagraph (a)(4) of the clause at FAR 52.230-3, 
Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices, shall identify 
the cost impact on each separate CAS covered contract from the date of 
failure to comply until the noncompliance is corrected.
    (c) If the submissions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
clause are not submitted within the specified time, or any extension 
granted by the Contracting Officer, an amount not to exceed 10 percent 
of each subsequent amount determined payable related to the Contractor's 
CAS-covered prime contracts, up to the estimated general dollar

[[Page 212]]

magnitude of the cost impact, may be withheld until such time as the 
required submission has been provided in the form and manner specified 
by the Contracting Officer.
    (d) Agree to appropriate contract and subcontract amendments to 
reflect adjustments established in accordance with subparagraphs (a)(4) 
and (a)(5) of the clauses at FAR 52.230-2 and 52.230-5; or with 
subparagraphs (a)(3) or (a)(4) of the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost 
Accounting Practices clause at FAR 52.230-3.
    (e) For all subcontracts subject to the clauses at FAR 52.230-2, 
52.230-3, or 52.230-5--
    (1) So state in the body of the subcontract, in the letter of award,

    (i) Subcontractor's name and subcontract number.
    (ii) Dollar amount and date of award.
    (iii) Name of Contractor making the award.
    (iv) Any changes the subcontractor has made or proposes to make to 
cost accounting practices that affect prime contracts or subcontracts 
containing the clauses at FAR 52.230-2, 52.230-3, or 52.230-5, unless 
these changes have already been reported. If award of the subcontract 
results in making one or more CAS effective for the first time, this 
fact shall also be reported.
    (f) Notify the Contracting Officer in writing of any adjustments 
required to subcontracts under this contract and agree to an adjustment, 
based on them, to this contract price or estimated cost and fee. This 
notice is due within 30 days after proposed subcontract adjustments are

    As prescribed in 32.111(a)(5), insert the following clause:

       Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (Apr 1989)

    (a) The Government shall pay the Contractor the contract price as 
provided in this contract.
    (b) The Government shall make progress payments monthly as the work 
proceeds, or at more frequent intervals as determined by the Contracting 
Officer, on estimates of work accomplished which meets the standards of 
quality established under the contract, as approved by the Contracting 
Officer. The Contractor shall furnish a breakdown of the total contract 
price showing the amount included therein for each principal category of 
the work, which shall substantiate the payment amount requested in order 
to provide a basis for determining progress payments, in such detail as 
requested by the Contracting Officer. In the preparation of estimates 
the Contracting Officer may authorize material delivered on the site and 
preparatory work done to be taken into consideration. Material delivered 
to the Contractor at locations other than the site may also be taken 
into consideration if--
    (1) Consideration is specifically authorized by this contract; and
    (2) The Contractor furnishes satisfactory evidence that it has 
acquired title to such material and that the material will be used to 
perform this contract.
    (c) Along with each request for progress payments, the contractor 
shall furnish the following certification, or payment shall not be made:
    I hereby certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that--
    (1) The amounts requested are only for performance in accordance 
with the specifications, terms, and conditions of the contract;
    (2) Payments to subcontractors and suppliers have been made from 
previous payments received under the contract, and timely payments will 
be made from the proceeds of the payment covered by this certification, 
in accordance with subcontract agreements and the requirements of 
chapter 39 of Title 31, United States Code; and
    (3) This request for progress payments does not include any amounts 
which the prime contractor intends to withhold or retain from a 
subcontractor or supplier in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
the subcontract.

    (d) If the Contractor, after making a certified request for progress 
payments, discovers that a portion or all of such request constitutes a 
payment for performance by the Contractor that fails to conform to the 
specifications, terms, and conditions of this contract (hereinafter 
referred to as the unearned amount), the Contractor shall--
    (1) Notify the Contracting Officer of such performance deficiency; 
and
    (2) Be obligated to pay the Government an amount (computed by the 
Contracting Officer in the manner provided in 31 U.S.C. 3903(c)(1)) 
equal to interest on the unearned amount from the date of receipt of the 
unearned amount until--
    (i) The date the Contractor notifies the Contracting Officer that 
the performance deficiency has been corrected; or
    (ii) The date the Contractor reduces the amount of any subsequent 
certified request for progress payments by an amount equal to the 
unearned amount.
    (e) If the Contracting Officer finds that satisfactory progress was 
achieved during any period for which a progress payment is to be made, 
the Contracting Officer shall authorize payment to be made in full. 
However, if satisfactory progress has not been made, the Contracting 
Officer may retain a maximum of 10 percent of the amount of the payment 
until satisfactory progress is achieved. When the work is substantially 
complete, the Contracting Officer may retain from previously withheld 
funds and future progress payments that amount the Contracting Officer 
considers adequate for protection of the Government and shall release to 
the Contractor all the remaining withheld funds. Also, on completion and 
acceptance of each separate building, public work, or other division of 
the contract, for which the price is stated separately in the contract, 
payment shall be made for the completed work without retention of a 
percentage.
    (f) All material and work covered by progress payments made shall, 
at the time of payment, become the sole property of the Government, but 
this shall not be construed as--
    (1) Relieving the Contractor from the sole responsibility for all 
material and work upon which payments have been made or the restoration 
of any damaged work; or
    (2) Waiving the right of the Government to require the fulfillment 
of all of the terms of the contract.
    (g) In making these progress payments, the Government shall, upon 
request, reimburse the Contractor for the amount of premiums paid for 
performance and payment bonds (including coinsurance and reinsurance 
agreements, when applicable) after the Contractor has furnished evidence 
of full payment to the surety. The retainage provisions in paragraph (e) 
above shall not apply to that portion of progress payments attributable 
to bond premiums.
    (h) The Government shall pay the amount due the Contractor under 
this contract after--
    (1) Completion and acceptance of all work;
    (2) Presentation of a properly executed voucher; and
    (3) Presentation of release of all claims against the Government 
arising by virtue of this contract, other than claims, in stated 
amounts, that the Contractor has specifically excepted from the 
operation of the release. A release may also be required of the assignee 
if the Contractor's claim to amounts payable under this contract has 
been assigned under the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940 (31 U.S.C. 3727 
and 41 U.S.C. 15).
    (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract, progress 
payments shall not exceed 80 percent on work accomplished on 
undefinitized contract actions. A contract action is any action 
resulting in a contract, as defined in FAR subpart 2.1, including 
contract modifications for additional supplies or services, but not 
including contract modifications that are within the scope and under the 
terms of the contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to 
the Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes.

<R05>
Sec. 52.232-7  Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts.

    As prescribed in 32.111(b), insert the following clause:

  Payments Under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts (Apr 1984)

    The Government shall pay the Contractor as follows upon the 
submission of invoices or vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer:
    (a) Hourly rate. (1) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying 
the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of 
direct labor hours performed. The rates shall include wages, indirect 
costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts 
of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. Vouchers may be 
submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by 
the Contracting Officer), to the Contracting Officer or designee. The 
Contractor shall substantiate vouchers by evidence of actual payment and 
by individual daily job timecards, or other substantiation approved by 
the Contracting Officer. Promptly after receipt of each substantiated 
voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this 
contract, and subject to the terms of (e) below, pay the voucher as 
approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (2) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting 
Officer shall withhold 5 percent of the amounts due under this paragraph 
(a), but the total amount withheld shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts 
withheld shall be retained until the execution and delivery of a release 
by the Contractor as provided in paragraph (f) below.
    (3) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in 
the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having 
performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided 
in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the 
Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to 
agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the 
Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for 
overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only 
to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (b) Materials and subcontracts. (1) Allowable costs of direct 
materials shall be determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance 
with subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect 
on the date of this contract. Reasonable and allocable material handling 
costs may be included in the charge for material to the extent they are 
clearly excluded from the hourly rate. Material handling costs are 
comprised of indirect costs, including, when appropriate, general and 
administrative expense allocated to direct materials in accordance with 
the Contractor's usual accounting practices consistent with subpart 31.2 
of the FAR. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for items and services 
purchased directly for the contract only when cash, checks, or other 
forms of actual payment have been made for such purchased items or 
services. Direct materials, as used in this clause, are those materials 
which enter directly into the end product, or which are used or consumed 
directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product.
    (2) The cost of subcontracts that are authorized under the 
subcontracts clause of this contract shall be reimbursable costs under 
this clause; provided, that the costs are consistent with subparagraph 
(3) below. Reimbursable costs in connection with subcontracts shall be 
limited to the amounts paid to the subcontractor in the same manner as 
for items and services purchased directly for the contract under 
subparagraph (1) above; however, this requirement shall not apply to a 
Contractor that is a small business concern. Reimbursable costs shall 
not include any costs arising from the letting, administration or 
supervision of performance of the subcontract, if the costs are included 
in the hourly rates payable under (a)(1) above.
    (3) To the extent able, the Contractor shall--
    (i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with 
due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and
    (ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, 
credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take 
advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the 
Contracting Officer and give the reasons. Credit shall be given to the 
Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, 
salvage, the value of any appreciable scrap, commissions, and other 
amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the Contractor, or would 
have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The 
benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or 
lost through fault of the Government, shall not be deducted from gross 
costs.
    (c) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the 
Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the 
ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use 
its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all 
obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any 
time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly

[[Page 216]]

rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this 
contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments 
and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling 
price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting 
Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government 
for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. 
If at any time during performing this contract, the Contractor has 
reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing 
this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated 
ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, 
giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this 
contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time 
during performing this contract, the Government has reason to believe 
that the work to be required in performing this contract will be 
substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the 
Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then 
revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the 
contract.
    (d) Ceiling price. The Government shall not be obligated to pay the 
Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, 
and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to 
do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless 
and until the Contracting Officer shall have notified the Contractor in 
writing that the ceiling price has been increased and shall have 
specified in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the 
ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the 
extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been 
increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the 
Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be 
allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs 
had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.
    (e) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract the 
Contracting Officer may request audit of the invoices or vouchers and 
substantiating material. Each payment previously made shall be subject 
to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices or 
vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been 
properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments 
or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the 
voucher or invoice designated by the Contractor as the completion 
voucher or completion invoice and substantiating material, and upon 
compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, 
without limitation, terms relating to patents and the terms of (f) and 
(g) below), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the 
Contractor. The completion invoice or voucher, and substantiating 
material, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as 
practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in 
no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting 
Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.
    (f) Assignment. The Contractor, and each assignee under an 
assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of 
final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the 
time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this 
contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, 
and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims 
arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following 
exceptions:
    (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if 
the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor.
    (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon 
the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of 
performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the 
date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives 
notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after 
the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that 
the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.
    (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the 
Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against 
patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by 
the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.
    (g) Refunds. The Contractor agrees that any refunds, rebates, or 
credits (including any related interest) accruing to or received by the 
Contractor or any assignee, that arise under the materials portion of 
this contract and for which the Contractor has received reimbursement, 
shall be paid by the Contractor to the Government. The Contractor and 
each assignee, under an assignment entered into under this contract and 
in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall 
execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to 
final payment under this contract, an assignment to the Government of 
such refunds, rebates, or credits (including any interest) in form and 
substance satisfactory to the Contracting Officer.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the nature of the work to be performed 
requires the contractor to furnish material that is regularly sold to 
the general public in the normal course of business by the

[[Page 217]]

contractor, and the price is under the limitations prescribed in 
16.601(b)(3), add the following subparagraph (4) to paragraph (b) of the 
basic clause:
    (4) If the nature of the work to be performed requires the 
Contractor to furnish material which is regularly sold to the general 
public in the normal course of business by the Contractor, the price to 
be paid for such material, notwithstanding (b)(1) above, shall be on the 
basis of an established catalog or list price, in effect when the 
material is furnished, less all applicable discounts to the Government; 
provided, that in no event shall such price be in excess of the 
Contractor's sales price to its most favored customer for the same item 
in like quantity, or the current market price, whichever is lower.
    Alternate II (JAN 1986). If a labor-hour contract is contemplated, 
and if no specific reimbursement for materials furnished is intended, 
the Contracting Officer may add the following paragraph (h) to the basic 
clause:

    (h) The terms of this clause that govern reimbursement for materials 
furnished are considered to have been deleted.

Sec. 52.232-8  Discounts for Prompt Payment.

    As prescribed in 32.111(c)(1), insert the following clause:

                 Discounts for Prompt Payment (Apr 1989)

    (a) Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the 
evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of 
the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount 
period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to 
offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, 
offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on 
individual invoices.
    (b) In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time 
shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of 
computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been 
made on the date which appears on the payment check or the date on which 
an electronic funds transfer was made.

                             (End of clause)

    As prescribed in 32.111(c)(2), insert a clause substantially as 
follows, appropriately modified with respect to payment due dates in 
accordance with agency regulations, in solicitations and contracts when 
a supply contract, service contract, time-and-materials contract, labor-
hour contract, or research and development contract is contemplated that 
includes two or more terms authorizing the temporary withholding of 
amounts otherwise payable to the contractor for supplies delivered or 
services performed:

             Limitation on Withholding of Payments (Apr 1984)

    If more than one clause or Schedule term of this contract authorizes 
the temporary withholding of amounts otherwise payable to the Contractor 
for supplies delivered or services performed, the total of the amounts 
withheld at any one time shall not exceed the greatest amount that may 
be withheld under any one clause or Schedule term at that time; 
provided, that this limitation shall not apply to--
    (a) Withholdings pursuant to any clause relating to wages or hours 
of employees;
    (b) Withholdings not specifically provided for by this contract;
    (c) The recovery of overpayments; and
    (d) Any other withholding for which the Contracting Officer 
determines that this limitation is inappropriate.

Sec. 52.232-10  Payments Under Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer Contracts.

    As prescribed in 32.111(d)(1), insert the following clause:

    Payments Under Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer Contracts (Aug 1987)

    (a) Estimates shall be made monthly of the amount and value of the 
work accomplished and services performed by the Contractor under this 
contract which meet standards of quality established under this 
contract. The estimates shall be prepared by the Contractor and 
accompanied by any supporting data required by the Contracting Officer.
    (b) Upon approval of the estimate by the Contracting Officer, 
payment upon properly executed vouchers shall be made to the Contractor, 
as soon as practicable, of 90 percent of the approved amount, less all 
previous payments; provided, that payment may be made in full during any 
months in which the

[[Page 218]]

Contracting Officer determines that performance has been satisfactory. 
Also, whenever the Contracting Officer determines that the work is 
substantially complete and that the amount retained is in excess of the 
amount adequate for the protection of the Government, the Contracting 
Officer may release the excess amount to the Contractor.
    (c) Upon satisfactory completion by the Contractor and acceptance by 
the Contracting Officer of the work done by the Contractor under the 
Statement of Architect-Engineer Services, the Contractor will be paid 
the unpaid balance of any money due for work under the statement, 
including retained percentages relating to this portion of the work. 
Upon satisfactory completion and final acceptance of the construction 
work, the Contractor shall be paid any unpaid balance of money due under 
this contract.
    (d) Before final payment under the contract, or before settlement 
upon termination of the contract, and as a condition precedent thereto, 
the Contractor shall execute and deliver to the Contracting Officer a 
release of all claims against the Government arising under or by virtue 
of this contract, other than any claims that are specifically excepted 
by the Contractor from the operation of the release in amounts stated in 
the release.
    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this contract, and 
specifically paragraph (b) of this clause, progress payments shall not 
exceed 80 percent on work accomplished on undefinitized contract 
actions. A contract action is any action resulting in a contract, as 
defined in FAR subpart 2.1, including contract modifications for 
additional supplies or services, but not including contract 
modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the 
contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the Changes 
clause, or funding and other administrative changes.

Sec. 52.232-12  Advance Payments.

    As prescribed in 32.412(a), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts under which the Government will provide 
advance payments, except as provided in 32.412(b):

                       Advance Payments (Apr 1984)

    (a) Requirements for payment. Advance payments will be made under 
this contract (1) upon submission of properly certified invoices or 
vouchers by the Contractor, and approval by the administering office, --
------ ---------- [Insert the name of the office designated under agency 
procedures], or (2) under a letter of credit. The amount of the invoice 
or voucher submitted plus all advance payments previously approved shall 
not exceed $-------- If a letter of credit is used, the Contractor shall 
withdraw cash only when needed for disbursements acceptable under this 
contract and report cash disbursements and balances as required by the 
administering office. The Contractor shall apply terms similar to this 
clause to any advance payments to subcontractors.
    (b) Special bank account. Until (1) the Contractor has liquidated 
all advance payments made under the contract and related interest 
charges and (2) the administering office has approved in writing the 
release of any funds due and payable to the Contractor, all advance 
payments and other payments under this contract shall be made by check 
payable to the Contractor marked for deposit only in the Contractor's 
special bank account with the ---------- [Insert the name of the bank]. 
None of the funds in the special bank account shall be mingled with 
other funds of the Contractor. Withdrawals from the special bank account 
may be made only by check of the Contractor countersigned by the 
Contracting Officer or a Government countersigning agent designated in 
writing by the Contracting Officer.
    (c) Use of funds. The Contractor may withdraw funds from the special 
bank account only to pay for properly allocable, allowable, and 
reasonable costs for direct materials, direct labor, and indirect costs. 
Other withdrawals require approval in writing by the administering 
office. Determinations of whether costs are properly allocable, 
allowable, and reasonable shall be in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, subject to any applicable subparts of part 31 of 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
    (d) Repayment to the Government. At any time, the Contractor may 
repay all or any

[[Page 219]]

part of the funds advanced by the Government. Whenever requested in 
writing to do so by the administering office, the Contractor shall repay 
to the Government any part of unliquidated advance payments considered 
by the administering office to exceed the Contractor's current 
requirements or the amount specified in paragraph (a) above. If the 
Contractor fails to repay the amount requested by the administering 
office, all or any part of the unliquidated advance payments may be 
withdrawn from the special bank account by check signed by only the 
countersigning agent and applied to reduction of the unliquidated 
advance payments under this contract.
    (e) Maximum payment. When the sum of all unliquidated advance 
payments, unpaid interest charges, and other payments exceed ---- 
percent of the contract price, the Government shall withhold further 
payments to the Contractor. On completion or termination of the 
contract, the Government shall deduct from the amount due to the 
Contractor all unliquidated advance payments and all interest charges 
payable. If previous payments to the Contractor exceed the amount due, 
the excess amount shall be paid to the Government on demand. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the contract price shall be considered to be 
the stated contract price of $------, less any subsequent price 
reductions under the contract, plus (1) any price increases resulting 
from any terms of this contract for price redetermination or escalation, 
and (2) any other price increases that do not, in the aggregate, exceed 
$------ [Insert an amount not higher than 10 percent of the stated 
contract amount inserted in this paragraph]. Any payments withheld under 
this paragraph shall be applied to reduce the unliquidated advance 
payments. If full liquidation has been made, payments under the contract 
shall resume.
    (f) Interest. (1) The Contractor shall pay interest to the 
Government on the daily unliquidated advance payments at the daily rate 
specified in subparagraph (f)(3) below. Interest shall be computed at 
the end of each calendar month for the actual number of days involved. 
For the purpose of computing the interest charge--
    (i) Advance payments shall be considered as increasing the 
unliquidated balance as of the date of the advance payment check;
    (ii) Repayments by Contractor check shall be considered as 
decreasing the unliquidated balance as of the date on which the check is 
received by the Government authority designated by the Contracting 
Officer; and
    (iii) Liquidations by deductions from Government payments to the 
Contractor shall be considered as decreasing the unliquidated balance as 
of the date of the check for the reduced payment.
    (2) Interest charges resulting from the monthly computation shall be 
deducted from payments, other than advance payments, due the Contractor. 
If the accrued interest exceeds the payment due, any excess interest 
shall be carried forward and deducted from subsequent payments. Interest 
carried forward shall not be compounded. Interest on advance payments 
shall cease to accrue upon satisfactory completion or termination of the 
contract for the convenience of the Government. The Contractor shall 
charge interest on advance payments to subcontractors in the manner 
described above and credit the interest to the Government. Interest need 
not be charged on advance payments to nonprofit educational or research 
subcontractors for experimental, developmental, or research work.
    (3) If interest is required under the contract, the Contracting 
Officer shall determine a daily interest rate based on the higher of (i) 
the published prime rate of the banking institution (depository) in 
which the special bank account is established or (ii) the rate 
established by the Secretary of the Treasury under Pub. L. 92-41 (50 
U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2)). The Contracting Officer shall revise the daily 
interest rate during the contract period in keeping with any changes in 
the cited interest rates.
    (4) If the full amount of interest charged under this paragraph has 
not been paid by deduction or otherwise upon completion or termination 
of this contract, the Contractor shall pay the remaining interest to the 
Government on demand.
    (g) Bank Agreement. Before an advance payment is made under this 
contract, the Contractor shall transmit to the administering office, in 
the form prescribed by the administering office, an agreement in 
triplicate from the bank in which the special bank account is 
established, clearly setting forth the special character of the account 
and the responsibilities of the bank under the account. If possible, the 
Contractor shall select a bank that is a member bank of the Federal 
Reserve System or is an insured bank within the meaning the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (12 U.S.C. 1811).
    (h) Lien on Special Bank Account. The Government shall have a lien 
upon any balance in the special bank account paramount to all other 
liens. The Government lien shall secure the repayment of any advance 
payments made under this contract and any related interest charges.
    (i) Lien on property under contract. (1) All advance payments under 
this contract, together with interest charges, shall be secured, when 
made, by a lien in favor of the Government, paramount to all other 
liens, on the supplies or other things covered by this contract and on 
all material and other property acquired for or allocated to the 
performance of this contract, except to the extent that the Government 
by virtue of any other terms of this contract, or otherwise,

[[Page 220]]

shall have valid title to the supplies, materials, or other property as 
against other creditors of the Contractor.
    (2) The Contractor shall identify, by marking or segregation, all 
property that is subject to a lien in favor of the Government by virtue 
of any terms of this contract in such a way as to indicate that it is 
subject to a lien and that it has been acquired for or allocated to 
performing this contract. If, for any reason, the supplies, materials, 
or other property are not identified by marking or segregation, the 
Government shall be considered to have a lien to the extent of the 
Government's interest under this contract on any mass of property with 
which the supplies, materials, or other property are commingled. The 
Contractor shall maintain adequate accounting control over the property 
on its books and records.
    (3) If, at any time during the progress of the work on the contract, 
it becomes necessary to deliver to a third person any items or materials 
on which the Government has a lien, the Contractor shall notify the 
third person of the lien and shall obtain from the third person a 
receipt in duplicate acknowledging the existence of the lien. The 
Contractor shall provide a copy of each receipt to the Contracting 
Officer.
    (4) If, under the termination clause, the Contracting Officer 
authorizes the Contractor to sell or retain termination inventory, the 
approval shall constitute a release of the Government's lien to the 
extent that--
    (i) The termination inventory is sold or retained; and
    (ii) The sale proceeds or retention credits are applied to reduce 
any outstanding advance payments.
    (j) Insurance. The Contractor represents and warrants that it 
maintains with responsible insurance carriers (1) insurance on plant and 
equipment against fire and other hazards, to the extent that similar 
properties are usually insured by others operating plants and properties 
of similar character in the same general locality; (2) adequate 
insurance against liability on account of damage to persons or property; 
and (3) adequate insurance under all applicable workers' compensation 
laws. The Contractor agrees that, until work under this contract has 
been completed and all advance payments made under the contract have 
been liquidated, it will maintain this insurance; maintain adequate

                    [List the pertinent obligations]

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the agency desires to waive the 
countersignature requirement because of the Contractor's financial 
strength, good performance record, and favorable experience concerning 
cost disallowances, add the following sentence, if appropriate, to 
paragraph (b) of the basic clause:

    However, for this contract, countersignature on behalf of the 
Government will not be required unless it is determined necessary by the 
administering office.
    Alternate II (APR 1984). If used in a cost-reimbursement contract, 
substitute the following paragraphs (c) and (e), and subparagraphs 
(f)(1) and (f)(2) for paragraphs (c) and (e) and subparagraphs (f)(1) 
and (2) of the basic clause:
    (c) Use of funds. The Contractor shall withdraw funds from the 
special bank account only to pay for allowable costs as prescribed by 
the -------- clause of this contract. Payment for any other types of 
expenses shall be approved in writing by the administering office.
    (e) Maximum payment. When the sum of all unliquidated advance 
payments, unpaid interest charges, and other payments equal the total 
estimated cost of $ -------- (not including fixed-fee, if any) for the 
work under this contract, the Government shall withhold further payments 
to the Contractor. Upon completion or termination of the contract, the 
Government shall deduct from the amount due to the Contractor all 
unliquidated advance payments and interest charges payable. The 
Contractor shall pay any deficiency to the Government upon demand. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the estimated cost shall be considered to be 
the stated estimated cost, less any subsequent reductions of the 
estimated cost, plus any increases in the estimated costs that do not, 
in the aggregate, exceed $-------- [Insert an amount not higher than 10 
percent of the stated estimated cost inserted in this paragraph.] The 
estimated cost shall include, without limitation, any reimbursable cost 
(as estimated by the Contracting Officer) incident to a termination for 
the convenience of the Government. Any payments withheld under this 
paragraph shall be applied to reduce the unliquidated advance payments. 
If full liquidation has been made, payments under the contract shall 
resume.
    (f) Interest. (1) The Contractor shall pay interest to the 
Government on the daily unliquidated advance payments at the daily rate 
specified in subparagraph (f)(3) below. Interest shall be computed at 
the end of each calendar month for the actual number of days involved. 
For the purpose of computing the interest charge, the following shall be 
observed:
    (i) Advance payments shall be considered as increasing the 
unliquidated balance as of the date of the advance payment check.
    (ii) Repayments by Contractor check shall be considered as 
decreasing the unliquidated balance as of the date on which the check is 
received by the Government authority designated by the Contracting 
Officer.
    (iii) Liquidations by deductions from payments to the Contractor 
shall be considered as decreasing the unliquidated balance as of the 
dates on which the Contractor presents to the Contracting Officer full 
and accurate data for the preparation of each voucher. Credits resulting 
from these deductions shall be made upon the approval of the 
reimbursement vouchers by the Disbursing Officer, based upon the 
Contracting Officer's certification of the applicable dates.
    (2) Interest charges resulting from the monthly computation shall be 
deducted from any payments on account of the fixed-fee due to the 
Contractor. If the accrued interest exceeds the payment due, any excess 
interest shall be carried forward and deducted from subsequent payments 
of the contract price or fixed-fee. Interest carried forward shall not 
be compounded. Interest on advance payments shall cease to accrue upon 
(i) satisfactory completion or (ii) termination of the contract for the 
convenience of the Government. The Contractor shall charge interest on 
advance payments to subcontractors in the manner described above and 
credit the interest to the Government. Interest need not be charged on 
advance payments to nonprofit educational or research subcontractors for 
experimental, developmental, or research work.
    Alternate III (APR 1984). If the agency considers a more rapid 
liquidation appropriate, add the following sentence as the first 
sentence of paragraph (e) of the basic clause with the appropriate 
percentage specified:

    To liquidate the principal amount of any advance payment made to the 
Contractor, there shall be deductions of -------- percent

[[Page 223]]

from all payments made by the Government under the contracts involved.
    Alternate IV (APR 1984). If the agency provides advance payments 
under the contract at no interest to the prime contractor, add the 
following sentences as the beginning sentences of paragraph (f) of the 
clause:

    No interest shall be charged to the prime Contractor for advance 
payments except for interest charged during a period of default. The 
terms of this paragraph concerning interest charges for advance payments 
shall not apply to the prime Contractor.
    Alternate V (JUL 1990). If the requirement for a special bank 
account is eliminated in accordance with 32.409-3 (e) or (g), insert the 
clause set forth below instead of the basic clause.
    If this Alternate is used in combination with Alternate II, 
disregard the instructions concerning paragraph (c), Use of funds, in 
Alternate II; substitute paragraph (e), Maximum payment, in Alternate II 
for paragraph (d) below; and substitute paragraph (f), Interest, in 
Alternate II for paragraph (e) below and change the reference to 
paragraph (f)(3) in the first sentence of paragraph (f) of Alternate II 
to (e)(3).
    If this Alternate is used in combination with Alternate III, insert 
the additional sentence set forth in Alternate III as the first sentence 
of paragraph (d) of this Alternate.
    If this Alternate is used in combination with Alternate IV, insert 
the additional sentences set forth in Alternate IV as the beginning 
sentences of paragraph (e) of this Alternate.

        Advance Payments Without Special Bank Account (Jul 1990)

    (a) Requirements for payment. Advance payments will be made under 
this contract (1) upon submission of properly certified invoices or 
vouchers by the contractor, and approval by the administering office, --
--- [insert the name of the office designated under agency procedures], 
or (2) under a letter of credit. The amount of the invoice or voucher 
submitted plus all advance payments previously approved shall not exceed 
$----. If a letter of credit is used, the Contractor shall withdraw cash 
only when needed for disbursements acceptable under this contract and 
report cash disbursements and balances as required by the administering 
office. The Contractor shall apply terms similar to this clause to any 
advance payments to subcontractors.
    (b) Use of funds. The Contractor may use advance payment funds only 
to pay for properly allocable, allowable, and reasonable costs for 
direct materials, direct labor, and indirect costs. Determinations of 
whether costs are properly allocable, allowable, and reasonable shall be 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, subject to 
any applicable subparts of part 31 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation.
    (c) Repayment to the Government. At any time, the Contractor may 
repay all or any part of the funds advanced by the Government. Whenever 
requested in writing to do so by the administering office, the 
Contractor shall repay to the Government any part of unliquidated 
advance payments considered by the administering office to exceed the 
Contractor's current requirements or the amount specified in paragraph 
(a) of this clause.
    (d) Maximum payment. When the sum of all unliquidated advance 
payments, unpaid interest charges, and other payments exceed ----- 
percent of the contract price, the Government shall withhold further 
payments to the Contractor. On completion or termination of the 
contract, the Government shall deduct from the amount due to the 
Contractor all unliquidated advance payments and all interest charges 
payable. If previous payments to the Contractor exceed the amount due, 
the excess amount shall be paid to the Government on demand. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the contract price shall be considered to be 
the stated contract price of $----, less any subsequent price reductions 
under the contract, plus (1) any price increases resulting from any 
terms of this contract for price redetermination or escalation, and (2) 
any other price increases that do not, in the aggregate, exceed $---- 
[insert an amount not higher than 10 percent of the stated contract 
amount inserted in this paragraph]. Any payments withheld under this 
paragraph shall be applied to reduce the unliquidated advance payments. 
If full liquidation has been made, payments under the contract shall 
resume.
    (e) Interest. (1) The Contractor shall pay interest to the 
Government on the daily unliquidated advance payments at the daily rate 
in subparagraph (e)(3) of this clause. Interest shall be computed at the 
end of each calendar month for the actual number of days involved. For 
the purpose of computing the interest charge--
    (i) Advance payments shall be considered as increasing the 
unliquidated balance as of the date of the advance payment check;
    (ii) Repayments by Contractor check shall be considered as 
decreasing the unliquidated balance as of the date on which the check is 
received by the Government authority designated by the Contracting 
Officer; and
    (iii) Liquidations by deductions from Government payments to the 
Contractor shall be

[[Page 224]]

considered as decreasing the unliquidated balance as of the date of the 
check for the reduced payment.
    (2) Interest charges resulting from the monthly computation shall be 
deducted from payments, other than advance payments, due the Contractor. 
If the accrued interest exceeds the payment due, any excess interest 
shall be carried forward and deducted from subsequent payments. Interest 
carried forward shall not be compounded. Interest on advance payments 
shall cease to accrue upon satisfactory completion or termination of the 
contract for the convenience of the Government. The Contractor shall 
charge interest on advance payments to subcontractors in the manner 
described above and credit the interest to the Government. Interest need 
not be charged on advance payments to nonprofit educational or research 
subcontractors, for experimental, developmental, or research work.
    (3) If interest is required under the contract, the Contracting 
Officer shall determine a daily interest rate based on the rate 
established by the Secretary of the Treasury under Pub. L. 92-41 (50 
U.S.C. App., 1215(b)(2)). The Contracting Officer shall revise the daily 
interest rate during the contract period in keeping with any changes in 
the cited interest rate.
    (4) If the full amount of interest charged under this paragraph has 
not been paid by deduction or otherwise upon completion or termination 
of this contract, the Contractor shall pay the remaining interest to the 
Government on demand.
    (f) Lien on property under contract. (1) All advance payments under 
this contract, together with interest charges, shall be secured, when 
made, by a lien in favor of the Government, paramount to all other 
liens, on the supplies or other things covered by this contract and on 
all material and other property acquired for or allocated to the 
performance of this contract, except to the extent that the Government 
by virtue of any other terms of this contract, or otherwise, shall have 
valid title to the supplies, materials, or other property as against 
other creditors of the Contractor.
    (2) The Contractor shall identify, by marking or segregation, all 
property that is subject to a lien in favor of the Government by virtue 
of any terms of this contract in such a way as to indicate that it is 
subject to a lien and that it has been acquired for or allocated to 
performing this contract. If, for any reason, the supplies, materials, 
or other property are not identified by marking or segregation, the 
Government shall be considered to have a lien to the extent of the 
Government's interest under this contract on any mass of property with 
which the supplies, materials, or other property are commingled. The 
Contractor shall maintain adequate accounting control over the property 
on its books and records.
    (3) If, at any time during the progress of the work on the contract, 
it becomes necessary to deliver to a third person any items or materials 
on which the Government has a lien, the Contractor shall notify the 
third person of the lien and shall obtain from the third person a 
receipt in duplicate acknowledging the existence of the lien. The 
Contractor shall provide a copy of each receipt to the Contracting 
Officer.
    (4) If, under the termination clause, the Contracting Officer 
authorizes the contractor to sell or retain termination inventory, the 
approval shall constitute a release of the Government's lien to the 
extent that--
    (i) The termination inventory is sold or retained; and
    (ii) The sale proceeds or retention credits are applied to reduce 
any outstanding advance payments.
    (g) Insurance. The Contractor represents and warrants that it 
maintains with responsible insurance carriers (1) insurance on plant and 
equipment against fire and other hazards, to the extent that similar 
properties are usually insured by others operating plants and properties 
of similar character in the same general locality; (2) adequate 
insurance against liability on account of damage to persons or property; 
and (3) adequate insurance under all applicable worker's compensation 
laws. The Contractor agrees that, until work under this contract has 
been completed and all advance payments made under the contract have 
been liquidated, it will maintain this insurance; maintain adequate 
insurance on any materials, parts, assemblies, subassemblies, supplies, 
equipment, and other property acquired for or allocable to this contract 
and subject to the Government lien under paragraph (f) of this clause; 
and furnish any certificates with respect to its insurance that the 
administering office may require.
    (h) Default. (1) If any of the following events occur, the 
Government may, by written notice to the Contractor, withhold further 
payments on this contract:
    (i) Termination of this contract for a fault of the Contractor.

failed to--

performance of this contract;
    (D) Limit inventory allocated to this contract to reasonable 
requirements; or

performing this contract in the ordinary course of business.

[[Page 225]]

    (iii) The appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator for all 
or a substantial part of the Contractor's property, or the institution 
of proceedings by or against the Contractor for bankruptcy, 
reorganization, arrangement, or liquidation.
    (iv) The commission of an act of bankruptcy.
    (2) If any of the events described in subparagraph (h)(1) of this 
clause continue for 30 days after the written notice to the Contractor, 
the Government may take any of the following additional actions:

this clause, on outstanding advance payments during the period of any 
event described in subparagraph (h)(1) of this clause.

public or private sale all or any part of the property on which the 
Government has a lien under this contract and, after deducting any 
expenses incident to the sale, apply the net proceeds of the sale to 
reduce the unliquidated balance of advance payments or other Government 
claims against the Contractor.
    (3) The Government may take any of the actions described in 
subparagraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this clause it considers appropriate 
at its discretion and without limiting any other rights of the 
Government.
    (i) Prohibition against assignment. Notwithstanding any other terms 
of this contract, the Contractor shall not assign this contract, any 
interest therein, or any claim under the contract to any party.

warrants the following:

Sec. 52.232-13  Notice of Progress Payments.

    As prescribed in 32.502-3(a), insert the following provision in 
invitations for bids and requests for proposals that include a Progress 
Payments clause:

                  Notice of Progress Payments (Apr 1984)

    The need for customary progress payments conforming to the 
regulations in subpart 32.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)

the contract. The Progress Payments clause included in this solicitation 
will be included in any resulting contract, modified or altered if 
necessary in accordance with subsection 52.232-16 and its Alternate I of 
the FAR. Even though the clause is included in the contract, the clause

and controls are determined by the Government to be inadequate for 
segregation and accumulation of contract costs.

that the new rate shall be used for that subcontractor in lieu of the 
customary rate.

                       Progress Payments (Jul 1991)

    Progress payments shall be made to the Contractor when requested as 
work progresses, but not more frequently than monthly in amounts 
approved by the Contracting Officer, under the following conditions:
    (a) Computation of amounts. (1) Unless the Contractor requests a 
smaller amount, each progress payment shall be computed as (i) 80 
percent of the Contractor's cumulative total costs under this contract, 
as shown by records maintained by the Contractor for the purpose of 
obtaining payment under Government contracts, plus (ii) progress 
payments to subcontractors (see paragraph (j) below), all less the sum 
of all previous progress payments made by the Government under this 
contract. Cost of money that would be allowable under 31.205-10 of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be deemed an incurred cost for 
progress payment purposes.
    (2) The following conditions apply to the timing of including costs 
in progress payment requests:
    (i) The costs of supplies and services purchased by the Contractor 
directly for this contract may be included only after payment by cash, 
check, or other form of actual payment.
    (ii) Costs for the following may be included when incurred, even if 
before payment, when the Contractor is not delinquent in payment of the 
costs of contract performance in the ordinary course of business:
    (A) Materials issued from the Contractor's stores inventory and 
placed in the production process for use on this contract.
    (B) Direct labor, direct travel, and other direct in-house costs.
    (C) Properly allocable and allowable indirect costs.
    (iii) Accrued costs of Contractor contributions under employee 
pension or other postretirement benefit, profit sharing, and stock 
ownership plans shall be excluded until actually paid unless--
    (A) The Contractor's practice is to contribute to the plans 
quarterly or more frequently; and
    (B) The contribution does not remain unpaid 30 days after the end of 
the applicable quarter or shorter payment period (any contributions 
remaining unpaid shall be excluded from the Contractor's total costs for 
progress payments until paid).
    (iv) If the contract is subject to the special transition method 
authorized in Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 410, Allocation of Business 
Unit General and Administrative Expense to Final Cost Objective, General 
and Administrative expenses (G&A) shall not be included in progress 
payment requests until the suspense account prescribed in CAS 410 is 
less than--
    (A) Five million dollars; or
    (B) The value of the work-in-process inventories under contracts 
entered into after the suspense account was established (only a pro rata 
share of the G&A allocable to the excess of the inventory over the 
suspense account value is includable in progress payment requests under 
this contract).
    (3) The Contractor shall not include the following in total costs 
for progress payment purposes in subparagraph (a)(1)(i) above:
    (i) Costs that are not reasonable, allocable to this contract, and 
consistent with sound and generally accepted accounting principles and 
practices.
    (ii) Costs incurred by subcontractors or suppliers.
    (iii) Costs ordinarily capitalized and subject to depreciation or 
amortization except for the properly depreciated or amortized portion of 
such costs.
    (iv) Payments made or amounts payable to subcontractors or 
suppliers, except for--
    (A) Completed work, including partial deliveries, to which the 
Contractor has acquired title; and
    (B) Work under cost-reimbursement or time-and-material subcontracts 
to which the Contractor has acquired title.
    (4) The amount of unliquidated progress payments may exceed neither 
(i) the progress payments made against incomplete work (including 
allowable unliquidated progress payments to subcontractors) nor (ii) the 
value, for progress payment purposes, of

[[Page 228]]

the incomplete work. Incomplete work shall be considered to be the 
supplies and services required by this contract, for which delivery and 
invoicing by the Contractor and acceptance by the Government are 
incomplete.
    (5) The total amount of progress payments shall not exceed 80 
percent of the total contract price.
    (6) If a progress payment or the unliquidated progress payments 
exceed the amounts permitted by subparagraphs (a)(4) or (a)(5) above, 
the Contractor shall repay the amount of such excess to the Government 
on demand.
    (b) Liquidation. Except as provided in the Termination for 
Convenience of the Government clause, all progress payments shall be 
liquidated by deducting from any payment under this contract, other than 
advance or progress payments, the unliquidated progress payments, or 80 
percent of the amount invoiced, whichever is less. The Contractor shall 
repay to the Government any amounts required by a retroactive price 
reduction, after computing liquidations and payments on past invoices at 
the reduced prices and adjusting the unliquidated progress payments 
accordingly. The Government reserves the right to unilaterally change 
from the ordinary liquidation rate to an alternate rate when deemed 
appropriate for proper contract financing.
    (c) Reduction or suspension. The Contracting Officer may reduce or 
suspend progress payments, increase the rate of liquidation, or take a 
combination of these acquisitions, after finding on substantial evidence 
any of the following conditions:
    (1) The Contractor failed to comply with any material requirement of 
this contract (which includes paragraphs (f) and (g) below).
    (2) Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's 
(i) failure to make progress or (ii) unsatisfactory financial condition.
    (3) Inventory allocated to this contract substantially exceeds 
reasonable requirements.
    (4) The Contractor is delinquent in payment of the costs of 
performing this contract in the ordinary course of business.
    (5) The unliquidated progress payments exceed the fair value of the 
work accomplished on the undelivered portion of this contract.
    (6) The Contractor is realizing less profit than that reflected in 
the establishment of any alternate liquidation rate in paragraph (b) 
above, and that rate is less than the progress payment rate stated in 
subparagraph (a)(1) above.
    (d) Title. (1) Title to the property described in this paragraph (d) 
shall vest in the Government. Vestiture shall be immediately upon the 
date of this contract, for property acquired or produced before that 
date. Otherwise, vestiture shall occur when the property is or should 
have been allocable or properly chargeable to this contract.
    (2) Property, as used in this clause, includes all of the below-
described items acquired or produced by the Contractor that are or 
should be allocable or properly chargeable to this contract under sound 
and generally accepted accounting principles and practices.
    (i) Parts, materials, inventories, and work in process;
    (ii) Special tooling and special test equipment to which the 
Government is to acquire title under any other clause of this contract;
    (iii) Nondurable (i.e., noncapital) tools, jigs, dies, fixtures, 
molds, patterns, taps, gauges, test equipment, and other similar 
manufacturing aids, title to which would not be obtained as special 
tooling under subparagraph (ii) above; and
    (iv) Drawings and technical data, to the extent the Contractor or 
subcontractors are required to deliver them to the Government by other 
clauses of this contract.
    (3) Although title to property is in the Government under this 
clause, other applicable clauses of this contract, e.g., the termination 
or special tooling clauses, shall determine the handling and disposition 
of the property.
    (4) The Contractor may sell any scrap resulting from production 
under this contract without requesting the Contracting Officer's 
approval, but the proceeds shall be credited against the costs of 
performance.
    (5) To acquire for its own use or dispose of property to which title 
is vested in the Government under this clause, the Contractor must 
obtain the Contracting Officer's advance approval of the action and the 
terms. The Contractor shall (i) exclude the allocable costs of the 
property from the costs of contract performance, and (ii) repay to the 
Government any amount of unliquidated progress payments allocable to the 
property. Repayment may be by cash or credit memorandum.
    (6) When the Contractor completes all of the obligations under this 
contract, including liquidation of all progress payments, title shall 
vest in the Contractor for all property (or the proceeds thereof) not--
    (i) Delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this 
contract; or
    (ii) Incorporated in supplies delivered to, and accepted by, the 
Government under this contract and to which title is vested in the 
Government under this clause.
    (7) The terms of this contract concerning liability for Government-
furnished property shall not apply to property to which the Government 
acquired title solely under this clause.
    (e) Risk of loss. Before delivery to and acceptance by the 
Government, the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the 
title to which vests in the Government under

[[Page 229]]

this clause, except to the extent the Government expressly assumes the 
risk. The Contractor shall repay the Government an amount equal to the 
unliquidated progress payments that are based on costs allocable to 
property that is damaged, lost, stolen, or destroyed.
    (f) Control of costs and property. The Contractor shall maintain an 
accounting system and controls adequate for the proper administration of 
this clause.
    (g) Reports and access to records. The Contractor shall promptly 
furnish reports, certificates, financial statements, and other pertinent 
information reasonably requested by the Contracting Officer for the 
administration of this clause. Also, the Contractor shall give the 
Government reasonable opportunity to examine and verify the Contractor's 
books, records, and accounts.
    (h) Special terms regarding default. If this contract is terminated 
under the Default clause, (i) the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to 
the Government the amount of unliquidated progress payments and (ii) 
title shall vest in the Contractor, on full liquidation of progress 
payments, for all property for which the Government elects not to 
require delivery under the Default clause. The Government shall be 
liable for no payment except as provided by the Default clause.
    (i) Reservations of rights. (1) No payment or vesting of title under 
this clause shall (i) excuse the Contractor from performance of 
obligations under this contract or (ii) constitute a waiver of any of 
the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract.
    (2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause (i) shall 
not be exclusive but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and 
remedies provided by law or this contract and (ii) shall not be affected 
by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, power, or 
privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or 
impair any further exercise under this clause or the exercise of any 
other right, power, or privilege of the Government.
    (j) Progress payments to subcontractors. The amounts mentioned in 
(a)(1)(ii) above shall be all progress payments to subcontractors or 
divisions, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The amounts included are limited to (i) the unliquidated 
remainder of progress payments made plus (ii) for small business 
concerns any unpaid subcontractor requests for progress payments that 
the Contractor has approved for current payment in the ordinary course 
of business.
    (2) The subcontract or interdivisional order is expected to involve 
a minimum of approximately 6 months between the beginning of work and 
the first delivery, or, if the subcontractor is a small business 
concern, 4 months.
    (3) The terms of the subcontract or interdivisional order concerning 
progress payments--
    (i) Are substantially similar to the terms of the clause at 52.232-
16, Progress Payments, for any subcontractor that is a large business 
concern, or that clause with its Alternate I for any subcontractor that 
is a small business concern;
    (ii) Are at least as favorable to the Government as the terms of 
this clause;
    (iii) Are not more favorable to the subcontractor or division than 
the terms of this clause are to the Contractor;
    (iv) Are in conformance with the requirements of paragraph 32.504(e) 
of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and
    (v) Subordinate all subcontractor rights concerning property to 
which the Government has title under the subcontract to the Government's 
right to require delivery of the property to the Government if (A) the 
Contractor defaults or (B) the subcontractor becomes bankrupt or 
insolvent.
    (4) The progress payment rate in the subcontract is the customary 
rate used by the Contracting Agency, depending on whether the 
subcontractor is or is not a small business concern.
    (5) The parties agree concerning any proceeds received by the 
Government for property to which title has vested in the Government 
under the subcontract terms, that the proceeds shall be applied to 
reducing any unliquidated progress payments by the Government to the 
Contractor under this contract.
    (6) If no unliquidated progress payments to the Contractor remain, 
but there are unliquidated progress payments that the Contractor has 
made to any subcontractor, the Contractor shall be subrogated to all the 
rights the Government obtained through the terms required by this clause 
to be in any subcontract, as if all such rights had been assigned and 
transferred to the Contractor.
    (7) The Contractor shall pay the subcontractor's progress payment 
request under subdivision (j)(1)(ii) above, within a reasonable time 
after receiving the Government progress payment covering those amounts.
    (8) To facilitate small business participation in subcontracting 
under this contract, the Contractor agrees to provide progress payments 
to small business concerns, in conformity with the standards for 
customary progress payments stated in subpart 32.5 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation. The Contractor further agrees that the need for 
such progress payments shall not be considered as a handicap or adverse 
factor in the award of subcontracts.
    (k) Limitations on undefinitized contract actions. Notwithstanding 
any other progress payment provisions in this contract, progress 
payments may not exceed 80 percent of costs incurred on work 
accomplished

[[Page 230]]

under undefinitized contract actions. A contract action is any action 
resulting in a contract, as defined in subpart 2.1, including contract 
modifications for additional supplies or services, but not including 
contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of 
the contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the 
Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes. This 
limitation shall apply to the costs incurred, as computed in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this clause, and shall remain in effect until the 
contract action is definitized. Costs incurred which are subject to this 
limitation shall be segregated on Contractor progress payment requests 
and invoices from those costs eligible for higher progress payment 
rates. For purposes of progress payment liquidation, as described in 
paragraph (b) of this clause, progress payments for undefinitized 
contract actions shall be liquidated at 80 percent of the amount 
invoiced for work performed under the undefinitized contract action as 
long as the contract action remains undefinitized. The amount of 
unliquidated progress payments for undefinitized contract actions shall 
not exceed 80 percent of the maximum liability of the Government under 
the undefinitized contract action or such lower limit specified 
elsewhere in the contract. Separate limits may be specified for separate 
actions.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (AUG 1987). If the contract is with a small business 
concern, change each mention of the progress payment and liquidation 
rates excepting paragraph (k) to the customary rate of 85 percent for 
small business concerns (see 32.501-1), delete subparagraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) from the basic clause, and substitute the following subparagraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2):

    (a) Computation of amounts. (1) Unless the Contractor requests a 
smaller amount, each progress payment shall be computed as (i) 85 
percent of the Contractor's total costs incurred under this contract 
whether or not actually paid, plus (ii) progress payments to 
subcontractors (see paragraph (j) below), all less the sum of all 
previous progress payments made by the Government under this contract. 
Cost of money that would be allowable under 31.205-10 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation shall be deemed an incurred cost for progress 
payment purposes.
    (2) Accrued costs of Contractor contributions under employee pension 
plans shall be excluded until actually paid unless--
    (i) The Contractor's practice is to make contributions to the 
retirement fund quarterly or more frequently; and
    (ii) The contribution does not remain unpaid 30 days after the end 
of the applicable quarter or shorter payment period (any contribution 
remaining unpaid shall be excluded from the Contractor's total costs for 
progress payments until paid).

    Alternate II (AUG 1987). If the contract is a letter contract, add 
paragraphs (l) and (m). The amount specified in paragraph (m) shall not 
exceed 80 percent applied to the maximum liability of the Government 
under the letter contract. Separate limits may be specified for separate 
parts of the work.

    (l) Progress payments made under this letter contract shall, unless 
previously liquidated under paragraph (b) of this clause, be liquidated 
under the following procedures:
    (1) If this letter contract is superseded by a definitive contract, 
unliquidated progress payments made under this letter contract shall be 
liquidated by deducting the amount from the first progress or other 
payments made under the definitive contract.
    (2) If this letter contract is not superseded by a definite contract 
calling for the furnishing of all or part of the articles or services 
covered under the letter contract, unliquidated progress payments made 
under the letter contract shall be liquidated by deduction from the 
amount payable under the Termination clause.
    (3) If this letter contract is partly terminated and partly 
superseded by a contract, the Government shall allocate the unliquidated 
progress payments to the terminated and unterminated portions as the 
Government deems equitable, and shall liquidate each portion under the 
relevant procedure in subparagraphs (l)(1) and (l)(2) of this clause.
    (4) If the method of liquidating progress payments provided in this 
clause does not result in full liquidation, the Contractor shall 
immediately pay the unliquidated balance to the Government on demand.
    (m) The amount of unliquidated progress payments shall not exceed . 
. . . (specify dollar amount).

[[Page 231]]

the Government under this contract (net of any applicable tax credit 
under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 1481)) shall bear simple 
interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of 
becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established 
by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in Section 12 of the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-563), which is applicable to 
the period in which the amount becomes due, as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this clause, and then at the rate applicable for each six-month 
period as fixed by the Secretary until the amount is paid.
    (b) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:
    (1) The date fixed under this contract.
    (2) The date of the first written demand for payment consistent with 
this contract, including any demand resulting from a default 
termination.
    (3) The date the Government transmits to the Contractor a proposed

before the funds are available:

                     Availability of Funds (Apr 1984)

    Funds are not presently available for this contract. The 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the 
availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract 
purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government 
for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the 
Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives 
notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the 
Contracting Officer.

Sec. 52.232-20  Limitation of Cost.

    As prescribed in 32.705-2(a), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts if a fully funded cost-reimbursement 
contract is contemplated, except those for consolidated facilities, 
facilities acquisition, or facilities use, whether or not the contract 
provides for payment of a fee. The 60-day period may be varied from 30 
to 90 days and the 75 percent from 75 to 85 percent. Task Order or other 
appropriate designation may be substituted for Schedule wherever that 
word appears in the clause.

                      Limitation of Cost (Apr 1984)

    (a) The parties estimate that performance of this contract, 
exclusive of any fee, will not cost the Government more than (1) the 
estimated cost specified in the Schedule or, (2) if this is a cost-
sharing contract, the Government's share of the estimated cost specified 
in the Schedule. The Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to 
perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under 
this contract within the estimated cost, which, if this is a cost-
sharing contract, includes both the Government's and the Contractor's 
share of the cost.

[[Page 232]]

    (b) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
whenever it has reason to believe that--
    (1) The costs the Contractor expects to incur under this contract in 
the next 60 days, when added to all costs previously incurred, will 
exceed 75 percent of the estimated cost specified in the Schedule; or
    (2) The total cost for the performance of this contract, exclusive 
of any fee, will be either greater or substantially less than had been 
previously estimated.
    (c) As part of the notification, the Contractor shall provide the 
Contracting Officer a revised estimate of the total cost of performing 
this contract.
    (d) Except as required by other provisions of this contract, 
specifically citing and stated to be an exception to this clause--
    (1) The Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for 
costs incurred in excess of (i) the estimated cost specified in the 
Schedule or, (ii) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the estimated cost 
to the Government specified in the Schedule; and
    (2) The Contractor is not obligated to continue performance under 
this contract (including actions under the Termination clause of this 
contract) or otherwise incur costs in excess of the estimated cost 
specified in the Schedule, until the Contracting Officer (i) notifies 
the Contractor in writing that the estimated cost has been increased and 
(ii) provides a revised estimated total cost of performing this 
contract. If this is a cost-sharing contract, the increase shall be 
allocated in accordance with the formula specified in the Schedule.
    (e) No notice, communication, or representation in any form other 
than that specified in subparagraph (d)(2) above, or from any person 
other than the Contracting Officer, shall affect this contract's 
estimated cost to the Government. In the absence of the specified 
notice, the Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for 
any costs in excess of the estimated cost or, if this is a cost-sharing 
contract, for any costs in excess of the estimated cost to the 
Government specified in the Schedule, whether those excess costs were 
incurred during the course of the contract or as a result of 
termination.
    (f) If the estimated cost specified in the Schedule is increased, 
any costs the Contractor incurs before the increase that are in excess 
of the previously estimated cost shall be allowable to the same extent 
as if incurred afterward, unless the Contracting Officer issues a 
termination or other notice directing that the increase is solely to 
cover termination or other specified expenses.
    (g) Change orders shall not be considered an authorization to exceed 
the estimated cost to the Government specified in the Schedule, unless 
they contain a statement increasing the estimated cost.
    (h) If this contract is terminated or the estimated cost is not 
increased, the Government and the Contractor shall negotiate an 
equitable distribution of all property produced or purchased under the 
contract, based upon the share of costs incurred by each.

    As prescribed in 32.705-2(b), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts for consolidated facilities, facilities 
acquisition, or facilities use (see 45.301):

                Limitation of Cost (Facilities) (Apr 1984)

    (a) The parties estimate that performance of this contract will not 
cost the Government more than the estimated cost specified in the 
Schedule. The Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the 
work specified in the Schedule within the estimated cost.
    (b) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
whenever it has reason to believe that--
    (1) The costs that the Contractor expects to incur under this 
contract in the next 30 days, when added to all costs previously 
incurred, will exceed 85 percent of the estimated cost specified in the 
Schedule; or
    (2) The total cost to the Government for the performance of this 
contract will be either greater or substantially less than had 
previously been estimated.
    (c) As part of the notification, the Contractor shall provide the 
Contracting Officer a revised estimate of the total cost of performing 
this contract.
    (d) Except as required by other provisions of this contract, 
specifically citing and stated to be an exception to this clause--
    (1) The Government is not obligated to reimburse the contractor for 
costs incurred in excess of the estimated cost specified in the 
Schedule; and
    (2) The Contractor is not obligated to continue performance under 
this contract (including actions under the Termination clause of this 
contract) or otherwise incur costs in excess of the estimated cost 
specified in the Schedule, until the Contracting Officer (i) notifies 
the Contractor in writing that the estimated cost has been increased and 
(ii) provides a revised estimated total cost of performing this 
contract.
    (e) No notice, communication, or representation in any form other 
than that specified in subparagraph (d)(2) above, or from any person 
other than the Contracting Officer, shall affect this contract's 
estimated cost to the Government. In the absence of the specified 
notice, the Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for 
any costs in

[[Page 233]]

excess of the estimated cost, whether those excess costs were incurred 
during the course of the contract or as a result of termination.
    (f) If the estimated cost specified in the Schedule is increased, 
any costs the Contractor incurs before the increase that are in excess 
of the previously estimated cost shall be allowable to the same extent 
as if incurred afterward, unless the Contracting Officer issues a 
termination or other notice directing that the increase is solely to 
cover termination or other specified expenses.
    (g) Change orders shall not be considered an authorization to exceed 
the estimated cost to the Government specified in the Schedule, unless 
they contain a statement increasing the estimated cost.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 52.232-22  Limitation of Funds.

    As prescribed in 32.705-2(c), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts if an incrementally funded cost-
reimbursement contract is contemplated. The 60-day period may be varied 
from 30 to 90 days and the 75 percent from 75 to 85 percent. Task Order 
or other appropriate designation may be substituted for Schedule 
wherever that word appears in the clause.

                      Limitation of Funds (Apr 1984)

    (a) The parties estimate that performance of this contract will not 
cost the Government more than (1) the estimated cost specified in the 
Schedule or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the Government's 
share of the estimated cost specified in the Schedule. The Contractor 
agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the 
Schedule and all obligations under this contract within the estimated 
cost, which, if this is a cost-sharing contract, includes both the 
Government's and the Contractor's share of the cost.
    (b) The Schedule specifies the amount presently available for 
payment by the Government and allotted to this contract, the items 
covered, the Government's share of the cost if this is a cost-sharing 
contract, and the period of performance it is estimated the allotted 
amount will cover. The parties contemplate that the Government will 
allot additional funds incrementally to the contract up to the full 
estimated cost to the Government specified in the Schedule, exclusive of 
any fee. The Contractor agrees to perform, or have performed, work on 
the contract up to the point at which the total amount paid and payable 
by the Government under the contract approximates but does not exceed 
the total amount actually allotted by the Government to the contract.
    (c) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
whenever it has reason to believe that the costs it expects to incur 
under this contract in the next 60 days, when added to all costs 
previously incurred, will exceed 75 percent of (1) the total amount so 
far allotted to the contract by the Government or, (2) if this is a 
cost-sharing contract, the amount then allotted to the contract by the 
Government plus the Contractor's corresponding share. The notice shall 
state the estimated amount of additional funds required to continue 
performance for the period specified in the Schedule.
    (d) Sixty days before the end of the period specified in the 
Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing 
of the estimated amount of additional funds, if any, required to 
continue timely performance under the contract or for any further period 
specified in the Schedule or otherwise agreed upon, and when the funds 
will be required.
    (e) If, after notification, additional funds are not allotted by the 
end of the period specified in the Schedule or another agreed-upon date, 
upon the Contractor's written request the Contracting Officer will 
terminate this contract on that date in accordance with the provisions 
of the Termination clause of this contract. If the Contractor estimates 
that the funds available will allow it to continue to discharge its 
obligations beyond that date, it may specify a later date in its 
request, and the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract on that 
later date.
    (f) Except as required by other provisions of this contract, 
specifically citing and stated to be an exception to this clause--
    (1) The Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for 
costs incurred in excess of the total amount allotted by the Government 
to this contract; and
    (2) The Contractor is not obligated to continue performance under 
this contract (including actions under the Termination clause of this 
contract) or otherwise incur costs in excess of (i) the amount then 
allotted to the contract by the Government or, (ii) if this is a cost-
sharing contract, the amount then allotted by the Government to the 
contract plus the Contractor's corresponding share, until the 
Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the amount 
allotted by the Government has been increased and specifies an increased 
amount, which shall then constitute the total amount allotted by the 
Government to this contract.
    (g) The estimated cost shall be increased to the extent that (1) the 
amount allotted by the Government or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing 
contract, the amount then allotted by the Government to the contract 
plus the Contractor's corresponding share, exceeds the estimated cost 
specified in the Schedule.

[[Page 234]]

If this is a cost-sharing contract, the increase shall be allocated in 
accordance with the formula specified in the Schedule.
    (h) No notice, communication, or representation in any form other 
than that specified in subparagraph (f)(2) above, or from any person 
other than the Contracting Officer, shall affect the amount allotted by 
the Government to this contract. In the absence of the specified notice, 
the Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for any 
costs in excess of the total amount allotted by the Government to this 
contract, whether incurred during the course of the contract or as a 
result of termination.
    (i) When and to the extent that the amount allotted by the 
Government to the contract is increased, any costs the Contractor incurs 
before the increase that are in excess of (1) the amount previously 
allotted by the Government or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, 
the amount previously allotted by the Government to the contract plus 
the Contractor's corresponding share, shall be allowable to the same 
extent as if incurred afterward, unless the Contracting Officer issues a 
termination or other notice and directs that the increase is solely to 
cover termination or other specified expenses.
    (j) Change orders shall not be considered an authorization to exceed 
the amount allotted by the Government specified in the Schedule, unless 
they contain a statement increasing the amount allotted.
    (k) Nothing in this clause shall affect the right of the Government 
to terminate this contract. If this contract is terminated, the 
Government and the Contractor shall negotiate an equitable distribution 
of all property produced or purchased under the contract, based upon the 
share of costs incurred by each.
    (l) If the Government does not allot sufficient funds to allow 
completion of the work, the Contractor is entitled to a percentage of 
the fee specified in the Schedule equalling the percentage of completion 
of the work contemplated by this contract.

Sec. 52.232-23  Assignment of Claims.

    As prescribed in 32.806(a)(1), insert the following clause:

                     Assignment of Claims (Jan 1986)

    (a) The Contractor, under the Assignment of Claims Act, as amended, 
31 U.S.C. 3727, 41 U.S.C. 15 (hereafter referred to as the Act), may

more parties participating in the financing of this contract.
    (c) The Contractor shall not furnish or disclose to any assignee 
under this contract any classified document (including this contract) or

Officer authorizes such action in writing.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If a no-setoff commitment is to be included 
in the contract (see 32.801 and 32.803(d)), add the following sentence 
at the end of paragraph (a) of the basic clause:
    Unless otherwise stated in this contract, payments to an assignee of 
any amounts due or to become due under this contract shall not, to the 
extent specified in the Act, be subject to reduction or setoff.

Sec. 52.232-25  Prompt payment.

    As prescribed in 32.908(c), insert the following clause:

    (a) As authorized in 32.905(a)(1)(ii), the Contracting Officer may 
modify the date in subdivision (a)(6)(i) of this clause to specify a 
period longer than 7 days for constructive acceptance, if required to 
afford the Government a reasonable opportunity to inspect and test the 
property furnished or evaluate the services performed, except in the 
case of a contract for the procurement of a brand-name commercial item 
for authorized resale.

[[Page 235]]

    (b) As prescribed in 32.906(a) and only as allowed under agency 
policies and procedures, the Contracting Officer may insert in paragraph 
(b) of the clause a period shorter than 30 days (but not less than 7 
days) for making contract financing payments.

                        Prompt Payment (Mar 1994)

    Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the 
Government will make invoice payments and contract financing payments 
under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. Payment shall 
be considered as being made on the day a check is dated or an electronic 
funds transfer is made. Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in 
32.902. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless 
otherwise specified.
    (a) Invoice Payments (1) For purposes of this clause, invoice 
payment means a Government disbursement of monies to a Contractor under 
a contract or other authorization for supplies or services accepted by 
the Government. This includes payments for partial deliveries that have 
been accepted by the Government and final cost or fee payments where 
amounts owed have been settled between the Government and the 
Contractor.
    (2) Except as indicated in subparagraph (a)(3) and paragraph (c) of 
this clause, the due date for making invoice payments by the designated 
payment office shall be the later of the following two events:
    (i) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a 
proper invoice from the Contractor.
    (ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered 
or services performed by the Contractor. On a final invoice where the 
payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance 
shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the contract 
settlement. However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate 
the invoice with the actual date of receipt, the invoice payment due 
date shall be deemed to be the 30th day after the date the Contractor's 
invoice is dated, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no 
disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with 
contract requirements.
    (3) The due date on contracts for meat, meat food products, or fish; 
contracts for perishable agricultural commodities, contracts for dairy 
products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible 
fats or oils, and contracts not requiring the submission of an invoice 
shall be as follows:
    (i) The due date for meat and meat food products, as defined in 
section 2(a) (3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182 
(3)) and further defined in Pub. L. 98-181 to include any edible fresh 
or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh 
eggs, and any perishable egg product, will be as close as possible to, 
but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.
    (ii) The due date for fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 
204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 
4003(3)), will be as close as possible to, but not later than, the 
seventh day after product delivery.
    (iii) The due date for perishable agricultural commodities, as 
defined in Section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act 
of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(44)), will be as close as possible to, but not 
later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is 
specified in the contract.
    (iv) The due date for dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) 
of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), 
edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or 
oils, will be as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day 
after the date on which a proper invoice has been received.
    (v) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for 
payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as 
specified in the contract.
    (4) An invoice is the Contractor's bill or written request for 
payment under the contract for supplies delivered or services performed. 
An invoice shall be prepared and submitted to the designated billing 
officer specified in the contract. A proper invoice must include the 
items listed in subdivisions (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(viii) of this 
clause. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, then the 
Contractor will be notified of the defect within 7 days after receipt of 
the invoice at the designated billing office (3 days for meat, meat food 
products, or fish, and 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, 
edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or 
oils). Untimely notification will be taken into account in the 
computation of any interest penalty owed the Contractor in the manner 
described in subparagraph (a)(6) of this clause.
    (i) Name and address of the Contractor.
    (ii) Invoice date.
    (iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered 
or services performed (including order number and contract line item 
number).
    (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and 
extended price of supplies delivered or services performed.
    (v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of 
shipment, prompt payment discount terms). Bill of lading number and 
weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills of 
lading.
    (vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to 
be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice 
of assignment).

[[Page 236]]

    (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number and mailing 
address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice.
    (viii) Any other information or documentation required by other 
requirements of the contract (such as evidence of shipment).
    (5) An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the 
Government, without request from the contractor, if payment is not made 
by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a) (5) (i) 
through (a) (5) (iii) of this clause are met, if applicable.
    (i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
    (ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation 
authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement over 
quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with any contract term or 
condition.
    (iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due 
the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount 
was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the 
Government and the Contractor.
    (6) The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act 
of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, 
except where the interest penalty is prescribed by other government 
authority. This rate is referred to as the Renegotiation Board Interest 
Rate, and it is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or 
about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on 
the invoice payment amount approved by the Government and be compounded 
in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date 
through the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 
30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment amount and 
be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day 
period. If the designated billing office failed to notify the Contractor 
of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph 
(a)(4) of this clause, then the due date on the corrected invoice will 
be adjusted by subtracting the number of days taken beyond the 
prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the 
Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be 
made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest 
penalties, if requested by the Contractor.
    (i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might 
be due the contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have 
occurred constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in 
this contract) after the contractor delivered the supplies or performed 
the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or 
contractor compliance with a contract provision. In the event that 
actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the 
determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date 
of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, 
however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, 
perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to 
fulfilling their responsibilities.
    (ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the 
determination of an interest penalty:
    (A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices 
submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days (3 days for 
meat, meat food products, or fish, and 5 days for perishable 
agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food 
products prepared from edible fats or oils).
    (B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the 
corrected invoice by the Contractor.
    (iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the 
filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1.00 
need not be paid.
    (iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to 
disagreement between the Government and Contractor over the payment 
amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts 
temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the 
contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be 
payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes.
    (7) An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the 
designated payment office, without request from the contractor, if a 
discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty 
will be calculated as described in subparagraph (a) (6) of this clause 
on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the first 
day after the end of the discount period through the date when the 
contractor is paid.
    (8) If this contract was awarded on or after October 1, 1989, a 
penalty amount, calculated in accordance with regulations issued by the 
Office of Management and Budget, shall be paid in addition to the 
interest penalty amount if the contractor--
    (i) Is owed an interest penalty;
    (ii) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date 
the invoice amount is paid; and
    (iii) Makes a written demand, not later than 40 days after the date 
the invoice amount is paid, that the agency pay such a penalty.
    (b) Contract Financing Payments (1) For purposes of this clause, 
contract financing payment means a Government disbursement of

[[Page 237]]

monies to a Contractor under a contract clause or other authorization 
prior to acceptance of supplies or services by the Government. Contract 
financing payments include advance payments, progress payments based on 
cost under the clause at 52.232-16, Progress Payments, progress payments 
based on a percentage or stage of completion (32.102(e)(1)) other than 
those made under the clause at 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price 
Construction Contracts, or the clause at 52.232-10, Payments Under 
Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer Contracts, and interim payments on cost 
type contracts.
    (2) For contracts that provide for contract financing, requests for 
payment shall be submitted to the designated billing office as specified 
in this contract or as directed by the Contracting Officer. Contract 
financing payments shall be made on the (insert day as prescribed by 
Agency head; if not prescribed, insert 30th day) day after receipt of a 
proper contract financing request by the designated billing office. In 
the event that an audit or other review of a specific financing request 
is required to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the 
contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment 
by the due date specified.
    (3) For advance payments, loans, or other arrangements that do not 
involve recurrent submissions of contract financing requests, payment 
shall be made in accordance with the corresponding contract terms or as 
directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (4) Contract financing payments shall not be assessed an interest 
penalty for payment delays.
    (c) If this contract contains the clause at 5.213-1, Fast Payment 
Procedure, payments will be made within 15 days after the date of 
receipt of the invoice.

modify the date in subdivision (a)(5)(i) of this clause to specify a 
period longer than 7 days for constructive acceptance or constructive 
approval, if required to afford the Government a practicable opportunity 
to inspect and test the property furnished or evaluate the services

funds transfer is made. Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in 
32.902. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless 
otherwise specified.
    (a) Invoice Payments. (1) For purposes of this clause, invoice 
payment means a Government disbursement of monies to a Contractor under 
a contract or other authorization for work or services accepted by the 
Government, payments for partial deliveries that have been accepted by 
the Government, and progress payments based on contracting officer 
approval of the estimated amount and value of work or services 
performed.
    (2) The due date for making invoice payments shall be as described 
in this subparagraph (a)(2).
    (i) The due date for work or services completed by the Contractor 
shall be the later of the following two events:
    (A) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a 
proper invoice from the Contractor.
    (B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services

acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the 
contract settlement.
    (ii) The due date for progress payments shall be the 30th day after 
Government approval of Contractor estimates of work or services 
accomplished.
    (iii) However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate 
the invoice or payment request with the actual date of receipt, the 
payment due date shall be deemed to be the 30th day after the date the 
Contractor's invoice or payment request is dated, provided a proper 
invoice or payment request is received and there is no disagreement over 
quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.
    (3) An invoice is the Contractor's bill or written request for

contract. An invoice shall be prepared and submitted to the designated 
billing office. A proper invoice must include the items listed in 
subdivisions (a)(3)(i) through

7 days after receipt of the invoice at the designated billing office. 
Untimely notification will be taken into account in the computation of 
any interest penalty owed the Contractor in the manner described in 
subparagraph (a)(5) of this clause:
    (i) Name and address of the Contractor.
    (ii) Invoice date.
    (iii) Contract number or other authorization for work or services

    (iv) Description of work or services performed.
    (v) Delivery and payment terms (e.g., prompt payment discount

    (vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to 
be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice 
of assignment).
    (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing 
address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice.
    (viii) Any other information or documentation required by the 
contract.
    (4) An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the 
designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if 
payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in 
subdivisions (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this clause are met, if 
applicable.
    (i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
    (ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation 
authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement over 
quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with any contract term or 
condition, or requested progress payment amount.
    (iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due 
the Contractor for work or services performed, the amount was not 
subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government 
and the Contractor.
    (5) The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act 
of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day prescribed by other 
governmental authority. This rate is referred to as the Renegotiation 
Board Interest Rate, and it is published in the Federal Register 
semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty 
shall accrue daily on the invoice payment amount approved by the 
Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the 
first day after the due date through the payment date. That is, interest 
accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved 
invoice payment amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid 
in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing office failed 
to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods 
prescribed in subparagraph (a)(3) of this clause, then the due date on 
the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting the number of days 
taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest 
penalty owed the Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. 
Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in 
calculating interest penalties, if requested by the Contractor.
    (i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might 
be due the Contractor, Government acceptance or approval shall be deemed 
to have occurred constructively as shown in subdivisions (a)(5)(i) (A) 
and (B) of this clause. In the event that actual acceptance or approval 
occurs within the constructive acceptance or approval period, the 
determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date 
of acceptance or approval. Constructive acceptance or constructive 
approval requirements do not apply if there is a disagreement over 
quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with a contract provision, or 
requested progress payment amounts. These requirements also do not 
compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve 
Contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make 
payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
    (A) For work or services completed by the Contractor, Government 
acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th 
day after the Contractor has completed the work or services in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.
    (B) For progress payments, Government approval shall be deemed to 
have occurred on the 7th day after Contractor estimates have been 
received by the designated billing office.
    (ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the 
determination of an interest penalty:
    (A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices 
submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days.
    (B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the 
corrected invoice by the Contractor.
    (iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the 
filing of a claims for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes, or for more than 1 years. Interest penalties of less than 
$1.00 need not be paid.
    (iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to 
disagreement between the Government and Contractor over the payment 
amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts 
temporarily withheld or retained in accordance

[[Page 239]]

with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any 
interest that may be payable will be resolved in accordance with the 
clause at 52.233-1, Disputes.
    (6) An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the 
designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if a 
discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty 
will be calculated on the amount of discount taken for the period 
beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period 
through the date when the Contractor is paid.
    (7) If this contract was awarded on or after October 1, 1989, a 
penalty amount, calculated in accordance with regulations issued by the 
Office of Management and Budget, shall be paid in addition to the 
interest penalty amount if the Contractor--
    (i) Is owed an interest penalty;
    (ii) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date 
the invoice amount is paid; and
    (iii) Makes a written demand, not later than 40 days after the date 
the invoice amount is paid, that the agency pay such a penalty.
    (b) Contract Financing Payments. (1) For purposes of this clause, if 
applicable, contract financing payment, means a Government disbursement 
of monies to a Contractor under a contract clause or other authorization 
prior to acceptance of supplies or services by the Government, other 
than progress payments based on estimates of amount and value of work 
performed. Contract financing payments include advance payments.
    (2) If this contract provides for contract financing, requests for 
payment shall be submitted to the designated billing office as specified 
in this contract or as directed by the Contracting Officer. Contract 
financing payments shall be made on the (insert day as prescribed by 
Agency head; if not prescribed, insert 30th day) day after receipt of a 
proper contract financing request by the designated billing office. In 
the event that an audit or other review of a specific financing request 
is required to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the 
contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment 
by the due date specified. For advance payments, loan, or other 
arrangements that do not involve recurrent submissions of contract 
financing request, payment shall be made in accordance with the 
corresponding contract terms or as directed by the Contracting Officer. 
Contract financing payments shall not be assessed an interest penalty 
for payment delays.

<R05>
Sec. 52.232-27  Prompt payment for construction contracts.

    As prescribed in 32.908(b), insert the following clause:

    (a) As authorized in 32.905(c)(1), the Contracting Officer may 
modify the date in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(A) of the clause to specify a 
period longer than 14 days if required to afford the Government a 
reasonable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determine 
the adequacy of the Contractor's performance under the contract.
    (b) As authorized in 32.905(c)(5), the Contracting Officer may 
modify the date in subdivision (a)(4)(i) of the clause to specify a 
period longer than 7 days for constructive acceptance or constructive 
approval if required to afford the Government a reasonable opportunity 
to inspect and test the property furnished or evaluate the services 
performed.
    (c) If applicable, as authorized in 32.906(a) and only as allowed 
under agency policies and procedures, the Contracting Officer may insert 
in paragraph (b) of the clause a period shorter than 30 days (but not 
less than 7 days) for making contract financing payments.

          Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts (Mar 1994)

    Notwithstanding any other payment terms in this contract, the 
Government will make invoice payments and contract financing payments 
under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. Payment shall 
be considered as being made on the day a check is dated or an electronic 
funds transfer is made. Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in 
32.902. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless 
otherwise specified.
    (a) Invoice Payments. (1) For purposes of this clause, there are 
several types of invoice payments which may occur under this contract, 
as follows:
    (i) Progress payments, if provided for elsewhere in this contract, 
based on Contracting Officer approval of the estimated amount and value 
of work or services performed, including payments for reaching 
milestones in any project:
    (A) The due date for making such payments shall be 14 days after 
receipt of the payment request by the designated billing office. 
However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate the payment 
request with the actual date of receipt, the payment due date shall be 
deemed to be the 14th day after the date the Contractor's payment 
request is dated, provided a proper payment request is received and 
there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor 
compliance with contract requirements.
    (B) The due date for payment of any amounts retained by the 
Contracting Officer

[[Page 240]]

in accordance with the clause at 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price 
Construction Contracts, shall be as specified in the contract or, if not 
specified, 30 days after approval for release to the Contractor by the 
Contracting Officer.
    (ii) Final payments based on completion and acceptance of all work 
and presentation of release of all claims against the Government arising 
by virtue of the contract, and payments for partial deliveries that have 
been accepted by the Government (e.g., each separate building, public 
work, or other division of the contract for which the price is stated 
separately in the contract):
    (A) The due date for making such payments shall be either the 30th 
day after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper invoice 
from the Contractor, or the 30th day after Government acceptance of the 
work or services completed by the Contractor, whichever is later. 
However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice 
with the date of actual receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be 
deemed to be the 30th day after the date the Contractor's invoice is 
dated, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no 
disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with 
contract requirements.
    (B) On a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to 
contract settlement actions (e.g., release of claims), acceptance shall 
be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the contract 
settlement.
    (2) An invoice is the Contractor's bill or written request for 
payment under the contract for work or services performed under the 
contract. An invoice shall be prepared and submitted to the designated 
billing office. A proper invoice must include the items listed in 
subdivisions (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(ix) of this clause. If the invoice 
does not comply with these requirements, the Contractor will be notified 
of the defect within 7 days after receipt of the invoice at the 
designated billing office. Untimely notification will be taken into 
account in the computation of any interest penalty owed the Contractor 
in the manner described in subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause:
    (i) Name and address of the Contractor.
    (ii) Invoice date.
    (iii) Contract number of other authorization for work or services 
performed (including order number and contract line item number).
    (iv) Description of work or services performed.
    (v) Delivery and payment terms (e.g., prompt payment discount 
terms).
    (vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to 
be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice 
of assignment).
    (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing 
address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice.
    (viii) For payments described in subdivision (a)(1)(i) of this 
clause, substantiation of the amounts requested and certification in 
accordance with the requirements of the clause at 52.232-5, Payments 
Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts.
    (ix) Any other information or documentation required by the 
contract.
    (3) An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the 
designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if 
payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in 
subdivisions (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(iii) of this clause are met, if 
applicable.
    (i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
    (ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation 
authorizing payment was processed and there was no disagreement over 
quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with any contract term or 
condition, or requested progress payment amount.
    (iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due 
the Contractor for work or services performed, the amount was not 
subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government 
and the Contractor.
    (4) The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act 
of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, 
except where the interest penalty is prescribed by other governmental 
authority. This rate is referred to as the Renegotiation Board Interest 
Rate, and it is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or 
about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on 
the invoice payment amount approved by the Government and be compounded 
in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date 
through the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 
30-day period will be added to the approved invoice payment amount and 
be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day 
period. If the designated billing office failed to notify the Contractor 
of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph 
(a)(2) of this clause, then the due date on the corrected invoice will 
be adjusted by subtracting the number of days taken beyond the 
prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the 
Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be 
made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest 
penalties, if requested by the Contractor.

[[Page 241]]

    (i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might 
be due the Contractor for payments described in subdivision (a)(1)(ii) 
of this clause, Government acceptance or approval shall be deemed to 
have occurred constructively on the 7th day after the Contractor has 
completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the contract. In the event that actual acceptance or 
approval occurs within the constructive acceptance or approval period, 
the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual 
date of acceptance or approval. Constructive acceptance or constructive 
approval requirements do not apply if there is a disagreement over 
quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. 
These requirements also do not compel Government officials to accept 
work or services, approve Contractor estimates, perform contract 
administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their 
responsibilities.
    (ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the 
determination of an interest penalty:
    (A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices 
submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days.
    (B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the 
corrected invoice by the Contractor.
    (iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the 
filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1.00 
need not be paid.
    (iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to 
disagreement between the Government and Contractor over the payment 
amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts 
temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the 
contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be 
payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, 
Disputes.
    (5) An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the 
designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if a 
discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty 
will be calculated on the amount of discount taken for the period 
beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period 
through the date when the Contractor is paid.
    (6) If this contract was awarded on or after October 1, 1989, a 
penalty amount, calculated in accordance with regulations issued by the 
Office of Management and Budget, shall be paid in addition to the 
interest penalty amount if the Contractor--
    (i) Is owed an interest penalty;
    (ii) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date 
the invoice amount is paid; and
    (iii) Makes a written demand, not later than 40 days after the date 
the invoice amount is paid, that the agency pay such a penalty.
    (b) Contract Financing Payments. (1) For purposes of this clause, if 
applicable, contract financing payments means a Government disbursement 
of monies to a Contractor under a contract clause or other authorization 
prior to acceptance of supplies or services by the Government, other 
than progress payments based on estimates of amount and value of work 
performed. Contract financing payments include advance payments and 
interim payments under cost-type contracts.
    (2) If this contract provides for contract financing, requests for 
payment shall be submitted to the designated billing office as specified 
in this contract or as directed by the Contracting Officer. Contract 
financing payments shall be made on the (insert day as prescribed by 
Agency head; if not prescribed, insert 30th day) day after receipt of a 
proper contract financing request by the designated billing office. In 
the event that an audit or other review of a specific financing request 
is required to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the 
contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment 
by the due date specified. For advance payments, loans, or other 
arrangements that do not involve recurrent submissions of contract 
financing requests, payment shall be made in accordance with the 
corresponding contract terms or as directed by the Contracting Officer. 
Contract financing payments shall not be assessed an interest penalty 
for payment dalays.
    (c) The Contractor shall include in each subcontract for property or 
services (including a material supplier) for the purpose of performing 
this contract the following:
    (1) A payment clause which obligates the Contractor to pay the 
subcontractor for satisfactory performance under its subcontract not 
later than 7 days from receipt of payment out of such amounts as are 
paid to the Contractor under the contract.
    (2) An interest penalty clause obligates the Contractor to pay to 
the subcontractor an interest penalty for each payment not made in 
accordance with the payment clause--
    (i) For the period beginning on the day after the required payment 
date and ending on the date on which payment of the amount due is made; 
and
    (ii) Computed at the rate of interest established by the Secretary 
of the Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest 
payments under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 
U.S.C. 611) in effect at the time the Contractor accrues the obligations 
to pay an interest penalty.
    (3) A clause requiring each subcontractor to include a payment 
clause and an interest penalty clause conforming to the standards set 
forth in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of

[[Page 242]]

this clause in each of its subcontracts, and to require each of its 
subcontractors to include such clauses in their subcontracts with each 
lower-tier subcontractor or supplier.
    (d) The clauses required by paragraph (c) of this clause shall not 
be constructed to impair the right of Contractor or a subcontractor at 
any tier to negotiate, and to include in their subcontract, provisions 
which--
    (1) Permit the Contractor of a subcontractor to retain (without 
cause) a specified percentage of each progress payment otherwise due to 
a subcontractor for satisfactory performance under the subcontract 
without incurring any obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty, 
in accordance with terms and conditions agreed to by the parties to the 
subcontract, giving such recognition as the parties deem appropriate to 
the ability of a subcontractor to furnish a performance bond and a 
payment bond;
    (2) Permit the Contractor or subcontractor to make determination 
that part or all of the subcontractor's request for payment may be 
withheld in accordance with the subcontract agreement; and
    (3) Permit such withholding without incurring any obligation to pay 
a late payment penalty if--
    (i) A notice conforming to the standards of paragraph (g) of this 
clause has been previously furnished to the subcontractor, and
    (ii) A copy of any notice issued by a Contractor pursuant to 
subdivision (d)(3)(i) of this clause has been furnished to the 
Contracting Officer.
    (e) If a Contractor, after making a request for payment to the 
Government but before making a payment to a subcontractor for the 
subcontractor's performance covered by the payment request, discovers 
that all or a portion of the payment otherwise due such subcontractor is 
subject to withholding from the subcontractor in accordance with the 
subcontract agreement, then the Contractor shall--
    (1) Furnish to the subcontractor a notice conforming to the 
standards of paragraph (g) of this clause as soon as practicable upon 
ascertaining the cause giving rise to a withholding, but prior to the 
due date for subcontractor payment;
    (2) Furnish to the Contracting Officer, as soon as practicable, a 
copy of the notice furnished to the subcontractor pursuant to 
subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause;
    (3) Reduce the subcontractor's progress payment by an amount not to 
exceed the amount specified in the notice of withholding furnished under 
subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause;
    (4) Pay the subcontractor as soon as practicable after the 
correction of the identified subcontract performance deficiency, and--
    (i) Make such payment within--
    (A) Seven days after correction of the identified subcontract 
performance deficiency (unless the funds therefor must be recovered from 
the Government because of a reduction under subdivision (e)(5)(i)) of 
this clause; or
    (B) Seven days after the Contractor recovers such funds from the 
Government; or
    (ii) Incur an obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty 
computed at the rate of interest established by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest payments 
under section 12 of the Contracts Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) 
in effect at the time the Contractor accrues the obligation to pay an 
interest penalty;
    (5) Notify the Contracting Officer upon--
    (i) Reduction of the amount of any subsequent certified application 
for payment; or
    (ii) Payment to the subcontractor of any withheld amounts of a 
progress payment, specifying--
    (A) The amounts withheld under subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause; 
and
    (B) The dates that such withholding began and ended; and
    (6) Be obligated to pay to the Government an amount equal to 
interest on the withheld payments (computed in the manner provided in 31 
U.S.C. 3903(c)(1)), from the 8th day after receipt of the withheld 
amounts from the Government until--
    (i) The day the identified subcontractor performance deficiency is 
corrected; or
    (ii) The date that any subsequent payment is reduced under 
subdivision (e)(5)(i) of this clause.
    (f)(1) If a Contractor, after making payment to a first-tier 
subcontractor, receives from a supplier or subcontractor of the first-
tier subcontractor (hereafter referred to as a second-tier 
subcontractor) a written notice in accordance with section 2 of the Act 
of August 24, 1935 (40 U.S.C. 270b, Miller Act), asserting a deficiency 
in such first-tier subcontractor's performance under the contract for 
which the Contractor may be utlimately liable, and the Contractor 
determines that all or a portion of future payments otherwise due such 
first-tier subcontractor is subject to withholding in accordance with 
the subcontract agreement, then the Contractor may, without incurring an 
obligation to pay an interest penalty under subparagraph (e)(6) of this 
clause--
    (i) Furnish to the first-tier subcontractor a notice conforming to 
the standards of paragraph (g) of this clause as soon as practicable 
upon making such determination; and
    (ii) Withhold from the first-tier subcontractor's next available 
progress payment or payments an amount not to exceed the amount 
specified in the notice of withholding furnished under subdivision 
(f)(1)(i) of this clause.
    (2) As soon as practicable, but not later than 7 days after receipt 
of satisfactory written notification that the identified subcontract 
performance deficiency has been

[[Page 243]]

corrected, the Contractor shall pay the amount withheld under 
subdivision (f)(1)(ii) of this clause to such first-tier subcontractor, 
or shall incur an obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty to 
such first-tier subcontractor computed at the rate of interest 
established by the Secretary of the Treasury, and published in the 
Federal Register, for interest payments under section 12 of the 
Contracts Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) in effect at the time the 
Contractor accrues the obligation to pay an interest penalty.
    (g) A written notice of any withholding shall be issued to a 
subcontractor (with a copy to the Contracting Officer of any such notice 
issued by the Contractor), specifying--
    (1) The amount to be withheld;
    (2) The specific causes for the withholding under the terms of the 
subcontract; and
    (3) The remedial actions to be taken by the subcontractor in order 
to receive payment of the amounts withheld.
    (h) The Contractor may not request payment from the Government of 
any amount withheld or retained in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
clause until such time as the Contractor has determined and certified to 
the Contracting Officer that the subcontractor is entitled to the 
payment of such amount.
    (i) A dispute between the Contractor and subcontractor relating to 
the amount or entitlement of a subcontractor to a payment or a late 
payment interest penalty under a clause included in the subcontract 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause does not constitute a dispute 
to which the United States is a party. The United States may not be 
interpleaded in any judicial or administrative proceeding involving such 
a dispute.
    (j) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this clause, this clause 
shall not limit or impair any contractual, administrative, or judicial 
remedies otherwise available to the Contractor or a subcontractor in the 
event of a dispute involving late payment or nonpayment by the 
Contractor or deficient subcontract performance or nonperformance by a 
subcontractor.
    (k) The Contractor's obligation to pay an interest penalty to a 
subcontractor pursuant to the clauses included in a subcontract under 
paragraph (c) of this clause shall not be construed to be an obligation 
of the United States for such interest penalty. A cost reimbursement 
claim may not include any amount for reimbursement of such interest 
penalty.

<R05>
Sec. 52.232-29  Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Items.

    As prescribed in 32.206(b)(2), insert the following clause:

     Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Items (Oct 1995)

    (a) Contractor entitlement to financing payments. The Contractor may 
request, and the Government shall pay, a contract financing payment as 
specified elsewhere in this contract when: the payment requested is 
properly due in accordance with this contract; the supplies deliverable 
or services due under the contract will be delivered or performed in 
accordance with the contract; and there has been no impairment or 
diminution of the Government's security under this contract.
    (b) Special terms regarding termination for cause. If this contract 
is terminated for cause, the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the 
Government the amount of unliquidated contract financing payments. The 
Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the 
Termination for Cause paragraph of the clause at 52.212-4, Contract 
Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items.
    (c) Security for Government financing. In the event the Contractor 
fails to provide adequate security, as required in this contract, no 
financing payment shall be made under this contract. Upon receipt of 
adequate security, financing payments shall be made, including all 
previous payments to which the Contractor is entitled, in accordance 
with the terms of the provisions for contract financing. If at any time 
the Contracting Officer determines that the security provided by the 
Contractor is insufficient, the Contractor shall promptly provide such 
additional security as the Contracting Officer determines necessary. In 
the event the Contractor fails to provide such additional security, the 
Contracting Officer may collect or liquidate such security that has been 
provided and suspend further payments to the Contractor; and the 
Contractor shall repay to the Government the amount of unliquidated 
financing payments as the Contracting Officer at his sole discretion 
deems repayable.
    (d) Reservation of rights. (1) No payment or other action by the 
Government under this clause shall (i) excuse the Contractor from 
performance of obligations under this contract, or (ii) constitute a 
waiver of any of the rights or remedies of the parties under the 
contract.
    (2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause (i) shall 
not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights 
and remedies provided by law or this contract; and (ii) shall not be 
affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any

[[Page 244]]

right, remedy, power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any 
single exercise preclude or impair any further exercise under this 
clause or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the 
Government.
    (e) Content of Contractor's request for financing payment. The 
Contractor's request for financing payment shall contain the following:

payments requested and such other information as is necessary for 
computation of the payment, prepared in accordance with the direction of 
the Contracting Officer.
    (f) Limitation on frequency of financing payments. Contractor 
financing payments shall be provided no more frequently than monthly.

Sec. 52.232-30  Installment Payments for Commercial Items.

    As prescribed in 32.206(g), insert the following clause:

          Installment Payments for Commercial Items (Oct 1995)

    (a) Contractor entitlement to financing payments. The Contractor may 
request, and the Government shall pay, a contract financing installment 
payment as specified in this contract when: the payment requested is 
properly due in accordance with this contract; the supplies deliverable 
or services due under the contract will be delivered or performed in 
accordance with the contract; and there has been no impairment or 
diminution of the Government's security under this contract.
    (b) Computation of amounts. Installment payment financing shall be 
paid to the Contractor when requested for each separately priced unit of 
supply (but not for services) of each contract line item in amounts 
approved by the Contracting Officer pursuant to this clause.
    (1) Number of installment payments for each contract line item. Each 
separately priced unit of each contract line item is authorized a fixed 
number of monthly installment payments. The number of installment 
payments authorized for each unit of a contract line item is equal to 
the number of months from the date of contract award to the date one 
month before the first delivery of the first separately priced unit of 
the contract line item. For example, if the first scheduled delivery of 
any separately priced unit of a contract line item is 9 months after 
award of the contract, all separately priced units of that contract line 
item are authorized 8 installment payments.
    (2) Amount of each installment payment. The amount of each 
installment payment for each separately priced unit of each contract 
line item is equal to 70 percent of the unit price divided by the number 
of installment payments authorized for that unit.
    (3) Date of each installment payment. Installment payments for any 
particular separately priced unit of a contract line item begin the 
number of months prior to the delivery of that unit that are equal to 
the number of installment payments authorized for that unit. For 
example, if 8 installment payments are authorized for each separately 
priced unit of a contract line item, the first installment payment for 
any particular unit of that contract line item would be 8 months before 
the scheduled delivery date for that unit. The last installment payment 
would be 1 month before scheduled delivery of a unit.
    (4) Limitation on payment. Prior to the delivery payment for a 
separately priced unit of a contract line item, the sum of all 
installment payments for that unit shall not exceed 70 percent of the 
price of that unit.
    (c) Contractor request for installment payment. The Contractor may 
submit requests for payment of installment payments not more frequently 
than monthly, in a form and manner acceptable to the Contracting 
Officer. Unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer, all 
installment payments in any month for which payment is being requested 
shall be included in a single request, appropriately itemized and 
totaled.
    (d) Dates for payment. An installment payment under this clause is a 
contract financing payment under the Prompt Payment clause of this 
contract, and except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, 
approved requests shall be paid within 30 days of submittal of a proper 
request for payment.
    (e) Liquidation of installment payments. Installment payments shall 
be liquidated by deducting from the delivery payment of each item the 
total unliquidated amount of installment payments made for that 
separately priced unit of that contract line item. The liquidation 
amounts for each unit of each line item shall be clearly delineated in 
each request for delivery payment submitted by the Contractor.
    (f) Security for installment payment financing. In the event the 
Contractor fails to provide adequate security as required in this 
contract, no financing payment shall be

[[Page 245]]

made under this contract. Upon receipt of adequate security, financing 
payments shall be made, including all previous payments to which the 
Contractor is entitled, in accordance with the terms of the contract. If 
at any time the Contracting Officer determines that the security 
provided by the Contractor is insufficient, the Contractor shall 
promptly provide such additional security as the Contracting Officer 
determines necessary. In the event the Contractor fails to provide such 
additional security, the Contracting Officer may collect or liquidate 
such security that has been provided, and suspend further payments to 
the Contractor; the Contractor shall repay to the Government the amount 
of unliquidated financing payments as the Contracting Officer at his 
sole discretion deems repayable.
    (g) Special terms regarding termination for cause. If this contract 
is terminated for cause, the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the 
Government the amount of unliquidated installment payments. The 
Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the 
Termination for Cause paragraph of the clause at 52.212-4, Contract 
Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items.
    (h) Reservation of rights. (1) No payment, vesting of title under 
this clause, or other action taken by the Government under this clause 
shall (i) excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under 
this contract, or (ii) constitute a waiver of any of the rights or 
remedies of the parties under the contract.
    (2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause (i) shall 
not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights 
and remedies provided by law or this contract, and (ii) shall not be 
affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, 
power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise 
preclude or impair any further exercise under this clause or the 
exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government.
    (i) Content of Contractor's request for installment payment. The 
Contractor's request for installment payment shall contain the 
following:
    (1) The name and address of the Contractor;
    (2) The date of the request for installment payment;
    (3) The contract number and/or other identifier of the contract or 
order under which the request is made; and
    (4) An itemized and totaled statement of the items, installment 
payment amount, and month for which payment is being requested, for each 
separately priced unit of each contract line item.

Sec. 52.232-31  Invitation to Propose Financing Terms.

    As prescribed in 32.205(b) and 32.206, insert the following 
provision:

            Invitation to Propose Financing Terms (Oct 1995)

    (a) The offeror is invited to propose terms under which the 
Government shall make contract financing payments during contract 
performance. The financing terms proposed by the offeror shall be a 
factor in the evaluation of the offeror's proposal. The financing terms 
of the successful offeror and the clause, Terms for Financing of 
Purchases of Commercial Items, at 52.232-29, shall be incorporated in 
any resulting contract.
    (b) The offeror agrees that in the event of any conflict between the 
terms proposed by the offeror and the terms in the clause at 52.232-29, 
Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Items, the terms of the 
clause at 52.232-29 shall govern.
    (c) Because of statutory limitations (10 U.S.C. 2307(f) and 41 
U.S.C. 255(f)), the offeror's proposed financing shall not be acceptable 
if it does not conform to the following limitations:
    (1) Delivery payments shall be made only for supplies delivered and 
accepted, or services rendered and accepted in accordance with the 
payment terms of this contract;
    (2) Contract financing payments shall not exceed 15 percent of the 
contract price in advance of any performance of work under the contract;
    (3) The terms and conditions of the contract financing must be 
appropriate or customary in the commercial marketplace; and
    (4) The terms and conditions of the contract financing must be in 
the best interests of the United States.
    (d) The offeror's proposal of financing terms shall include the 
following:
    (1) The proposed contractual language describing the contract 
financing (see FAR 32.202-2 for appropriate definitions of types of 
payments); and
    (2) A listing of the earliest date and greatest amount at which each 
contract financing payment may be payable and the amount of each 
delivery payment. Any resulting contract shall provide that no contract 
financing payment shall be made at any earlier date or in a greater 
amount than shown in the offeror's listing.
    (e) The offeror's proposed prices and financing terms shall be 
evaluated to determine the cost to the United States of the proposal 
using the interest rate and delivery schedule specified elsewhere in 
this solicitation.

<R05>
Sec. 52.232-32  Performance-Based Payments.

    As prescribed in 32.1005, insert the following clause:

                  Performance-Based Payments (Oct 1995)

    (a) Amount of payments and limitations on payments. Subject to such 
other limitations and conditions as are specified in this contract and 
this clause, the amount of payments and limitations on payments shall be 
specified in the contract's description of the basis for payment.
    (b) Contractor request for performance-based payment. The Contractor 
may submit requests for payment of performance-based payments not more 
frequently than monthly, in a form and manner acceptable to the 
Contracting Officer. Unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting 
Officer, all performance-based payments in any period for which payment 
is being requested shall be included in a single request, appropriately 
itemized and totaled. The Contractor's request shall contain the 
information and certification detailed in paragraphs (l) and (m) of this 
clause.
    (c) Approval and payment of requests. (1) The Contractor shall not 
be entitled to payment of a request for performance-based payment prior 
to successful accomplishment of the event or performance criterion for 
which payment is requested. The Contracting Officer shall determine 
whether the event or performance criterion for which payment is 
requested has been successfully accomplished in accordance with the 
terms of the contract. The Contracting Officer may, at any time, require 
the Contractor to substantiate the successful performance of any event 
or performance criterion which has been or is represented as being 
payable.
    (2) A payment under this performance-based payment clause is a 
contract financing payment under the Prompt Payment clause of this 
contract, and approved requests shall be paid in accordance with the 
prompt payment period and provisions specified for contract financing 
payments by that clause. However, if the Contracting Officer requires 
substantiation as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or 
inquires into the status of an event or performance criterion, or into 
any of the conditions listed in paragraph (e) of this clause, or into 
the Contractor certification, payment is not required, and the prompt 
payment period shall not begin until the Contracting Officer approves 
the request.
    (3) The approval by the Contracting Officer of a request for 
performance-based payment does not constitute an acceptance by the 
Government and does not excuse the Contractor from performance of 
obligations under this contract.
    (d) Liquidation of performance-based payments. (1) Performance-based 
finance amounts paid prior to payment for delivery of an item shall be 
liquidated by deducting a percentage or a designated dollar amount from 
the delivery payment. If the performance-based finance payments are on a 
delivery item basis, the liquidation amount for each such line item 
shall be the percent of that delivery item price that was previously 
paid under performance-based finance payments or the designated dollar 
amount. If the performance-based finance payments are on a whole 
contract basis, liquidation shall be by either predesignated liquidation 
amounts or a liquidation percentage.
    (2) If at any time the amount of payments under this contract 
exceeds any limitation in this contract, the Contractor shall repay to 
the Government the excess. Unless otherwise determined by the 
Contracting Officer, such excess shall be credited as a reduction in the 
unliquidated performance-based payment balance(s), after adjustment of 
invoice payments and balances for any retroactive price adjustments.
    (e) Reduction or suspension of performance-based payments. The 
Contracting Officer may reduce or suspend performance-based payments, 
liquidate performance-based payments by deduction from any payment under 
the contract, or take a combination of these actions after finding upon 
substantial evidence any of the following conditions:
    (1) The Contractor failed to comply with any material requirement of 
this contract (which includes paragraphs (h) and (i) of this clause).
    (2) Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's 
(i) failure to make progress, or (ii) unsatisfactory financial 
condition.
    (3) The Contractor is delinquent in payment of any subcontractor or 
supplier under this contract in the ordinary course of business.
    (f)(1) Title. Title to the property described in this paragraph (f) 
shall vest in the Government. Vestiture shall be immediately upon the 
date of the first performance-based payment under this contract, for 
property acquired or produced before that date. Otherwise, vestiture 
shall occur when the property is or should have been allocable or 
properly chargeable to this contract.
    (2) Property, as used in this clause, includes all of the following 
described items acquired or produced by the Contractor that are or 
should be allocable or properly chargeable to this contract under sound 
and generally accepted accounting principles and practices:
    (i) Parts, materials, inventories, and work in process;

[[Page 247]]

    (ii) Special tooling and special test equipment to which the 
Government is to acquire title under any other clause of this contract;
    (iii) Nondurable (i.e., noncapital) tools, jigs, dies, fixtures, 
molds, patterns, taps, gauges, test equipment and other similar 
manufacturing aids, title to which would not be obtained as special 
tooling under subparagraph (f)(2)(ii) of this clause; and
    (iv) Drawings and technical data, to the extent the Contractor or 
subcontractors are required to deliver them to the Government by other 
clauses of this contract.
    (3) Although title to property is in the Government under this 
clause, other applicable clauses of this contract (e.g., the termination 
or special tooling clauses) shall determine the handling and disposition 
of the property.
    (4) The Contractor may sell any scrap resulting from production 
under this contract, without requesting the Contracting Officer's 
approval, provided that any significant reduction in the value of the 
property to which the Government has title under this clause is reported 
in writing to the Contracting Officer.
    (5) In order to acquire for its own use or dispose of property to 
which title is vested in the Government under this clause, the 
Contractor must obtain the Contracting Officer's advance approval of the 
action and the terms. If approved, the basis for payment (the events or 
performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed 
to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable 
(if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the 
Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (g) Risk of loss. Before delivery to and acceptance by the 
Government, the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the 
title to which vests in the Government under this clause, except to the 
extent the Government expressly assumes the risk. If any property is 
damaged, lost, stolen, or destroyed, the basis of payment (the events or 
performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed 
to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable 
(if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the 
Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (h) Records and controls. The Contractor shall maintain records and 
controls adequate for administration of this clause. The Contractor 
shall have no entitlement to performance-based payments during any time 
the Contractor's records or controls are determined by the Contracting 
Officer to be inadequate for administration of this clause.
    (i) Reports and Government access. The Contractor shall promptly 
furnish reports, certificates, financial statements, and other pertinent 
information requested by the Contracting Officer for the administration 
of this clause and to determine that an event or other criterion 
prompting a financing payment has been successfully accomplished. The 
Contractor shall give the Government reasonable opportunity to examine 
and verify the Contractor's records and to examine and verify the 
Contractor's performance of this contract for administration of this 
clause.
    (j) Special terms regarding default. If this contract is terminated 
under the Default clause, (1) the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to 
the Government the amount of unliquidated performance-based payments, 
and (2) title shall vest in the Contractor, on full liquidation of all 
performance-based payments, for all property for which the Government 
elects not to require delivery under the Default clause of this 
contract. The Government shall be liable for no payment except as 
provided by the Default clause.
    (k) Reservation of rights. (1) No payment or vesting of title under 
this clause shall (i) excuse the Contractor from performance of 
obligations under this contract, or (ii) constitute a waiver of any of 
the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract.
    (2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause (i) shall 
not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights 
and remedies provided by law or this contract, and (ii) shall not be 
affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, 
power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise 
preclude or impair any further exercise under this clause or the 
exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government.
    (l) Content of Contractor's request for performance-based payment. 
The Contractor's request for performance-based payment shall contain the 
following:
    (1) The name and address of the Contractor;
    (2) The date of the request for performance-based payment;
    (3) The contract number and/or other identifier of the contract or 
order under which the request is made;
    (4) Such information and documentation as is required by the 
contract's description of the basis for payment; and
    (5) A certification by a Contractor official authorized to bind the 
Contractor, as specified in paragraph (m) of this clause.
    (m) Content of Contractor's certification. As required in paragraph 
(l)(5) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the following 
certification in each request for performance-based payment:
    I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that--
    (1) This request for performance-based payment is true and correct; 
this request (and

[[Page 248]]

attachments) has been prepared from the books and records of the 
Contractor, in accordance with the contract and the instructions of the 
Contracting Officer;
    (2) (Except as reported in writing on ______________), all payments 
to subcontractors and suppliers under this contract have been paid, or 
will be paid, currently, when due in the ordinary course of business;
    (3) There are no encumbrances (except as reported in writing on 
______________) against the property acquired or produced for, and 
allocated or properly chargeable to, the contract which would affect or 
impair the Government's title;
    (4) There has been no materially adverse change in the financial 
condition of the Contractor since the submission by the Contractor to 
the Government of the most recent written information dated 
______________; and
    (5) After the making of this requested performance-based payment, 
the amount of all payments for each deliverable item for which 
performance-based payments have been requested will not exceed any 
limitation in the contract, and the amount of all payments under the 
contract will not exceed any limitation in the contract.

Sec. 52.232-33  Mandatory Information for Electronic Funds Transfer Payment.

    As prescribed in 32.1103(a) and (c), insert the following clause:

 Mandatory Information for Electronic Funds Transfer Payment (Aug 1996)

    (a) Method of payment. Payments by the Government under this 
contract, including invoice and contract financing payments, may be made 
by check or electronic funds transfer (EFT) at the option of the 
Government. If payment is made by EFT, the Government may, at its 
option, also forward the associated payment information by electronic 
transfer. As used in this clause, the term ``EFT'' refers to the funds 
transfer and may also include the information transfer.
    (b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. (1) The 
Contractor is required, as a condition to any payment under this 
contract, to provide the Government with the information required to 
make payment by EFT as described in paragraph (d) of this clause, unless 
the payment office determines that submission of the information is not 
required. However, until January 1, 1999, in the event the Contractor 
certifies in writing to the payment office that the Contractor does not 
have an account with a financial institution or an authorized payment 
agent, payment shall be made by other than EFT. For any payments to be 
made after January 1, 1999, the Contractor shall provide EFT information 
as described in paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to 
multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the 
applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the payment 
office.
    (c) Contractor's EFT information. Prior to submission of the first 
request for payment (whether for invoice or contract financing payment) 
under this contract, the Contractor shall provide the information 
required to make contract payment by EFT, as described in paragraph (d) 
of this clause, directly to the Government payment office named in this 
contract. If more than one payment office is named for the contract, the 
Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event 
that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible 
for providing the changed information to the designated payment 
office(s).
    (d) Required EFT information. The Government may make payment by EFT 
through either an Automated Clearing House (ACH) subject to the banking 
laws of the United States or the Federal Reserve Wire Transfer System at 
the Government's option. The Contractor shall provide the following 
information for both methods in a form acceptable to the designated 
payment office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple 
contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause).
    (1) The contract number to which this notice applies.
    (2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the 
contract, and account number at the Contractor's financial agent.
    (3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and 
telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this 
information.
    (4) For ACH payments only:
    (i) Name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the 
Contractor's financial agent.
    (ii) Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, 
saving, or lockbox).
    (5) For Federal Reserve Wire Transfer System payments only:
    (i) Name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and the 9-digit Routing 
Transit Number for the Contractor's financial agent.
    (ii) If the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to 
the Federal Reserve Wire Transfer System and, therefore, not the 
receiver of the wire transfer payment, the Contractor shall also provide 
the name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the 
correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment.

[[Page 249]]

    (e) Suspension of payment. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any 
other clause of this contract, the Government is not required to make 
any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated 
payment office, of the correct EFT payment information from the 
Contractor or a certificate submitted in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this clause. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any 
invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a valid 
invoice or contract financing request as defined in the Prompt Payment 
clause of this contract.
    (2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT 
information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT 
information no later than the 30th day after its receipt to the extent 
payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no 
further payments be made until the changed EFT information is 
implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a 
late payment under the Prompt Payment clause of this contract, the 
Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for 
payment by the number of days of the suspension.
    (f) Contractor EFT arrangements. The Contractor shall designate a 
single financial agent capable of receiving and processing the 
electronic funds transfer using the EFT methods described in paragraph 
(d) of this clause. The Contractor shall pay all fees and charges for 
receipt and processing of transfers.
    (g) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an 
uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government failed 
to use the Contractor-provided EFT information in the correct manner, 
the Government remains responsible for (i) making a correct payment, 
(ii) paying any prompt payment penalty due, and (iii) recovering any 
erroneously directed funds.
    (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because 
Contractor-provided EFT information was incorrect at the time of 
Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the 
Federal Reserve System, and--
    (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment 
office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor 
is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
    (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, 
the Government retains the right to either make payment by mail or 
suspend the payment in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (h) EFT and prompt payment. (1) A payment shall be deemed to have 
been made in a timely manner in accordance with the Prompt Payment 
clause of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction 
given to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement 
of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the 
specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal 
Reserve System.
    (2) When payment cannot be made by EFT because of incorrect EFT 
information provided by the Contractor, no interest penalty is due after 
the date of the uncompleted or erroneous payment transaction, provided 
that notice of the defective EFT information is issued to the Contractor 
within 7 days after the Government is notified of the defective EFT 
information.
    (i) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the 
proceeds of this contract as provided for in the Assignment of Claims 
clause of this contract, the assignee shall provide the assignee EFT 
information required by paragraph (d) of this clause. In all respects, 
the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it 
were the Contractor. EFT information which shows the ultimate recipient 
of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a 
proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect 
EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (j) Payment office discretion. If the Contractor does not wish to 
receive payment by EFT methods for one or more payments, the Contractor 
may submit a request to the designated payment office to refrain from 
requiring EFT information or using the EFT payment method. The decision 
to grant the request is solely that of the Government.
    (k) Change of EFT information by financial agent. The Contractor 
agrees that the Contractor's financial agent may notify the Government 
of a change to the routing transit number, Contractor account number, or 
account type. The Government shall use the changed data in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor agrees that the 
information provided by the agent is deemed to be correct information as 
if it were provided by the Contractor. The Contractor agrees that the 
agent's notice of changed EFT data is deemed to be a request by the 
Contractor in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) that no further payments 
be made until the changed EFT information is implemented by the payment 
office.

Sec. 52.232-34  Optional Information for Electronic Funds Transfer Payment.

    As prescribed in 32.1103 (b) and (c), insert the following clause:

[[Page 250]]

  Optional Information for Electronic Funds Transfer Payment (Aug 1996)

    (a) Method of payment. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this clause, after the Contractor provides the information described in 
paragraph (d) of this clause, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
clause, payments by the Government under this contract, including 
invoice and contract financing payments, may be made by check or 
electronic funds transfer (EFT) at the option of the Government. If 
payment is made by EFT, the Government may, at its option, also forward 
the associated payment information by electronic transfer. As used in 
this clause, the term ``EFT'' refers to the funds transfer and may also 
include the information transfer.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provision of this clause making the 
furnishing of EFT information optional, the Contractor shall furnish the 
EFT information described in paragraph (d) for any payment to be made 
after January 1, 1999.
    (b) Contractor consent. (1) If the Contractor is willing to be paid 
by EFT, the Contractor shall provide the EFT information described in 
paragraph (d) of this clause. The Contractor agrees that, after 
providing EFT information in accordance with this clause, the Contractor 
cannot withdraw the Government's right to make payment by EFT for this 
contract.
    (2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to 
multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the 
applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the payment 
office.
    (c) Contractor's EFT information. Prior to submission of the first 
request for payment (whether for invoice or contract financing payment) 
under this contract, for which the Contractor desires EFT payment, the 
Contractor shall provide the information required to make contract 
payment by EFT, as described in paragraph (d) of this clause, directly 
to the Government payment office named in this contract. If more than 
one payment office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall 
provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT 
information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing 
the changed information to the designated payment office(s).
    (d) Required EFT information. The Government may make payment by EFT 
through either an Automated Clearing House (ACH) subject to the domestic 
banking laws of the United States or the Federal Reserve Wire Transfer 
System at the Government's option. The Contractor shall provide the 
following information for both methods in a form acceptable to the 
designated payment office. The Contractor may supply this data for this 
or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause).
    (1) The contract number to which this notice applies.
    (2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the 
contract, and account number at the Contractor's financial agent.
    (3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and 
telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this 
information.
    (4) For ACH payment only:
    (i) Name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the 
Contractor's financial agent.
    (ii) Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, 
saving, or lockbox).
    (5) For Federal Reserve Wire Transfer System payments only:
    (i) Name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and the 9-digit Routing 
Transit Number for the Contractor's financial agent.
    (ii) If the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to 
the Federal Reserve Wire Transfer System and, therefore, not the 
receiver of the wire transfer payment, the Contractor shall also provide 
the name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the 
correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment.
    (e) Suspension of payment. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any 
other clause of this contract, if, after receipt of the Contractor's EFT 
information in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause, the EFT 
information is found to be incorrect, or, for payment after January 1, 
1999, if EFT information has not been furnished, then until receipt by 
the designated payment office of the correct EFT information from the 
Contractor, (i) the Government is not required to make any further 
payment under this contract; and (ii) any invoice or contract financing 
request shall be deemed not to be a valid invoice or contract financing 
request as defined in the Prompt Payment clause of this contract.
    (2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT 
information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT 
information no later than the 30th day after its receipt to the extent 
payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no 
further payments be made until the changed EFT information is 
implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a 
late payment under the Prompt Payment clause of this contract, the 
Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for 
payment by the number of days of the suspension.
    (f) Contractor EFT arrangements. The Contractor shall designate a 
single financial agent capable of receiving and processing the 
electronic funds transfer using the EFT methods described in paragraph 
(d) of this clause. The Contractor shall pay all fees and

[[Page 251]]

charges for receipt and processing of transfers.
    (g) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an 
uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government failed 
to use the Contractor-provided EFT information in the correct manner, 
the Government remains responsible for (i) making a correct payment, 
(ii) paying any prompt payment penalty due, and (iii) recovering any 
erroneously directed funds.
    (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because 
Contractor-provided EFT information was incorrect at the time of 
Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the 
Federal Reserve System, and--
    (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment 
office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor 
is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
    (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, 
the Government retains the right to either make payment by mail or 
suspend the payment in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (h) EFT and prompt payment. (1) A payment shall be deemed to have 
been made in a timely manner in accordance with the Prompt Payment 
clause of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction 
given to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement 
of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the 
specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal 
Reserve System.
    (2) When payment cannot be made by EFT because of incorrect EFT 
information provided by the Contractor, no interest penalty is due after 
the date of the uncompleted or erroneous payment transaction, provided 
that notice of the defective EFT information is issued to the Contractor 
within 7 days after the Government is notified of the defective EFT 
information.
    (i) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the 
proceeds of this contract as provided for in the Assignment of Claims 
clause of this contract, the assignee shall provide the assignee EFT 
information required by paragraph (d) of this clause. In all respects, 
the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it 
were the Contractor. EFT information which shows the ultimate recipient 
of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a 
proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect 
EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this clause.
    (j) Payment office discretion. If, after submitting the EFT 
information, the Contractor does not wish to receive payment by EFT 
methods for one or more payments, the Contractor may submit a request to 
the designated payment office to refrain from using the EFT payment 
method. The decision to grant the request is solely that of the 
Government.
    (k) Change of EFT information by financial agent. The Contractor 
agrees that the Contractor's financial agent may notify the Government 
of a change to the routing transit number, Contractor account number, or 
account type. The Government shall use the changed data in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor agrees that the 
information provided by the agent is deemed to be correct information as 
if it were provided by the Contractor. The Contractor agrees that the 
agent's notice of changed EFT data is deemed to be a request by the 
Contractor in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) that no further payments 
be made until the changed EFT information is implemented by the payment 
office.

Sec. 52.233-1  Disputes.

    As prescribed in 33.215, insert the following clause:

                           Disputes (Oct 1995)

    (a) This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 
as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613).
    (b) Except as provided in the Act, all disputes arising under or 
relating to this contract shall be resolved under this clause.
    (c) Claim, as used in this clause, means a written demand or written 
assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of 
right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or 
interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or 
relating to this contract. A claim arising under a contract, unlike a 
claim relating to that contract, is a claim that can be resolved under a 
contract clause that provides for the relief sought by the claimant. 
However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking 
the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act 
until certified as required by subparagraph (d)(2) of this clause. A 
voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in 
dispute when submitted is not a claim under the Act. The submission may 
be converted to a claim under the Act, by complying with the submission 
and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either 
as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
    (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, 
unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after 
accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. 
A claim by the

[[Page 252]]

Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision 
by the Contracting Officer.
    (2)(i) Contractors shall provide the certification specified in 
subparagraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim--
    (A) Exceeding $100,000; or
    (B) Regardless of the amount claimed, when using--
    (1) Arbitration conducted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 575-580; or
    (2) Any other alternative means of dispute resolution (ADR) 
technique that the agency elects to handle in accordance with the 
Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADRA).
    (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in 
controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
    (iii) The certification shall state as follows: ``I certify that the 
claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and 
complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount 
requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the 
Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly 
authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor.''
    (3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized 
to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
    (e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting 
Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a 
decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims 
over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the 
claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be 
made.
    (f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the 
Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.
    (g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting 
Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the 
parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use ADR. If the Contractor 
refuses an offer for alternative disputes resolution, the Contractor 
shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's 
specific reasons for rejecting the request. When using arbitration 
conducted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 575-580, or when using any other ADR 
technique that the agency elects to handle in accordance with the ADRA, 
any claim, regardless of amount, shall be accompanied by the 
certification described in subparagraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause, and 
executed in accordance with subparagraph (d)(3) of this clause.
    (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and 
unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim 
(certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would 
be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to 
claims having defective certifications, as defined in (FAR) 48 CFR 
33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting 
Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be 
paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in 
the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting 
Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-
month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of 
the claim.
    (i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this 
contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, 
appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any 
decision of the Contracting Officer.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (DEC 1991). If it is determined under agency procedures, 
that continued performance is necessary pending resolution of any claim 
arising under or relating to the contract, substitute the following 
paragraph (i) for the paragraph (i) of the basic clause:

    (i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this 
contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, 
appeal, or action arising under or relating to the contract, and comply 
with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

Sec. 52.233-3  Protest After Award.

    As prescribed in 33.106(b), insert the following clause:

                     Protest After Award (Aug 1996)

    (a) Upon receipt of a notice of protest (as defined in FAR 33.101) 
or a determination that a protest is likely (see FAR 33.102(d)), the 
Contracting Officer may, by written order to the Contractor, direct the 
Contractor to stop performance of the work called for by this contract. 
The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued 
under this clause. Upon receipt of the order, the Contractor shall 
immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to 
minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the 
order during the period of work stoppage. Upon receipt of the final 
decision in the protest, the Contracting Officer shall either--
    (1) Cancel the stop-work order; or
    (2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the 
Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of 
this contract.
    (b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either 
before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor shall 
resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment 
in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract 
shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if--
    (1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required 
for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance 
of any part of this contract; and
    (2) The Contractor asserts its right to an adjustment within 30 days 
after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that if the 
Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the 
Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted at any 
time before final payment under this contract.
    (c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the 
order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the 
Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the 
stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement.
    (d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the 
order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by 
equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the 
stop-work order.
    (e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at any time 
are not affected by action taken under this clause.
    (f) If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent 
misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related 
to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as 
provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require 
the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In 
addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements 
of subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the 
amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between 
the Contractor and the Government.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (JUN 1985). As prescribed in 33.106(b), substitute in 
paragraph (a)(2) the words ``the Termination clause of this contract'' 
for the words ``the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the 
Government clause of this contract.'' In paragraph (b) substitute the 
words ``an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule, the estimated 
cost, the fee, or a combination thereof, and in any other terms of the 
contract that may be affected'' for the words ``an equitable adjustment 
in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both.''

subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site which differ 
materially from those indicated in this contract, or (2) unknown 
physical conditions at the site, of an unusual nature, which differ 
materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as 
inhering in work of the character provided for in the contract.
    (b) The Contracting Officer shall investigate the site conditions 
promptly after receiving the notice. If the conditions do materially so 
differ and cause an increase or decrease in the Contractor's cost of, or 
the time required for, performing any part of the work under this 
contract, whether or not changed as a result of the conditions, an 
equitable adjustment shall be made under this clause and the contract 
modified in writing accordingly.
    (c) No request by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment to the

has investigated and satisfied itself as to the general and local 
conditions which can affect the work or its cost, including but not

information is reasonably ascertainable from an inspection of the site, 
including all exploratory work done by the Government, as well as from 
the

drawings and specifications made a part of this contract. Any failure of 
the Contractor to take the actions described and acknowledged in this 
paragraph will not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for 
estimating properly the difficulty and cost of successfully performing 
the work, or for proceeding to successfully perform the work without 
additional expense to the Government.
    (b) The Government assumes no responsibility for any conclusions or 
interpretations made by the Contractor based on the information made 
available by the Government. Nor does the Government assume 
responsibility for any understanding reached or representation made 
concerning conditions which can affect the work by any of its officers

    (a) All equipment, material, and articles incorporated into the work 
covered by this contract shall be new and of the most suitable grade for 
the purpose intended, unless otherwise specifically provided in this 
contract. References in the specifications to equipment, material, 
articles, or patented processes by trade name, make, or catalog number, 
shall be regarded as establishing a standard of quality and shall not be 
construed as limiting competition. The Contractor may, at its option, 
use any equipment, material, article, or process that, in the judgment 
of the Contracting Officer, is equal to that named in the 
specifications, unless otherwise specifically provided in this contract.
    (b) The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's approval 
of the machinery and mechanical and other equipment to be incorporated 
into the work. When requesting approval, the Contractor shall furnish to 
the Contracting Officer the name of the manufacturer, the model number, 
and other information concerning the performance, capacity, nature, and 
rating of the machinery and mechanical and other equipment. When 
required by this contract or by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor 
shall also obtain the Contracting Officer's approval of the material or 
articles which the Contractor contemplates incorporating into the work. 
When requesting approval, the Contractor shall provide full information 
concerning the material or articles. When directed to do so, the 
Contractor shall submit samples for approval at the Contractor's 
expense, with all shipping charges prepaid. Machinery, equipment, 
material, and articles that do not have the required approval shall be 
installed or used at the risk of subsequent rejection.
    (c) All work under this contract shall be performed in a skillful 
and workmanlike manner. The Contracting Officer may require, in writing,

possession of or using any work, the Contracting Officer shall furnish 
the Contractor a list of items of work remaining to be performed or 
corrected on those portions of the work that the Government intends to 
take possession of or use. However, failure of the Contracting Officer 
to list any item of work shall not relieve the Contractor of 
responsibility for complying with the terms of the contract. The 
Government's possession or use shall not be deemed an acceptance of any 
work under the contract.
    (b) While the Government has such possession or use, the Contractor 
shall be relieved of the responsibility for the loss of or damage to the 
work resulting from the Government's possession or use, notwithstanding 
the terms of the clause in this contract entitled Permits and 
Responsibilities. If prior possession or use by the Government delays

of completion, and the contract shall be modified in writing 
accordingly.

noncompliance with these requirements or any condition which poses a 
serious or imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or 
Government personnel, the Contracting Officer shall notify the 
Contractor orally, with written confirmation, and request immediate 
initiation of corrective action. This notice, when delivered to the 
Contractor or the Contractor's representative at the work site, shall be 
deemed sufficient notice of the noncompliance and that corrective action 
is required. After receiving the notice, the Contractor shall 
immediately take corrective action. If the Contractor fails or refuses 
to promptly take corrective action, the Contracting Officer may issue an 
order stopping all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective 
action has been taken. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any 
equitable adjustment of the contract price or extension of the 
performance schedule on any stop work order issued under this clause.
    (e) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this 
paragraph (e), with appropriate changes in the designation of the 
parties, in subcontracts.

reasonable rates determined by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor 
shall carefully conserve any utilities furnished without charge.

satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, shall install and maintain all 
necessary temporary connections and distribution lines, and all meters

             Schedules for Construction Contracts (Apr 1984)

    (a) The Contractor shall, within five days after the work commences 
on the contract or another period of time determined by the Contracting 
Officer, prepare and submit to the Contracting Officer for approval 
three

[[Page 259]]

copies of a practicable schedule showing the order in which the 
Contractor proposes to perform the work, and the dates on which the 
Contractor contemplates starting and completing the several salient 
features of the work (including acquiring materials, plant, and 
equipment). The schedule shall be in the form of a progress chart of 
suitable scale to indicate appropriately the percentage of work 
scheduled for completion by any given date during the period. If the 
Contractor fails to submit a schedule within the time prescribed, the 
Contracting Officer may withhold approval of progress payments until the 
Contractor submits the required schedule.
    (b) The Contractor shall enter the actual progress on the chart as 
directed by the Contracting Officer, and upon doing so shall immediately 
deliver three copies of the annotated schedule to the Contracting 
Officer. If, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor 
falls behind the approved schedule, the Contractor shall take steps 
necessary to improve its progress, including those that may be required 
by the Contracting Officer, without additional cost to the Government. 
In this circumstance, the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor 
to increase the number of shifts, overtime operations, days of work, 
and/or the amount of construction plant, and to submit for approval any 
supplementary schedule or schedules in chart form as the Contracting 
Officer deems necessary to demonstrate how the approved rate of progress 
will be regained.
    (c) Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of the 
Contracting Officer under this clause shall be grounds for a 
determination by the Contracting Officer that the Contractor is not 
prosecuting the work with sufficient diligence to ensure completion 
within the time specified in the contract. Upon making this 
determination, the Contracting Officer may terminate the Contractor's 
right to proceed with the work, or any separable part of it, in 
accordance with the default terms of this contract.

these surveys shall be used in computing the quantities of work 
performed and the actual construction completed and in place.
    (b) The Government shall conduct the original and final surveys and 
make the computations based on them. The Contractor shall conduct the 
surveys for any periods for which progress payments are requested and 
shall make the computations based on these surveys. All surveys 
conducted by the Contractor shall be conducted under the direction of a 
representative of the Contracting Officer, unless the Contracting 
Officer waives this requirement in a specific instance.
    (c) Promptly upon completing a survey, the Contractor shall furnish 
the originals of all field notes and all other records relating to the 
survey or to the layout of the work to the Contracting Officer, who 
shall use them as necessary to determine the amount of progress 
payments. The Contractor shall retain copies of all such material 
furnished to the Contracting Officer.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If it is determined at a level above that of 
the contracting officer that it is impracticable for Government 
personnel to perform the original and final surveys, and the Government 
wishes the contractor to perform these surveys, substitute the following 
paragraph (b) for paragraph (b) of the basic clause:
    (b) The Contractor shall conduct the original and final surveys and 
surveys for any periods for which progress payments are requested. All 
these surveys shall be conducted under the direction of a representative

base lines and bench marks indicated on the drawings, and shall be 
responsible for all measurements in connection with the layout. The 
Contractor shall furnish, at its own expense, all stakes, templates, 
platforms, equipment, tools, materials, and labor required to lay out 
any part of the work. The Contractor shall be responsible for executing 
the work to the lines and grades that may be established or indicated by

removal is authorized, the Contracting Officer may replace them and 
deduct the expense of the replacement from any amounts due or to become 
due to the Contractor.

drawings and specifications and shall at all times give the Contracting 
Officer access thereto. Anything mentioned in the specifications and not 
shown on the drawings, or shown on the drawings and not mentioned in the 
specifications, shall be of like effect as if shown or mentioned in 
both. In case of difference between drawings and specifications, the 
specifications shall govern. In case of discrepancy in the figures, in 
the drawings, or in the specifications, the matter shall be promptly 
submitted to the Contracting Officer, who shall promptly make a 
determination in writing. Any adjustment by the Contractor without such 
a determination shall be at its own risk and expense. The Contracting 
Officer shall furnish from time to time such detailed drawings and other 
information as considered necessary, unless otherwise provided.
    (b) Wherever in the specifications or upon the drawings the words 
directed, required, ordered, designated, prescribed, or words of like 
import are used, it shall be understood that the direction, requirement, 
order, designation, or prescription, of the Contracting Officer is 
intended and similarly the words approved, acceptable, satisfactory, or 
words of like import shall mean approved by, or acceptable to, or 
satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, unless otherwise expressly 
stated.

import are used, it shall be understood that the reference is made to 
the drawings accompanying this contract unless stated otherwise. The 
word provided as used herein shall be understood to mean provide

subcontractor, or any lower tier subcontractor pursuant to a 
construction contract, showing in detail (1) the proposed fabrication 
and assembly of structural elements and (2) the installation (i.e., 
form, fit, and attachment details) of materials or equipment. It 
includes drawings, diagrams, layouts, schematics, descriptive 
literature, illustrations, schedules, performance and test data, and 
similar materials furnished by the contractor to explain in detail 
specific portions of the work required by the contract. The Government 
may duplicate, use, and disclose in any manner and for any purpose shop 
drawings delivered under this contract.
    (e) If this contract requires shop drawings, the Contractor shall 
coordinate all such drawings, and review them for accuracy, 
completeness, and compliance with contract requirements and shall 
indicate its approval thereon as evidence of such coordination and 
review. Shop drawings submitted to the Contracting Officer without 
evidence of the Contractor's approval may be returned for resubmission. 
The Contracting Officer will indicate an approval or disapproval of the 
shop drawings and if not approved as submitted shall indicate the 
Government's reasons therefor. Any work done before such approval shall 
be at the Contractor's risk. Approval by the Contracting Officer shall 
not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for any errors or 
omissions in such drawings, nor from responsibility for complying with 
the requirements of this contract, except with respect to variations 
described and approved in accordance with (f) below.
    (f) If shop drawings show variations from the contract requirements, 
the Contractor shall describe such variations in writing, separate from 
the drawings, at the time of submission. If the Contracting Officer 
approves any such variation, the Contracting Officer shall issue an 
appropriate contract modification, except that, if the variation is 
minor or does not involve a change in price or in time of performance, a 
modification need not be issued.
    (g) The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer for 
approval four copies (unless otherwise indicated) of all shop drawings 
as called for under the various headings of these specifications. Three 
sets (unless otherwise indicated) of all shop drawings, will be retained 
by the Contracting Officer and one set will be returned to the 
Contractor.

    As prescribed in 36.609-1(c), insert the following clause:

               Design Within Funding Limitations (Apr 1984)

    (a) The Contractor shall accomplish the design services required 
under this contract so as to permit the award of a contract, using 
standard Federal Acquisition Regulation procedures for the construction 
of the facilities designed at a price that does not exceed the estimated 
construction contract price as set forth in paragraph (c) below. When 
bids or proposals for the construction contract are received that exceed 
the estimated price, the contractor shall perform such redesign and 
other services as are necessary to permit contract award within the 
funding limitation. These additional services shall be performed at no 
increase in the price of this contract. However, the Contractor shall 
not be required to perform such additional services at no cost to the 
Government if the unfavorable bids or proposals are the result of 
conditions beyond its reasonable control.
    (b) The Contractor will promptly advise the Contracting Officer if 
it finds that the project being designed will exceed or is likely to 
exceed the funding limitations and it is unable to design a usable 
facility within these limitations. Upon receipt of such information, the 
Contracting Officer will review the Contractor's revised estimate of 
construction cost. The Government may, if it determines that the 
estimated construction contract price set forth in this contract is so 
low that award of a construction contract

[[Page 262]]

not in excess of such estimate is improbable, authorize a change in 
scope or materials as required to reduce the estimated construction cost 
to an amount within the estimated construction contract price set forth 
in paragraph (c) below, or the Government may adjust such estimated 
construction contract price. When bids or proposals are not solicited or 
are unreasonably delayed, the Government shall prepare an estimate of

this contract, shall furnish, install, operate, and maintain all 
facilities required to furnish service hereunder, and measure such 
service at the point of delivery specified in the Service 
Specifications. Title to all such facilities shall remain with the

under this contract. This permit or license includes use of the site or 
sites agreed upon by the parties hereto for the installation, operation, 
maintenance, and repair of the facilities of the Contractor required to 
be located upon Government premises. All applicable taxes and other 
charges in connection therewith, together with all liability of the 
Contractor in construction, operation, maintenance and repair of such 
facilities, shall be the obligation of the Contractor.
    (c) Authorized representatives of the Contractor will be allowed 
access to the facilities on Government premises at reasonable times to 
perform the obligations of the Contractor regarding such facilities. It 
is expressly understood that the Government may limit or restrict the 
right of access herein granted in any manner considered necessary (e.g., 
national security, public safety).
    (d) Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the Contractor 
shall, at its expense, remove such facilities and restore Government 
premises to their original condition as near as practicable within a 
reasonable time after the Government terminates this contract. In the 
event such termination of this contract is due to the fault of the 
Contractor, such facilities may be retained in place at the option of 
the Government for a reasonable time while the Government attempts to 
obtain service elsewhere comparable to that provided for hereunder.

adjustment shall be made to the next invoice for the purpose of 
correcting such errors. However, any meter which registers not more than 
____ percent slow or fast shall be deemed correct.
    (2) The Contractor shall read all meters at periodic intervals of

regulatory body or applicable bylaws. All billings based on meter 
readings of less than ____ days shall be prorated accordingly.

Contractor shall make additional tests of any or all such meters in the 
presence of Government representatives. The

[[Page 269]]

cost of such additional tests shall be borne by the Government if the 
percentage of errors is found to be not more than ____ percent slow or 
fast.
    (3) No meter shall be placed in service or allowed to remain in 
service which has an error in registration in excess of ____ percent 
under normal operating conditions.

by the Contracting Officer to the Contractor regarding any material 
changes anticipated in the volume or characteristics of the utility 
service required at each location.

in consequence of any cause beyond the control of the Contractor, 
including but not limited to acts of God or of the public enemy, fires, 
floods, earthquakes, or other catastrophe, strikes, or failure or

each monthly bill for service furnished under this contract to the 
service location, a credit of ________ percent of the amount of each 
such bill as rendered until the accumulation of credits shall equal the

defaults in performance, prior to full credit of any connection charge 
paid by the Government, the Contractor shall pay to the Government an 
amount equal to the uncredited balance of the connection charge as of 
the date of the termination or default.
    (d) Termination before completion of facilities. The Government

completed work prior to the time of termination by the Government, plus 
the cost of removal, less the salvage value.
    (e) Termination after completion of facilities. In the event the

lieu of allowing credits, pay the Government during such period 
installments in like amount, manner, and extent as the credit provided 
for under paragraph (c) of this clause before such termination; and
    (ii) Immediately after such ________ month period the Contractor 
shall promptly pay in full to the Government the uncredited balance of 
the connection charge.
    (2) To remove such facilities at the Contractor's own expense within

    (4) Amount of Government-furnished property.
    (b) If any change causes an increase or decrease in any hourly rate, 
the ceiling price, or the time required for performance of any part of 
the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, or 
otherwise affects any other terms and conditions of this contract, the 
Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the (1) 
ceiling price, (2) hourly rates, (3) delivery schedule, and (4) other 
affected terms, and shall modify the contract accordingly.
    (c) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this 
clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. 
However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, 
the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted 
before final payment of the contract.
    (d) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the 
Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the 
Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.

sureties, if any, by written order designated or indicated to

[[Page 280]]

be a change order, make changes in the work within the general scope of 
the contract, including changes--

    (2) In the method or manner of performance of the work;
    (3) In the Government-furnished facilities, equipment, materials,

    (b) Any other written or oral order (which, as used in this

determination) from the Contracting Officer that causes a change shall 
be treated as a change order under this clause; provided, that the 
Contractor gives the Contracting Officer written notice stating (1) the 
date, circumstances, and source of the order and (2) that the Contractor 
regards the order as a change order.
    (c) Except as provided in this clause, no order, statement, or 
conduct of the Contracting Officer shall be treated as a change under 
this clause or entitle the Contractor to an equitable adjustment.
    (d) If any change under this clause causes an increase or decrease 
in the Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, the performance 
of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed by 
any such order, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable 
adjustment and modify the contract in writing. However, except for an 
adjustment based on defective specifications, no adjustment for any 
change under paragraph (b) of this clause shall be made for any costs 
incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor gives written notice as

Government is responsible, the equitable adjustment shall include any 
increased cost reasonably incurred by the Contractor in attempting to 
comply with the defective specifications.

clause within 30 days after (1) receipt of a written change order under

$100,000. The Contractor, for each change or series of related changes, 
shall maintain separate accounts, by job order or other suitable 
accounting procedure, of all incurred segregable, direct costs (less 
allocable credits) of work, both changed and not changed, allocable to 
the change. The Contractor shall maintain such accounts until the 
parties agree to an equitable adjustment for the changes ordered by the 
Contracting Officer or the matter is conclusively disposed of in 
accordance with the Disputes clause.

Sec. 52.243-7  Notification of Changes.

    As prescribed in 43.107, the contracting officer may insert a clause 
substantially the same as the following in solicitations and contracts. 
The clause is available for use primarily in negotiated research and 
development or supply contracts for the acquisition of major weapon 
systems or principal subsystems. If the contract amount is expected to 
be less than $1,000,000, the clause shall not be used, unless the 
contracting officer anticipates that situations will arise that may 
result in a contractor alleging that the Government has effected changes 
other than those identified as such in writing and signed by the 
contracting officer.

                    Notification of Changes (Apr 1984)

    (a) Definitions.
    Contracting Officer, as used in this clause, does not include any 
representative of the Contracting Officer.
    Specifically Authorized Representative (SAR), as used in this 
clause, means any person the Contracting Officer has so designated by 
written notice (a copy of which shall be provided to the Contractor) 
which shall refer to this subparagraph and shall be issued to the 
designated representative before the SAR exercises such authority.
    (b) Notice. The primary purpose of this clause is to obtain prompt 
reporting of Government conduct that the Contractor considers to 
constitute a change to this contract. Except for changes identified as 
such in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor 
shall notify the Administrative Contracting Officer in writing promptly, 
within ------ (to be negotiated) calendar days from the date that the 
Contractor identifies any Government conduct (including actions, 
inactions, and written or oral communications) that the Contractor 
regards as a change to the contract terms and conditions. On the basis 
of the most accurate information available to the Contractor, the notice 
shall state--
    (1) The date, nature, and circumstances of the conduct regarded as a 
change;
    (2) The name, function, and activity of each Government individual 
and Contractor official or employee involved in or knowledgeable about 
such conduct;
    (3) The identification of any documents and the substance of any 
oral communication involved in such conduct;
    (4) In the instance of alleged acceleration of scheduled performance 
or delivery, the basis upon which it arose;
    (5) The particular elements of contract performance for which the 
Contractor may seek an equitable adjustment under this clause, 
including--
    (i) What contract line items have been or may be affected by the 
alleged change;
    (ii) What labor or materials or both have been or may be added, 
deleted, or wasted by the alleged change;
    (iii) To the extent practicable, what delay and disruption in the 
manner and sequence of performance and effect on continued performance 
have been or may be caused by the alleged change;
    (iv) What adjustments to contract price, delivery schedule, and 
other provisions affected by the alleged change are estimated; and
    (6) The Contractor's estimate of the time by which the Government 
must respond to the Contractor's notice to minimize cost, delay or 
disruption of performance.
    (c) Continued performance. Following submission of the notice 
required by (b) above, the Contractor shall diligently continue 
performance of this contract to the maximum extent possible in 
accordance with its terms and conditions as construed by the Contractor, 
unless the notice reports a direction of the Contracting Officer or a 
communication from a SAR of the Contracting Officer, in either of which 
events the Contractor shall continue performance; provided, however, 
that if the Contractor regards the direction or communication as a 
change as described in (b) above, notice shall be given in the manner 
provided. All directions, communications, interpretations, orders and 
similar actions of the SAR shall be reduced to writing promptly and 
copies furnished to the Contractor and to the Contracting Officer. The 
Contracting Officer shall promptly countermand any action which exceeds 
the authority of the SAR.
    (d) Government response. The Contracting Officer shall promptly, 
within ------ (to be negotiated) calendar days after receipt of notice, 
respond to the notice in writing. In responding, the Contracting Officer 
shall either--
    (1) Confirm that the conduct of which the Contractor gave notice 
constitutes a change and when necessary direct the mode of further 
performance;
    (2) Countermand any communication regarded as a change;
    (3) Deny that the conduct of which the Contractor gave notice 
constitutes a change and when necessary direct the mode of further 
performance; or
    (4) In the event the Contractor's notice information is inadequate 
to make a decision

[[Page 282]]

under (1), (2), or (3) above, advise the Contractor what additional 
information is required, and establish the date by which it should be 
furnished and the date thereafter by which the Government will respond.
    (e) Equitable adjustments. (1) If the Contracting Officer confirms 
that Government conduct effected a change as alleged by the Contractor, 
and the conduct causes an increase or decrease in the Contractor's cost 
of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under 
this contract, whether changed or not changed by such conduct, an 
equitable adjustment shall be made--
    (i) In the contract price or delivery schedule or both; and
    (ii) In such other provisions of the contract as may be affected.
    (2) The contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. In the 
case of drawings, designs or specifications which are defective and for 
which the Government is responsible, the equitable adjustment shall 
include the cost and time extension for delay reasonably incurred by the 
Contractor in attempting to comply with the defective drawings, designs 
or specifications before the Contractor identified, or reasonably should 
have identified, such defect. When the cost of property made obsolete or 
excess as a result of a change confirmed by the Contracting Officer 
under this clause is included in the equitable adjustment, the 
Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of 
disposition of the property. The equitable adjustment shall not include 
increased costs or time extensions for delay resulting from the 
Contractor's failure to provide notice or to continue performance as 
provided, respectively, in (b) and (c) above.

    Note: The phrases contract price and cost wherever they appear in 
the clause, may be appropriately modified to apply to cost-reimbursement 
or incentive contracts, or to combinations thereof.

Sec. 52.244-1  Subcontracts Fixed-Price Contracts.

    As prescribed in 44.204(a)(1)(i), insert the following clause. The 
threshold in subparagraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the clause may be 
lowered when closer surveillance of subcontracting is necessary because 
of the nature of the industry involved, criticality of the work expected 
to be subcontracted, absence of competition in placing the prime 
contract, uncertainties as to the adequacy of the contractor's 
purchasing system, or novelty of the supplies or services being 
purchased.

             Subcontracts (Fixed-Price Contracts) (Feb 1995)

    (a) This clause does not apply to firm-fixed-price contracts and 
fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment. However, it does 
apply to subcontracts resulting from unpriced modifications to such 
contracts.
    (b) Subcontract, as used in this clause, includes but is not limited 
to purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. 
The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer reasonably in 
advance of entering into any subcontract if the Contractor does not have 
an approved purchasing system and if the subcontract--
    (1) Is proposed to exceed $100,000; or
    (2) Is one of a number of subcontracts with a single subcontractor, 
under this contract, for the same or related supplies or services, that 
in the aggregate are expected to exceed $100,000.
    (c) The advance notification required by paragraph (b) above shall 
include--
    (1) A description of the supplies or services to be subcontracted;
    (2) Identification of the type of subcontract to be used;
    (3) Identification of the proposed subcontractor and an explanation 
of why and how the proposed subcontractor was selected, including the 
competition obtained;
    (4) The proposed subcontract price and the Contractor's cost or 
price analysis;
    (5) The subcontractor's current, complete, and accurate cost or 
pricing data and Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, if 
required by other contract provisions;
    (6) The subcontractor's Disclosure Statement or Certificate relating 
to Cost Accounting Standards when such data are required by other 
provisions of this contract; and
    (7) A negotiation memorandum reflecting--
    (i) The principal elements of the subcontract price negotiations;
    (ii) The most significant considerations controlling establishment 
of initial or revised prices;
    (iii) The reason cost or pricing data were or were not required;
    (iv) The extent, if any, to which the Contractor did not rely on the 
subcontractor's cost or pricing data in determining the price objective 
and in negotiating the final price;
    (v) The extent, if any, to which it was recognized in the 
negotiation that the subcontractor's cost or pricing data were not 
accurate, complete, or current; the action taken by the Contractor and 
subcontractor;

[[Page 283]]

and the effect of any such defective data on the total price negotiated;
    (vi) The reasons for any significant difference between the 
Contractor's price objective and the price negotiated; and
    (vii) A complete explanation of the incentive fee or profit plan 
when incentives are used. The explanation shall identify each critical 
performance element, management decisions used to quantify each 
incentive element, reasons for the incentives, and a summary of all 
trade-off possibilities considered.
    (d) The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's written 
consent before placing any subcontract for which advance notification is 
required under paragraph (b) above. However, the Contracting Officer may 
ratify in writing any such subcontract. Ratification shall constitute 
the consent of the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Even if the Contractor's purchasing system has been approved, 
the Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's written consent 
before placing subcontracts identified below:
_______________________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________________
    (f) Unless the consent or approval specifically provides otherwise, 
neither consent by the Contracting Officer to any subcontract nor 
approval of the Contractor's purchasing system shall constitute a 
determination (1) of the acceptability of any subcontract terms or 
conditions, (2) of the acceptability of any subcontract price or of any 
amount paid under any subcontract, or (3) to relieve the Contractor of 
any responsibility for performing this contract.
    (g) No subcontract placed under this contract shall provide for 
payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis, and any fee payable 
under cost-reimbursement subcontracts shall not exceed the fee 
limitations in section 15.903(d) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
(FAR).
    (h) The Government reserves the right to review the Contractor's 
purchasing system as set forth in FAR subpart 44.3.

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the Contracting Officer elects to delete 
the requirement for advance notification of, or consent to, any 
subcontracts that were evaluated during negotiations (this election is 
not authorized for acquisition of major systems and subsystems or their 
components), add the following paragraph (i) to the basic clause:

    As prescribed in 45.106(b)(1), insert the following clause:

          Government Property (Fixed-Price Contracts) (Dec 1989)

    (a) Government-furnished property. (1) The Government shall deliver 
to the Contractor, for use in connection with and under the terms of 
this contract, the Government-furnished property described in the 
Schedule or specifications together with any related data and 
information that the Contractor may request and is reasonably required 
for the intended use of the property (hereinafter referred to as 
Government-furnished property).
    (2) The delivery or performance dates for this contract are based 
upon the expectation that Government-furnished property suitable for use 
(except for property furnished as-is) will be delivered to the 
Contractor at the times stated in the Schedule or, if not so stated, in 
sufficient time to enable the Contractor to meet the contract's delivery 
or performance dates.
    (3) If Government-furnished property is received by the Contractor 
in a condition not suitable for the intended use, the Contractor shall, 
upon receipt of it, notify the Contracting Officer, detailing the facts, 
and, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at Government expense, 
either repair, modify, return, or otherwise dispose of the property. 
After completing the directed action and upon written request of the 
Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment 
as provided in paragraph (h) of this clause.
    (4) If Government-furnished property is not delivered to the 
Contractor by the required time, the Contracting Officer shall, upon the 
Contractor's timely written request, make a determination of the delay, 
if any, caused the Contractor and shall make an equitable adjustment in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause.
    (b) Changes in Government-furnished property. (1) The Contracting 
Officer may, by written notice, (i) decrease the Government-furnished 
property provided or to be provided under this contract, or (ii) 
substitute other Government-furnished property for the property to be 
provided by the Government, or to be acquired by the Contractor for the 
Government, under this contract. The Contractor shall promptly take such 
action as the Contracting Officer may direct regarding the removal, 
shipment, or disposal of the property covered by such notice.
    (2) Upon the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer 
shall make an equitable adjustment to the contract in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this clause, if the Government has agreed in the 
Schedule to make the property available for performing this contract and 
there is any--
    (i) Decrease or substitution in this property pursuant to 
subparagraph (b)(1) above; or
    (ii) Withdrawal of authority to use this property, if provided under 
any other contract or lease.
    (c) Title in Government property. (1) The Government shall retain 
title to all Government-furnished property.
    (2) All Government-furnished property and all property acquired by 
the Contractor, title to which vests in the Government under this 
paragraph (collectively referred to as Government property), are subject 
to the provisions of this clause. However, special tooling accountable 
to this contract is subject to the provisions of the Special Tooling 
clause and is not subject to the provisions of this clause. Title to 
Government property shall not be affected by its incorporation into or 
attachment to any property not owned by the Government, nor shall 
Government property become a fixture or lose its identity as personal 
property by being attached to any real property.

[[Page 287]]

    (3) Title to each item of facilities and special test equipment 
acquired by the Contractor for the Government under this contract shall 
pass to and vest in the Government when its use in performing this 
contract commences or when the Government has paid for it, whichever is 
earlier, whether or not title previously vested in the Government.
    (4) If this contract contains a provision directing the Contractor 
to purchase material for which the Government will reimburse the 
Contractor as a direct item of cost under this contract--
    (i) Title to material purchased from a vendor shall pass to and vest 
in the Government upon the vendor's delivery of such material; and
    (ii) Title to all other material shall pass to and vest in the 
Government upon--
    (A) Issuance of the material for use in contract performance;
    (B) Commencement of processing of the material or its use in 
contract performance; or
    (C) Reimbursement of the cost of the material by the Government, 
whichever occurs first.
    (d) Use of Government property. The Government property shall be 
used only for performing this contract, unless otherwise provided in 
this contract or approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Property administration. (1) The Contractor shall be responsible 
and accountable for all Government property provided under this contract 
and shall comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 45.5, 
as in effect on the date of this contract.
    (2) The Contractor shall establish and maintain a program for the 
use, maintenance, repair, protection, and preservation of Government 
property in accordance with sound industrial practice and the applicable 
provisions of subpart 45.5 of the FAR.
    (3) If damage occurs to Government property, the risk of which has 
been assumed by the Government under this contract, the Government shall 
replace the items or the Contractor shall make such repairs as the 
Government directs. However, if the Contractor cannot effect such 
repairs within the time required, the Contractor shall dispose of the 
property as directed by the Contracting Officer. When any property for 
which the Government is responsible is replaced or repaired, the 
Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in accordance 
with paragraph (h) of this clause.
    (4) The Contractor represents that the contract price does not 
include any amount for repairs or replacement for which the Government 
is responsible. Repair or replacement of property for which the 
Contractor is responsible shall be accomplished by the Contractor at its 
own expense.
    (f) Access. The Government and all its designees shall have access 
at all reasonable times to the premises in which any Government property 
is located for the purpose of inspecting the Government property.
    (g) Risk of loss. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the 
Contractor assumes the risk of, and shall be responsible for, any loss 
or destruction of, or damage to, Government property upon its delivery 
to the Contractor or upon passage of title to the Government under 
paragraph (c) of this clause. However, the Contractor is not responsible 
for reasonable wear and tear to Government property or for Government 
property properly consumed in performing this contract.
    (h) Equitable adjustment. When this clause specifies an equitable 
adjustment, it shall be made to any affected contract provision in 
accordance with the procedures of the Changes clause. When appropriate, 
the Contracting Officer may initiate an equitable adjustment in favor of 
the Government. The right to an equitable adjustment shall be the 
Contractor's exclusive remedy. The Government shall not be liable to 
suit for breach of contract for--
    (1) Any delay in delivery of Government-furnished property;
    (2) Delivery of Government-furnished property in a condition not 
suitable for its intended use;
    (3) A decrease in or substitution of Government-furnished property; 
or
    (4) Failure to repair or replace Government property for which the 
Government is responsible.
    (i) Final accounting and disposition of Government property. Upon 
completing this contract, or at such earlier dates as may be fixed by 
the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall submit, in a form 
acceptable to the Contracting Officer, inventory schedules covering all 
items of Government property (including any resulting scrap) not 
consumed in performing this contract or delivered to the Government. The 
Contractor shall prepare for shipment, deliver f.o.b. origin, or dispose 
of the Government property as may be directed or authorized by the 
Contracting Officer. The net proceeds of any such disposal shall be 
credited to the contract price or shall be paid to the Government as the 
Contracting Officer directs.
    (j) Abandonment and restoration of Contractor's premises. Unless 
otherwise provided herein, the Government--
    (1) May abandon any Government property in place, at which time all 
obligations of the Government regarding such abandoned property shall 
cease; and
    (2) Has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Contractor's 
premises under any circumstances (e.g., abandonment, disposition upon 
completion of need, or upon contract completion). However, if the 
Government-furnished property (listed in the Schedule or

[[Page 288]]

specifications) is withdrawn or is unsuitable for the intended use, or 
if other Government property is substituted, then the equitable 
adjustment under paragraph (h) of this clause may properly include 
restoration or rehabilitation costs.
    (k) Communications. All communications under this clause shall be in 
writing.
    (l) Overseas contracts. If this contract is to be performed outside 
of the United States of America, its territories, or possessions, the 
words Government and Government-furnished (wherever they appear in this 
clause) shall be construed as United States Government and United States 
Government-furnished, respectively.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). As prescribed in 45.106(b)(2), substitute 
the following paragraph (g) for paragraph (g) of the basic clause:

    (g) Limited risk of loss. (1) The term Contractor's managerial 
personnel, as used in this paragraph (g), means the Contractor's 
directors, officers, and any of the Contractor's managers, 
superintendents, or equivalent representatives who have supervision or 
direction of--
    (i) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business;
    (ii) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operation at any 
one plant or separate location at which the contract is being performed; 
or
    (iii) A separate and complete major industrial operation connected 
with performing this contract.
    (2) The Contractor shall not be liable for loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, the Government property provided under this contract (or, 
if an educational or nonprofit organization, for expenses incidental to 
such loss, destruction, or damage), except as provided in subparagraphs 
(3) and (4) below.
    (3) The Contractor shall be responsible for loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, the Government property provided under this contract 
(including expenses incidental to such loss, destruction, or damage)--
    (i) That results from a risk expressly required to be insured under 
this contract, but only to the extent of the insurance required to be 
purchased and maintained, or to the extent of insurance actually 
purchased and maintained, whichever is greater;
    (ii) That results from a risk that is in fact covered by insurance 
or for which the Contractor is otherwise reimbursed, but only to the 
extent of such insurance or reimbursement;
    (iii) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the 
express terms of this contract;
    (iv) That results from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on 
the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or
    (v) That results from a failure on the part of the Contractor, due 
to willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the 
Contractor's managerial personnel, to establish and administer a program 
or system for the control, use, protection, preservation, maintenance, 
and repair of Government property as required by paragraph (e) of this 
clause.
    (4)(i) If the Contractor fails to act as provided in subdivision 
(g)(3)(v) above, after being notified (by certified mail addressed to 
one of the Contractor's managerial personnel) of the Government's 
disapproval, withdrawal of approval, or nonacceptance of the system or 
program, it shall be conclusively presumed that such failure was due to 
willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor's 
managerial personnel.
    (ii) In such event, any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the 
Government property shall be presumed to have resulted from such failure 
unless the Contractor can establish by clear and convincing evidence 
that such loss, destruction, or damage--
    (A) Did not result from the Contractor's failure to maintain an 
approved program or system; or
    (B) Occurred while an approved program or system was maintained by 
the Contractor.
    (5) If the Contractor transfers Government property to the 
possession and control of a subcontractor, the transfer shall not affect 
the liability of the Contractor for loss or destruction of, or damage 
to, the property as set forth above. However, the Contractor shall 
require the subcontractor to assume the risk of, and be responsible for, 
any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the property while in the 
subcontractor's possession or control, except to the extent that the 
subcontract, with the advance approval of the Contracting Officer, 
relieves the subcontractor from such liability. In the absence of such 
approval, the subcontract shall contain appropriate provisions requiring 
the return of all Government property in as good condition as when 
received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for its use in 
accordance with the provisions of the prime contract.
    (6) Upon loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property 
provided under this contract, the Contractor shall so notify the 
Contracting Officer and shall communicate with the loss and salvage 
organization, if any, designated by the Contracting Officer. With the 
assistance of any such organization, the Contractor shall take all 
reasonable action to protect the Government property from further 
damage, separate the damaged and undamaged Government property, put all 
the affected Government property in the best possible order, and furnish 
to the Contracting Officer a statement of--

[[Page 289]]

    (i) The lost, destroyed, or damaged Government property;
    (ii) The time and origin of the loss, destruction, or damage;
    (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which the 
Government property is a part; and
    (iv) The insurance, if any, covering any part of or interest in such 
commingled property.
    (7) The Contractor shall repair, renovate, and take such other 
action with respect to damaged Government property as the Contracting 
Officer directs. If the Government property is destroyed or damaged 
beyond practical repair, or is damaged and so commingled or combined 
with property of others (including the Contractor's) that separation is 
impractical, the Contractor may, with the approval of and subject to any 
conditions imposed by the Contracting Officer, sell such property for 
the account of the Government. Such sales may be made in order to 
minimize the loss to the Government, to permit the resumption of 
business, or to accomplish a similar purpose. The Contractor shall be 
entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract price for the 
expenditures made in performing the obligations under this subparagraph 
(g)(7) in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause. However, the 
Government may directly reimburse the loss and salvage organization for 
any of their charges. The Contracting Officer shall give due regard to 
the Contractor's liability under this paragraph (g) when making any such 
equitable adjustment.
    (8) The Contractor represents that it is not including in the price 
and agrees it will not hereafter include in any price to the Government 
any charge or reserve for insurance (including any self- insurance fund 
or reserve) covering loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government 
property, except to the extent that the Government may have expressly 
required the Contractor to carry such insurance under another provision 
of this contract.
    (9) In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or otherwise 
compensated for any loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government 
property, the Contractor shall use the proceeds to repair, renovate, or 
replace the lost, destroyed, or damaged Government property or shall 
otherwise credit the proceeds to or equitably reimburse the Government, 
as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (10) The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's 
rights to recover against third parties for any loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, Government property. Upon the request of the Contracting 
Officer, the Contractor shall, at the Government's expense, furnish to 
the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the 
prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment in 
favor of the Government) in obtaining recovery. In addition, where a 
subcontractor has not been relieved from liability for any loss or 
destruction of, or damage to, Government property, the Contractor shall 
enforce for the benefit of the Government the liability of the 
subcontractor for such loss, destruction, or damage.
    Alternate II (JUL 1985). As prescribed in 45.106(b)(3), substitute 
the following paragraphs (c) and (g) for paragraphs (c) and (g) of the 
basic clause:

    (c) Title in Government property. (1) The Government shall retain 
title to all Government-furnished property.
    (2) All Government-furnished property and all property acquired by 
the Contractor, title to which vests in the Government under this 
paragraph (collectively referred to as Government property), are subject 
to the provisions of this clause. Title to Government property shall not 
be affected by its incorporation into or attachment to any property not 
owned by the Government, nor shall Government property become a fixture 
or lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real 
property.
    (3) Title to each item of facilities, special test equipment, and 
special tooling (other than that subject to a special tooling clause) 
acquired by the Contractor for the Government under this contract shall 
pass to and vest in the Government when its use in performing this 
contract commences, or when the Government has paid for it, whichever is 
earlier, whether or not title previously vested in the Government.
    (4) Title to equipment (and other tangible personal property) 
purchased with funds available for research and having an acquisition 
cost of less than $5,000 shall vest in the Contractor upon acquisition 
or as soon thereafter as feasible; provided, that the Contractor 
obtained the Contracting Officer's approval before each acquisition. 
Title to equipment purchased with funds available for research and 
having an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more shall vest as set forth in 
the contract. If title to equipment vests in the Contractor under this 
subparagraph (c)(4), the Contractor agrees that no charge will be made 
to the Government for any depreciation, amortization, or use under any 
existing or future Government contract or subcontract thereunder. The 
Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a list of all equipment 
to which title is vested in the Contractor under this subparagraph 
(c)(4) within 10 days following the end of the calendar quarter during 
which it was received.
    (5) Vesting title under this paragraph (c) is subject to civil 
rights legislation, 42 U.S.C. 2000d. Before title is vested and by 
signing

[[Page 290]]

this contract, the Contractor accepts and agrees that--

 No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under this 
contemplated financial assistance (title to equipment).
    (g) Limited risk of loss. (1) The term Contractor's managerial 
personnel, as used in this paragraph (g), means the Contractor's 
directors, officers, and any of the Contractor's managers, 
superintendents, or equivalent representatives who have supervision or 
direction of--
    (i) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business;
    (ii) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operation at any 
one plant, laboratory, or separate location at which the contract is 
being performed; or
    (iii) A separate and complete major industrial operation connected 
with performing this contract.
    (2) The Contractor shall not be liable for loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, the Government property provided under this contract (or, 
if an educational or nonprofit organization, for expenses incidental to 
such loss, destruction, or damage), except as provided in subparagraphs 
(3) and (4) below.
    (3) The Contractor shall be responsible for loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, the Government property provided under this contract 
(including expenses incidental to such loss, destruction, or damage)--
    (i) That results from a risk expressly required to be insured under 
this contract, but only to the extent of the insurance required to be 
purchased and maintained, or to the extent of insurance actually 
purchased and maintained, whichever is greater;
    (ii) That results from a risk which is in fact covered by insurance 
or for which the Contractor is otherwise reimbursed, but only to the 
extent of such insurance or reimbursement;
    (iii) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the 
express terms of this contract;
    (iv) That results from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on 
the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or
    (v) That results from a failure on the part of the Contractor, due 
to willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the 
Contractor's managerial personnel, to establish and administer a program 
or system for the control, use, protection, preservation, maintenance, 
and repair of Government property as required by paragraph (e) of this 
clause.
    (4)(i) If the Contractor fails to act as provided in subdivision 
(g)(3)(v) above, after being notified (by certified mail addressed to 
one of the Contractor's managerial personnel) of the Government's 
disapproval, withdrawal of approval, or nonacceptance of the system or 
program, it shall be conclusively presumed that such failure was due to 
willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor's 
managerial personnel.
    (ii) Furthermore, any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the 
Government property shall be presumed to have resulted from such failure 
unless the Contractor can establish by clear and convincing evidence 
that such loss, destruction, or damage--
    (A) Did not result from the Contractor's failure to maintain an 
approved program or system; or
    (B) Occurred while an approved program or system was maintained by 
the Contractor.
    (5) If the Contractor transfers Government property to the 
possession and control of a subcontractor, the transfer shall not affect 
the liability of the Contractor for loss or destruction of, or damage 
to, the property as set forth above. However, the Contractor shall 
require the subcontractor to assume the risk of, and be responsible for, 
any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the property while in the 
subcontractor's possession or control, except to the extent that the 
subcontract, with the advance approval of the Contracting Officer, 
relieves the subcontractor from such liability. In the absence of such 
approval, the subcontract shall contain appropriate provisions requiring 
the return of all Government property in as good condition as when 
received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for its use in 
accordance with the provisions of the prime contract.
    (6) Upon loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property 
provided under this contract, the Contractor shall so notify the 
Contracting Officer and shall communicate with the loss and salvage 
organization, if any, designated by the Contracting Officer. With the 
assistance of any such organization, the Contractor shall take all 
reasonable action to protect the Government property from further 
damage, separate the damaged and undamaged Government property, put all 
the affected Government property in the best possible order, and furnish 
to the Contracting Officer a statement of--
    (i) The lost, destroyed, or damaged Government property;
    (ii) The time and origin of the loss, destruction, or damage;
    (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which the 
Government property is a part; and
    (iv) The insurance, if any, covering any part of or interest in such 
commingled property.
    (7) The Contractor shall repair, renovate, and take such other 
action with respect to damaged Government property as the Contracting 
Officer directs. If the Government property is destroyed or damaged 
beyond practical repair, or is damaged and so commingled or combined 
with property of others

[[Page 291]]

(including the Contractor's) that separation is impractical, the 
Contractor may, with the approval of and subject to any conditions 
imposed by the Contracting Officer, sell such property for the account 
of the Government. Such sales may be made in order to minimize the loss 
to the Government, to permit the resumption of business, or to 
accomplish a similar purpose. The Contractor shall be entitled to an 
equitable adjustment in the contract price for the expenditures made in 
performing the obligations under this subparagraph (g)(7) in accordance 
with paragraph (h) of this clause. However, the Government may directly 
reimburse the loss and salvage organization for any of their charges. 
The Contracting Officer shall give due regard to the Contractor's 
liability under this paragraph (g) when making any such equitable 
adjustment.
    (8) The Contractor represents that it is not including in the price, 
and agrees it will not hereafter include in any price to the Government, 
any charge or reserve for insurance (including any self-insurance fund 
or reserve) covering loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government 
property, except to the extent that the Government may have expressly 
required the Contractor to carry such insurance under another provision 
of this contract.
    (9) In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or otherwise 
compensated for any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the Government 
property, the Contractor shall use the proceeds to repair, renovate, or 
replace the lost, destroyed, or damaged Government property or shall 
otherwise credit the proceeds to or equitably reimburse the Government, 
as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (10) The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's 
rights to recover against third parties for any loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, Government property. Upon the request of the Contracting 
Officer, the Contractor shall, at the Government's expense, furnish to 
the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the 
prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment in 
favor of the Government) in obtaining recovery. In addition, where a 
subcontractor has not been relieved from liability for any loss or

Sec. 52.245-5  Government Property (Cost-Reimbursement, Time-and-Material, or Labor-Hour Contracts).

    As prescribed in 45.106(f)(1), insert the following clause:

  Government Property (Cost-Reimbursement, Time-and-Material, or Labor-
                       Hour Contracts) (Jan 1986)

    (a) Government-furnished property. (1) The term Contractor's

with such related data and information as the Contractor may request and 
as may be reasonably required for the intended use of the property 
(hereinafter referred to as Government-furnished property).
    (3) The delivery or performance dates for this contract are based 
upon the expectation that Government-furnished property suitable for use 
will be delivered to the Contractor at the times stated in the Schedule 
or, if not so stated, in sufficient time to enable the Contractor to 
meet the contract's delivery or performance dates.
    (4) If Government-furnished property is received by the Contractor 
in a condition not suitable for the intended use, the Contractor shall, 
upon receipt, notify the Contracting Officer, detailing the facts, and, 
as directed by the Contracting Officer and at Government expense, either 
effect repairs or modification or return or otherwise dispose of the 
property. After completing the directed action and upon written request 
of the Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable 
adjustment as provided in paragraph (h) of this clause.
    (5) If Government-furnished property is not delivered to the 
Contractor by the required time or times, the Contracting Officer shall, 
upon the Contractor's timely written request, make a determination of 
the delay, if any, caused the Contractor and shall make an equitable 
adjustment in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause.
    (b) Changes in Government-furnished property. (1) The Contracting 
Officer may, by written notice, (i) decrease the Government-furnished 
property provided or to be provided under this contract or (ii) 
substitute other Government-furnished property for the property to be

Government under this contract. The Contractor shall promptly take such 
action as the Contracting Officer may direct regarding the removal, 
shipment, or disposal of the property covered by this notice.
    (2) Upon the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer 
shall make an equitable adjustment to the contract in accordance with

Schedule to

[[Page 293]]

make such property available for performing this contract and there is 
any--
    (i) Decrease or substitution in this property pursuant to 
subparagraph (b)(1) above; or

other contract or lease.

delivery of such property.
    (3) Title to all other property, the cost of which is reimbursable 
to the Contractor, shall pass to and vest in the Government upon--
    (i) Issuance of the property for use in contract performance;
    (ii) Commencement of processing of the property or use in contract 
performance; or
    (iii) Reimbursement of the cost of the property by the Government, 
whichever occurs first.
    (4) All Government-furnished property and all property acquired by 
the Contractor, title to which vests in the Government under this 
paragraph (collectively referred to as Government property), are subject 
to the provisions of this clause. Title to Government property shall not 
be affected by its incorporation into or attachment to any property not 
owned by the Government, nor shall Government property become a fixture 
or lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real 
property.
    (d) Use of Government property. The Government property shall be 
used only for performing this contract, unless otherwise provided in 
this contract or approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Property administration. (1) The Contractor shall be responsible 
and accountable for all Government property provided under the contract 
and shall comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 45.5, 
as in effect on the date of this contract.
    (2) The Contractor shall establish and maintain a program for the 
use, maintenance, repair, protection, and preservation of Government 
property in accordance with sound business practice and the applicable 
provisions of FAR subpart 45.5.
    (3) If damage occurs to Government property, the risk of which has 
been assumed by the Government under this contract, the Government shall 
replace the items or the Contractor shall make such repairs as the 
Government directs. However, if the Contractor cannot effect such 
repairs within the time required, the Contractor shall dispose of the 
property as directed by the Contracting Officer. When any property for 
which the Government is responsible is replaced or repaired, the 
Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in accordance 
with paragraph (h) of this clause.
    (f) Access. The Government and all its designees shall have access 
at all reasonable times to the premises in which any Government property 
is located for the purpose of inspecting the Government property.
    (g) Limited risk of loss. (1) The Contractor shall not be liable for 
loss or destruction of, or damage to, the Government property provided 
under this contract or for expenses incidental to such loss, 
destruction, or damage, except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) 
below.
    (2) The Contractor shall be responsible for loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, the Government property provided under this contract 
(including expenses incidental to such loss, destruction, or damage)--
    (i) That results from a risk expressly required to be insured under 
this contract, but only to the extent of the insurance required to be 
purchased and maintained or to the extent of insurance actually 
purchased and maintained, whichever is greater;
    (ii) That results from a risk that is in fact covered by insurance 
or for which the Contractor is otherwise reimbursed, but only to the 
extent of such insurance or reimbursement;
    (iii) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the 
express terms of this contract;
    (iv) That results from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on 
the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or
    (v) That results from a failure on the part of the Contractor, due 
to willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the 
Contractor's managerial personnel, to establish and administer a program 
or system for the control, use, protection, preservation, maintenance, 
and repair of Government property as required by paragraph (e) of this 
clause.
    (3)(i) If the Contractor fails to act as provided by subdivision 
(g)(2)(v) above, after being notified (by certified mail addressed to 
one of the Contractor's managerial personnel) of the Government's 
disapproval, withdrawal of approval, or nonacceptance of the system or 
program, it shall be conclusively presumed that such failure was due to 
willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor's 
managerial personnel.
    (ii) In such event, any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the 
Government property shall be presumed to have resulted from such failure 
unless the Contractor can establish by clear and convincing evidence 
that such loss, destruction, or damage--
    (A) Did not result from the Contractor's failure to maintain an 
approved program or system; or
    (B) Occurred while an approved program or system was maintained by 
the Contractor.

[[Page 294]]

    (4) If the Contractor transfers Government property to the 
possession and control of a subcontractor, the transfer shall not affect 
the liability of the Contractor for loss or destruction of, or damage 
to, the property as set forth above. However, the Contractor shall 
require the subcontractor to assume the risk of, and be responsible for, 
any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the property while in the 
subcontractor's possession or control, except to the extent that the 
subcontract, with the advance approval of the Contracting Officer, 
relieves the subcontractor from such liability. In the absence of such 
approval, the subcontract shall contain appropriate provisions requiring 
the return of all Government property in as good condition as when 
received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for its use in 
accordance with the provisions of the prime contract.
    (5) Upon loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property 
provided under this contract, the Contractor shall so notify the 
Contracting Officer and shall communicate with the loss and salvage 
organization, if any, designated by the Contracting Officer. With the 
assistance of any such organization, the Contractor shall take all 
reasonable action to protect the Government property from further 
damage, separate the damaged and undamaged Government property, put all 
the affected Government property in the best possible order, and furnish 
to the Contracting Officer a statement of--
    (i) The lost, destroyed, or damaged Government property;
    (ii) The time and origin of the loss, destruction, or damage;
    (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which the 
Government property is a part; and
    (iv) The insurance, if any, covering any part of or interest in such 
commingled property.
    (6) The Contractor shall repair, renovate, and take such other 
action with respect to damaged Government property as the Contracting 
Officer directs. If the Government property is destroyed or damaged 
beyond practical repair, or is damaged and so commingled or combined 
with property of others (including the Contractor's) that separation is 
impractical, the Contractor may, with the approval of and subject to any 
conditions imposed by the Contracting Officer, sell such property for 
the account of the Government. Such sales may be made in order to 
minimize the loss to the Government, to permit the resumption of 
business, or to accomplish a similar purpose. The Contractor shall be 
entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract price for the 
expenditures made in performing the obligations under this subparagraph 
(g)(6) in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause. However, the 
Government may directly reimburse the loss and salvage organization for 
any of their charges. The Contracting Officer shall give due regard to 
the Contractor's liability under this paragraph (g) when making any such 
equitable adjustment.
    (7) The Contractor shall not be reimbursed for, and shall not 
include as an item of overhead, the cost of insurance or of any reserve 
covering risk of loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government 
property, except to the extent that the Government may have expressly 
required the Contractor to carry such insurance under another provision 
of this contract.
    (8) In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or otherwise 
compensated for any loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government 
property, the Contractor shall use the proceeds to repair, renovate, or 
replace the lost, destroyed, or damaged Government property or shall 
otherwise credit the proceeds to, or equitably reimburse, the 
Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (9) The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's 
rights to recover against third parties for any loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, Government property. Upon the request of the Contracting 
Officer, the Contractor shall, at the Government's expense, furnish to 
the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the 
prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment in 
favor of the Government) in obtaining recovery. In addition, where a 
subcontractor has not been relieved from liability for any loss or 
destruction of, or damage to, Government property, the Contractor shall 
enforce for the benefit of the Government the liability of the 
subcontractor for such loss, destruction, or damage.
    (h) Equitable adjustment. When this clause specifies an equitable 
adjustment, it shall be made to any affected contract provision in 
accordance with the procedures of the Changes clause. When appropriate, 
the Contracting Officer may initiate an equitable adjustment in favor of 
the Government. The right to an equitable adjustment shall be the 
Contractor's exclusive remedy. The Government shall not be liable to 
suit for breach of contract for--
    (1) Any delay in delivery of Government-furnished property;
    (2) Delivery of Government-furnished property in a condition not 
suitable for its intended use;
    (3) A decrease in or substitution of Government-furnished property; 
or
    (4) Failure to repair or replace Government property for which the 
Government is responsible.
    (i) Final accounting and disposition of Government property. Upon 
completing this contract, or at such earlier dates as may be fixed by 
the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall submit, in a form 
acceptable to the Contracting Officer, inventory schedules

[[Page 295]]

covering all items of Government property not consumed in performing 
this contract or delivered to the Government. The Contractor shall 
prepare for shipment, deliver f.o.b. origin, or dispose of the 
Government property as may be directed or authorized by the Contracting 
Officer. The net proceeds of any such disposal shall be credited to the 
cost of the work covered by this contract or paid to the Government as 
directed by the Contracting Officer. The foregoing provisions shall 
apply to scrap from Government property; provided, however, that the 
Contracting Officer may authorize or direct the Contractor to omit from 
such inventory schedules any scrap consisting of faulty castings or 
forgings or of cutting and processing waste, such as chips, cuttings, 
borings, turnings, short ends, circles, trimmings, clippings, and 
remnants, and to dispose of such scrap in accordance with the 
Contractor's normal practice and account for it as a part of general 
overhead or other reimbursable costs in accordance with the Contractor's 
established accounting procedures.
    (j) Abandonment and restoration of Contractor premises. Unless 
otherwise provided herein, the Government--
    (1) May abandon any Government property in place, at which time all 
obligations of the Government regarding such abandoned property shall 
cease; and
    (2) Has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Contractor's 
premises under any circumstances (e.g., abandonment, disposition upon 
completion of need, or contract completion). However, if the Government-
furnished property (listed in the Schedule or specifications) is 
withdrawn or is unsuitable for the intended use, or if other Government 
property is substituted, then the equitable adjustment under paragraph 
(h) of this clause may properly include restoration or rehabilitation 
costs.
    (k) Communications. All communications under this clause shall be in 
writing.
    (l) Overseas contracts. If this contract is to be performed outside 
the United States of America, its territories, or possessions, the words 
Government and Government-furnished (wherever they appear in this 
clause) shall be construed as United States Government and United States 
Government-furnished, respectively.

                             (End of clause)

the following paragraph (c) for paragraph (c) of the basic clause:

    (c) Title. (1) The Government shall retain title to all Government-
furnished property.
    (2) All Government-furnished property and all property acquired by 
the Contractor, title to which vests in the Government under this 
paragraph (collectively referred to as Government property), are subject 
to the provisions of this clause. Title to Government property shall not 
be affected by its incorporation into or attachment to any property not 
owned by the Government, nor shall Government property become a fixture 
or lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real 
property.
    (3) Title to all property purchased by the Contractor for which the 
Contractor is entitled to be reimbursed as a direct item of cost under 
this contract and that, under the provisions of this contract is to vest 
in the Government, shall pass to and vest in the Government upon the 
vendor's delivery of such property. Title to all other property, the 
cost of which is to be reimbursed to the Contractor under this contract 
and that under the provisions of this contract is to vest in the 
Government, shall pass to and vest in the Government upon--
    (i) Issuance of the property for use in contract performance;
    (ii) Commencement of processing of the property or its use in 
contract performance; or
    (iii) Reimbursement of the cost of the property by the Government, 
whichever occurs first.
    (4) Title to equipment (and other tangible personal property) 
purchased with funds available for research and having an acquisition 
cost of less than $5,000 shall vest in the Contractor upon acquisition 
or as soon thereafter as feasible; provided, that the Contractor 
obtained the Contracting Officer's approval before each acquisition. 
Title to equipment purchased with funds available for research and 
having an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more shall vest as set forth in 
the contract. If title to equipment vests in the Contractor under this 
subparagraph (c)(4), the Contractor agrees that no charge will be made 
to the Government for any depreciation, amortization, or use under any 
existing or future Government contract or subcontract thereunder. The 
Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a list of all equipment 
to which title is vested in the Contractor under this subparagraph 
(c)(4) within 10 days following the end of the calendar quarter during 
which it was received.
    (5) Vesting title under this paragraph (c) is subject to civil 
rights legislation, 42 U.S.C. 2000d. Before title is vested and by 
signing

[[Page 296]]

this contract, the Contractor accepts and agrees that--

 No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under this 
contemplated financial assistance (title to equipment).

definitions apply:
    Facilities, as used in this clause, means all property provided 
under this facilities contract.
    Related contract, as used in this clause, means a Government 
contract or subcontract for supplies or services under which the use of 
the facilities is or may be authorized.
    (b) Facilities to be provided. (1) The Contractor, at Government 
expense and subject to the provisions of this contract, shall acquire, 
construct, or install the facilities and perform the related work as 
described in the Schedule.
    (2) The Government, subject to the provisions of this contract, 
shall furnish to the Contractor the facilities identified in the 
Schedule as Government-furnished facilities. The Contractor, at 
Government expense, shall perform the work with respect to those 
facilities as is described in the Schedule.
    (3) All shipments of the facilities shall be made on Government 
bills of lading, unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. 
The required number of such Government bills of lading will be furnished 
to the Contractor by, and the Contractor shall be accountable therefor 
to, the transportation activity designated by the Contracting Officer.
    (c) Period of this contract. If not otherwise specified in the 
contract and if not previously terminated under paragraph (m), the use 
of the facilities authorized under this contract shall terminate 5 years 
after its effective date. Thereafter, if continued use of the facilities 
by the Contractor is mutually desired, the parties shall enter into a 
new contract that shall incorporate such provisions as may then be 
required by applicable laws and regulations. The parties may, by written 
agreement, extend the use of the facilities under this contract beyond 
this 5-year period to permit the completion of any then-existing related 
contracts and subcontracts.
    (d) Title in the facilities. (1) The Government shall retain title

item of cost under this contract.
    (3) Title to replacement parts furnished by the Contractor in 
carrying out its normal maintenance obligations under paragraph (h) 
shall pass to and vest in the Government upon completion of their 
installation in the facilities.
    (4) Title to other property, the cost of which is reimbursable to 
the Contractor under this contract, shall pass to and vest in the 
Government upon--
    (i) Issuance of the property for use in performing this contract;
    (ii) Commencement of processing or use of the property in performing 
this contract; or
    (iii) Reimbursement of the cost of the property by the Government, 
whichever occurs first.
    (5) Title to the facilities shall not be affected by their 
incorporation into or attachment to any property not owned by the 
Government, nor shall any item of the facilities become a fixture or 
lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real

[[Page 297]]

property. The Contractor shall keep the facilities free and clear of all 
liens and encumbrances and, except as otherwise authorized by this 
contract or by the Contracting Officer, shall not remove or otherwise 
part with possession of, or permit the use by others of, any of the 
facilities.
    (6) The Contractor may, with the written approval of the Contracting 
Officer, install, arrange, or rearrange, on Government-furnished 
premises, readily movable machinery, equipment, and other items 
belonging to the Contractor. Title to any such item shall remain in the 
Contractor even though it may be attached to real property owned by the 
Government, unless the Contracting Officer determines that it is so 
permanently attached that removal would cause substantial injury to 
Government property.
    (7) The Contractor shall not construct or install, at its own 
expense, any fixed improvement or structural alterations in Government 
buildings or other real property without advance written approval of the 
Contracting Officer. Fixed improvement or structural alterations, as

facilities at any of the locations specified in the Schedule and, with 
the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer, at any other 
location. In granting this approval, the Contracting Officer may 
prescribe such terms and conditions as may be deemed necessary for 
protecting the Government's interest in the facilities involved. Those 
terms and conditions shall take precedence over any conflicting 
provisions of this contract.
    (f) Notice of use of the facilities. The Contractor shall notify the 
Contracting Officer in writing--
    (1) Whenever use of all facilities for Government work in any 
quarterly period averages less than 75 percent of the total use of the 
facilities; or
    (2) Whenever any item of the facilities is no longer needed or 
usable for performing existing related contracts that authorize such 
use.
    (g) Property control. The Contractor shall maintain property control 
procedures and records and a system of identification of the facilities, 
in accordance with the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation 
(FAR) subpart 45.5 in effect on the date of this contract. The 
provisions of FAR 45.5 are hereby incorporated by reference and made a 
part of this contract.
    (h) Maintenance. (1) Except as otherwise provided in the Schedule, 
the Contractor shall perform normal maintenance of the facilities in 
accordance with sound industrial practice, including protection, 
preservation, and repair of the facilities and normal parts replacement 
for equipment.
    (2) As soon as practicable after the execution of this contract, the 
Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written proposed 
maintenance program, including a maintenance records system, in 
sufficient detail to show its adequacy. If the Contracting Officer 
agrees to the proposed program, it shall become the normal maintenance 
obligation of the Contractor. The Contractor's performance according to 
the approved program shall satisfy the Contractor's obligations under 
subparagraphs (h)(1) and (h)(5) of this clause.
    (3) The Contracting Officer may at any time direct the Contractor in 
writing to reduce the work required by the normal maintenance program. 
If such order reduces the cost of performing the maintenance, an 
appropriate equitable adjustment may be made in any affected related 
contract that so provides.
    (4) The Contractor shall perform any maintenance work directed by 
the Contracting Officer in writing. Work in excess of the maintenance 
required under subparagraphs (h)(1) through (h)(3) of this clause shall 
be at Government expense. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting 
Officer in writing when sound industrial practice requires maintenance 
in excess of the normal maintenance program.
    (5) The Contractor shall keep records of all work done on the 
facilities and shall give the Government reasonable opportunity to 
inspect these records. When facilities are disposed of under this 
contract, the Contractor shall deliver the related records to the 
Government or, if the Contracting Officer directs, to third persons.
    (6) The Contractor's obligation under this clause for each item of 
facilities shall continue until the item is removed, abandoned, or 
disposed of; until the expiration of the 120-day period stated in 
subparagraph (n)(4) of this clause; and until the Contractor has 
discharged its other obligations under this contract with respect to 
such items.
    (i) Access. The Government and any persons designated by it shall, 
at all reasonable times, have access to the premises where any of the 
facilities are located.
    (j) Indemnification of the Government. The Contractor shall 
indemnify the Government and hold it harmless against claims for injury 
to persons or damage to property of the Contractor or others arising 
from the Contractor's possession or use of the facilities, except as 
specified in the clause at FAR 52.228-7, Insurance--Liability to Third 
Persons. However, the provisions of the Contractor's related contracts 
shall govern any assumption of liability by the Government for claims 
arising under those contracts.

[[Page 298]]

    (k) Late delivery, diversion, and substitution. (1) The Government 
shall not be liable for breach of contract for any delay in delivery or 
nondelivery of facilities to be furnished under this contract.
    (2) The Government has the right, at its expense, to divert the 
facilities under this contract by directing the Contractor to--
    (i) Deliver any of the facilities to locations other than those 
specified in the Schedule; or
    (ii) Assign purchase orders or subcontracts for any of the 
facilities to the Government or third parties.
    (3) The Government may furnish any facilities instead of having the 
Contractor acquire or construct them. In such event, the Contractor is 
entitled to reimbursement for the cost related to the acquisition or 
construction of the facilities, including the cost of terminating 
purchase orders and subcontracts.
    (4) Appropriate equitable adjustment may be made in any related 
contract that so provides and that is affected by any nondelivery, 
delay, diversion, or substitution under this paragraph (k).
    (l) Representations and warranties. (1) The Government makes no 
warranty, express or implied, regarding the condition or fitness for use 
of any facilities. To the extent practical, the Contractor shall be 
allowed to inspect all the facilities to be furnished by the Government 
before their shipment.
    (2) If the Contractor receives facilities in a condition not 
suitable for the intended use, the Contractor shall, within 30 days 
after receipt and installation thereof, so notify the Contracting 
Officer, detailing the facts and, as directed by the Contracting Officer 
and at Government expense, either (i) return such item or otherwise 
dispose of it or (ii) effect repairs or modifications. An appropriate 
equitable adjustment may be made in any related contract that so 
provides and that is affected by the return, disposition, repair, or 
modification of any facilities.
    (m) Termination of the use of the facilities. (1) The Contractor may 
at any time, upon written notice to the Contracting Officer, terminate 
its authority to use any or all of the facilities. Termination under 
this paragraph (m) shall not relieve the Contractor of any of its 
obligations or liabilities under any related contract or subcontract 
affected by the termination.
    (2) The Contracting Officer may at any time, upon written notice, 
terminate or limit the Contractor's authority to use any of the 
facilities. Except as otherwise provided in the Failure to Perform 
clause of this contract, an equitable adjustment may be made in any 
related contract of the Contractor that so provides and that is affected 
by such notice.
    (n) Disposition of the facilities. (1) The provisions of this 
paragraph (n) shall apply to facilities for which use has been 
terminated by either the Contracting Officer or the Contractor under 
paragraph (m), except as provided in subparagraph (n)(2).
    (2) Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, this 
paragraph shall not apply to facilities terminated by the Contractor 
if--
    (i) The facilities terminated do not comprise all of the facilities 
in the possession of the Contractor; and
    (ii) The Contracting Officer determines that continued retention of 
the facilities will not interfere with the Contractor's operations.
    (3) Within 60 days after the effective date of any notice of 
termination given under paragraph (m), or within such longer period as 
the Contracting Officer may approve in writing, the Contractor shall 
submit to the Contracting Officer, in a form satisfactory to the 
Contracting Officer, an accounting for all the facilities covered by the 
notice.
    (4) Within 120 days after the Contractor accounts for any facilities 
under subparagraph (n)(3), the Contracting Officer shall give written 
notice to the Contractor as to the disposition of the facilities, except 
as otherwise provided in subparagraph (n)(6). In its disposition of the 
facilities, the Government may either--
    (i) Abandon the facilities in place, in which case all obligations 
of the Government regarding such abandoned facilities and the 
restoration or rehabilitation of the premises in and on which they are 
located shall immediately cease; or
    (ii) Require the Contractor to comply, at Government expense, with 
such directions as the Contracting Officer may give with respect to--
    (A) The preparation, protection, removal, or shipment of the 
affected facilities;
    (B) The retention or storage of the affected facilities; provided, 
that the Contracting Officer shall not direct the Contractor to retain 
or store any items of facilities in or on real property not owned by the 
Government if such retention or storage will interfere with the 
Contractor's operations;
    (C) The restoration of Government-owned property incident to the 
removal of the facilities from such property; and
    (D) The sale of any affected facilities in such manner, at such 
times, and at such price as may be approved by the Government, except 
that the Contractor shall not be required to extend credit to any 
purchaser.
    (5) If the Contracting Officer fails to give the written notice 
required by subparagraph (n)(4) within the prescribed 120-day period, 
the Contractor may, upon not less than 30 days' written notice to the 
Government and at Government risk and expense, (i) retain the facilities 
in place or (ii) remove any of the affected severable facilities located 
in

[[Page 299]]

Contractor-owned property and store them at the Contractor's plant or in 
a public insured warehouse, in accordance with sound practice and in a 
manner compatible with their security classification. Except as provided 
in this subparagraph, the Government shall not be liable to the 
Contractor for failure to give the written notice required by 
subparagraph (n)(4).
    (6) Nonseverable items of the facilities or items of the facilities 
subject to patent or proprietary rights shall be disposed of in such 
manner as the parties may have agreed to in writing.
    (7) The Government, either directly or by third persons engaged by 
it, may remove or otherwise dispose of any facilities for which the 
Contractor's authority to use has been terminated, other than those for 
which specific provision is made in subparagraph (n)(6).
    (8) The Contractor shall, within a reasonable time after the 
expiration of the 120-day period specified in subparagraph (n)(4), 
remove all of its property from the Government property and take such 
action as the Contracting Officer may direct in writing with respect to 
restoring that Government property (to the extent that it is affected by 
the installation of the Contractor's property) to its condition before 
such installation.
    (9) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this contract, the 
Government shall not be obligated to the Contractor to restore or 
rehabilitate any property at the Contractor's plant, except for 
restoration or rehabilitation costs caused by removal of the facilities 
under subdivision (n)(4)(ii). The Contractor agrees to indemnify the 
Government against all suits or claims for damages arising out of the 
Government's failure to restore or rehabilitate any property at the 
Contractor's plant or property of its subcontractors, except any damage 
as may be caused by the negligence of the Government, its agents, or 
independent contractors.

<R05>
Sec. 52.245-8  Liability for the Facilities.

    As prescribed in 45.302-6(b), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when a consolidated facilities contract, a 
facilities acquisition contract, or a facilities use contract is 
contemplated.

                 Liability for the Facilities (Apr 1984)

    (a) The term Contractor's managerial personnel, as used in this 
clause, means any of the Contractor's directors, officers, managers, 
superintendents, or equivalent representatives who have supervision or 
direction of--
    (1) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business;
    (2) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operations at any 
one plant or separate location in which the facilities are installed or 
located; or
    (3) A separate and complete major industrial operation in connection 
with which the facilities are used.
    (b) The Contractor shall not be liable for any loss or destruction 
of, or damage to, the facilities, or for expenses incidental to such 
loss, destruction, or damage, except as provided in this clause.
    (c) The Contractor shall be liable for loss or destruction of, or 
damage to, the facilities, and for expenses incidental to such loss, 
destruction, or damage--
    (1) That results from a risk expressly required to be insured under 
this contract, but only to the extent of the insurance required to be 
purchased and maintained, or to the extent of insurance actually 
purchased and maintained, whichever is greater;
    (2) That results from a risk that is in fact covered by insurance or 
for which the Contractor is otherwise reimbursed, but only to the extent 
of such insurance or reimbursement;
    (3) For which the Contractor is otherwise responsible under the 
express terms of this contract;
    (4) That results from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on 
the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or
    (5) That results from a failure, due to willful misconduct or lack 
of good faith on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel--
    (i) To establish, maintain, and administer a system for control of 
the facilities in accordance with the Property administration paragraph 
of the Government Property clause; or
    (ii) To maintain and administer a program for maintenance, repair, 
protection, and preservation of the facilities, in accordance with the 
Property administration paragraph of the Government Property clause, or 
to take reasonable steps to comply with any appropriate written 
direction that the Contracting Officer may prescribe as reasonably 
necessary for the protection of the facilities. If the Government 
Property clause does not include the Property administration paragraph, 
then the Contractor shall exercise sound industrial practice in 
complying with the requirements of this subdivision (c)(5)(ii).
    (d)(1) If the Contractor fails to act as provided by subparagraph 
(c)(5) above, after being notified (by certified mail addressed to one 
of the Contractor's managerial personnel) of the Government's 
disapproval, withdrawal of approval, or nonacceptance of the system or 
program, it shall be conclusively

[[Page 300]]

presumed that such failure was due to willful misconduct or lack of good 
faith on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel.
    (2) Furthermore, any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the 
Government property shall be presumed to have resulted from such failure 
unless the Contractor can establish by clear and convincing evidence 
that such loss, destruction, or damage--
    (i) Did not result from the Contractor's failure to maintain an 
approved program or system; or
    (ii) Occurred while an approved program or system was maintained by 
the Contractor.
    (e) If the Contractor transfers facilities to the possession and 
control of a subcontractor, the transfer shall not affect the liability 
of the Contractor for loss or destruction of, or damage to, the 
facilities. However, the Contractor shall require the subcontractor to 
assume the risk of, and be responsible for, any loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, the facilities while in the subcontractor's possession or 
control, except to the extent that the subcontract, with the advance 
approval of the Contracting Officer, relieves the subcontractor from 
such liability. In the absence of such approval, the subcontract shall 
contain appropriate provisions requiring the return of all the 
facilities in as good condition as when received, except for reasonable 
wear and tear or for their utilization in accordance with the provisions 
of the prime contract.
    (f) Unless expressly directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, 
the Contractor shall not include in the price or cost under any contract 
with the Government the cost of insurance (including self-insurance) 
against any form of loss, destruction, or damage to the facilities. Any 
insurance required under this clause shall be in such form, in such 
amounts, for such periods of time, and with such insurers (including the 
Contractor as self-insurer in appropriate circumstances) as the 
Contracting Officer shall require or approve. Such insurance shall 
provide for 30 days advance notice to the Contracting Officer, in the 
event of cancellation or material change in the policy coverage on the 
part of the insurer. A certificate of insurance or a certified copy of 
such insurance shall be deposited promptly with the Contracting Officer. 
The Contractor shall, not less than 30 days before the expiration of 
such insurance, deliver to the Contracting Officer a certificate of 
insurance or a certified copy of each renewal policy. The insurance 
shall be in the name of the United States of America (Agency Name), the 
Contractor, and such other interested parties as the Contracting Officer 
shall approve, and shall contain a loss payable clause reading 
substantially as follows:

 Any loss under this policy shall be adjusted with (Contractor) and the 
proceeds, at the direction of the Government, shall be paid to 
(Contractor). Proceeds not paid to (Contractor) shall be paid to the 
office designated by the Contracting Officer.

    (g) When there is any loss or destruction of, or damage to, the 
facilities--
    (1) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer 
and, with the assistance of the Contracting Officer, shall take all 
reasonable steps to protect the facilities from further damage, separate 
the damaged and undamaged facilities, put all the facilities in the best 
possible order, and promptly furnish to the Contracting Officer (and in 
any event within 30 days) a statement of--
    (i) The facilities lost or damaged;
    (ii) The time and origin of the loss or damage;
    (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which the 
facilities are a part; and
    (iv) Any insurance covering any part of or interest in such 
commingled property;
    (2) The Contractor shall make such repairs, replacements, and 
renovations of the lost, destroyed, or damaged facilities, or take such 
other action as the Contracting Officer may direct in writing; and
    (3) The Contractor shall perform its obligations under this 
paragraph (g) at Government expense, except to the extent that the 
Contractor is liable for such damage, destruction, or loss under the 
terms of this clause, and except as any damage, destruction, or loss is 
compensated by insurance.
    (h) The Government is not obliged to replace or repair the 
facilities that have been lost, destroyed, or damaged. If the Government 
does not replace or repair the facilities, the right of the parties to 
an equitable adjustment in delivery or performance dates, price, or 
both, and in any other contractual condition of the related contracts 
affected shall be governed by the terms and conditions of those 
contracts.
    (i) Except to the extent of any loss or destruction of, or damage 
to, the facilities for which the Contractor is relieved of liability, 
the facilities shall be returned to the Government or otherwise disposed 
of under the terms of this contract (1) in as good condition as when 
received by the Contractor, (2) improved, or (3) as required under the 
terms of this contract, less ordinary wear and tear.
    (j) If the Contractor is in any way compensated (excepting proceeds 
from use and occupancy insurance, the cost of which is not borne 
directly or indirectly by the Government) for any loss or destruction 
of, or

[[Page 301]]

damage to, the facilities, the Contractor, as directed by the 
Contracting Officer, shall--
    (1) Use the proceeds to repair, renovate, or replace the facilities 
involved; or
    (2) Pay such proceeds to the Government.
    (k) The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's 
right to recover against third parties for any loss or destruction of, 
or damage to, the facilities. Upon the request of the Contracting 
Officer, the Contractor shall furnish to the Government, at Government 
expense, all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the 
prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment in 
favor of the Government) in obtaining recovery.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 52.245-9  Use and Charges.

    As prescribed in 45.302-6(c), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts (1) when a consolidated facilities contract 
or a facilities use contract or (2) when a fixed-price contract is 
contemplated, and Government production and research property is 
provided other than on a rent-free basis. If the conditions specified in 
45.403(a) apply, the contracting officer shall modify the clause, as 
appropriate.

                        Use and Charges (Apr 1984)

    (a) The Contractor may use the facilities without charge in the 
performance of--
    (1) Contracts with the Government that specifically authorize such 
use without charge;
    (2) Subcontracts of any tier under Government prime contracts if the 
Contracting Officer having cognizance of the prime contract (i) approves 
a subcontract specifically authorizing such use or (ii) otherwise 
authorizes such use in writing; and
    (3) Other work, if the Contracting Officer specifically authorizes 
in writing use without charge for such work.
    (b) If granted written permission by the Contracting Officer, or if 
it is specifically provided for in the Schedule, the Contractor may use 
the facilities for a rental fee for work other than that provided in 
paragraph (a). Authorizing such use of the facilities does not waive any 
rights of the Government to terminate the Contractor's right to use the 
facilities. The rental fee shall be determined in accordance with the 
following paragraphs.
    (c) The following bases are or shall be established in writing for 
the rental computation prescribed in paragraphs (d) and (e) below in 
advance of any use of the facilities on a rental basis:
    (1) The rental rates shall be those set forth in Table I.
    (2) The acquisition cost of the facilities shall be the total cost 
to the Government, as determined by the Contracting Officer, and 
includes the cost of transportation and installation, if borne by the 
Government.
    (i) When Government-owned special tooling or accessories are rented 
with any of the facilities, the acquisition cost of the facilities shall 
be increased by the total cost to the Government of such tooling or 
accessories, as determined by the Contracting Officer.
    (ii) When any of the facilities are substantially improved at 
Government expense, the acquisition cost of the facilities shall be 
increased by the increase in value that the improvement represents, as 
determined by the Contracting Officer.
    (iii) The determinations of the Contracting Officer under this 
subparagraph (c)(2) shall be final.
    (3) For the purpose of determining the amount of rental due under 
paragraph (d), the rental period shall be not less than 1 month nor more 
than 6 months, as approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (4) For the purpose of computing any credit under paragraph (e), the 
unit in determining the amount of use of the facilities shall be direct 
labor hours, sales, hours of use, or any other unit of measure that will 
result in an equitable apportionment of the rental charge, as approved 
by the Contracting Officer.
    (d) The Contractor shall compute the amount of rentals to be paid 
for each rental period by applying the appropriate rental rates to the 
acquisition cost of such facilities as may have been authorized for use 
in advance for the rental period.
    (e) The full rental charge for each period shall be reduced by a 
credit. The credit equals the rental amount that would otherwise be 
properly allocable to the work for which the facilities were used 
without charge under paragraph (a). The credit shall be computed by 
multiplying the full rental for the rental period by a fraction in which 
the numerator is the amount of use of the facilities by the Contractor 
without charge during the period, and the denominator is the total 
amount of use of the facilities by the Contractor during the period.
    (f) Within 90 days after the close of each rental period, the 
Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written statement 
of the use made of the facilities by the Contractor and the rental due 
the Government. At the same time, the Contractor shall make available 
such records and data as are determined by the Contracting Officer to be 
necessary to verify the information contained in the statement.
    (g) If the Contractor fails to submit the information as required in 
paragraph (f) above, the Contractor shall be liable for the full

[[Page 302]]

rental for the period. However, if the Contractor's failure to submit 
was not the fault of the Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall grant 
to the Contractor in writing a reasonable extension of time to submit.
    (h) Unless otherwise directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, 
the Contractor shall give priority in the use of the facilities to 
performing contracts and subcontracts of the Contracting Officer having 
cognizance of the facilities and shall not undertake any work involving 
the use of the facilities that would interfere with performing existing 
Government contracts or subcontracts.
    (i) Concurrently with the submission of the written statement 
prescribed by paragraph (f) of this clause, the Contractor shall pay the 
rental due the Government under this clause. Payment shall be by check 
made payable to the office designated for contract administration and 
mailed or delivered to the Contracting Officer. Receipt and acceptance 
by the Government of the Contractor's check pursuant to this paragraph 
shall constitute an accord and satisfaction of the final amount due the 
Government hereunder, unless the Contractor is notified in writing 
within 180 days following receipt that the amount received is not 
regarded by the Government as the final amount due.
    (j) If the Contractor uses any item of the facilities without 
authorization, the Contractor shall be liable for the full monthly 
rental, without credit, for such item for each month or part of a month 
in which such unauthorized use occurs; provided, however, that the 
agency head concerned may, in writing, waive the Contractor's liability 
for such unauthorized use if the agency head determines that without 
such a waiver gross inequity would result. The acceptance of any rental 
by the Government under this clause shall not be construed as a waiver 
or relinquishment of any rights it may have against the Contractor 
growing out of the Contractor's unauthorized use of the facilities or 
any other failure to perform this contract according to its terms.

                                 Table I

                              Rental Rates

    (i) For real property and associated fixtures, a fair and reasonable 
rental shall be established, based on sound commercial practice.
    (ii) For plant equipment of the types covered in Federal Supply 
classes 3405, 3408, 3410, and 3411 through 3419, machine tools; and in 
3441 through 3449, secondary metal forming and cutting machines, the 
following monthly rates shall apply:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Monthly   
                     Age of Equipment                       Rental Rate 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under 2 years old........................................  3.0 percent  
Over 2 to 3 years old....................................  2.0 percent  
Over 3 to 6 years old....................................  1.5 percent  
Over 6 to 10 years old...................................  1.0 percent  
Over 10 years old........................................  0.75 percent 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The age of each item of the equipment shall be based on the year in 
which it was manufactured, with a birthday on January 1 of each year 
thereafter. For example, an item of equipment manufactured on July 15, 
1978, will be considered to be over 1 year old on and after January 1, 
1979, and over 2 years old on and after January 1, 1980.
    (iii) For personal property and equipment not covered in (i) or (ii) 
above, a rental shall be established at not less than the prevailing 
commercial rate, if any, or, in the absence of such rate, not less than 
2 percent per month for electronic test equipment and automotive 
equipment and not less than 1 percent per month for all other property 
and equipment.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 52.245-10  Government Property (Facilities Acquisition).

    As prescribed in 45.302-6(d), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when a facilities acquisition contract is 
contemplated:

         Government Property (Facilities Acquisition) (Mar 1996)

    (a) Definitions.
    Facilities, as used in this clause, means all property provided 
under this facilities contract.
    Related contract, as used in this clause, means a Government 
contract or subcontract for supplies or services under which the use of 
the facilities is or may be authorized.
    (b) Facilities to be provided. (1) The Contractor, at Government 
expense and subject to the provisions of this contract, shall acquire, 
construct, or install the facilities and perform the related work as 
described in the Schedule.
    (2) The Government, subject to the provisions of this contract, 
shall furnish to the Contractor the facilities identified in the 
Schedule as Government-furnished facilities. The Contractor, at 
Government expense, shall perform the work with respect to those 
Government-furnished facilities as is described in the Schedule.
    (c) Title in the facilities. (1) The Government shall retain title 
to all Government-furnished property.
    (2) Title to all facilities and components shall pass to and vest in 
the Government upon delivery by the vendor of all such items purchased 
by the Contractor for which it is

[[Page 303]]

entitled to be reimbursed as a direct item of cost under this contract.
    (3) Title to other property, the cost of which is reimbursable to 
the Contractor under this contract, shall pass to and vest in the 
Government upon--
    (i) Issuance of the property for use in performing this contract;
    (ii) Commencement of processing or use of the property in performing 
this contract; or
    (iii) Reimbursement of the cost of the property by the Government, 
whichever occurs first.
    (4) Title to the facilities shall not be affected by their 
incorporation into, or attachment to, any property not owned by the 
Government, nor shall any item of the facilities become a fixture or 
lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real 
property. The Contractor shall keep the facilities free and clear of all 
liens and encumbrances and, except as otherwise authorized by this 
contract or by the Contracting Officer, shall not remove or otherwise 
part with possession of, or permit the use by others of, any of the 
facilities.
    (5) The Contractor may, with the written approval of the Contracting 
Officer, install, arrange, or rearrange, on Government-furnished 
premises, readily movable machinery, equipment, and other items 
belonging to the Contractor. Title to any such item shall remain in the 
Contractor even though it may be attached to real property owned by the 
Government, unless the Contracting Officer determines that it is so 
permanently attached that removal would cause substantial injury to 
Government property.
    (6) The Contractor shall not construct or install, at its own 
expense, any fixed improvement or structural alterations in Government 
buildings or other real property without advance written approval of the 
Contracting Officer. Fixed improvement, or structural alterations, as 
used herein, means any alteration or improvement in the nature of the 
building or other real property, that, after completion, cannot be 
removed without substantial loss of value or damage to the premises. The 
term does not include foundations for production equipment.
    (d) Property control. The Contractor shall maintain property control 
procedures and records and a system of identification of the facilities 
in accordance with the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation 
(FAR) subpart 45.5 in effect on the date of this contract. The 
provisions of FAR 45.5 are hereby incorporated by reference and made a 
part of this contract.
    (e) Access. The Government and any persons designated by it shall, 
at all reasonable times, have access to the premises where any of the 
facilities are located.
    (f) Indemnification of the Government. The Contractor shall 
indemnify the Government and hold it harmless against claims for injury 
to persons or damage to property of the Contractor or others arising 
from the Contractor's possession or use of the facilities, except as 
specified in the clause at FAR 52.228-7, Insurance--Liability to Third 
Persons. However, the provisions of the Contractor's related contracts 
shall govern any assumption of liability by the Government for claims 
arising under such related contracts.
    (g) Late delivery, diversion, and substitution. (1) The Government 
shall not be liable for breach of contract for any delay in delivery or 
nondelivery of facilities to be furnished under this contract.
    (2) The Government has the right, at its expense, to divert the 
facilities under this contract by directing the Contractor to--
    (i) Deliver any of the facilities to locations other than those 
specified in the Schedule; or
    (ii) Assign purchase orders or subcontracts for any of the 
facilities to the Government or third parties.
    (3) The Government may furnish any facilities instead of having the 
Contractor acquire or construct them. In such event, the Contractor is 
entitled to reimbursement for the cost related to the acquisition or 
construction of the facilities, including the cost of terminating 
purchase orders and subcontracts.
    (4) Appropriate equitable adjustment may be made in any related 
contract that so provides and that is affected by nondelivery, delay, 
diversion, or substitution under this paragraph (g).
    (h) Representations and warranties. (1) The Government makes no 
warranty, express or implied, regarding the condition or fitness for use 
of any facilities. To the extent practical, the Contractor shall be 
allowed to inspect all the facilities to be furnished by the Government 
before their shipment.
    (2) If the Contractor receives facilities in a condition not 
suitable for the intended use, the Contractor shall, within 30 days 
after receipt and installation thereof, so notify the Contracting 
Officer, detailing the facts, and, as directed by the Contracting 
Officer and at Government expense, either (i) return such item or 
otherwise dispose of it or (ii) effect repairs or modifications. An 
appropriate equitable adjustment may be made in any related contract 
that so provides and that is affected by the return, disposition, 
repair, or modification of any facilities.
    (i) Supersedure. Upon the acquisition, construction, or installation 
of the facilities called for by this contract, or any usable increment 
of the facilities, and acceptance by the Government, the facilities 
shall then be subject to the provisions of the facilities contract that 
authorizes the use of the items.

<R05>
Sec. 52.245-11  Government Property (Facilities Use).

    As prescribed in 45.302-6(e)(1), insert the following clause:

             Government Property (Facilities Use) (Apr 1984)

    (a) Definitions. Facilities, as used in this clause, means property 
provided under this facilities contract.
    Related contract, as used in this clause, means a Government 
contract or subcontract for supplies or services under which the use of 
the facilities is or may be authorized.
    (b) Period of this contract. If not otherwise specified in this 
contract and if not previously terminated under paragraph (k), the use 
of the facilities authorized under this contract shall terminate 5 years 
after its effective date. Thereafter, if continued use of the facilities 
by the Contractor is mutually desired, the parties shall enter into a 
new contract that shall incorporate such provisions as may then be 
required by applicable laws and regulations. The parties may, by written 
agreement, extend the use of the facilities under this contract beyond 
this 5-year period to permit the completion of any then-existing related 
contracts and subcontracts.
    (c) Title in the facilities. (1) Title to the facilities shall 
remain in the Government. Title to parts replaced by the Contractor in 
carrying out its normal maintenance obligations under paragraph (g) 
shall pass to and vest in the Government upon completion of their 
installation in the facilities.
    (2) Title to the facilities shall not be affected by their 
incorporation into or attachment to any property not owned by the 
Government, nor shall any item of the facilities become a fixture or 
lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real 
property. The Contractor shall keep the facilities free and clear of all 
liens and encumbrances and, except as otherwise authorized by this 
contract or by the Contracting Officer, shall not remove or otherwise 
part with possession of, or permit the use by others of, any of the 
facilities.
    (3) The Contractor may, with the written approval of the Contracting 
Officer, install, arrange, or rearrange, on Government-furnished 
premises, readily movable machinery, equipment, and other items 
belonging to the Contractor. Title to any such item shall remain in the 
Contractor even though it may be attached to real property owned by the 
Government, unless the Contracting Officer determines that it is so 
permanently attached that removal would cause substantial injury to 
Government property.
    (4) The Contractor shall not construct or install, at its own 
expense, any fixed improvement or structural alterations in Government 
buildings or other real property without advance written approval of the 
Contracting Officer. Fixed improvement or structural alterations, as 
used herein, means any alteration or improvement in the nature of the 
building or other real property that, after completion, cannot be 
removed without substantial loss of value or damage to the premises. The 
term does not include foundations for production equipment.
    (d) Location of the facilities. The Contractor may use the 
facilities at any of the locations specified in the Schedule and, with 
the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer, at any other 
location. In granting this approval, the Contracting Officer may 
prescribe such terms and conditions as may be deemed necessary for 
protecting the Government's interest in the facilities involved. Those 
terms and conditions shall take precedence over any conflicting 
provisions of this contract.
    (e) Notice of use of the facilities. The Contractor shall notify the 
Contracting Officer in writing--
    (1) Whenever use of all facilities for Government work in any 
quarterly period averages less than 75 percent of the total use of the 
facilities; or
    (2) Whenever any item of the facilities is no longer needed or 
usable for performing existing related contracts that authorize such 
use.
    (f) Property control. The Contractor shall maintain property control 
procedures and records, and a system of identification of the 
facilities, in accordance with the provisions of Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) subpart 45.5 in effect on the date of this contract. 
The provisions of FAR 45.5 are hereby incorporated by reference and made 
a part of this contract.
    (g) Maintenance. (1) Except as otherwise provided in the Schedule, 
the Contractor shall protect, preserve, maintain (including normal parts 
replacement), and repair the facilities in accordance with sound 
industrial practice.
    (2) As soon as practicable after the execution of this contract, the 
Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written proposed 
maintenance program, including a maintenance records system, in 
sufficient detail to show the adequacy of the proposed program. If the 
Contracting Officer agrees to the proposed program, it shall become the 
normal maintenance obligation of the Contractor. The Contractor's 
performance according to the approved program shall satisfy the 
Contractor's obligations under subparagraphs (g)(1) and (g)(5) of this 
clause.

[[Page 305]]

    (3) The Contracting Officer may at any time direct the Contractor in 
writing to reduce the work required by the normal maintenance program. 
If such order reduces the cost of performing the maintenance, an 
appropriate equitable adjustment may be made in any affected related 
contract that so provides.
    (4) The Contractor shall perform any maintenance work directed by 
the Contracting Officer in writing. Work in excess of the maintenance 
required under subparagraphs (g)(1) through (g)(3) of this clause shall 
be at Government expense. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting 
Officer in writing when sound industrial practice requires maintenance 
in excess of the normal maintenance program.
    (5) The Contractor shall keep records of all work done on the 
facilities and shall give the Government reasonable opportunity to 
inspect such records. When facilities are disposed of under this 
contract, the Contractor shall deliver the related records to the 
Government or, if directed by the Contracting Officer, to third persons.
    (6) The Contractor's obligation under this clause for each item of 
facilities shall continue until the item is removed, abandoned, or 
disposed of at the expiration of the 120-day period stated in 
subparagraph (l)(4) of this clause and when the Contractor has 
discharged its other obligations under this contract with respect to 
such items.
    (h) Access. The Government and any persons designated by it shall, 
at all reasonable times, have access to the premises where any of the 
facilities are located.
    (i) Indemnification of the Government. The Contractor shall 
indemnify the Government and hold it harmless against claims for injury 
to persons or damage to property of the Contractor or others arising 
from the Contractor's possession or use of the facilities under this 
contract. However, the provisions of the Contractor's related contracts 
shall govern any assumption of liability by the Government for claims 
arising under those contracts.
    (j) Representations and warranties. (1) The Government makes no 
warranty, express or implied, regarding the condition or fitness for use 
of any facilities. To the extent practical, the Contractor shall be 
allowed to inspect all the facilities to be furnished by the Government 
before their shipment.
    (2) If the Contractor receives facilities in a condition not 
suitable for the intended use, the Contractor shall, within 30 days 
after receipt and installation thereof, so notify the Contracting 
Officer, detailing the facts, and, as directed by the Contracting 
Officer and at Government expense, either (i) return such item or 
otherwise dispose of it or (ii) effect repairs or modifications. An 
appropriate equitable adjustment may be made in any related contract 
that so provides and that is affected by the return, disposition, 
repair, or modification of any facilities.
    (k) Termination of use of the facilities. (1) The Contractor may at 
any time, upon written notice to the Contracting Officer, terminate its 
authority to use any or all of the facilities. Termination under this 
paragraph (k) shall not relieve the Contractor of any of its obligations 
or liabilities under any related contract or subcontract affected by the 
termination.
    (2) The Contracting Officer may at any time, upon written notice, 
terminate or limit the Contractor's authority to use any of the 
facilities. Except as otherwise provided in the Failure to Perform 
clause of this contract, an equitable adjustment may be made in any 
related contract of the Contractor that so provides and that is affected 
by such notice.
    (l) Disposition of the facilities. (1) The provisions of this 
paragraph (l) shall apply to facilities whose use has been terminated by 
either the Contracting Officer or the Contractor under paragraph (k), 
except as provided in subparagraph (l)(2).
    (2) Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, this 
paragraph (l) shall not apply to facilities terminated by the Contractor 
if--
    (i) The facilities terminated do not comprise all of the facilities 
in the possession of the Contractor; and
    (ii) The Contracting Officer determines that continued retention of 
the facilities will not interfere with the Contractor's operations.
    (3) Within 60 days after the effective date of any notice of 
termination given under paragraph (k) or within such longer period as 
the Contracting Officer may approve in writing, the Contractor shall 
submit to the Contracting Officer an accounting for all the facilities 
covered by such notice. The submission of the Contractor shall be in a 
form satisfactory to the Contracting Officer.
    (4) Within 120 days after the Contractor accounts for any facilities 
under subparagraph (l)(3), the Contracting Officer shall give written 
notice to the Contractor as to the disposition of the facilities, except 
as otherwise provided in subparagraph (l)(6). In its disposition of the 
facilities, the Government may either--
    (i) Abandon the facilities in place, in which case all obligations 
of the Government regarding such abandoned facilities and the 
rehabilitation of the premises in and on which they are located shall 
immediately cease; or
    (ii) Require the Contractor to comply, at Government expense, with 
such directions as the Contracting Officer may give with respect to--
    (A) The preparation, protection, removal, or shipment of the 
affected facilities;

[[Page 306]]

    (B) The retention or storage of the affected facilities; provided, 
that the Contracting Officer shall not direct the Contractor to retain 
or store any items of facilities in or on real property not owned by the 
Government if such retention or storage will interfere with the 
Contractor's operations;
    (C) The restoration of Government-owned property incident to the 
removal of the facilities from such property; and
    (D) The sale of any affected facilities in such manner, at such 
times, and at such price as may be approved by the Government, except 
that the Contractor shall not be required to extend credit to any 
purchaser.
    (5) If the Contracting Officer fails to give the written notice 
required by subparagraph (l)(4) of this clause within the prescribed 
120-day period, the Contractor may, upon not less than 30 days' written 
notice to the Government, and at Government risk and expense, (i) retain 
the facilities in place or (ii) remove any of the affected severable 
facilities located in Contractor-owned property and store them at the 
Contractor's plant or in a public insured warehouse. Such removal and 
storage shall be in accordance with sound practice and in a manner 
compatible with the security classification of the facilities. Except as 
provided in this subparagraph (l)(5), the Government shall not be liable 
to the Contractor for failure to give the written notice required by 
subparagraph (l)(4).
    (6) Nonseverable items of the facilities or items of the facilities 
subject to patent or proprietary rights shall be disposed of in such 
manner as the parties may have agreed to in writing.
    (7) The Government, either directly or by third persons engaged by 
it, may remove or otherwise dispose of any facilities for which the 
Contractor's authority to use has been terminated, other than those for 
which specific provision is made in subparagraph (l)(6).
    (8) The Contractor shall, within a reasonable time after the 
expiration of the 120-day period specified in subparagraph (l)(4), 
remove all of its property from the Government property and take such 
action as the Contracting Officer may direct in writing with respect to 
restoring such Government property, to the extent that it is affected by 
the installation of the Contractor's property, to its condition before 
such installation.
    (9) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this contract, the 
Government shall not be obligated to the Contractor to restore or 
rehabilitate any property at the Contractor's plant, except for 
restoration or rehabilitation costs caused by removal of the facilities 
under subdivision (l)(4)(ii). The Contractor agrees to indemnify the 
Government against all suits or claims for damages arising out of the 
Government's failure to restore or rehabilitate any property at the 
Contractor's plant or property of its subcontractors, except any damage 
as may be caused by the negligence of the Government, its agents, or 
independent contractors.
    (m) Supersedure. (1) Facilities previously provided to the 
Contractor under the contracts specified in the Schedule of this 
contract shall become subject to this contract upon its effective date. 
The terms of those contracts by which such facilities were previously 
provided to the Contractor are hereby superseded with respect to such 
facilities, except for rights and obligations that may have accrued 
under such other contract before the effective date of this contract.
    (2) Facilities subsequently provided the Contractor under any 
contract shall, if that contract so specifies, be subject to this 
contract upon the completion of their construction, acquisition, and 
installation or upon their availability for use, whichever occurs first, 
except as otherwise provided in the contract or other document by which 
such facilities are provided to the Contractor.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (JUL 1985). As prescribed in 45.302-6(e)(2), substitute 
the following paragraph (c) of the basic clause:

    (c) Title. (1) Title to equipment (and other tangible personal 
property) having a unit acquisition cost of less than $5,000, purchased 
with funds available for research, shall vest in the Contractor upon 
acquisition or as soon thereafter as feasible, provided that the 
Contractor received the Contracting Officer's approval before acquiring 
the equipment. Title to other equipment purchased with Government funds 
shall vest in the Government. The Government may at any time during the 
term of this contract or upon its completion or termination transfer to 
the Contractor the title to any equipment purchased with funds available 
for research. Any such transfer shall be upon terms and conditions 
agreed to by the parties. The Contractor agrees that it shall not charge 
under any Government contract or subcontract any depreciation, 
amortization, or use of the equipment purchased or transferred under 
this paragraph. When title to equipment is vested in the Contractor or 
is transferred under this paragraph to the Contractor, the equipment 
ceases to be Government property. Within 10 days after the end of the 
calendar quarter in which such acquisition or transfer of title occurs, 
the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a list of all 
equipment, title to which is vested in the Contractor.
    (2)(i) The Government shall retain title to all Government-furnished 
property.
    (ii) Except as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1), title to all 
property shall pass to and vest in the Government upon delivery by the 
vendor of all such items purchased by the

[[Page 307]]

Contractor for which it is entitled to be reimbursed as a direct item of 
cost under this or a related contract.
    (iii) Title to replacement parts furnished by the Contractor in 
performing its normal obligations under paragraph (g) shall pass to and 
vest in the Government upon completion of their installation in the 
facilities.
    (iv) Title to other property, the cost of which is reimbursable to 
the contractor under this contract or a related contract, shall pass to 
and vest in the Government upon--
    (A) Issuance of the property for use in performing this contract;
    (B) Commencement of processing or use of the property in performing 
this contract; or
    (C) Reimbursement of the cost of the property by the Government, 
whichever occurs first.
    (3) Title to the facilities shall not be affected by their 
incorporation into or attachment to any property not owned by the 
Government, nor shall any item of the facilities become a fixture or 
lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real 
property. The Contractor shall keep the facilities free and clear of all 
liens and encumbrances and, except as otherwise authorized by this 
contract or by the Contracting Officer, shall not remove or otherwise 
part with possession of, or permit the use by others of, any of the 
facilities.
    (4) The Contractor may, with the written approval of the Contracting 
Officer, install, arrange, or rearrange, on Government-furnished 
premises, readily movable machinery, equipment, and other items 
belonging to the Contractor. Title to any such item shall remain in the 
Contractor even though it may be attached to real property owned by the 
Government, unless the Contracting Officer determines that it is so 
permanently attached that removal would cause substantial injury to 
Government property.
    (5) The Contractor shall not construct or install, at its own 
expense, any fixed improvement or structural alterations in Government 
buildings or other real property without advance written approval of the 
Contracting Officer. Fixed improvement, as used herein, means any 
alteration or improvement in the nature of the building or other real 
property that, after completion, cannot be removed without substantial 
loss of value or damage to the premises. The term does not include 
foundations for production equipment.
    (6) Vesting title under this paragraph (c) is subject to civil 
rights legislation, 42 U.S.C. 2000d. Before title is vested and by 
signing this contract, the Contractor accepts and agrees that--

 No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under this 
contemplated financial assistance (title to equipment).

    As prescribed in 45.302-7(e), insert the following clause:

              Facilities Equipment Modernization (Apr 1985)

    (a) The Contractor agrees to return to the Government the net cost 
savings realized from using modernized or replacement equipment provided 
by the Government under this contract. This applies to using such 
equipment on any contracts or subcontracts that are firm-fixed price, or 
that are fixed-price with economic price adjustment provisions, entered 
into within the 3 years following the date such equipment is placed into 
production. This provision does not apply to the use of such equipment

equipment.
    (b)(1) The Contractor shall maintain adequate records for 
implementing this clause. The Contractor shall make such records 
available at its office for inspection, audit, or reproduction by any

to maintain records and make them and additional information available 
to the Contracting Officer.
    (c) Records of equipment shall generally be acceptable if they are 
maintained under established accounting practices and permit a fair 
estimation of the net cost savings realized. Net cost savings realized 
shall be determined by a comparison of the Contractor's cost experience 
in the operation of the equipment before and after modernization.
    (d) Amounts due the Government under this clause shall be returned 
by the Contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer, by--
    (1) Credits to, or adjustment of the prices of, the related 
contracts benefitting from using the modernized or replacement 
equipment;
    (2) Payment to the Government through the Contracting Officer having 
cognizance of the equipment; or
    (3) Any other means mutually agreed to.

Sec. 52.245-17  Special Tooling.

    As prescribed in 45.306-5, insert the following clause:

                       Special Tooling (Dec 1989)

    (a) Definition. Special tooling means jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, 
patterns, taps, gauges, other equipment and manufacturing aids, all 
components of these items, and replacements of these items that are of 
such a specialized nature that without substantial modification or 
alteration their use is limited to the development or production of 
particular supplies or parts thereof or performing particular services. 
It does not include material, special test equipment, facilities (except 
foundations and similar improvements necessary for installing special 
tooling), general or special machine tools, or similar capital items. 
Special tooling for the purpose of this clause, includes all special 
tooling acquired or fabricated by the Contractor for the Government 
(other than special tooling to be delivered as a line item) or furnished 
by the Government for use in connection with and under the terms of the 
contract.
    (b) Title. The Government retains title to Government-owned special 
tooling and option to take title to all special tooling subject to this 
clause until such time as title or option to take title is relinquished 
by the Contracting Officer as provided for in subparagraphs (j)(2) and 
(j)(3) of this clause.
    (c) Risk of loss. Except to the extent that the Government shall 
have otherwise assumed the risk of loss to special tooling applicable to 
this clause, in the event of the loss, theft or destruction of or damage 
to any such property, the repair or replacement shall be accomplished by 
the Contractor at its own expense.
    (d) Special tooling furnished by the Government. (1) Except as 
otherwise provided in this contract, all Government-furnished special 
tooling is provided as is. The Government makes no warranty whatsoever 
with respect to special tooling furnished as is, except that the 
property is in the same condition when placed at the f.o.b. point 
specified in the solicitation as when last available for inspection by 
the Contractor under the solicitation.
    (2) The Contractor may repair any special tooling made available on 
an as is basis. Such repair will be at the Contractor's expense, except 
as otherwise provided in this clause. Such property may be modified as 
necessary for use under this contract at the Contractor's expense, 
except as otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Any repair or 
modification of property furnished as is shall not affect the title of 
the Government.
    (3) If there is any change in the condition of special tooling 
furnished as is from the time inspected or last available for inspection 
under the solicitation to the time placed on board at the location 
specified in the solicitation or the Government directs a change in the 
quantity of special tooling furnished or to be furnished, and such 
change will adversely affect the Contractor, the Contractor shall, upon 
receipt of the property, notify the Contracting Officer detailing the 
facts, and, as directed by the Contracting Officer, either (i) return 
such items at the Government's expense or otherwise dispose of the 
property or (ii) effect repair to return the property to its condition 
when inspected under the solicitation or, if not inspected, last 
available for inspection under the solicitation. After completing the 
directed action and upon written request of the Contractor, the 
Contracting Officer shall equitably adjust any contractual provisions 
affected by the return, disposition, or repair in accordance with

sequence.
    (4) Distribution of lists. The Contractor shall submit two copies of 
lists to each of the following recipients unless otherwise directed:
    (i) The Contracting Officer.

[[Page 311]]

    (ii) The Administrative Contracting Officer.
    (iii) The inventory control point designated by the contracting 
office.
    (j) Disposition instructions. The Contracting Officer shall provide 
the Contractor with written disposition instructions within 180 days of 
receipt of the list as prescribed by subparagraph (i)(1) of this clause 
and within 90 days of the receipt of excess special tooling lists 
reported in accordance with subparagraph (i)(2) of this clause. The 
Contracting Officer may direct disposition by any of the methods listed 
in subparagraphs (j)(1) through (j)(3) of this clause, or a combination 
of such methods. The Contractor shall comply with such disposition 
instructions.
    (1) The Contracting Officer may identify specific items of special 
tooling to be retained or give the Contractor a list specifying the 
products, parts, or services including follow-on requirements for which 
the Government may require special tooling and request the Contractor to 
identify all usable items of special tooling on hand that were designed 
for or used in the production or performance of such products, parts, or 
services. Once items of usable special tooling required by the 
Government are identified, the Contracting Officer may--
    (i) Direct the Contractor to transfer specified items of special 
tooling to follow-on contracts requiring their use. Those items shall be 
furnished for use on the contract(s) as specified by the Contracting 
Officer and shall be subject to the provisions of the gaining 
contracts(s); or
    (ii) Request the Contractor to enter into an appropriate storage 
contract for special tooling specified to be retained by the Contractor 
for the Government. Tooling to be stored shall be stored pursuant to a 
storage contract between the Government and the Contractor; or
    (iii) Direct the Contractor to transfer title to the Government (to 
the extent not previously transferred) and deliver to the Government 
those items of special tooling which are specified for removal from the 
Contractor's plant.
    (2) The Contracting Officer may direct the Contractor to sell, or 
dispose of as scrap, for the account of the Government, any special 
tooling not specified by the Government pursuant to subparagraph (j)(1) 
of this clause. To the extent that the Contractor incurs any costs 
occasioned by compliance with such direction, for which it is not 
otherwise compensated, the contract price shall be equitably adjusted in 
accordance with the Changes clause of this contract. The net proceeds of 
all sales shall either be credited to the cost of contract performance 
or shall be otherwise paid to the Government as directed by the 
Contracting Officer. Sale of special tooling to the prime Contractor or 
any of its subcontractors is subject to the prior written approval of 
the Contracting Officer.
    (3) The Contracting Officer may furnish the Contractor with a 
statement disclaiming further Government interest or right in specified 
special tooling.
    (4) Restoration of Contractor's premises. Unless otherwise provided 
in this contract, the Government has no obligation to restore or 
rehabilitate the Contractor's premises under any circumstances (e.g., 
abandonment, disposition upon completion of need, or upon contract 
completion). However, if special tooling is withdrawn or if other 
special tooling is substituted, then the equitable adjustment under 
paragraph (m) of this clause may properly include restoration or 
rehabilitation costs.
    (k) Access to special tooling. The Contractor shall provide access 
to special tooling subject to this clause at all reasonable times to all 
individuals designated by the Contracting Officer.
    (l) Storage or shipment. The Contractor shall promptly arrange for 
either the shipment or the storage of special tooling specified in 
accordance with the final disposition instructions in subdivisions 
(j)(1)(ii) or (j)(1)(iii) of this clause. Tooling to be shipped shall be 
properly packaged, packed, and marked in accordance with the directions 
of the Contracting Officer. All operation sheets or other appropriate 
data necessary to show the manufacturing operations or processes for 
which the items were used or designed shall accompany special tooling to 
be shipped or stored or shall otherwise be provided to the Government as 
directed by the Contracting Officer. To the extent that the Contractor 
incurs costs for storage, shipment, packing, crating, or handling under 
this paragraph and not otherwise compensated for, the contract price 
shall be equitably adjusted in accordance with the Changes clause of 
this contract.
    (m) Equitable adjustment. When this clause specifies an equitable 
adjustment, it shall be made to any affected contract provision in 
accordance with the procedures of the Changes clause. When appropriate, 
the Contracting Officer may initiate an equitable adjustment in favor of 
the Government. The right to an equitable adjustment shall be the 
Contractor's exclusive remedy. The Government shall not be liable to 
suit for breach of contract for--
    (1) Any delay in delivery of Government-furnished special tooling;
    (2) Delivery of Government-furnished special tooling in a condition 
not suitable for its intended use;
    (3) A decrease in or substitution of special tooling; or
    (4) Failure to repair or replace Government-furnished special 
tooling for which the Government is responsible.

[[Page 312]]

    (n) Subcontract provisions. In order to perform this contract, the 
Contractor may place subcontracts (including purchase orders) involving 
the use of special tooling. If the full cost of the tooling is charged 
to those subcontracts, the Contractor agrees to include in the 
subcontract appropriate provisions to obtain Government rights and data 
comparable to the rights of the Government under this clause (unless the 
Contractor and Contracting Officer agree in writing that such rights are 
not of interest to the Government). The Contractor agrees to exercise 
such rights for the benefit of the Government as directed by the 
Contracting Officer.

Sec. 52.245-18  Special Test Equipment.

    As prescribed in 45.307-3, insert the following clause:

                    Special Test Equipment (Feb 1993)

    (a) Special test equipment, as used in this clause, means either 
single or multipurpose integrated test units engineered, designed, 
fabricated, or modified to accomplish special purpose testing in 
performing a contract. It consists of items or assemblies of equipment, 
including standard or general purpose items or components, that are 
interconnected and interdependent so as to become a new functional 
entity for special testing purposes. It does not include material, 
special tooling, facilities (except foundations and similar improvements 
necessary for installing special test equipment), and plant equipment 
items used for general plant testing purposes.
    (b) The Contractor may either acquire or fabricate special test 
equipment at Government expense when the equipment is not otherwise 
itemized in this contract and the prior approval of the Contracting 
Officer has been obtained. The Contractor shall provide the Contracting 
Officer with a written notice, at least 30 days in advance, of the 
Contractor's intention to acquire or fabricate the special test 
equipment. As a minimum, the notice shall also include an estimated 
aggregate cost of all items and components of the equipment the 
individual cost of which is less than $5,000, and the following 
information on each item or component of equipment costing $5,000 or 
more:
    (1) The end use application and function of each proposed special 
test unit, identifying special characteristics and the reasons for the 
classification of the test unit as special test equipment.
    (2) A complete description identifying the items to be acquired and 
the items to be fabricated by the Contractor.
    (3) The estimated cost of the item of special test equipment or 
component.
    (4) A statement that intra-plant screening of Contractor and 
Government-owned special test equipment and components has been 
accomplished and that none are available for use in performing this 
contract.
    (c) The Government may furnish any special test equipment or 
components rather than approve their acquisition or fabrication by the 
Contractor. Such Government-furnished items shall be subject to the 
Government Property clause, except that the Government shall not be 
obligated to deliver such items any sooner than the Contractor could 
have acquired or fabricated them after expiration of the 30-day notice 
period in paragraph (b) of this clause. However, unless the Government 
notifies the Contractor of its decision to furnish the items within the 
30-day notice period, the Contractor may proceed to acquire or fabricate 
the equipment or components subject to any other applicable provisions 
of this contract.
    (d) The Contractor shall, in any subcontract that provides that 
special test equipment or components may be acquired or fabricated for 
the Government, insert provisions that conform substantially to the 
language of this clause, including this paragraph (d). The Contractor 
shall furnish the names of such subcontractors to the Contracting 
Officer.
    (e) If an engineering change requires either the acquisition or 
fabrication of new special test equipment or substantial modification of 
existing special test equipment, the Contractor shall comply with 
paragraph (b) above. In so complying, the Contractor shall identify the 
change order which requires the proposed acquisition, fabrication, or 
modification.

Sec. 52.245-19  Government Property Furnished ``As Is.''

    As prescribed in 45.308-2, insert the following clause:

            Government Property Furnished ``As Is'' (Apr 1984)

    (a) The Government makes no warranty whatsoever with respect to 
Government property furnished as is, except that the property is in the 
same condition when placed at the f.o.b. point specified in the 
solicitation as when inspected by the Contractor pursuant to the 
solicitation or, if not inspected by the Contractor, as when last

[[Page 313]]

available for inspection under the solicitation.
    (b) The Contractor may repair any property made available on an as 
is basis. Such repair will be at the Contractor's expense except as 
otherwise provided in this clause. Such property may be modified at the 
Contractor's expense, but only with the written permission of the 
Contracting Officer. Any repair or modification of property furnished as 
is shall not affect the title of the Government.
    (c) If there is any change in the condition of Government property 
furnished as is from the time inspected or last available for inspection 
under the solicitation to the time placed on board at the location 
specified in the solicitation, and such change will adversely affect the 
Contractor, the Contractor shall, upon receipt of the property, notify 
the Contracting Officer detailing the facts and, as directed by the 
Contracting Officer, either (1) return such property at the Government's 
expense or otherwise dispose of the property or (2) effect repairs to 
return the property to its condition when inspected under the 
solicitation or, if not inspected, last available for inspection under 
the solicitation. After completing the directed action and upon written 
request of the Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall equitably 
adjust any contractual provisions affected by the return, disposition, 
or repair in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Changes 
clause of this contract. The foregoing provisions for adjustment are the 
exclusive remedy available to the Contractor, and the Government shall 
not be otherwise liable for any delivery of Government property 
furnished as is in a condition other than that in which it was 
originally offered.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this clause, Government property 
furnished as is shall be governed by the Government Property clause of 
this contract.

    As prescribed in 46.301, insert the following clause:

              Contractor Inspection Requirements (Apr 1984)

    The Contractor is responsible for performing or having performed all 
inspections and tests necessary to substantiate that the supplies or 
services furnished under this contract conform to contract requirements, 
including any applicable technical requirements for specified 
manufacturers' parts. This clause takes precedence over any Government 
inspection and testing required in the contract's specifications, except 
for specialized inspections or tests specified to be performed solely by 
the Government.

Sec. 52.246-2  Inspection of Supplies--Fixed-Price.

    As prescribed in 46.302, insert the following clause:

              Inspection of Supplies--Fixed-Price (Aug 1996)

    (a) Definition. Supplies, as used in this clause, includes but is 
not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end 
products, and lots of supplies.
    (b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system 
acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and 
shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have 
been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been 
found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. 
As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing 
all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records 
shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during 
contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract 
requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as 
reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These 
reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not 
unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised 
or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the 
contract.
    (c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies 
called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and 
times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before 
acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a 
manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no 
contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the 
benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in 
this contract.
    (d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of 
the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and 
shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract 
price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and 
convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in 
the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government 
inspections or tests made at

[[Page 314]]

other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that 
in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any 
reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.
    (e)(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the 
Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to 
the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.
    (2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any 
additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes 
reinspection or retest necessary.
    (f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require 
correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when 
they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in 
conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject 
nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.
    (g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be 
corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit 
correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the 
Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or 
rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement 
for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action 
taken.
    (h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct 
rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or 
corrected, the Government may either (1) by contract or otherwise, 
remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the 
Contractor or (2) terminate the contract for default. Unless the 
Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery 
schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an 
equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall 
be a dispute.
    (i)(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government 
quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the 
Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time (i) when 
Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of the contract and (ii) when the supplies will be 
ready for Government inspection.
    (2) The Governments request shall specify the period and method of 
the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it 
shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of 
advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in 
the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.
    (j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as 
practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. 
Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall 
not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on 
the Government, for nonconforming supplies.
    (k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the 
Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet 
contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be 
conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting 
to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.
    (l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in 
paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights 
and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this 
contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no 
increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or 
nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the 
Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in 
accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon 
between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the 
Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the 
Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or (2) within a 
reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or 
nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable 
under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require 
correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, 
the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original 
point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original 
point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor 
fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not 
cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as 
the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of 
notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the 
Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or 
correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned 
the Government thereby.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (JUL 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is 
contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for 
paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.

    (g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be 
corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit 
correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not 
tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies

[[Page 315]]

without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, 
and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of 
removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, 
or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the 
incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by 
the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be 
at no increase in the total final price.
    (h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct 
rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or 
corrected, the Government may either (1) by contract or otherwise, 
remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target 
price or, if established, the total final price or (2) may terminate the 
contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the 
nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting 
Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price 
or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to 
agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.
    (l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in 
paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights 
and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this 
contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no 
increase in any target price or, if it is established, the total final 
price of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or 
nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the 
Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in 
accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon 
between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the 
Contracting Officer may require a reduction in any target price, or, if 
it is established, the total final price of this contract, if the 
Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or (2) within a 
reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or 
nonconformance, to repay such portion of the total final price as is 
equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not 
to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the 
Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the 
original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the 
original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the 
Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and 
does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer 
period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after 
receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, 
the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace 
or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it 
is established, the total final price of this contract.

    Alternate II (JUL 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with 
retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs 
(g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic 
clause:

    (g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be 
corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit 
correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not 
tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing 
the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required 
shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, 
replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be 
incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination 
clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the 
establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the 
redetermined price.
    (h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct 
rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or 
corrected, the Government may either (1) by contract or otherwise, 
remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the 
initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract 
prices or (2) terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor 
corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery 
schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and 
equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, 
the redetermined contract prices. Failure to agree upon an equitable 
price reduction shall be a dispute.
    (l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in 
paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights 
and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this 
contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no 
increase in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the 
redetermined prices of this contract, to correct or replace the 
defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or 
at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in 
accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon 
between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the 
Contracting Officer may require a reduction in the initial contract 
prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this 
contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or (2) 
within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of 
defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the

[[Page 316]]

initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined 
prices of this contract, as is equitable under the circumstances if the 
Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. 
When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear 
the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the 
Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is 
not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as 
required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a 
period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may 
authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting 
Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by 
contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably 
reduce the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the 
redetermined prices of this contract.

at any time require the Contractor to correct or replace,

[[Page 317]]

without cost to the Government, nonconforming supplies, if the 
nonconformances are due to (1) fraud, lack of good faith, or willful 
misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel or (2) 
the conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or 
retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial 
personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is 
habitually careless or unqualified.

replacement supplies as to supplies originally delivered.
    (j) The Contractor shall have no obligation or liability under this 
contract to replace supplies that were nonconforming at the time of 
delivery, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise 
provided in the contract.

obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be 
governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and 
convenient performance of these duties.
    (e) If any of the services do not conform with contract 
requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the 
services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase 
in contract amount. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by 
reperformance, the Government may (1) require the Contractor to take 
necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract 
requirements and (2) reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced 
value of the services performed.
    (f) If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again 
or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in 
conformity with contract requirements, the Government may (1) by 
contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor

    As prescribed in 46.307(a), insert the following clause:

      Inspection of Research and Development--Fixed-Price (Aug 1996)

    (a) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system 
acceptable to the Government covering the work under this contract. 
Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor 
shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract 
performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires.
    (b) The Government has the right to inspect and test all work called 
for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, 
including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. 
The Government may also inspect the premises of the Contractor or any 
subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government shall 
perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the 
work.
    (c) If the Government performs any inspection or test on the 
premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall 
furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in 
contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe

    (d) The Government shall accept or reject the work as promptly as 
practicable after delivery, unless otherwise specified in the contract. 
Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the work shall not 
relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the 
Government, for nonconforming work. Work is nonconforming when it is 
defective in material or workmanship or is otherwise not in conformity 
with contract requirements.
    (e) The Government has the right to reject nonconforming work. If 
the Contractor fails or is unable to correct or to replace nonconforming 
work within the delivery schedule (or such later time as the Contracting 
Officer may authorize), the Contracting Officer may accept the work and 
make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree on a price reduction 
shall be a dispute.
    (f) Inspection and test by the Government does not relieve the 
Contractor from responsibility for defects or other failures to meet the 
contract requirements that may be discovered before acceptance. 
Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross 
mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise specified in the contract. 
If acceptance is not conclusive for any of these causes, the Government, 
in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under 
other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the 
Contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace 
the defective or nonconforming supplies (work) at the original point of 
delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's 
election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may 
be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; 
provided, the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract 
price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or (2) 
within a reasonable time after the Contractor's receipt of notice of 
defects or nonconformance, to repayment of such portion of the contract 
price as is equitable under the circumstances if the Government elects 
not to require correction or replacement. When supplies (work) are (is) 
returned to the Contractor,

[[Page 320]]

the Contractor shall bear transportation costs from the original point 
of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point 
of delivery when that point is not the Contractor's plant.

replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the 
corrective action taken.
    (g)(1) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness 
to perform required replacement or correction, the Government may--
    (i) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, 
charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or make an equitable 
reduction in any fixed fee paid or payable under the contract;
    (ii) Require delivery of any undelivered articles and shall have the

under the contract; or
    (iii) Terminate the contract for default.

the Contractor or to the reduction in fixed fee shall be a dispute.
    (h) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g) above, the Government may 
at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or 
replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the 
Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the 
failure is due to (1) fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct

be on a no-fee basis, substitute paragraphs (f) and (g) below for 
paragraphs (f) and (g) of the basic clause.

    (f) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 
months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after

under this contract or any related contract.
    (d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of 
the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and 
shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and 
assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
    (e) The Contracting Officer may, at any time, require the Contractor 
to correct or replace facilities or work that is defective or does not 
conform to contract requirements.

[[Page 322]]

Except as provided in paragraph (f) below, corrections and replacements 
shall be at Government expense if, under the terms of this contract, the 
facilities or work corrected or replaced were initially furnished, or 
required to be performed at Government expense.
    (f) The Contracting Officer may, at any time, require the Contractor 
to correct or replace facilities or work that is defective or does not 
conform to contract requirements, without cost to the Government under 
this contract or any related contract or subcontract, if the defects or 
failures are due to fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on 
the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or to the conduct of 
one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the 
Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has 
reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless 
or unqualified.
    (g) Corrected or replacement facilities or work shall be subject to 
this clause in the same manner as facilities or work originally 
completed under the contract.

                               (Apr 1984)

    (a) Definition. Contract date, as used in this clause, means the 
date set for bid opening or, if this is a negotiated contract or a 
modification, the effective date of this contract or modification.
    (b) The Contractor shall comply with the specification titled ------
---- [Contracting Officer insert the title and number of the 
specification], in effect on the contract date, which is hereby 
incorporated into this contract.

                             (End of clause)

Sec. 52.246-12  Inspection of Construction.

    As prescribed in 46.312, insert the following clause:

                  Inspection of Construction (Aug 1996)

    (a) Definition. Work includes, but is not limited to, materials, 
workmanship, and manufacture and fabrication of components.
    (b) The Contractor shall maintain an adequate inspection system and 
perform such inspections as will ensure that the work performed under 
the contract conforms to contract requirements. The Contractor shall 
maintain complete inspection records and make them available to the 
Government. All work shall be conducted under the general direction of 
the Contracting Officer and is subject to Government inspection and test 
at all places and at all reasonable times before acceptance to ensure 
strict compliance with the terms of the contract.
    (c) Government inspections and tests are for the sole benefit of the 
Government and do not--
    (1) Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for providing adequate 
quality control measures;
    (2) Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for damage to or loss 
of the material before acceptance;
    (3) Constitute or imply acceptance; or
    (4) Affect the continuing rights of the Government after acceptance 
of the completed work under paragraph (i) below.
    (d) The presence or absence of a Government inspector does not 
relieve the Contractor from any contract requirement, nor is the 
inspector authorized to change any term or condition of the 
specification without the Contracting Officer's written authorization.
    (e) The Contractor shall promptly furnish, at no increase in 
contract price, all facilities, labor, and material reasonably needed 
for performing such safe and convenient inspections and tests as may be 
required by the Contracting Officer. The Government may charge to the 
Contractor any additional cost of inspection or test when work is not 
ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, or 
when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary. The 
Government shall perform all inspections and tests in a manner that will 
not unnecessarily delay the work. Special, full size, and performance 
tests shall be performed as described in the contract.
    (f) The Contractor shall, without charge, replace or correct work 
found by the Government not to conform to contract requirements, unless 
in the public interest the Government consents to accept the work with 
an appropriate adjustment in contract price. The Contractor shall 
promptly segregate and remove rejected material from the premises.
    (g) If the Contractor does not promptly replace or correct rejected 
work, the Government may (1) by contract or otherwise, replace or 
correct the work and charge the cost to the Contractor or (2) terminate 
for default the Contractor's right to proceed.

[[Page 323]]

    (h) If, before acceptance of the entire work, the Government decides 
to examine already completed work by removing it or tearing it out, the 
Contractor, on request, shall promptly furnish all necessary facilities, 
labor, and material. If the work is found to be defective or 
nonconforming in any material respect due to the fault of the Contractor 
or its subcontractors, the Contractor shall defray the expenses of the 
examination and of satisfactory reconstruction. However, if the work is 
found to meet contract requirements, the Contracting Officer shall make 
an equitable adjustment for the additional services involved in the 
examination and reconstruction, including, if completion of the work was 
thereby delayed, an extension of time.
    (i) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government shall 
accept, as promptly as practicable after completion and inspection, all 
work required by the contract or that portion of the work the 
Contracting Officer determines can be accepted separately. Acceptance 
shall be final and conclusive except for latent defects, fraud, gross 
mistakes amounting to fraud, or the Government's rights under any 
warranty or guarantee.

improvements:

  Inspection--Dismantling, Demolition, or Removal of Improvements (Aug 
                                  1996)

    (a) Unless otherwise designated by the specifications, all 
workmanship performed under the contract is subject to Government 
inspection at all times and places where dismantling or demolition work 
is being performed. The Contractor shall furnish promptly, and at no 
increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities, labor, and 
materials necessary for safe and convenient inspection by the 
Government. The Government shall perform inspections in a manner that 
will not unduly delay the work.
    (b) The Contractor is responsible for damage to property caused by 
defective workmanship. The Contractor shall promptly segregate and 
remove from the premises any unsatisfactory facilities, materials, and 
equipment used in contract performance, and promptly replace them with 
satisfactory items. If the Contractor fails to proceed at once in a 
workmanlike manner with performance of the work or with the correction 
of defective workmanship, the Government may (1) by contract or 
otherwise, replace the facilities, materials, and equipment or correct 
the workmanship and charge the cost to the Contractor and (2) terminate 
for default the Contractor's right to proceed. The Contractor and any 
surety shall be liable, to the extent specified in the contract for any 
damage or cost of repair or replacement.

solicitations and contracts for freight transportation services 
(including local drayage) by rail, motor (including bus), domestic 
freight forwarder, and domestic water carriers (including inland, 
coastwise, and intercoastal). The contracting officer shall not use the 
clause for the acquisition of transportation services by domestic or 
international air carriers or by international ocean carriers, or to 
freight services provided under bills of lading or to those negotiated 
for reduced rates under 49 U.S.C. 1072(b)(1). (See part 47, 
Transportation.)

                 Inspection of Transportation (Apr 1984)

    The Government has the right to inspect and test the Contractor's 
services, facilities, and equipment at all reasonable times. The 
Contractor shall furnish Government representatives with the free access 
and reasonable facilities and assistance required to accomplish their 
inspections and tests.

    (a) When authorized in writing by the cognizant Contract 
Administration Office (CAO), the Contractor shall ship with a 
Certificate of Conformance any supplies for which the contract would 
otherwise require inspection at source. In no case shall the 
Government's right to inspect supplies under the inspection provisions 
of this contract be

[[Page 324]]

prejudiced. Shipments of such supplies will not be made under this 
contract until use of the Certificate of Conformance has been authorized 
in writing by the CAO, or inspection and acceptance have occurred.
    (b) The Contractor's signed certificate shall be attached to or 
included on the top copy of the inspection or receiving report 
distributed to the payment office or attached to the CAO copy when 
contract administration (Block 10 of the DD Form 250) is performed by 
the Defense Contract Administration Services. In addition, a copy of the 
signed certificate shall also be attached to or entered on copies of the 
inspection or receiving report accompanying the shipment.
    (c) The Government has the right to reject defective supplies or 
services within a reasonable time after delivery by written notification 
to the Contractor. The Contractor shall in such event promptly replace, 
correct, or repair the rejected supplies or services at the Contractor's

    (a) Title to supplies furnished under this contract shall pass to 
the Government upon formal acceptance, regardless of when or where the 
Government takes physical possession, unless the contract specifically 
provides for earlier passage of title.
    (b) Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of 
loss of or damage to supplies shall remain with the Contractor until, 
and shall pass to the Government upon--
    (1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is 
f.o.b. origin; or
    (2) Acceptance by the Government or delivery of the supplies to the 
Government at the destination specified in the contract, whichever is 
later, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.

conform to contract requirements as to give a right of rejection. The 
risk of loss of or damage to such nonconforming supplies remains with 
the Contractor until cure or acceptance. After cure or acceptance, 
paragraph (b) above shall apply.

Sec. 52.246-17  Warranty of Supplies of a Noncomplex Nature.

    As prescribed in 46.710(a)(1), the contracting officer may insert a 
clause substantially as follows in solicitations and contracts for 
noncomplex items when a fixed-price supply contract is contemplated and 
the use of a warranty clause has been approved under agency procedures. 
If the contractor's design rather than the Government's design is to be 
used, insert the word design before material in paragraph (b)(1)(i).

          Warranty of Supplies of a Noncomplex Nature (Apr 1984)

    (a) Definitions. Acceptance, as used in this clause, means the act 
of an authorized representative of the Government by which the 
Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of 
existing supplies, or approves specific services as partial or complete 
performance of the contract.
    Correction, as used in this clause, means the elimination of a 
defect.
    Supplies, as used in this clause, means the end item furnished by 
the Contractor and related services required under the contract. The 
word does not include data.
    (b) Contractor's obligations. (1) Notwithstanding inspection and 
acceptance by the Government of supplies furnished under this contract, 
or any condition of this contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, 
the Contractor warrants that for -------- [Contracting Officer shall 
state specific period of time after delivery, or the specified event 
whose occurrence will terminate the warranty period;

[[Page 325]]

e.g., the number of miles or hours of use, or combinations of any 
applicable events or periods of time]--
    (i) All supplies furnished under this contract will be free from 
defects in material or workmanship and will conform with all 
requirements of this contract; and
    (ii) The preservation, packaging, packing, and marking, and the 
preparation for, and method of, shipment of such supplies will conform 
with the requirements of this contract.
    (2) When return, correction, or replacement is required, 
transportation charges and responsibility for the supplies while in 
transit shall be borne by the Contractor. However, the Contractor's 
liability for the transportation charges shall not exceed an amount 
equal to the cost of transportation by the usual commercial method of 
shipment between the place of delivery specified in this contract and 
the Contractor's plant, and return.
    (3) Any supplies or parts thereof, corrected or furnished in 
replacement under this clause, shall also be subject to the terms of 
this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. The 
warranty, with respect to supplies or parts thereof, shall be equal in 
duration to that in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from 
the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies.
    (4) All implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a 
particular purpose are excluded from any obligation contained in this 
contract.
    (c) Remedies available to the Government. (1) The Contracting 
Officer shall give written notice to the Contractor of any breach of 
warranties in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause within -------- 
[Contracting Officer shall insert specific period of time; e.g., ``45 
days of the last delivery under this contract,'' or ``45 days after 
discovery of the defect''].
    (2) Within a reasonable time after the notice, the Contracting 
Officer may either--
    (i) Require, by written notice, the prompt correction or replacement 
of any supplies or parts thereof (including preservation, packaging, 
packing, and marking) that do not conform with the requirements of this 
contract within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this clause; or
    (ii) Retain such supplies and reduce the contract price by an amount 
equitable under the circumstances.
    (3)(i) If the contract provides for inspection of supplies by 
sampling procedures, conformance of supplies or components subject to 
warranty action shall be determined by the applicable sampling 
procedures in the contract. The Contracting Officer--
    (A) May, for sampling purposes, group any supplies delivered under 
this contract;
    (B) Shall require the size of the sample to be that required by 
sampling procedures specified in the contract for the quantity of 
supplies on which warranty action is proposed;
    (C) May project warranty sampling results over supplies in the same 
shipment or other supplies contained in other shipments even though all 
of such supplies are not present at the point of reinspection; provided, 
that the supplies remaining are reasonably representative of the 
quantity on which warranty action is proposed; and
    (D) Need not use the same lot size as on original inspection or 
reconstitute the original inspection lots.
    (ii) Within a reasonable time after notice of any breach of the 
warranties specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contracting 
Officer may exercise one or more of the following options:
    (A) Require an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any 
group of supplies.
    (B) Screen the supplies grouped for warranty action under this 
clause at the Contractor's expense and return all nonconforming supplies 
to the Contractor for correction or replacement.
    (C) Require the Contractor to screen the supplies at locations 
designated by the Government within the continental United States and to 
correct or replace all nonconforming supplies.
    (D) Return the supplies grouped for warranty action under this 
clause to the Contractor (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point 
of acceptance) for screening and correction or replacement.
    (4) (i) The Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, 
correct or replace the nonconforming supplies with similar supplies from 
another source and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the 
Government thereby if the Contractor--
    (A) Fails to make redelivery of the corrected or replaced supplies 
within the time established for their return; or
    (B) Fails either to accept return of the nonconforming supplies or 
fails to make progress after their return to correct or replace them so 
as to endanger performance of the delivery schedule, and in either of 
these circumstances does not cure such failure within a period of 10 
days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in 
writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying 
such failure.
    (ii) Instead of correction or replacement by the Government, the 
Contracting Officer may require an equitable adjustment of the contract 
price. In addition, if the Contractor fails to furnish timely 
disposition instructions, the Contracting Officer may dispose of the 
nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account in a reasonable 
manner. The Government is entitled to reimbursement from the Contractor, 
or from the proceeds of such disposal, for the reasonable expenses of

[[Page 326]]

the care and disposition of the nonconforming supplies, as well as for 
excess costs incurred or to be incurred.
    (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this 
clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the 
Government by any other clause of this contract.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I [Reserved]
    Alternate II (APR 1984). If it is desirable to specify that 
necessary transportation incident to correction or replacement will be 
at the Government's expense (as might be the case if, for example, the 
cost of a warranty would otherwise be prohibitive), substitute a 
paragraph substantially the same as the following paragraph (b)(2) for 
paragraph (b)(2) of the basic clause:

    (2) If correction or replacement is required and transportation of 
supplies in connection with correction or replacement is necessary, 
transportation charges and responsibility for the supplies while in 
transit shall be borne by the Government.
    Alternate III (APR 1984). If the supplies cannot be obtained from 
another source, substitute a paragraph substantially the same as the 
following paragraph (c)(4) for paragraph (c)(4) of the basic clause:

    (4) If the Contractor does not agree as to responsibility to correct 
or replace the supplies delivered, the Contractor shall nevertheless 
proceed in accordance with the written request issued by the Contracting 
Officer under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause to correct or replace the 
defective or nonconforming supplies. In the event it is later determined 
that the supplies were not defective or nonconforming within the terms 
and conditions of this clause, the contract price will be equitably 
adjusted.
    Alternate IV (APR 1984). If a fixed-price incentive contract is 
contemplated, add a paragraph substantially the same as the following 
paragraph(c)(6) to the basic clause:

    (6) All costs incurred or estimated to be incurred by the Contractor 
in complying with this clause shall be considered when negotiating the 
total final price under the Incentive Price Revision clause of this 
contract. After establishment of the total final price, Contractor 
compliance with this clause shall be at no increase in the total final 
price. Any equitable adjustment made under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
clause shall be governed by the paragraph entitled Equitable Adjustments 
Under Other Clauses in the Incentive Price Revision clause of this 
contract.
    Alternate V (APR 1984). If it is anticipated that recovery of the 
warranted item will involve considerable Government expense for 
disassembly and/or reassembly of larger items, add a paragraph 
substantially the same as the following paragraph (c)(6) to the basic 
clause. Redesignate the additional paragraph as (c)(7) if Alternate IV 
is also being used.

    (6) The Contractor shall be liable for the reasonable costs of 
disassembly and/or reassembly of larger items when it is necessary to 
remove the supplies to be inspected and/or returned for correction or 
replacement.

Sec. 52.246-18  Warranty of Supplies of a Complex Nature.

    As prescribed in 46.710(b)(1), the contracting officer may insert a 
clause substantially as follows in solicitations and contracts for 
deliverable complex items when a fixed-price supply or research and 
development contract is contemplated and the use of a warranty clause 
has been approved under agency procedures. If the contractor's design 
rather than the Government's design is to be used, insert the word 
design before material in paragraph (b)(1).

           Warranty of Supplies of a Complex Nature (Apr 1984)

    (a) Definitions. Acceptance, as used in this clause, means the act 
of an authorized representative of the Government by which the 
Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of 
existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services 
rendered, as partial or complete performance of the contract.
    Correction, as used in this clause, means the elimination of a 
defect.
    Supplies, as used in this clause, means the end items furnished by 
the Contractor and related services required under this contract. The 
word does not include data.
    (b) Contractor's obligations. (1) The Contractor warrants that for 
-------- [Contracting Officer shall state the specific warranty period 
after delivery, or the specified event whose occurrence will terminate 
the warranty period; e.g., the number of miles or hours of use, or 
combinations of any applicable events or periods of time] all supplies 
furnished under this contract will be free from defects in material and 
workmanship and will conform with all

[[Page 327]]

requirements of this contract; provided, however, that with respect to 
Government-furnished property, the Contractor's warranty shall extend 
only to its proper installation, unless the Contractor performs some 
modification or other work on the property, in which case the 
Contractor's warranty shall extend to the modification or other work.
    (2) Any supplies or parts thereof corrected or furnished in 
replacement shall be subject to the conditions of this clause to the 
same extent as supplies initially delivered. This warranty shall be 
equal in duration to that set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause 
and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced 
supplies.
    (3) The Contractor shall not be obligated to correct or replace 
supplies if the facilities, tooling, drawings, or other equipment or 
supplies necessary to accomplish the correction or replacement have been 
made unavailable to the Contractor by action of the Government. In the 
event that correction or replacement has been directed, the Contractor 
shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the 
nonavailability.
    (4) The Contractor shall also prepare and furnish to the Government 
data and reports applicable to any correction required (including 
revision and updating of all affected data called for under this 
contract) at no increase in the contract price.
    (5) When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor 
shall bear the transportation costs from the place of delivery specified 
in the contract (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of 
acceptance) to the Contractor's plant and return.
    (6) All implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a 
particular purpose are excluded from any obligation contained in this 
contract.
    (c)  Remedies available to the Government. (1) In the event of a 
breach of the Contractor's warranty in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, 
the Government may, at no increase in contract price--
    (i) Require the Contractor, at the place of delivery specified in 
the contract (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of 
acceptance) or at the Contractor's plant, to repair or replace, at the 
Contractor's election, defective or nonconforming supplies; or
    (ii) Require the Contractor to furnish at the Contractor's plant the 
materials or parts and installation instructions required to 
successfully accomplish the correction.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer does not require correction or 
replacement of defective or nonconforming supplies or the Contractor is 
not obligated to correct or replace under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
clause, the Government shall be entitled to an equitable reduction in 
the contract price.
    (3) The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing 
of any breach of the warranty in paragraph (b) of this clause within --
-------- [Contracting Officer shall insert specific period of time in 
which notice shall be given to the Contractor; e.g., 45 days after 
delivery of the nonconforming supplies.; 45 days of the last delivery 
under this contract.; or 45 days after discovery of the defect.] The 
Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written 
recommendation within -------- [Contracting Officer shall insert period 
of time] as to the corrective action required to remedy the breach. 
After the notice of breach, but not later than -------- [Contracting 
Officer shall insert period within which the warranty remedies should be 
exercised] after receipt of the Contractor's recommendation for 
corrective action, the Contracting Officer may, in writing, direct 
correction or replacement as in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, and the 
Contractor shall, notwithstanding any disagreement regarding the 
existence of a breach of warranty, comply with this direction. If it is 
later determined that the Contractor did not breach the warranty in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the contract price will be equitably 
adjusted.
    (4) If supplies are corrected or replaced, the period for 
notification of a breach of the Contractor's warranty in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this clause shall be -------- [Contracting Officer shall 
insert period within which the Contractor must be notified of a breach 
as to corrected or replaced supplies] from the furnishing or return by 
the Contractor to the Government of the corrected or replaced supplies 
or parts thereof, or, if correction or replacement is effected by the 
Contractor at a Government or other activity, for -------- [Contracting 
Officer shall insert period within which the Contractor must be notified 
of a breach of warranty as to corrected or replaced supplies] 
thereafter.
    (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this 
clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the 
Government by any other clause of the contract.

                             (End of clause)

necessary transportation incident to correction or replacement will be 
at the Government's expense (as might be the case if, for example, the 
cost of a warranty would otherwise be prohibitive), substitute a

Sec. 52.246-19  Warranty of Systems and Equipment under Performance Specifications or Design Criteria.

    As prescribed in 46.710(c)(1), the contracting officer may insert a 
clause substantially as follows in solicitations and contracts when 
performance specifications or design are of major importance; a fixed-
price supply, service, or research and development contract for systems 
and equipment is contemplated, and the use of a warranty clause has been 
approved under agency procedures.

 Warranty of Systems and Equipment Under Performance Specifications or 
                       Design Criteria (Dec 1989)

    (a) Definitions. Acceptance, as used in this clause, means the act 
of an authorized representative of the Government by which the 
Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of 
existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services 
rendered, as partial or complete performance of the contract.
    Correction, as used in this clause, means the elimination of a 
defect.
    Defect, as used in this clause, means any condition or 
characteristic in any supplies or services furnished by the Contractor 
under the contract that is not in compliance with the requirements of 
the contract.
    Supplies, as used in this clause, means the end items furnished by 
the Contractor and related services required under this contract. Except 
when this contract includes the clause entitled Warranty of Data, 
supplies also means data.
    (b) Contractor's obligations. (1) The Contractor's warranties under 
this clause shall apply only to those defects discovered by either the 
Government or the Contractor -------- [Contracting Officer shall state 
the warranty period; e.g., at the time of delivery; within 45 days after 
delivery, or the specified event whose occurrence will terminate the 
warranty period; e.g., the number of miles or hours of use, or 
combination of any applicable events or periods of time.]
    (2) If the Contractor becomes aware at any time before acceptance by 
the Government (whether before or after tender to the Government) that a 
defect exists in any supplies or services, the Contractor shall (i) 
promptly correct the defect or (ii) promptly notify the Contracting 
Officer, in writing, of the defect, using the same procedures prescribed 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause.
    (3) If the Contracting Officer determines that a defect exists in 
any of the supplies or services accepted by the Government under this 
contract, the Contracting Officer shall promptly notify the Contractor 
of the defect, in writing, within -------- [Contracting Officer shall 
insert the specific period of time in which notice shall be given to the 
Contractor; e.g., 30 days after delivery of the nonconforming supplies; 
90 days of the last delivery under this contract; or 90 days after 
discovery of the defect.] Upon timely notification of the existence of a 
defect, or if the Contractor independently discovers a defect in 
accepted supplies or services, the Contractor shall submit to the 
Contracting Officer, in writing, within -------- [Contracting Officer 
shall insert period of time] a recommendation for corrective actions, 
together with supporting information in sufficient detail for the 
Contracting Officer to determine what corrective action, if any, shall 
be undertaken.
    (4) The Contractor shall promptly comply with any timely written 
direction from the Contracting Officer to correct or partially correct a 
defect, at no increase in the contract price.
    (5) The Contractor shall also prepare and furnish to the Contracting 
Officer data and reports applicable to any correction required under 
this clause (including revision and updating of all other affected data 
called for

[[Page 329]]

under this contract) at no increase in the contract price.
    (6) In the event of timely notice of a decision not to correct or 
only to partially correct, the Contractor shall submit a technical and 
cost proposal within -------- [Contracting Officer shall insert period 
of time] to amend the contract to permit acceptance of the affected 
supplies or services in accordance with the revised requirement, and an 
equitable reduction in the contract price shall promptly be negotiated 
by the parties and be reflected in a supplemental agreement to this 
contract.
    (7) Any supplies or parts thereof corrected or furnished in 
replacement and any services reperformed shall also be subject to the 
conditions of this clause to the same extent as supplies or services 
initially accepted. The warranty, with respect to these supplies, parts, 
or services, shall be equal in duration to that set forth in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this clause, and shall run from the date of delivery of the 
corrected or replaced supplies.
    (8) The Contractor shall not be responsible under this clause for 
the correction of defects in Government-furnished property, except for 
defects in installation, unless the Contractor performs, or is obligated 
to perform, any modifications or other work on such property. In that 
event, the Contractor shall be responsible for correction of defects 
that result from the modifications or other work.
    (9) If the Government returns supplies to the Contractor for 
correction or replacement under this clause, the Contractor shall be 
liable for transportation charges up to an amount equal to the cost of 
transportation by the usual commercial method of shipment from the place 
of delivery specified in this contract (irrespective of the f.o.b. point 
or the point of acceptance) to the Contractor's plant and return to the 
place of delivery specified in this contract. The Contractor shall also 
bear the responsibility for the supplies while in transit.
    (10) All implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a 
particular purpose are excluded from any obligation under this contract.
    (c) Remedies available to the Government. (1) The rights and 
remedies of the Government provided in this clause--
    (i) Shall not be affected in any way by any terms or conditions of 
this contract concerning the conclusiveness of inspection and 
acceptance; and
    (ii) Are in addition to, and do not limit, any rights afforded to 
the Government by any other clause of this contract.
    (2) Within -------- [Contracting Officer shall insert period of 
time] after receipt of the Contractor's recommendations for corrective 
action and adequate supporting information, the Contracting Officer, 
using sole discretion, shall give the Contractor written notice not to 
correct any defect, or to correct or partially correct any defect within 
a reasonable time at -------- [Contracting Officer shall insert 
locations where corrections may be performed].
    (3) In no event shall the Government be responsible for any 
extension or delays in the scheduled deliveries or periods of 
performance under this contract as a result of the Contractor's 
obligations to correct defects, nor shall there be any adjustment of the 
delivery schedule or period of performance as a result of the correction 
of defects unless provided by a supplemental agreement with adequate 
consideration.
    (4) This clause shall not be construed as obligating the Government 
to increase the contract price.
    (5)(i) The Contracting Officer shall give the Contractor a written 
notice, specifying any failure or refusal of the Contractor to--
    (A) Present a detailed recommendation for corrective action as 
required by paragraph (b)(3) of this clause;
    (B) Correct defects as directed under paragraph (b)(4) of this 
clause; or
    (C) Prepare and furnish data and reports as required by paragraph 
(b)(5) of this clause.
    (ii) The notice shall specify a period of time following receipt of 
the notice by the Contractor in which the Contractor must remedy the 
failure or refusal specified in the notice.
    (6) If the Contractor does not comply with the Contracting Officer's 
written notice in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this clause, the Contracting 
Officer may by contract or otherwise--
    (i) Obtain detailed recommendations for corrective action and 
either--
    (A) Correct the supplies or services; or
    (B) Replace the supplies or services, and if the Contractor fails to 
furnish timely disposition instructions, the Contracting Officer may 
dispose of the nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account in a 
reasonable manner, in which case the Government is entitled to 
reimbursement from the Contractor, or from the proceeds, for the 
reasonable expenses of care and disposition, as well as for excess costs 
incurred or to be incurred;
    (ii) Obtain applicable data and reports; and
    (iii) Charge the Contractor for the costs incurred by the 
Government.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If it is desirable to specify that necessary 
transportation incident to correction or replacement will be at the 
Government's expense (as might be the case if, for example, the cost of 
a warranty would otherwise be prohibitive), substitute a paragraph 
substantially the same as

[[Page 330]]

the following paragraph (b)(9) for paragraph (b)(9) of the basic clause:

    (9) If correction or replacement is required, and transportation of 
supplies in connection with correction or replacement is necessary, 
transportation charges and responsibility for the supplies while in 
transit shall be borne by the Government.
    Alternate II (APR 1984). If a fixed-price incentive contract is 
contemplated, add a paragraph substantially the same as the following 
paragraph (c)(7) to the basic clause:

    (7) All costs incurred or estimated to be incurred by the Contractor 
in complying with this clause shall be considered when negotiating the 
total final price under the Incentive Price Revision clause of this 
contract. After establishment of the total final price, Contractor 
compliance with this clause shall be at no increase in the total final 
price. Any equitable adjustments made under paragraph (b)(6) of this 
clause shall be governed by the paragraph entitled Equitable Adjustments 
Under Other Clauses in the Incentive Price Revision clause of this 
contract.
    Alternate III (APR 1984). If it is anticipated that recovery of the 
warranted item will involve considerable Government expense for 
disassembly and/or reassembly of larger items, add a paragraph 
substantially the same as the following paragraph (c)(7) to the basic 
clause. Redesignate the additional paragraph as (c)(8) if Alternate II 
is also being used:

    (7) The Contractor shall be liable for the reasonable costs of 
disassembly and/or reassembly of larger items when it is necessary to 
remove the supplies to be inspected and/or returned for correction or 
replacement.

Sec. 52.246-20  Warranty of Services.

    As prescribed in 46.710(d), the contracting officer may insert a 
clause substantially as follows in solicitations and contracts when a 
fixed-price contract for services is contemplated and the use of a 
warranty clause has been approved under agency procedures, unless a 
clause substantially the same as the clause at 52.246-19, Warranty of 
Systems and Equipment under Performance Specifications or Design 
Criteria, has been used:

                     Warranty of Services (Apr 1984)

    (a) Definitions. Acceptance, as used in this clause, means the act 
of an authorized representative of the Government by which the 
Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of 
existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services, as 
partial or complete performance of the contract.
    Correction, as used in this clause, means the elimination of a 
defect.
    (b) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government or 
any provision concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor 
warrants that all services performed under this contract will, at the 
time of acceptance, be free from defects in workmanship and conform to 
the requirements of this contract. The Contracting Officer shall give 
written notice of any defect or nonconformance to the Contractor ------
-- [Contracting Officer shall insert the specific period of time in 
which notice shall be given to the Contractor; e.g., within 30 days from 
the date of acceptance by the Government,; within 1000 hours of use by 
the Government,; or other specified event whose occurrence will 
terminate the period of notice, or combination of any applicable events 
or period of time]. This notice shall state either (1) that the 
Contractor shall correct or reperform any defective or nonconforming 
services, or (2) that the Government does not require correction or 
reperformance.
    (c) If the Contractor is required to correct or reperform, it shall 
be at no cost to the Government, and any services corrected or 
reperformed by the Contractor shall be subject to this clause to the 
same extent as work initially performed. If the Contractor fails or 
refuses to correct or reperform, the Contracting Officer may, by 
contract or otherwise, correct or replace with similar services and 
charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby, 
or make an equitable adjustment in the contract price.
    (d) If the Government does not require correction or reperformance, 
the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the 
contract price.

possession.
    (c) The Contractor shall remedy at the Contractor's expense any 
failure to conform, or any defect. In addition, the Contractor shall 
remedy at the Contractor's expense any damage to Government-owned or 
controlled real or personal property, when that damage is the result 
of--
    (1) The Contractor's failure to conform to contract requirements; or
    (2) Any defect of equipment, material, workmanship, or design 
furnished.

subcontractor or supplier at any tier, the Contractor shall not be 
liable for the repair of any defects of material or design furnished by 
the Government nor for the repair of any damage that results from any 
defect in Government-furnished material or design.
    (j) This warranty shall not limit the Government's rights under the 
Inspection and Acceptance clause of this contract with respect to latent 
defects, gross mistakes, or fraud.

                             (End of clause)

    (2) Differentials for mode of transportation, type of vehicle, or 
place of delivery as indicated in Contractor's offer may be added to the 
contract price.
    (b) The Contractor shall--
    (1)(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract

    (ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in 
conformance with carrier requirements to protect the goods and to ensure

Government; or
    (ii) If not specified, order appropriate carrier equipment not in

place of delivery and the cost of loading, blocking, and bracing on the

expressed as a rate in cents for each 100 pounds (CWT) of the supplies 
for one or more of the options under this clause that the Government may 
specify at the time of shipment.
    (2) These differential(s) will be considered in the evaluation of 
offers to determine the lowest overall cost to the Government. If, at 
the time of shipment, the Government specifies (normally on a Government 
bill of lading) a mode of transportation, type of vehicle, or place of 
delivery for which the offeror has set forth a differential, the 
Contractor shall include the total of such differential costs (the 
applicable differential multiplied by the actual weight on the 
Government bill of lading) as a separate reimbursable item on the 
Contractor's invoice for the supplies.
    (3) The Government shall have the option of performing or arranging 
at its own expense any transportation from Contractor's shipping plant 
or point to carrier's facility at the time of shipment and, whenever 
this option is exercised, the Government shall make no reimbursement 
based on a quoted differential.
    (4) Offeror's differentials in cents for each 100 pounds for 
optional mode of transportation, types of vehicle, transportation within 
a mode, or place of delivery, specified by the Government at the time of 
shipment and not included in the f.o.b. origin price indicated in the 
Schedule by the offeror, are as follows:
----------(carload, truckload, less-load,
----------wharf, flatcar, driveaway, etc.)

    Land methods of transportation by regulated common carrier are the 
normal means of transportation used by the Government for shipment 
within the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). Accordingly, for 
the purpose of evaluating offers, only these methods will be considered 
in establishing the cost of transportation between offeror's shipping 
point and destination (tentative or firm, whichever is applicable) in 
the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). This transportation 
cost will be added to the offer price in determining the overall cost of 
the supplies to the Government. When tentative destinations are 
indicated, they will be used only for evaluation purposes, the 
Government having the right to use any other means of transportation or 
any other destination at the time of shipment.

shall be the inland transportation costs from the point of origin in the 
United States to the port of loading, port handling charges at the port 
of loading, and ocean shipping costs from the United States port of

from other than those ports specified for evaluation purposes.
    (2) Offers shall be evaluated on the basis of shipment through one

shall designate below at least one of the ports of loading listed in 
paragraph (d) below as their place of delivery. Failure to designate at 
least one of the ports as the point to which delivery will be made by 
the Contractor may render the offer nonresponsive.

    (e) Ports of loading nominated by offeror. The ports of loading 
named in paragraph (d) above are considered by the Government to be 
appropriate for this solicitation due to their compatibility with 
methods and facilities required to handle the cargo and types of vessels 
and to meet the required overseas delivery dates. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, offerors may nominate additional ports of loading that the 
offeror considers to be more favorable to the Government. The Government 
may disregard such nominated ports if, after considering the quantity 
and nature of the supplies concerned, the requisite cargo handling 
capability, the available sailings on U.S.-flag vessels, and other 
pertinent transportation factors, it determines that use of the 
nominated ports is not compatible with the required overseas delivery 
date. United States Great Lakes ports of loading may be considered in 
the evaluation of offers only for those items scheduled in this 
provision for delivery during the ice-free or navigable period as 
proclaimed by the authorities of the St. Lawrence Seaway (normal period 
is between April 15 and November 30 annually). All ports named, 
including those nominated by offerors and determined to be eligible as 
provided in this provision, shall be considered in evaluating all offers 
received in order to establish the lowest laid down cost to the 
Government at the overseas port of discharge. All determinations shall 
be based on availability of ocean services by U.S.-flag vessels only. 
Additional U.S. port(s) of loading nominated by offeror, if any: ------
------
    (f) Price basis: Offeror shall indicate whether prices are based 
on--
    (  ) Paragraph (b), f.o.b. origin, transportation by GBL to port 
listed in paragraph (d);
    (  ) Paragraph (c), f.o.b. destination (i.e., a port listed in 
paragraph (d));
    (  ) Paragraph (e), f.o.b. origin, transportation by GBL to port 
nominated in paragraph (e); and/or
    (  ) Paragraph (e), f.o.b. destination (i.e., a port nominated in 
paragraph (e)).

                           (End of provision)

    Alternate I (FEB 1995). When the CONUS ports of export are DOD water 
terminals, delete paragraph (a) from the basic provision and substitute 
for it the following paragraph (a):
    (a) Port handling and ocean charges--DOD water terminals. The port 
handling and ocean charges are set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
provision for the information of offerors and are current as of the time 
of issuance of the solicitation. For evaluation of offers, the 
Government will use the port handling and ocean charges made available 
by the Directorate of International Traffic, Military Traffic Management 
Command rate information letters, on file as of the date of bid opening 
(or the closing date specified for receipt of offers) and which will be 
effective for the date of the expected initial shipment.
    Alternate II (APR 1984). When offers are solicited on an f.o.b. 
origin only basis, delete paragraphs (c) and (f) from the basic 
provision, but do not redesignate the ensuing paragraphs. Add the 
following basic paragraph (g) to the provision:
    (g) Paragraphs (c) and (f) have been deleted but ensuing paragraphs 
have not been redesignated.
    Alternate III (APR 1984). When offers are solicited on an f.o.b. 
destination only basis, delete paragraph (b) from the basic provision 
but do not redesignate the ensuing paragraphs. Delete subparagraph 
(c)(2) and paragraph (f) from the provision and substitute the following 
subparagraph (c)(2) and paragraph (f). Add paragraph (g) below.
    (c)(2) Offerors shall designate below at least one of the ports of 
loading listed in paragraph (d) below as their place of delivery. 
Failure to designate at least one of the ports as the point to which 
delivery will be made by the Contractor may render the offer 
nonresponsive.
PLACE OF DELIVERY:______________________________________________________
[Offerors insert at least one of the ports listed in paragraph (d) 
below.].
    (f) Price basis. Offerors shall indicate whether prices are based 
on--
    {time}  Paragraph (c), f.o.b. destination (i.e., a port listed in 
paragraph (d)); or
    {time}  Paragraph (e), f.o.b. destination (i.e., a port nominated in 
paragraph (e)).
    (g) Paragraph (b) has been deleted, but ensuing paragraphs have not 
been redesignated.

   Diversion of Shipment Under F.o.b. Destination Contracts (Mar 1989)

    (a) When a place of delivery is changed in accordance with the 
Changes clause of this contract, the contract price shall be adjusted 
pursuant to that clause for any resulting increase or decrease in the 
cost of performance. No adjustment shall be made for changes in 
transportation costs when supplies are identically priced for delivery 
regionally or nationally and the place of delivery is changed within the 
area to which the identical price applies. In all other cases, price 
adjustments due to changes in transportation costs shall be determined 
by comparing the cost of--
    (1) Shipments to the new destinations as evidenced by copy of paid 
freight bills to be supplied by the Contractor with the invoice; and
    (2) Shipments to the original or old destination as evidenced by 
copy of the appropriate paid freight bills to be supplied by the 
Contractor, or, in the event no shipments were made, as evidenced by the 
applicable rates of a common or contract carrier. If carrier rates are 
not publicly filed with any regulatory body, (e.g., interstate shipments 
moving by rail piggyback service) the Contractor shall provide a copy of 
the contract, letter agreement, or other written communication from 
carriers quoting the rates/charges that would have been applied for 
shipments to the original or old destination.
    (b) If (1) shipments to the new destination are made by the 
Contractor's owned or leased trucks and/or (2) shipments to the original 
destination were made or would have been made by the Contractor's owned 
or leased trucks, the Contractor shall so certify. The Government shall 
make an appropriate adjustment in contract prices for payment purposes 
by substituting a rate equal to 70 percent of the lowest applicable rate 
published in common carrier tariffs as of the date of shipment for the 
Contractor's actual rate or contemplated transportation costs.
    (c) If any or all of the following data are not clearly shown on, or 
available from, copies of paid freight bills for each diverted shipment, 
the Contractor shall supply a statement showing the--
    (1) Full name of the carrier or carriers in the routing;
    (2) Number of containers;
    (3) Gross shipping weight;
    (4) Actual date of shipment; and
    (5) Freight description for the supplies as indicated in the

    As prescribed in 47.305-12(a)(2), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when Government property is to be furnished 
under a contract and the Government will be responsible for 
transportation arrangements and costs:

  F.o.b. Point for Delivery of Government-Furnished Property (Apr 1984)

    (a) Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, any Government 
property furnished to the Contractor for use within the United States 
(excluding Alaska and Hawaii) or Canada will be delivered by the 
Government at a point to be specified by the Contractor in the offer. 
Should the Government elect to make delivery by railroad, the f.o.b. 
point shall be private siding, Contractor's plant. If the Contractor's 
plant is not served by rail, the f.o.b. point shall be railroad cars in 
the same or nearest city having rail service. All line-haul 
transportation costs to the specified destination shall be borne by the 
Government. The Government may choose the mode of transportation and the 
carriers.
    (b) If the destination of such Government-furnished property is a 
Contractor's plant located outside the 48 contiguous states, the 
District of Columbia or Canada, the f.o.b. point for Government delivery 
of Government-furnished property shall be a location in the United 
States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) specified by the Contractor. If the 
Contractor fails to name a point, then the f.o.b. point shall be the 
port city in the United States nearest to the Government source of the 
Government-furnished property that has regular commercial water 
transportation services to the offshore port nearest Contractor's plant.
    (c) Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer or provided 
in the contract, the Contractor shall return all Government-furnished 
equipment, supplies, and property, including all property not returned 
in the

[[Page 355]]

form of acceptable end items, to the point at which the Government 
property was originally furnished to the Contractor under the contract. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the Government may have furnished the 
property at the Contractor's plant, the Contracting Officer may direct 
the Contractor to deliver the Government property being returned to, and 
load, block, and brace it in, railway cars in the city in which the 
Contractor's plant is located, or, if the Contractor's city is not 
served by rail service, in the nearest city having rail service. Unless 
otherwise specified in the contract, all property shall be packed in 
containers conforming with the rules of common carrier published tariffs 
so as to be free of penalty charges by the carrier designated for 
shipment by the Government.

in solicitations when benefits may accrue to the Government because 
transit arrangements may apply:

                     Transit Arrangements (Apr 1984)

    The lowest appropriate common carrier transportation costs, 
including offeror's through transit rates and charges when applicable, 
from offeror's shipping points, via the transit point, to the ultimate 
destination will be used in evaluating offers.

    As prescribed in 47.305-13(b)(4), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when supplies are of such a nature, or when 
it is the custom of the trade, that offerors may have potential transit 
credits available and the Government may reduce transportation costs 
through the use of transit credits:

           Transportation Transit Privilege Credits (Apr 1984)

    (a) If the offeror has established with regulated common carriers 
transit privileges that can be applied to the supplies when shipped from 
the original source, the offeror is invited to propose to use these 
credits for shipping the supplies to the designated Government 
destinations. The offeror will ship these supplies under commercial 
bills of lading, paying all remaining transportation charges connected 
with the shipment, subject to reimbursement by the Government in an 
amount equal to the remaining charges but not exceeding the amount 
quoted by the offeror.
    (b) After loading on the carrier's equipment and acceptance by the 
carrier, these shipments under paid commercial bills of lading will move 
for the account of and at the risk of the Government (unless, pursuant 
to the Changes clause, the office administering the contract directs use 
of Government bills of lading).
    (c) The amount quoted below by the offeror represents the 
transportation costs in cents per 100 pounds (freight rate) for full 
carload/truckload shipments of the supplies from offeror's original 
source, via offeror's transit plant or point, to the Government 
destination(s) including the carrier's transit privilege charge, less 
the applicable transit credit (i.e., the amount (rate) initially paid to 
the carrier for shipment from original source to offeror's transit plant 
or point).
    (d) The rate per CWT quoted will be used by the Government to 
evaluate the offered f.o.b. origin price unless a lower rate is 
applicable on the date of bid opening (or closing date specified for 
receipt of offers). To have the offer evaluated on this basis, the 
offeror must insert below the remaining transportation charges that the 
offeror agrees to pay, including any transit charges, subject to 
reimbursement by the Government, as explained in this clause, to 
destinations listed in the Schedule as follows:

by rail:

    Loading, Blocking, and Bracing of Freight Car Shipments (Apr 1984)

    (a) Upon receipt of shipping instructions, as provided in this 
contract, the supplies to be included in any carload shipment by rail 
shall be loaded, blocked, and braced by the Contractor in accordance 
with the standards published by the Association of American Railroads 
and effective at the time of shipment.

[[Page 356]]

    (b) Shipments, for which the Association of American Railroads has 
published no such standards, shall be loaded, blocked, and braced in 
accordance with standards established by the shipper as evidenced by 
written acceptance of an authorized representative of the carrier.
    (c) The Contractor shall be liable for payment of any damage to any 
supplies caused by the failure to load, block, and brace in accordance 
with acceptable standards set forth herein.
    (d) A copy of the appropriate pamphlet of the Association of 
American Railroads may be obtained from that Association.

    As prescribed in 47.305-16(a), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when it is contemplated that they may result 
in f.o.b. origin contracts with shipments in carloads or truckloads. 
This will facilitate realistic freight cost evaluations of offers and 
ensure that contractors produce economical shipments of agreed size.

        F.o.b. Origin--Carload and Truckload Shipments (Apr 1984)

    (a) The Contractor agrees that shipment shall be made in carload or 
truckload lots when the quantity to be delivered to any one destination 
in any delivery period pursuant to the contract schedule of deliveries 
is sufficient to constitute a carload or truckload shipment, except as 
may otherwise be permitted or directed, in writing, by the Contracting 
Officer.
    (b) For evaluation purposes, the agreed weight of a carload or 
truckload shall be the highest applicable minimum weight that will 
result in the lowest freight rate (or per car charge) on file or 
published in common carrier tariffs or tenders as of the date of bid 
opening (or the closing date specified for receipt of proposals).
    (c) For purposes of actual delivery, the agreed weight of a carload 
or truckload will be the highest applicable minimum weight that will 
result in the lowest possible freight rate (or per car charge) on file 
or published as of date of shipment.
    (d) If the total weight of any scheduled quantity to a destination 
is less than the highest carload/truckload minimum weight used for 
evaluation of offers, the Contractor agrees to ship such scheduled 
quantity in one shipment.
    (e) The Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any 
increased costs to the Government resulting from failure to comply with 
the above requirements.

    As prescribed in 47.305-16(b)(1), insert the following clause:

             Guaranteed Shipping Characteristics (Dec 1989)

    (a) The offeror is requested to complete subparagraph (a)(1) of this 
clause, for each part or component which is packed or packaged 
separately. This information will be used to determine transportation 
costs for evaluation purposes. If the offeror does not furnish 
sufficient data in subparagraph (a)(1) of this clause, to permit 
determination by the Government of the item shipping costs, evaluation 
will be based on the shipping characteristics submitted by the offeror 
whose offer produces the highest transportation costs or in the absence 
thereof, by the Contracting Officer's best estimate of the actual 
transportation costs. If the item shipping costs, based on the actual 
shipping characteristics, exceed the item shipping costs used for 
evaluation purposes, the Contractor agrees that the contract price shall 
be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the 
transportation costs actually incurred, and the costs which would have 
been incurred if the evaluated shipping characteristics had been 
accurate.
    (1) To be completed by the offeror:

Sec. 52.247-61  F.o.b. Origin--Minimum Size of Shipments.

    As prescribed in 47.305-16(c), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when volume rates may apply:

           F.o.b. Origin--Minimum Size of Shipments (Apr 1984)

    The Contractor agrees that shipment will be made in carload and 
truckload lots when the quantity to be delivered to any one destination 
in any delivery period pursuant to the contract schedule of deliveries 
is sufficient to constitute a carload or truckload shipment, except as 
may otherwise be permitted or directed in writing by the Contracting 
Officer. The agreed weight of a carload or truckload will be the highest 
applicable minimum weight which will result in the lowest freight rate 
(or per car charge) on file or published in common carrier tariffs or 
tenders as of date of shipment. In the event the total weight of any 
scheduled quantity to a destination is less than the highest carload/
truckload minimum weight, the Contractor agrees to ship such scheduled 
quantity in one shipment. The Contractor shall be liable to the 
Government for any increased costs to the Government resulting from 
failure to comply with the above requirements. This liability shall not 
attach if supplies are outsized or of such nature that they cannot be 
loaded at the highest minimum weight bracket.

materials, or equipment to the construction site from the United States 
either for use in performance of, or for incorporation in, the work 
called for by this contract, the Contractor shall use privately owned 
U.S.-flag commercial vessels to the extent that such vessels are 
available at rates that are fair and reasonable for privately owned 
U.S.-flag commercial vessels.
    (b) The Contractor shall not make any shipment exceeding 10 
measurement tons (400 cubic feet) by vessels other than privately owned 
U.S.-flag commercial vessels without (1) notifying the Contracting 
Officer that U.S.-flag commercial vessels are not available at rates

Sec. 52.248-1  Value Engineering.

    As prescribed in 48.201, insert the following clause in supply or 
service contracts to provide a value engineering incentive under the 
conditions specified in 48.201. In solicitations and contracts for items 
requiring an extended period for production (e.g., ship construction, 
major system acquisition), if agency procedures prescribe sharing of 
future contract savings on all units to be delivered under contracts 
awarded during the sharing period, the contracting officer shall modify 
subdivision (i)(3)(i) and the first sentence under subparagraph (3) of 
the definition of acquisition savings by substituting under contracts 
awarded during the sharing period for during the sharing period. For 
engineering-development and low-rate-initial-production solicitations 
and contracts, the contracting officer shall modify subdivision 
(i)(3)(i) and the first sentence under subparagraph (3) of the 
definition of acquisition savings by substituting for the number of 
future contract units scheduled for delivery during the sharing period, 
a number equal to the quantity required over the highest 36 consecutive 
months of planned production, based on planning or production 
documentation at the time the VECP is accepted.

                       Value Engineering (Mar 1989)

    (a) General. The Contractor is encouraged to develop, prepare, and 
submit value engineering change proposals (VECP's) voluntarily. The 
Contractor shall share in any net acquisition savings realized from 
accepted VECP's, in accordance with the incentive sharing rates in 
paragraph (f) below.
    (b) Definitions. Acquisition savings, as used in this clause, means 
savings resulting from the application of a VECP to contracts awarded by 
the same contracting office or its successor for essentially the same 
unit. Acquisition savings include--
    (1) Instant contract savings, which are the net cost reductions on 
this, the instant contract, and which are equal to the instant unit cost 
reduction multiplied by the number of instant contract units affected by 
the VECP, less the Contractor's allowable development and implementation 
costs;
    (2) Concurrent contract savings, which are net reductions in the 
prices of other contracts that are definitized and ongoing at the time 
the VECP is accepted; and
    (3) Future contract savings, which are the product of the future 
unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of future contract units 
scheduled for delivery during the sharing period. If this contract is a 
multiyear contract, future contract savings include savings on 
quantities funded after VECP acceptance.
    Collateral costs, as used in this clause, means agency cost of 
operation, maintenance, logistic support, or Government-furnished 
property.
    Collateral savings, as used in this clause, means those measurable 
net reductions resulting from a VECP in the agency's overall projected 
collateral costs, exclusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the 
acquisition cost changes.
    Contracting office includes any contracting office that the 
acquisition is transferred to, such as another branch of the agency or 
another agency's office that is performing a joint acquisition action.
    Contractor's development and implementation costs, as used in this 
clause, means those costs the Contractor incurs on a VECP specifically 
in developing, testing, preparing, and submitting the VECP, as well as 
those costs the Contractor incurs to make the contractual changes 
required by Government acceptance of a VECP.
    Future unit cost reduction, as used in this clause, means the 
instant unit cost reduction adjusted as the Contracting Officer 
considers necessary for projected learning or changes in quantity during 
the sharing period. It is calculated at the time the VECP is accepted 
and applies either (1) throughout the sharing period, unless the 
Contracting Officer decides that recalculation is necessary because 
conditions are significantly different from those previously anticipated 
or (2) to the calculation of a lump-sum payment, which cannot later be 
revised.
    Government costs, as used in this clause, means those agency costs 
that result directly from developing and implementing the VECP, such as 
any net increases in the cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and 
logistics support. The term does not include

[[Page 362]]

the normal administrative costs of processing the VECP or any increase 
in this contract's cost or price resulting from negative instant 
contract savings.
    Instant contract, as used in this clause, means this contract, under 
which the VECP is submitted. It does not include increases in quantities 
after acceptance of the VECP that are due to contract modifications, 
exercise of options, or additional orders. If this is a multiyear 
contract, the term does not include quantities funded after VECP 
acceptance. If this contract is a fixed-price contract with prospective 
price redetermination, the term refers to the period for which firm 
prices have been established.
    Instant unit cost reduction means the amount of the decrease in unit 
cost of performance (without deducting any Contractor's development or 
implementation costs) resulting from using the VECP on this, the instant 
contract. If this is a service contract, the instant unit cost reduction 
is normally equal to the number of hours per line-item task saved by 
using the VECP on this contract, multiplied by the appropriate contract 
labor rate.
    Negative instant contract savings means the increase in the cost or 
price of this contract when the acceptance of a VECP results in an 
excess of the Contractor's allowable development and implementation 
costs over the product of the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by 
the number of instant contract units affected.
    Net acquisition savings means total acquisition savings, including 
instant, concurrent, and future contract savings, less Government costs.
    Sharing base, as used in this clause, means the number of affected 
end items on contracts of the contracting office accepting the VECP.
    Sharing period, as used in this clause, means the period beginning 
with acceptance of the first unit incorporating the VECP and ending at 
the later of (1) 3 years after the first unit affected by the VECP is 
accepted or (2) the last scheduled delivery date of an item affected by 
the VECP under this contract's delivery schedule in effect at the time 
the VECP is accepted.
    Unit, as used in this clause, means the item or task to which the 
Contracting Officer and the Contractor agree the VECP applies.
    Value engineering change proposal (VECP) means a proposal that--
    (1) Requires a change to this, the instant contract, to implement; 
and
    (2) Results in reducing the overall projected cost to the agency 
without impairing essential functions or characteristics; provided, that 
it does not involve a change--
    (i) In deliverable end item quantities only;
    (ii) In research and development (R&D) end items or R&D test 
quantities that is due solely to results of previous testing under this 
contract; or
    (iii) To the contract type only.
    (c) VECP preparation. As a minimum, the Contractor shall include in 
each VECP the information described in subparagraphs (1) through (8) 
below. If the proposed change is affected by contractually required 
configuration management or similar procedures, the instructions in 
those procedures relating to format, identification, and priority 
assignment shall govern VECP preparation. The VECP shall include the 
following:
    (1) A description of the difference between the existing contract 
requirement and the proposed requirement, the comparative advantages and 
disadvantages of each, a justification when an item's function or 
characteristics are being altered, the effect of the change on the end 
item's performance, and any pertinent objective test data.
    (2) A list and analysis of the contract requirements that must be 
changed if the VECP is accepted, including any suggested specification 
revisions.
    (3) Identification of the unit to which the VECP applies.
    (4) A separate, detailed cost estimate for (i) the affected portions 
of the existing contract requirement and (ii) the VECP. The cost 
reduction associated with the VECP shall take into account the 
Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs, including 
any amount attributable to subcontracts under the Subcontracts paragraph 
of this clause, below.
    (5) A description and estimate of costs the Government may incur in 
implementing the VECP, such as test and evaluation and operating and 
support costs.
    (6) A prediction of any effects the proposed change would have on 
collateral costs to the agency.
    (7) A statement of the time by which a contract modification 
accepting the VECP must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost 
reduction, noting any effect on the contract completion time or delivery 
schedule.
    (8) Identification of any previous submissions of the VECP, 
including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers 
involved, and previous Government actions, if known.
    (d) Submission. The Contractor shall submit VECP's to the 
Contracting Officer, unless this contract states otherwise. If this 
contract is administered by other than the contracting office, the 
Contractor shall submit a copy of the VECP simultaneously to the 
Contracting Officer and to the Administrative Contracting Officer.
    (e) Government action. (1) The Contracting Officer shall notify the 
Contractor of the status of the VECP within 45 calendar days after the 
contracting office receives it. If additional time is required, the 
Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor within the

[[Page 363]]

45-day period and provide the reason for the delay and the expected date 
of the decision. The Government will process VECP's expeditiously; 
however, it shall not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP.
    (2) If the VECP is not accepted, the Contracting Officer shall 
notify the Contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. 
The Contractor may withdraw any VECP, in whole or in part, at any time 
before it is accepted by the Government. The Contracting Officer may 
require that the Contractor provide written notification before 
undertaking significant expenditures for VECP effort.
    (3) Any VECP may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the 
Contracting Officer's award of a modification to this contract citing 
this clause and made either before or within a reasonable time after 
contract performance is completed. Until such a contract modification 
applies a VECP to this contract, the Contractor shall perform in 
accordance with the existing contract. The Contracting Officer's 
decision to accept or reject all or part of any VECP and the decision as 
to which of the sharing rates applies shall be final and not subject to 
the Disputes clause or otherwise subject to litigation under the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601-613).
    (f) Sharing rates. If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor shall share 
in net acquisition savings according to the percentages shown in the 
table below. The percentage paid the Contractor depends upon (1) this 
contract's type (fixed-price, incentive, or cost-reimbursement), (2) the 
sharing arrangement specified in paragraph (a) above (incentive, program 
requirement, or a combination as delineated in the Schedule), and (3) 
the source of the savings (the instant contract, or concurrent and 
future contracts), as follows:

**Includes cost-plus-award-fee contracts.                               

    (g) Calculating net acquisition savings. (1) Acquisition savings are 
realized when (i) the cost or price is reduced on the instant contract, 
(ii) reductions are negotiated in concurrent contracts, (iii) future 
contracts are awarded, or (iv) agreement is reached on a lump-sum 
payment for future contract savings (see subparagraph (i)(4) below). Net 
acquisition savings are first realized, and the Contractor shall be paid 
a share, when Government costs and any negative instant contract savings 
have been fully offset against acquisition savings.
    (2) Except in incentive contracts, Government costs and any price or 
cost increases resulting from negative instant contract savings shall be 
offset against acquisition savings each time such savings are realized 
until they are fully offset. Then, the Contractor's share is calculated 
by multiplying net acquisition savings by the appropriate Contractor's 
percentage sharing rate (see paragraph (f) above). Additional Contractor 
shares of net acquisition savings shall be paid to the Contractor at the 
time realized.
    (3) If this is an incentive contract, recovery of Government costs 
on the instant contract shall be deferred and offset against concurrent 
and future contract savings. The Contractor shall share through the 
contract incentive structure in savings on the instant contract items 
affected. Any negative instant contract savings shall be added to the 
target cost or to the target price and ceiling price, and the amount 
shall be offset against concurrent and future contract savings.
    (4) If the Government does not receive and accept all items on which 
it paid the Contractor's share, the Contractor shall reimburse the 
Government for the proportionate share of these payments.
    (h) Contract adjustment. The modification accepting the VECP (or a 
subsequent modification issued as soon as possible after any 
negotiations are completed) shall--
    (1) Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of 
instant contract savings, unless this is an incentive contract;
    (2) When the amount of instant contract savings is negative, 
increase the contract

[[Page 364]]

price, target price and ceiling price, target cost, or estimated cost by 
that amount;
    (3) Specify the Contractor's dollar share per unit on future 
contracts, or provide the lump-sum payment;
    (4) Specify the amount of any Government costs or negative instant 
contract savings to be offset in determining net acquisition savings 
realized from concurrent or future contract savings; and
    (5) Provide the Contractor's share of any net acquisition savings 
under the instant contract in accordance with the following:
    (i) Fixed-price contracts--add to contract price.
    (ii) Cost-reimbursement contracts--add to contract fee.
    (i) Concurrent and future contract savings. (1) Payments of the 
Contractor's share of concurrent and future contract savings shall be 
made by a modification to the instant contract in accordance with 
subparagraph (h)(5) above. For incentive contracts, shares shall be 
added as a separate firm-fixed-price line item on the instant contract. 
The Contractor shall maintain records adequate to identify the first 
delivered unit for 3 years after final payment under this contract.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share 
of concurrent contract savings by (i) subtracting from the reduction in 
price negotiated on the concurrent contract any Government costs or 
negative instant contract savings not yet offset and (ii) multiplying 
the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.
    (3) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share 
of future contract savings by (i) multiplying the future unit cost 
reduction by the number of future contract units scheduled for delivery 
during the sharing period, (ii) subtracting any Government costs or 
negative instant contract savings not yet offset, and (iii) multiplying 
the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.
    (4) When the Government wishes and the Contractor agrees, the 
Contractor's share of future contract savings may be paid in a single 
lump sum rather than in a series of payments over time as future 
contracts are awarded. Under this alternate procedure, the future 
contract savings may be calculated when the VECP is accepted, on the 
basis of the Contracting Officer's forecast of the number of units that 
will be delivered during the sharing period. The Contractor's share 
shall be included in a modification to this contract (see subparagraph 
(h)(3) above) and shall not be subject to subsequent adjustment.
    (5) Alternate no-cost settlement method. When, in accordance with 
subsection 48.104-3 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the 
Government and the Contractor mutually agree to use the no-cost 
settlement method, the following applies:
    (i) The Contractor will keep all the savings on the instant contract 
and on its concurrent contracts only.
    (ii) The Government will keep all the savings resulting from 
concurrent contracts placed on other sources, savings from all future 
contracts, and all collateral savings.
    (j) Collateral savings. If a VECP is accepted, the instant contract 
amount shall be increased, as specified in subparagraph (h)(5) above, by 
20 percent of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized 
in a typical year of use after subtracting any Government costs not 
previously offset. However, the Contractor's share of collateral savings 
shall not exceed (1) the contract's firm-fixed-price, target price, 
target cost, or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or (2) 
$100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer shall be the 
sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings, and that amount 
shall not be subject to the Disputes clause or otherwise subject to 
litigation under 41 U.S.C. 601-613.
    (k) Relationship to other incentives. Only those benefits of an 
accepted VECP not rewardable under performance, design-to-cost 
(production unit cost, operating and support costs, reliability and 
maintainability), or similar incentives shall be rewarded under this 
clause. However, the targets of such incentives affected by the VECP 
shall not be adjusted because of VECP acceptance. If this contract 
specifies targets but provides no incentive to surpass them, the value 
engineering sharing shall apply only to the amount of achievement better 
than target.
    (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include an appropriate value 
engineering clause in any subcontract of $100,000 or more and may 
include one in subcontracts of lesser value. In calculating any 
adjustment in this contract's price for instant contract savings (or 
negative instant contract savings), the Contractor's allowable 
development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's 
allowable development and implementation costs, and any value 
engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor, clearly resulting 
from a VECP accepted by the Government under this contract. The 
Contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor value 
engineering incentive payments; provided, that the payments shall not 
reduce the Government's share of concurrent or future contract savings 
or collateral savings.
    (m) Data. The Contractor may restrict the Government's right to use 
any part of a

[[Page 365]]

VECP or the supporting data by marking the following legend on the 
affected parts:

``These data, furnished under the Value Engineering clause of contract 
--------, shall not be disclosed outside the Government or duplicated, 
used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to 
evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted under the clause. 
This restriction does not limit the Goverment's right to use information 
contained in these data if it has been obtained or is otherwise 
available from the Contractor or from another source without 
limitations.''

    If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor hereby grants the Government 
unlimited rights in the VECP and supporting data, except that, with 
respect to data qualifying and submitted as limited rights technical 
data, the Government shall have the rights specified in the contract 
modification implementing the VECP and shall appropriately mark the 
data. (The terms unlimited rights and limited rights are defined in part 
27 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.)

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the contracting officer selects a 
mandatory value engineering program requirement, substitute the 
following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the basic clause:

    (a) General. The Contractor shall (1) engage in a value engineering 
program, and submit value engineering progress reports, as specified in 
the Schedule and (2) submit to the Contracting Officer any resulting 
value engineering change proposals (VECP's). In addition to being paid 
as the Schedule specifies for this mandatory program, the Contractor 
shall share in any net acquisition savings realized from accepted 
VECP's, in accordance with the program requirement sharing rates in 
paragraph (f) below.
    Alternate II (APR 1984). If the contracting officer selects both a 
value engineering incentive and mandatory value engineering program 
requirement, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of 
the basic clause:

    (a) General. For those contract line items designated in the 
Schedule as subject to the value engineering program requirement, the 
Contractor shall (1) engage in a value engineering program, and submit 
value engineering progress reports, as specified in the Schedule and (2) 
submit to the Contracting Officer any resulting VECP's. In addition to 
being paid as the Schedule specifies for this mandatory program, the 
Contractor shall share in any net acquisition savings realized from 
VECP's accepted under the program, in accordance with the program 
requirement sharing rates in paragraph (f) below. For remaining areas of 
the contract, the Contractor is encouraged to develop, prepare, and 
submit VECP's voluntarily; for VECP's accepted under these remaining 
areas, the incentive sharing rates apply.
    Alternate III (APR 1984). When the head of the contracting activity 
determines that the cost of calculating and tracking collateral savings 
will exceed the benefits to be derived in a contract calling for a value 
engineering incentive, delete paragraph (j) from the basic clause and 
redesignate the remaining paragraphs accordingly.

<R05>
Sec. 52.248-3  Value Engineering--Construction.

    As prescribed in 48.202, insert the following clause:

                Value Engineering--Construction (Mar 1989)

    (a) General. The Contractor is encouraged to develop, prepare, and 
submit value engineering change proposals (VECP's) voluntarily. The 
Contractor shall share in any instant contract savings realized from 
accepted VECP's, in accordance with paragraph (f) below.
    (b) Definitions. Collateral costs, as used in this clause, means 
agency costs of operation, maintenance, logistic support, or Government-
furnished property.
    Collateral savings, as used in this clause, means those measurable 
net reductions resulting from a VECP in the agency's overall projected 
collateral costs, exlcusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the 
acquisition cost changes.
    Contractor's development and implementation costs, as used in this 
clause, means those costs the Contractor incurs on a VECP specifically 
in developing, testing, preparing, and submitting the VECP, as well as 
those costs the Contractor incurs to make the contractual changes 
required by Government acceptance of a VECP.
    Government costs, as used in this clause, means those agency costs 
that result directly from developing and implementing the VECP, such as 
any net increases in the cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and 
logistic support. The term does not include the normal administrative 
costs of processing the VECP.
    Instant contract savings, as used in this clause, means the 
estimated reduction in Contractor cost of performance resulting from 
acceptance of the VECP, minus allowable Contractor's development and 
implementation costs, including subcontractors' development and 
implementation costs (see paragraph (h) below).
    Value engineering change proposal (VECP) means a proposal that--
    (1) Requires a change to this, the instant contract, to implement; 
and
    (2) Results in reducing the contract price or estimated cost without 
impairing essential functions or characteristics; provided, that it does 
not involve a change--
    (i) In deliverable end item quantities only; or
    (ii) To the contract type only.
    (c) VECP preparation. As a minimum, the Contractor shall include in 
each VECP the information described in subparagraphs (1) through (7) 
below. If the proposed change is affected by contractually required 
configuration management or similar procedures, the instructions in 
those procedures relating to

[[Page 367]]

format, identification, and priority assignment shall govern VECP 
preparation. The VECP shall include the following:
    (1) A description of the difference between the existing contract 
requirement and that proposed, the comparative advantages and 
disadvantages of each, a justification when an item's function or 
characteristics are being altered, and the effect of the change on the 
end item's performance.
    (2) A list and analysis of the contract requirements that must be 
changed if the VECP is accepted, including any suggested specification 
revisions.
    (3) A separate, detailed cost estimate for (i) the affected portions 
of the existing contract requirement and (ii) the VECP. The cost 
reduction associated with the VECP shall take into account the 
Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs, including 
any amount attributable to subcontracts under paragraph (h) below.
    (4) A description and estimate of costs the Government may incur in 
implementing the VECP, such as test and evaluation and operating and 
support costs.
    (5) A prediction of any effects the proposed change would have on 
collateral costs to the agency.
    (6) A statement of the time by which a contract modification 
accepting the VECP must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost 
reduction, noting any effect on the contract completion time or delivery 
schedule.
    (7) Identification of any previous submissions of the VECP, 
including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers 
involved, and previous Government actions, if known.
    (d) Submission. The Contractor shall submit VECP's to the Resident 
Engineer at the worksite, with a copy to the Contracting Officer.
    (e) Government action. (1) The Contracting Officer shall notify the 
Contractor of the status of the VECP within 45 calendar days after the 
contracting office receives it. If additional time is required, the 
Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor within the 45-day period 
and provide the reason for the delay and the expected date of the 
decision. The Government will process VECP's expeditiously; however, it 
shall not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP.
    (2) If the VECP is not accepted, the Contracting Officer shall 
notify the Contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. 
The Contractor may withdraw any VECP, in whole or in part, at any time 
before it is accepted by the Government. The Contracting Officer may 
require that the Contractor provide written notification before 
undertaking significant expenditures for VECP effort.
    (3) Any VECP may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the 
Contracting Officer's award of a modification to this contract citing 
this clause. The Contracting Officer may accept the VECP, even though an 
agreement on price reduction has not been reached, by issuing the 
Contractor a notice to proceed with the change. Until a notice to 
proceed is issued or a contract modification applies a VECP to this 
contract, the Contractor shall perform in accordance with the existing 
contract. The Contracting Officer's decision to accept or reject all or 
part of any VECP shall be final and not subject to the Disputes clause 
or otherwise subject to litigation under the Contract Disputes Act of 
1978 (41 U.S.C. 601-613).
    (f) Sharing. (1) Rates. The Government's share of savings is 
determined by subtracting Government costs from instant contract savings 
and multiplying the result by (i) 45 percent for fixed-price contracts 
or (ii) 75 percent for cost-reimbursement contracts.
    (2) Payment. Payment of any share due the Contractor for use of a 
VECP on this contract shall be authorized by a modification to this 
contract to--
    (i) Accept the VECP;
    (ii) Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of 
instant contract savings; and
    (iii) Provide the Contractor's share of savings by adding the amount 
calculated to the contract price or fee.
    (g) Collateral savings. If a VECP is accepted, the instant contract 
amount shall be increased by 20 percent of any projected collateral 
savings determined to be realized in a typical year of use after 
subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the 
Contractor's share of collateral savings shall not exceed (1) the 
contract's firm-fixed-price or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is 
accepted, or (2) $100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer 
shall be the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings, and 
that amount shall not be subject to the Disputes clause or otherwise 
subject to litigation under 41 U.S.C. 601-613.
    (h) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include an appropriate value 
engineering clause in any subcontract of $50,000 or more and may include 
one in subcontracts of lesser value. In computing any adjustment in this 
contract's price under paragraph (f) above, the Contractor's allowable 
development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's 
allowable development and implementation costs clearly resulting from a 
VECP accepted by the Government under this contract, but shall exclude 
any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor. The 
Contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor value 
engineering incentive payments; provided, that

[[Page 368]]

these payments shall not reduce the Government's share of the savings 
resulting from the VECP.
    (i) Data. The Contractor may restrict the Government's right to use 
any part of a VECP or the supporting data by marking the following 
legend on the affected parts:

``These data, furnished under the Value Engineering--Construction clause 
of contract --------, shall not be disclosed outside the Government or 
duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose 
other than to evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted 
under the clause. This restriction does not limit the Government's right 
to use information contained in these data if it has been obtained or is 
otherwise available from the Contractor or from another source without 
limitations.''

    If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor hereby grants the Government 
unlimited rights in the VECP and supporting data, except that, with 
respect to data qualifying and submitted as limited rights technical 
data, the Government shall have the rights specified in the contract 
modification implementing the VECP and shall appropriately mark the

Sec. 52.249-2  Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed-Price).

    As prescribed in 49.502(b)(1)(i), insert the following clause:

 Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed-Price) (Sep 1996)

    (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this 
contract in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting 
Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest. 
The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Contractor 
a Notice of Termination specifying the extent of termination and the 
effective date.
    (b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed 
by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall immediately proceed 
with the following obligations, regardless of any delay in determining 
or adjusting any amounts due under this clause:
    (1) Stop work as specified in the notice.
    (2) Place no further subcontracts or orders (referred to as 
subcontracts in this clause) for materials, services, or facilities, 
except as necessary to complete the continued portion of the contract.
    (3) Terminate all subcontracts to the extent they relate to the work 
terminated.
    (4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting 
Officer, all right, title,

[[Page 369]]

and interest of the Contractor under the subcontracts terminated, in 
which case the Government shall have the right to settle or to pay any 
termination settlement proposal arising out of those terminations.
    (5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the 
Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination 
settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts; the 
approval or ratification will be final for purposes of this clause.
    (6) As directed by the Contracting Officer, transfer title and 
deliver to the Government (i) the fabricated or unfabricated parts, work 
in process, completed work, supplies, and other material produced or 
acquired for the work terminated, and (ii) the completed or partially 
completed plans, drawings, information, and other property that, if the 
contract had been completed, would be required to be furnished to the 
Government.
    (7) Complete performance of the work not terminated.
    (8) Take any action that may be necessary, or that the Contracting 
Officer may direct, for the protection and preservation of the property 
related to this contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and 
in which the Government has or may acquire an interest.
    (9) Use its best efforts to sell, as directed or authorized by the 
Contracting Officer, any property of the types referred to in 
subparagraph (b)(6) of this clause; provided, however, that the 
Contractor (i) is not required to extend credit to any purchaser and 
(ii) may acquire the property under the conditions prescribed by, and at 
prices approved by, the Contracting Officer. The proceeds of any 
transfer or disposition will be applied to reduce any payments to be 
made by the Government under this contract, credited to the price or 
cost of the work, or paid in any other manner directed by the 
Contracting Officer.
    (c) The Contractor shall submit complete termination inventory 
schedules no later than 120 days from the effective date of termination, 
unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written 
request of the Contractor within this 120-day period.
    (d) After expiration of the plant clearance period as defined in 
subpart 45.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Contractor may 
submit to the Contracting Officer a list, certified as to quantity and 
quality, of termination inventory not previously disposed of, excluding 
items authorized for disposition by the Contracting Officer. The 
Contractor may request the Government to remove those items or enter 
into an agreement for their storage. Within 15 days, the Government will 
accept title to those items and remove them or enter into a storage 
agreement. The Contracting Officer may verify the list upon removal of 
the items, or if stored, within 45 days from submission of the list, and 
shall correct the list, as necessary, before final settlement.
    (e) After termination, the Contractor shall submit a final 
termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form 
and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The 
Contractor shall submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year 
from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by 
the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Contractor within 
this 1-year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that 
the facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received 
and acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Contractor fails to 
submit the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may 
determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, 
due the Contractor because of the termination and shall pay the amount 
determined.
    (f) Subject to paragraph (e) of this clause, the Contractor and the 
Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount 
to be paid or remaining to be paid because of the termination. The 
amount may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work done. 
However, the agreed amount, whether under this paragraph (f) or 
paragraph (g) of this clause, exclusive of costs shown in subparagraph 
(g)(3) of this clause, may not exceed the total contract price as 
reduced by (1) the amount of payments previously made and (2) the 
contract price of work not terminated. The contract shall be modified, 
and the Contractor paid the agreed amount. Paragraph (g) of this clause 
shall not limit, restrict, or affect the amount that may be agreed upon 
to be paid under this paragraph.
    (g) If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on 
the whole amount to be paid because of the termination of work, the 
Contracting Officer shall pay the Contractor the amounts determined by 
the Contracting Officer as follows, but without duplication of any 
amounts agreed on under paragraph (f) of this clause:
    (1) The contract price for completed supplies or services accepted 
by the Government (or sold or acquired under subparagraph (b)(9) of this 
clause) not previously paid for, adjusted for any saving of freight and 
other charges.
    (2) The total of--
    (i) The costs incurred in the performance of the work terminated, 
including initial costs and preparatory expense allocable thereto, but 
excluding any costs attributable to supplies or services paid or to be 
paid under subparagraph (g)(1) of this clause;

[[Page 370]]

    (ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement 
proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to 
the terminated portion of the contract if not included in subdivision 
(g)(2)(i) of this clause; and
    (iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (g)(2)(i) of this clause, 
determined by the Contracting Officer under 49.202 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be 
fair and reasonable; however, if it appears that the Contractor would 
have sustained a loss on the entire contract had it been completed, the 
Contracting Officer shall allow no profit under this subdivision (iii) 
and shall reduce the settlement to reflect the indicated rate of loss.
    (3) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, 
including--
    (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably 
necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and 
supporting data;
    (ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the 
amounts of such settlements); and
    (iii) Storage, transportation, and other costs incurred, reasonably 
necessary for the preservation, protection, or disposition of the 
termination inventory.
    (h) Except for normal spoilage, and except to the extent that the 
Government expressly assumed the risk of loss, the Contracting Officer 
shall exclude from the amounts payable to the Contractor under paragraph 
(g) of this clause, the fair value, as determined by the Contracting 
Officer, of property that is destroyed, lost, stolen, or damaged so as 
to become undeliverable to the Government or to a buyer.
    (i) The cost principles and procedures of part 31 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall 
govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause.
    (j) The Contractor shall have the right of appeal, under the 
Disputes clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer 
under paragraph (e), (g), or (l) of this clause, except that if the 
Contractor failed to submit the termination settlement proposal or 
request for equitable adjustment within the time provided in paragraph 
(e) or (l), respectively, and failed to request a time extension, there 
is no right of appeal.
    (k) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, 
there shall be deducted--
    (1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Contractor 
under the terminated portion of this contract;
    (2) Any claim which the Government has against the Contractor under 
this contract; and
    (3) The agreed price for, or the proceeds of sale of, materials, 
supplies, or other things acquired by the Contractor or sold under the 
provisions of this clause and not recovered by or credited to the 
Government.
    (l) If the termination is partial, the Contractor may file a 
proposal with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the 
price(s) of the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting 
Officer shall make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by 
the Contractor for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be 
requested within 90 days from the effective date of termination unless 
extended in writing by the Contracting Officer.
    (m)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it 
prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by 
the Contractor for the terminated portion of the contract, if the 
Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed 
the amount to which the Contractor will be entitled.
    (2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be 
due, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government upon 
demand, together with interest computed at the rate established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest 
shall be computed for the period from the date the excess payment is 
received by the Contractor to the date the excess is repaid. Interest 
shall not be charged on any excess payment due to a reduction in the 
Contractor's termination settlement proposal because of retention or 
other disposition of termination inventory until 10 days after the date 
of the retention or disposition, or a later date determined by the 
Contracting Officer because of the circumstances.
    (n) Unless otherwise provided in this contract or by statute, the 
Contractor shall maintain all records and documents relating to the 
terminated portion of this contract for 3 years after final settlement. 
This includes all books and other evidence bearing on the Contractor's 
costs and expenses under this contract. The Contractor shall make these 
records and documents available to the Government, at the Contractor's 
office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved 
by the Contracting Officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other 
authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records 
and documents.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (SEP 1996). If the contract is for construction, 
substitute the following paragraph (g) for paragraph (g) of the basic 
clause:

    (g) If the Contractor and Contracting Officer fail to agree on the 
whole amount to be paid the Contractor because of the termination of 
work, the Contracting Officer shall

[[Page 371]]

pay the Contractor the amounts determined as follows, but without 
duplication of any amounts agreed upon under paragraph (f) of this 
clause:
    (1) For contract work performed before the effective date of 
termination, the total (without duplication of any items) of--
    (i) The cost of this work;
    (ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement 
proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to 
the terminated portion of the contract if not included in subdivision 
(g)(1)(i) of this clause; and
    (iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (g)(1)(i) of this clause, 
determined by the Contracting Officer under 49.202 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be 
fair and reasonable; however, if it appears that the Contractor would 
have sustained a loss on the entire contract had it been completed, the 
Contracting Officer shall allow no profit under this subdivision (iii) 
and shall reduce the settlement to reflect the indicated rate of loss.
    (2) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, 
including--
    (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably 
necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and 
supporting data;
    (ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the 
amounts of such settlements); and
    (iii) Storage, transportation, and other costs incurred, reasonably 
necessary for the preservation, protection, or disposition of the 
termination inventory.
    Alternate II (SEP 1996). If the contract is with an agency of the 
U.S. Government or with State, local, or foreign governments or their 
agencies, and if the Contracting Officer determines that the requirement 
to pay interest on excess partial payments is inappropriate, delete 
subparagraph (m)(2) of the basic clause.
    Alternate III (SEP 1996). If the contract is for construction and 
with an agency of the U.S. Government or with State, local, or foreign 
governments or their agencies, substitute the following paragraph (g) 
for paragraph (g) of the basic clause. Subparagraph (m)(2) may be 
deleted from the basic clause if the Contracting Officer determines that 
the requirement to pay interest on excess partial payments is 
inappropriate.
    (g) If the Contractor and Contracting Officer fail to agree on the 
whole amount to be paid the Contractor because of the termination of 
work, the Contracting Officer shall pay the Contractor the amounts 
determined as follows, but without duplication of any amounts agreed 
upon under paragraph (f) of this clause:
    (1) For contract work performed before the effective date of 
termination, the total (without duplication of any items) of--
    (i) The cost of this work;
    (ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement 
proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to 
the terminated portion of the contract if not included in subdivision 
(g)(1)(i) of this clause; and
    (iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (g)(1)(i) of this clause, 
determined by the Contracting Officer under 49.202 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be 
fair and reasonable; however, if it appears that the Contractor would 
have sustained a loss on the entire contract had it been completed, the 
Contracting Officer shall allow no profit under this subdivision (iii) 
and shall reduce the settlement to reflect the indicated rate of loss.

including--

                 or Removal of Improvements) (Sep 1996)

    (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this 
contract, in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting

    (5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the 
Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination 
settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts; the

    As prescribed in 49.502(c), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts for services, regardless of value, when a 
fixed-price contract is contemplated and the Contracting Officer 
determines that because of the kind of services required, the successful 
offeror will not incur substantial charges in preparation for and in 
carrying out the contract, and would, if terminated for the convenience 
of the Government, limit termination settlement charges to services 
rendered before the date of termination:

 Termination for Convenience of the Government (Services) (Short Form) 
                               (Apr 1984)

    The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this 
contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest. 
If this contract is terminated, the Government shall be liable only for 
payment under the payment provisions of this contract for services 
rendered before the effective date of termination.

Sec. 52.249-5  Termination for Convenience of the Government (Educational and Other Nonprofit Institutions).

    As prescribed in 49.502(d), insert the following clause:

  Termination for Convenience of the Government (Educational and Other 
                   Nonprofit Institutions) (Sep 1996)

    (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this 
contract in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting 
Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest. 
The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Contractor 
a Notice of Termination specifying the extent of termination and the 
effective date.
    (b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination and except as directed 
by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall immediately proceed 
with the following obligations:
    (1) Stop work as specified in the notice.
    (2) Place no further subcontracts or orders (referred to as 
subcontracts in this clause), except as necessary to complete the 
continued portion of the contract.
    (3) Terminate all applicable subcontracts and cancel or divert 
applicable commitments covering personal services that extend beyond the 
effective date of termination.
    (4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting 
Officer, all right, title, and interest of the Contractor under the 
subcontracts terminated, in which case the Government shall have the 
right to settle or pay any termination settlement proposal arising out 
of those terminations.
    (5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the 
Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination 
settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts; 
approval or ratification will be final for purposes of this clause.
    (6) Transfer title (if not already transferred) and, as directed by 
the Contracting Officer, deliver to the Government any information and 
items that, if the contract had been completed, would have been required 
to be furnished, including (i) materials or equipment produced, in 
process, or acquired for the work terminated and (ii) completed or 
partially completed plans, drawings, and information.
    (7) Complete performance of the work not terminated.
    (8) Take any action that may be necessary, or that the Contracting 
Officer may direct, for the protection and preservation of the property 
related to this contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and 
in which the Government has or may acquire an interest.
    (9) Use its best efforts to sell, as directed or authorized by the 
Contracting Officer, termination inventory other than that retained by 
the Government under subparagraph (b)(6) of this clause; provided, 
however, that the Contractor (i) is not required to extend credit to any 
purchaser and (ii) may acquire the property under the conditions 
prescribed by, and at prices approved by, the Contracting Officer. The 
proceeds of any transfer or disposition will be applied to reduce any 
payments to be made by the Government under this contract, credited to 
the price or cost of the work, or paid in any other manner directed by 
the Contracting Officer.
    (c) The Contractor shall submit complete termination inventory 
schedules no later

[[Page 375]]

than 120 days from the effective date of termination, unless extended in 
writing by the Contracting Officer upon written request of the 
Contractor within this 120-day period.
    (d) After termination, the Contractor shall submit a final 
termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form 
and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The 
Contractor shall submit the proposal promptly but no later than 1 year 
from the effective date of termination unless extended in writing by the 
Contracting Officer upon written request of the Contractor within this 
1-year period. If the Contractor fails to submit the termination 
settlement proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may 
determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, 
due the Contractor because of the termination and shall pay the amount 
determined.
    (e) Subject to paragraph (d) of this clause, the Contractor and the 
Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount 
to be paid because of the termination. This amount may include 
reasonable cancellation charges incurred by the Contractor and any 
reasonable loss on outstanding commitments for personal services that 
the Contractor is unable to cancel; provided, that the Contractor 
exercised reasonable diligence in diverting such commitments to other 
operations. The contract shall be amended and the Contractor paid the 
agreed amount.
    (f) The cost principles and procedures in subpart 31.3 of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), in effect on the date of the 
contract, shall govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under 
this clause; however, if the Contractor is not an educational 
institution, and is a nonprofit organization under Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-122, Cost Principles for Nonprofit 
Organizations, July 8, 1980, those cost principles shall apply; 
provided, that if the Contractor is a nonprofit institution listed in 
Attachment C of OMB Circular A-122, the cost principles at FAR 31.2 for 
commercial organizations shall apply to such contractor.
    (g) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it 
prescribes, make partial payments against costs incurred by the 
Contractor for the terminated portion of this contract, if the 
Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed 
the amount to which the Contractor will be entitled.
    (h) The Contractor has the right of appeal as provided under the 
Disputes clause, except that if the Contractor failed to submit the 
termination settlement proposal within the time provided in paragraph 
(d) of this clause and failed to request a time extension, there is no 
right of appeal.

                             (End of clause)

<R05>
Sec. 52.249-6  Termination (Cost-Reimbursement).

    As prescribed in 49.503(a)(1), insert the following clause:

               Termination (Cost-Reimbursement) (Sep 1996)

    (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this 
contract in whole or, from time to time, in part, if--
    (1) The Contracting Officer determines that a termination is in the 
Government's interest; or
    (2) The Contractor defaults in performing this contract and fails to 
cure the default within 10 days (unless extended by the Contracting 
Officer) after receiving a notice specifying the default. Default 
includes failure to make progress in the work so as to endanger 
performance.
    (b) The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the 
Contractor a Notice of Termination specifying whether termination is for 
default of the Contractor or for convenience of the Government, the 
extent of termination, and the effective date. If, after termination for 
default, it is determined that the Contractor was not in default or that 
the Contractor's failure to perform or to make progress in performance 
is due to causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence 
of the Contractor as set forth in the Excusable Delays clause, the 
rights and obligations of the parties will be the same as if the 
termination was for the convenience of the Government.
    (c) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed 
by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall immediately proceed 
with the following obligations, regardless of any delay in determining 
or adjusting any amounts due under this clause:
    (1) Stop work as specified in the notice.
    (2) Place no further subcontracts or orders (referred to as 
subcontracts in this clause), except as necessary to complete the 
continued portion of the contract.
    (3) Terminate all subcontracts to the extent they relate to the work 
terminated.
    (4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting 
Officer, all right, title, and interest of the Contractor under the 
subcontracts terminated, in which case the Government shall have the 
right to settle or to pay any termination settlement proposal arising 
out of those terminations.
    (5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the 
Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination 
settlement proposals arising from the

[[Page 376]]

termination of subcontracts, the cost of which would be reimbursable in 
whole or in part, under this contract; approval or ratification will be 
final for purposes of this clause.
    (6) Transfer title (if not already transferred) and, as directed by 
the Contracting Officer, deliver to the Government (i) the fabricated or 
unfabricated parts, work in process, completed work, supplies, and other 
material produced or acquired for the work terminated, (ii) the 
completed or partially completed plans, drawings, information, and other 
property that, if the contract had been completed, would be required to 
be furnished to the Government, and (iii) the jigs, dies, fixtures, and 
other special tools and tooling acquired or manufactured for this 
contract, the cost of which the Contractor has been or will be 
reimbursed under this contract.
    (7) Complete performance of the work not terminated.
    (8) Take any action that may be necessary, or that the Contracting 
Officer may direct, for the protection and preservation of the property 
related to this contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and 
in which the Government has or may acquire an interest.
    (9) Use its best efforts to sell, as directed or authorized by the 
Contracting Officer, any property of the types referred to in 
subparagraph (c)(6) of this clause; provided, however, that the 
Contractor (i) is not required to extend credit to any purchaser and 
(ii) may acquire the property under the conditions prescribed by, and at 
prices approved by, the Contracting Officer. The proceeds of any 
transfer or disposition will be applied to reduce any payments to be 
made by the Government under this contract, credited to the price or 
cost of the work, or paid in any other manner directed by the 
Contracting Officer.
    (d) The Contractor shall submit complete termination inventory 
schedules no later than 120 days from the effective date of termination, 
unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written 
request of the Contractor within this 120-day period.
    (e) After expiration of the plant clearance period as defined in 
subpart 45.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Contractor may 
submit to the Contracting Officer a list, certified as to quantity and 
quality, of termination inventory not previously disposed of, excluding 
items authorized for disposition by the Contracting Officer. The 
Contractor may request the Government to remove those items or enter 
into an agreement for their storage. Within 15 days, the Government will 
accept the items and remove them or enter into a storage agreement. The 
Contracting Officer may verify the list upon removal of the items, or if 
stored, within 45 days from submission of the list, and shall correct 
the list, as necessary, before final settlement.
    (f) After termination, the Contractor shall submit a final 
termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form 
and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The 
Contractor shall submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year 
from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by 
the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Contractor within 
this 1-year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that 
the facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received 
and acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Contractor fails to 
submit the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may 
determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, 
due the Contractor because of the termination and shall pay the amount 
determined.
    (g) Subject to paragraph (f) of this clause, the Contractor and the 
Contracting Officer may agree on the whole or any part of the amount to 
be paid (including an allowance for fee) because of the termination. The 
contract shall be amended, and the Contractor paid the agreed amount.
    (h) If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree in 
whole or in part on the amount of costs and/or fee to be paid because of 
the termination of work, the Contracting Officer shall determine, on the 
basis of information available, the amount, if any, due the Contractor, 
and shall pay that amount, which shall include the following:
    (1) All costs reimbursable under this contract, not previously paid, 
for the performance of this contract before the effective date of the 
termination, and those costs that may continue for a reasonable time 
with the approval of or as directed by the Contracting Officer; however, 
the Contractor shall discontinue these costs as rapidly as practicable.
    (2) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement proposals 
under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to the 
terminated portion of the contract if not included in subparagraph 
(h)(1) of this clause.
    (3) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, 
including--
    (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably 
necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and 
supporting data;
    (ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the 
amounts of such settlements); and
    (iii) Storage, transportation, and other costs incurred, reasonably 
necessary for the preservation, protection, or disposition of the 
termination inventory. If the termination is for default, no amounts for 
the

[[Page 377]]

preparation of the Contractor's termination settlement proposal may be 
included.
    (4) A portion of the fee payable under the contract, determined as 
follows:
    (i) If the contract is terminated for the convenience of the 
Government, the settlement shall include a percentage of the fee equal 
to the percentage of completion of work contemplated under the contract, 
but excluding subcontract effort included in subcontractors' termination 
proposals, less previous payments for fee.
    (ii) If the contract is terminated for default, the total fee 
payable shall be such proportionate part of the fee as the total number 
of articles (or amount of services) delivered to and accepted by the 
Government is to the total number of articles (or amount of services) of 
a like kind required by the contract.
    (5) If the settlement includes only fee, it will be determined under 
subparagraph (h)(4) of this clause.
    (i) The cost principles and procedures in part 31 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall 
govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause.
    (j) The Contractor shall have the right of appeal, under the 
Disputes clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer 
under paragraph (f), (h), or (l) of this clause, except that if the 
Contractor failed to submit the termination settlement proposal within 
the time provided in paragraph (f) and failed to request a time 
extension, there is no right of appeal. If the Contracting Officer has 
made a determination of the amount due under paragraph (f), (h) or (l) 
of this clause, the Government shall pay the Contractor (1) the amount 
determined by the Contracting Officer if there is no right of appeal or 
if no timely appeal has been taken, or (2) the amount finally determined 
on an appeal.
    (k) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, 
there shall be deducted--
    (1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Contractor, 
under the terminated portion of this contract;
    (2) Any claim which the Government has against the Contractor under 
this contract; and
    (3) The agreed price for, or the proceeds of sale of materials, 
supplies, or other things acquired by the Contractor or sold under this 
clause and not recovered by or credited to the Government.
    (l) The Contractor and Contracting Officer must agree to any 
equitable adjustment in fee for the continued portion of the contract 
when there is a partial termination. The Contracting Officer shall amend 
the contract to reflect the agreement.
    (m)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it 
prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by 
the Contractor for the terminated portion of the contract, if the 
Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed 
the amount to which the Contractor will be entitled.
    (2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be 
due, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government upon 
demand, together with interest computed at the rate established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest 
shall be computed for the period from the date the excess payment is 
received by the Contractor to the date the excess is repaid. Interest 
shall not be charged on any excess payment due to a reduction in the 
Contractor's termination settlement proposal because of retention or 
other disposition of termination inventory until 10 days after the date 
of the retention or disposition, or a later date determined by the 
Contracting Officer because of the circumstances.
    (n) The provisions of this clause relating to fee are inapplicable 
if this contract does not include a fee.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (SEP 1996). If the contract is for construction, 
substitute the following subparagraph (h)(4) for subparagraph (h)(4) of 
the basic clause:

    (4) A portion of the fee payable under the contract determined as 
follows:
    (i) If the contract is terminated for the convenience of the 
Government, the settlement shall include a percentage of the fee equal 
to the percentage of completion of work contemplated under the contract, 
but excluding subcontract effort included in subcontractors' termination 
settlement proposals, less previous payments for fee.
    (ii) If the contract is terminated for default, the total fee 
payable shall be such proportionate part of the fee as the actual work 
in place is to the total work in place required by the contract.
    Alternate II (SEP 1996). If the contract is with an agency of the 
U.S. Government or with State, local, or foreign governments or their 
agencies, and if the contracting officer determines that the requirement 
to pay interest on excess partial payments is inappropriate, delete 
subparagraph (m)(2) from the basic clause.
    Alternate III (SEP 1996). If the contract is for construction with 
an agency of the U.S. Government or with State, local, or foreign 
governments or their agencies, the following subparagraph (h)(4) shall 
be substituted for

[[Page 378]]

subparagraph (h)(4) of the basic clause. Subparagraph (m)(2) may be 
deleted from the basic clause if the contracting officer determines that 
the requirement to pay interest on excess partial payments is 
inappropriate.
    (4) A portion of the fee payable under the contract determined as 
follows:
    (i) If the contract is terminated for the convenience of the 
Government, the settlement shall include a percentage of the fee equal 
to the percentage of completion of work contemplated under the contract, 
but excluding subcontract effort included in subcontractors' termination 
settlement proposals, less previous payments for fee.
    (ii) If the contract is terminated for default, the total fee 
payable shall be such proportionate part of the fee as the actual work 
in place is to the total work in place required by the contract.
    Alternate IV (SEP 1996). If the contract is a time-and-material or 
labor-hour contract, substitute the following paragraphs (h) and (l) for 
paragraphs (h) and (l) of the basic clause:
    (h) If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree in 
whole or in part on the amount to be paid because of the termination of 
work, the Contracting Officer shall determine, on the basis of 
information available, the amount, if any, due the Contractor and shall 
pay the amount determined as follows:
    (1) If the termination is for the convenience of the Government, 
include--
    (i) An amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of 
the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours 
expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) 
in the Schedule, less any hourly rate payments already made to the 
contractor;
    (ii) An amount (computed under the provisions for payment of 
materials) for material expenses incurred before the effective date of 
termination, not previously paid to the Contractor;
    (iii) An amount for labor and material expenses computed as if the 
expenses were incurred before the effective date of termination if they 
are reasonably incurred after the effective date, with the approval of 
or as directed by the Contracting Officer; however, the Contractor shall 
discontinue these expenses as rapidly as practicable;
    (iv) If not included in subdivision (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) above, 
the cost of settling and paying termination settlement proposals under 
terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to the terminated 
portion of the contract; and
    (v) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, 
including--
    (A) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably 
necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and 
supporting data;
    (B) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the 
amounts of such settlements); and
    (C) Storage, transportation, and other costs incurred, reasonably 
necessary for the protection or disposition of the termination 
inventory.
    (2) If the termination is for default of the Contractor, include the 
amounts computed under subparagraph (h)(1) above but omit--
    (i) Any amount for preparation of the Contractor's termination 
settlement proposal; and
    (ii) The portion of the hourly rate allocable to profit for any 
direct labor hours expended in furnishing materials and services not 
delivered to and accepted by the Government.
    (l) If the termination is partial, the Contractor may file with the 
Contracting Officer a proposal for an equitable adjustment of the 
price(s) for the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting 
Officer shall make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by 
the Contractor for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be 
requested within 90 days from the effective date of termination, unless 
extended in writing by the Contracting Officer.
    Alternate V (SEP 1996). If the contract is a time-and-material or 
labor-hour contract with an agency of the U.S. Government or with State, 
local or foreign governments or their agencies, substitute the following

contracting officer determines that the requirement to pay interest on 
excess partial payments is inappropriate.
    (h) If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree in 
whole or in part on the amount to be paid because of the termination of 
work, the Contracting Officer shall determine, on the basis of 
information available, the amount, if any, due the Contractor and shall

    As prescribed in 49.503(b), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts for architect-engineer services when a 
fixed-price contract is contemplated:

         Termination (Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer) (Apr 1984)

    (a) The Government may terminate this contract in whole or, from 
time to time, in part, for the Government's convenience or because of 
the failure of the Contractor to fulfill the contract obligations. The 
Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Contractor a 
Notice of Termination specifying the nature, extent, and effective date 
of the termination. Upon receipt of the notice, the Contractor shall (1) 
immediately discontinue all services affected (unless the notice directs 
otherwise), and (2) deliver to the Contracting Officer all data, 
drawings, specifications, reports, estimates, summaries, and other 
information and materials accumulated in performing this contract, 
whether completed or in process.
    (b) If the termination is for the convenience of the Government, the 
Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract 
price but shall allow no anticipated profit on unperformed services.
    (c) If the termination is for failure of the Contractor to fulfill 
the contract obligations, the Government may complete the work by 
contract or otherwise and the Contractor shall be liable for any 
additional cost incurred by the Government.
    (d) If, after termination for failure to fulfill contract 
obligations, it is determined that the Contractor had not failed, the 
rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the 
termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government.
    (e) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this 
clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law 
or under this contract.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 52.249-8  Default (Fixed-Price Supply and Service).

    As prescribed in 49.504(a)(1), insert the following clause:

           Default (Fixed-Price Supply and Service) (Apr 1984)

    (a)(1) The Government may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, 
by written notice of default to the Contractor, terminate this contract 
in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Deliver the supplies or to perform the services within the time 
specified in this contract or any extension;
    (ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract 
(but see subparagraph (a)(2) below); or
    (iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see 
subparagraph (a)(2) below).

[[Page 380]]

    (2) The Government's right to terminate this contract under 
subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the 
Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if 
authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of the 
notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.
    (b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part, 
it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting 
Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those 
terminated, and the Contractor will be liable to the Government for any 
excess costs for those supplies or services. However, the Contractor 
shall continue the work not terminated.
    (c) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the 
Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to 
perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without 
the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes 
include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the 
Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, 
(4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions (7) strikes, (8) 
freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance 
the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor.
    (d) If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a 
subcontractor at any tier, and if the cause of the default is beyond the 
control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault 
or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not be liable for any 
excess costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted supplies 
or services were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time for 
the Contractor to meet the required delivery schedule.
    (e) If this contract is terminated for default, the Government may 
require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the Government, 
as directed by the Contracting Officer, any (1) completed supplies, and 
(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tools, dies, 
jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights 
(collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in this clause) 
that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the 
terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting 
Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its 
possession in which the Government has an interest.
    (f) The Government shall pay contract price for completed supplies 
delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall 
agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and 
accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. 
Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes clause. The 
Government may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting 
Officer determines to be necessary to protect the Government against 
loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.
    (g) If, after termination, it is determined that the Contractor was 
not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and 
obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had 
been issued for the convenience of the Government.
    (h) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in 
addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this 
contract.

delivery services, within the time specified in this contract or any 
extension;
    (ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract 
(but see subparagraph (a)(2) below); or
    (iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see

    (2) The Government's right to terminate this contract under 
subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the 
Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if 
authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of the 
notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.
    (e) If this contract is terminated while the Contractor has 
possession of Government goods, the Contractor shall, upon direction of 
the Contracting Officer, protect and preserve the goods until 
surrendered to the Government or its agent. The Contractor and 
Contracting Officer shall agree on payment for the preservation and 
protection of goods. Failure to agree on an amount will be a dispute 
under the Disputes clause.

Sec. 52.249-9  Default (Fixed-Price Research and Development).

    As prescribed in 49.504(b), insert the following clause:

        Default (Fixed-Price Research and Development) (Apr 1984)

    (a)(1) The Government may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, 
by written Notice of Default to the Contractor, terminate this contract 
in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Perform the work under the contract within the time specified in 
this contract or any extension;
    (ii) Prosecute the work so as to endanger performance of this 
contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below); or
    (iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see 
subparagraph (a)(2) below).
    (2) The Government's right to terminate this contract under 
subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) of this paragraph may be exercised if 
the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more, if 
authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of the 
notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.
    (b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part, 
it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting 
Officer considers appropriate, work similar to the work terminated, and 
the Contractor will be liable to the Government for any excess costs for 
the similar work. However, the Contractor shall continue the work not 
terminated.
    (c) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the 
Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to 
perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without 
the fault or negliqence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes 
include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the 
Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, 
(4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) 
freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance 
the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor.
    (d) If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a 
subcontractor at any tier, and if the cause of the default is beyond the 
control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault 
or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not be liable for any 
excess costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted supplies 
or services were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time for 
the Contractor to meet the required delivery schedule or other 
performance requirements.
    (e) If this contract is terminated for default, the Government may 
require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the Government, 
as directed by the Contracting Officer, any (1) completed or partially 
completed work not previously delivered to, and accepted by, the 
Government and (2) other property, including contract rights, 
specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this 
contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor 
shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the 
Government has an interest.
    (f) The Government shall pay the contract price, if separately 
stated, for completed work it has accepted and the amount agreed upon by 
the Contractor and the Contracting Officer for (1) completed work for 
which no separate price is stated, (2) partially completed work, (3) 
other property described above that it accepts, and (4) the protection 
and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute 
under the Disputes clause. The Government may withhold from these 
amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to 
protect the Government against loss from outstanding liens or claims of 
former lien holders.
    (g) If, after termination, it is determined that the Contractor was 
not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and 
obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had 
been issued for the convenience of the Government.
    (h) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in 
addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this 
contract.

Sec. 52.249-10  Default (Fixed-Price Construction).

    As prescribed in 49.504(c)(1), insert the following clause:

              Default (Fixed-Price Construction) (Apr 1984)

    (a) If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work or any 
separable part, with the diligence that will insure its completion 
within the time specified in this contract including any extension, or 
fails to complete the work within this time, the Government may, by 
written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right to proceed with 
the work (or the separable part of the work) that has been delayed. In 
this event, the Government may take over the work and complete it by 
contract or otherwise, and may take possession of and use any materials, 
appliances, and plant on the work site

[[Page 382]]

necessary for completing the work. The Contractor and its sureties shall 
be liable for any damage to the Government resulting from the 
Contractor's refusal or failure to complete the work within the 
specified time, whether or not the Contractor's right to proceed with 
the work is terminated. This liability includes any increased costs 
incurred by the Government in completing the work.
    (b) The Contractor's right to proceed shall not be terminated nor 
the Contractor charged with damages under this clause, if--
    (1) The delay in completing the work arises from unforeseeable 
causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the 
Contractor. Examples of such causes include (i) acts of God or of the 
public enemy, (ii) acts of the Government in either its sovereign or 
contractual capacity, (iii) acts of another Contractor in the 
performance of a contract with the Government, (iv) fires, (v) floods, 
(vi) epidemics, (vii) quarantine restrictions, (viii) strikes, (ix) 
freight embargoes, (x) unusually severe weather, or (xi) delays of 
subcontractors or suppliers at any tier arising from unforeseeable 
causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of both 
the Contractor and the subcontractors or suppliers; and
    (2) The Contractor, within 10 days from the beginning of any delay 
(unless extended by the Contracting Officer), notifies the Contracting 
Officer in writing of the causes of delay. The Contracting Officer shall 
ascertain the facts and the extent of delay. If, in the judgment of the 
Contracting Officer, the findings of fact warrant such action, the time 
for completing the work shall be extended. The findings of the 
Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive on the parties, but 
subject to appeal under the Disputes clause.
    (c) If, after termination of the Contractor's right to proceed, it 
is determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the delay 
was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties will be the 
same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the 
Government.
    (d) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in 
addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this 
contract.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). If the contract is for dismantling, 
demolition, or removal of improvements, substitute the following 
paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the basic clause:
    (a)(1) If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work, or 
any separable part, with the diligence that will insure its completion 
within the time specified in this contract, including any extension, or 
fails to complete the work within this time, the Government may, by 
written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right to proceed with 
the work or the part of the work that has been delayed. In this event, 
the Government may take over the work and complete it by contract or 
otherwise, and may take possession of and use any materials, appliances, 
and plant on the work site necessary for completing the work.
    (2) If title to property is vested in the Contractor under this 
contract, it shall revest in the Government regardless of any other 
clause of this contract, except for property that the Contractor has 
disposed of by bona fide sale or removed from the site.
    (3) The Contractor and its sureties shall be liable for any damage 
to the Government resulting from the Contractor's refusal or failure to 
complete the work within the specified time, whether or not the 
Contractor's right to proceed with the work is terminated. This 
liability includes any increased costs incurred by the Government in 
completing the work.
    Alternate II (APR 1984). If the contract is to be awarded during a 
period of national emergency, subparagraph (b)(1) below may be 
substituted for subparagraph (b)(1) of the basic clause:
    (1) The delay in completing the work arises from causes other than 
normal weather beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of 
the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (i) acts of God or of 
the public enemy, (ii) acts of the Government in either its sovereign or 
contractual capacity, (iii) acts of another Contractor in the 
performance of a contract with the Government, (iv) fires, (v) floods, 
(vi) epidemics, (vii) quarantine restrictions, (viii) strikes, (ix) 
freight embargoes, (x) unusually severe weather, or (xi) delays of 
subcontractors or suppliers at any tier arising from causes other than 
normal weather beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of 
both the Contractor and the subcontractors or suppliers; and
    Alternate III (APR 1984). If the contract is for dismantling, 
demolition, or removal of improvements and is to be awarded during a 
period of national emergency, substitute the following paragraph (a) for 
paragraph (a) of the basic clause. The following subparagraph (b)(1) may 
be substituted for subparagraph (b)(1) of the basic clause:
    (a)(1) If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work, or 
any separable part, with the diligence that will insure its completion

event, the Government may take over the work and complete it by contract 
or otherwise, and may take possession of and use any materials, 
appliances, and plant on the work site necessary for completing the 
work.
    (2) If title to property is vested in the Contractor under this 
contract, it shall revest in the Government regardless of any other 
clause of this contract, except for property that the Contractor has 
disposed of by bona fide sale or removed from the site.
    (3) The Contractor and its sureties shall be liable for any damage 
to the Government resulting from the Contractor's refusal or failure to 
complete the work within the specified time, whether or not the 
Contractor's right to proceed with the work is terminated. This 
liability includes any increased costs incurred by the Government in 
completing the work.
    (b) The Contractor's right to proceed shall not be terminated nor 
the Contractor charged with damages under this this clause, if--
    (1) The delay in completing the work arises from causes other than 
normal weather beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of 
the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (i) acts of God or of 
the public enemy, (ii) acts of the Government in either its sovereign or

Sec. 52.249-11  Termination of Work (Consolidated Facilities or Facilities Acquisition).

    As prescribed in 49.505(a), insert the following clause:

 Termination of Work (Consolidated Facilities or Facilities Acquisition) 
                               (Sep 1996)

    (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this 
contract in whole, or from time to time, in part if the Contracting 
Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest. 
The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Contractor 
a Notice of Termination specifying the extent of termination and the 
effective date.
    (b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed 
by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall immediately proceed 
with the following obligations regardless of any delay in determining 
any item of reimbursable cost under this clause:
    (1) Stop work as specified in the notice.
    (2) Place no further subcontracts or orders (referred to as 
subcontracts in this clause) for materials, services, or facilities, 
except as necessary to complete the continued portion of the contract.
    (3) Terminate all subcontracts to the extent they relate to the work 
terminated.
    (4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting 
Officer, all right, title, and interest of the Contractor under the 
subcontracts terminated, in which case the Government shall have the 
right to settle or pay any termination settlement proposal arising out 
of those terminations.
    (5) With the approval or ratification to the extent required by the 
Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination 
settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts, the 
cost of which would be reimbursable in whole or in part under this 
contract; the approval or ratification will be final for purposes of 
this clause.
    (6) Transfer title (if not already transferred) and, as directed by 
the Contracting Officer, deliver to the Government (i) the fabricated or 
unfabricated parts, work in process, completed work, supplies, and other 
material produced or acquired for the work terminated, and (ii) the 
completed or partially completed plans, drawings, information, and other 
property that, if the contract had been completed, would be required to 
be furnished to the Government.
    (7) Complete performance of the work not terminated.
    (8) Take any action that may be necessary, or that the Contracting 
Officer may direct, for the protection and preservation of the property 
related to this contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and 
in which the Government has or may acquire an interest.
    (9) Use its best efforts to sell, as directed or authorized by the 
Contracting Officer, any property of the types referred to in 
subparagraph (b)(6) of this clause; provided, however, that the 
Contractor (i) is not required to extend credit to any purchaser and 
(ii) may acquire the property under the conditions prescribed by, and at 
prices approved by, the Contracting Officer. The proceeds of any 
transfer or disposition will be applied to reduce any payments to be 
made by the Government under this contract, credited to the price or 
cost of the work, or paid in any other manner directed by the 
Contracting Officer.

[[Page 384]]

    (c) The Contractor shall submit complete termination inventory 
schedules no later than 120 days from the effective date of termination, 
unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written 
request of the Contractor within this 120-day period.
    (d) After expiration of the plant clearance period as defined in 
subpart 45.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Contractor may 
submit a list, to the Contracting Officer certified as to quantity and 
quality, of termination inventory not previously disposed of, excluding 
items authorized for disposition by the Contracting Officer. The 
Contractor may request the Government to remove these items or enter 
into an agreement for their storage. Within 15 days, the Government 
shall accept the items and remove them or enter into a storage 
agreement. The Contracting Officer may verify the list upon removal of 
the items or, if stored, within 45 days from submission of the list, and 
shall correct the list, as necessary, before final settlement.
    (e) After termination, the Contractor shall submit a final 
termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form 
and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The 
Contractor shall submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year 
from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by 
the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Contractor within 
this 1-year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that 
the facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received 
and acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Contractor fails to 
submit the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may 
determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, 
due the Contractor because of the termination and shall pay that amount.
    (f) Subject to paragraph (e) of this clause, the Contractor and the 
Contracting Officer may agree on the whole or any part of the amount to 
be paid because of the termination. The contract shall be amended, and 
the Contractor paid the agreed amount.
    (g) If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on 
the whole amount of costs to be paid because of the termination of work, 
the Contracting Officer shall determine, on the basis of information 
available, the amount, if any, due the Contractor, and shall pay the 
amount, determined as follows:
    (1) All costs reimbursable under this contract, not previously paid, 
for the performance of this contract before the effective date of the 
termination, and part of those costs that may continue for a reasonable 
time with the approval of or as directed by the Contracting Officer; 
however, the Contractor shall discontinue those costs as rapidly as 
practicable.
    (2) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement proposals 
under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to the 
terminated portion of the contract, if not included in subparagraph 
(g)(1) of this clause.
    (3) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, 
including--
    (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably 
necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and 
supporting data;
    (ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts; and
    (iii) Storage, transportation, and other costs incurred, reasonably 
necessary for the preservation, protection, or disposition of the 
termination inventory.
    (h) The cost principles and procedures in part 31 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall 
govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause.
    (i) The Contractor shall have the right of appeal, under the 
Disputes clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer 
under paragraph (e) or (g) of this clause, except that if the Contractor 
failed to submit the termination settlement proposal within the time 
provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, and failed to request a time 
extension, there is no right of appeal. If the Contracting Officer has 
made a determination of the amount due under paragraph (e) or (g) of 
this clause, the Government shall pay the Contractor (1) the amount 
determined by the Contracting Officer if there is no right of appeal or 
if no timely appeal has been taken, or (2) the amount finally determined 
on an appeal.
    (j) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, 
there shall be deducted--
    (1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Contractor, 
under the terminated portion of this contract;
    (2) Any claim which the Government has against the Contractor under 
this contract; and
    (3) The agreed price for, or the proceeds of sale of materials, 
supplies, or other things acquired by the Contractor or sold under this 
clause and not recovered by or credited to the Government.
    (k)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it 
prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by 
the Contractor for the terminated portion of the contract, if the 
Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed 
the amount to which the Contractor will be entitled.
    (2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be 
due, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government upon 
demand, together with interest computed at the rate established by the

[[Page 385]]

Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest 
shall be computed for the period from the date the excess payment is 
received by the Contractor to the date the excess is repaid. Interest 
shall not be charged on any excess payment due to a reduction in the 
Contractor's termination settlement proposal because of retention or 
other disposition of termination inventory until 10 days after the date 
of the retention or disposition, or a later date determined by the 
Contracting Officer because of the circumstances.
    (l) Any related contract of the Contractor may be equitably adjusted 
if it provides for such an adjustment and if it is affected by a Notice 
of Termination under this clause. The Government shall not be liable to 
the Contractor for damages or loss of profits because of any Notice of 
Termination issued under this clause.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (SEP 1996). If the contract is with an agency of the 
U.S. Government or with State, local, or foreign governments or their 
agencies, and if the contracting officer determines that the requirement 
to pay interest on excess partial payments is inappropriate, delete 
subparagraph (k)(2) from the basic clause.

                      Failure to Perform (Apr 1984)

    (a) Subject to the Excusable Delays clause (if included in this 
contract), if the Contractor fails to perform this contract under its 
terms, the Contracting Officer shall give the Contractor written notice 
stating the failure. Thereafter, regardless of any other provision of 
this contract, the Contractor shall not be entitled to an equitable 
adjustment under either this contract or any related contract, to the 
extent the equitable adjustment arises from the Contractor's failure to 
perform or from any reasonable remedial action taken by the Contracting 
Officer based upon the failure.
    (b) The failure of the Government to insist, in one or more 
instances, upon the performance of any term of this contract is not a 
waiver of the Government's right to future performance of such term, and 
the Contractor's obligation for future performance of such term shall 
continue in effect.
    (c) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in 
addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this 
contract.

    As prescribed in 49.505(d), insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts for supplies, services, construction, and 
research and development on a fee basis whenever a cost-reimbursement 
contract is contemplated. Also insert the clause in time-and-material 
contracts, labor-hour contracts, consolidated facilities contracts, and 
facilities acquisition contracts. When used in construction contracts, 
substitute the words completion time for delivery schedule in the last 
sentence of the clause. When used in facilities contracts, substitute 
the words termination of work for termination in the last sentence of 
the clause.

                       Excusable Delays (Apr 1984)

    (a) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the 
Contractor shall not be in default because of any failure to perform 
this contract under its terms if the failure arises from causes beyond 
the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. 
Examples of these causes are (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) 
acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, 
(3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) 
strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In 
each instance, the failure to perform must be beyond the control and 
without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Default includes 
failure to make progress in the work so as to endanger performance.

[[Page 386]]

    (b) If the failure to perform is caused by the failure of a 
subcontractor at any tier to perform or make progress, and if the cause 
of the failure was beyond the control of both the Contractor and 
subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either, the 
Contractor shall not be deemed to be in default, unless--
    (1) The subcontracted supplies or services were obtainable from 
other sources;
    (2) The Contracting Officer ordered the Contractor in writing to 
purchase these supplies or services from the other source; and
    (3) The Contractor failed to comply reasonably with this order.
    (c) Upon request of the Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall 
ascertain the facts and extent of the failure. If the Contracting 
Officer determines that any failure to perform results from one or more 
of the causes above, the delivery schedule shall be revised, subject to 
the rights of the Government under the termination clause of this 
contract.

    As prescribed in 50.403-3, insert the following clause in contracts 
whenever the approving official determines that the contractor shall be 
indemnified against unusually hazardous or nuclear risks (also see 
50.403-2(c)):

            Indemnification Under Public Law 85-804 (Apr 1984)

    (a) Contractor's principal officials, as used in this clause, means 
directors, officers, managers, superintendents, or other representatives 
supervising or directing--
    (1) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business;
    (2) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operations at any 
one plant or separate location in which this contract is being 
performed; or
    (3) A separate and complete major industrial operation in connection 
with the performance of this contract.
    (b) Under Pub. L. 85-804 (50 U.S.C 1431-1435) and Executive Order 
10789, as amended, and regardless of any other provisions of this 
contract, the Government shall, subject to the limitations contained in 
the other paragraphs of this clause, indemnify the Contractor against--
    (1) Claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or 
settlement) by third persons (including employees of the Contractor) for 
death; personal injury; or loss of, damage to, or loss of use of 
property;
    (2) Loss of, damage to, or loss of use of Contractor property, 
excluding loss of profit; and
    (3) Loss of, damage to, or loss of use of Government property, 
excluding loss of profit.
    (c) This indemnification applies only to the extent that the claim, 
loss, or damage (1) arises out of or results from a risk defined in this 
contract as unusually hazardous or nuclear and (2) is not compensated 
for by insurance or otherwise. Any such claim, loss, or damage, to the 
extent that it is within the deductible amounts of the Contractor's 
insurance, is not covered under this clause. If insurance coverage or 
other financial protection in effect on the date the approving official 
authorizes use of this clause is reduced, the Government's liability 
under this clause shall not increase as a result.
    (d) When the claim, loss, or damage is caused by willful misconduct 
or lack of good faith on the part of any of the Contractor's principal 
officials, the Contractor shall not be indemnified for--
    (1) Government claims against the Contractor (other than those 
arising through subrogation); or
    (2) Loss or damage affecting the Contractor's property.
    (e) With the Contracting Officer's prior written approval, the 
Contractor may, in any subcontract under this contract, indemnify the 
subcontractor against any risk defined in this contract as unusually 
hazardous or nuclear. This indemnification shall provide, between the 
Contractor and the subcontractor, the same rights and duties, and the 
same provisions for notice, furnishing of evidence or proof, and 
Government settlement or defense of claims as this clause provides. The 
Contracting Officer may also approve indemnification of subcontractors 
at any lower tier, under the same terms and conditions. The Government 
shall indemnify the Contractor against liability to subcontractors 
incurred under subcontract provisions approved by the Contracting 
Officer.
    (f) The rights and obligations of the parties under this clause 
shall survive this contract's termination, expiration, or completion. 
The Government shall make no payment under this clause unless the agency 
head determines that the amount is just and reasonable. The Government 
may pay the Contractor or subcontractors, or may directly pay parties to 
whom the Contractor or subcontractors may be liable.
    (g) The Contractor shall--
    (1) Promptly notify the Contracting Officer of any claim or action 
against, or any loss by, the Contractor or any subcontractors that may 
reasonably be expected to involve indemnification under this clause;
    (2) Immediately furnish to the Government copies of all pertinent 
papers the Contractor receives;

[[Page 387]]

    (3) Furnish evidence or proof of any claim, loss, or damage covered 
by this clause in the manner and form the Government requires; and
    (4) Comply with the Government's directions and execute any 
authorizations required in connection with settlement or defense of 
claims or actions.
    (h) The Government may direct, control, or assist in settling or 
defending any claim or action that may involve indemnification under 
this clause.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (APR 1984). In cost-reimbursement contracts, add the 
following paragraph (i) to the basic clause:
    (i) The cost of insurance (including self-insurance programs) 
covering a risk defined in this contract as unusually hazardous or 
nuclear shall not be reimbursed except to the extent that the 
Contracting Officer has required or approved this insurance. The 
Government's obligations under this clause are--
    (1) Excepted from the release required under this contract's clause 
relating to allowable cost; and
    (2) Not affected by this contract's Limitation of Cost or Limitation 
of Funds clause.


<R05>
Sec. 52.251-1  Government Supply Sources.

    As prescribed in 51.107, insert the following clause in 
solicitations and contracts when the contracting officer may authorize 
the contractor to acquire supplies or services from a Government supply 
source:

                   Government Supply Sources (Apr 1984)

    The Contracting Officer may issue the Contractor an authorization to 
use Government supply sources in the performance of this contract. Title 
to all property acquired by the Contractor under such an authorization 
shall vest in the Government unless otherwise specified in the contract. 
Such property shall not be considered to be Government-furnished 
property, as distinguished from Government property. The provisions of 
the clause entitled Government Property, except its paragraphs (a) and 
(b), shall apply to all property acquired under such authorization.

                             (End of clause)
