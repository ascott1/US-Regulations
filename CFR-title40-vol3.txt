                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2001), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 52.02  Introduction.

    (a) This part sets forth the Administrator's approval and 
disapproval of State plans and the Administrator's promulgation of such 
plans or portions thereof. Approval of a plan or any portion thereof is 
based upon a determination by the Administrator that such plan or 
portion meets the requirements of section 110 of the Act and the 
provisions of part 51 of this chapter.
    (b) Any plan or portion thereof promulgated by the Administrator 
substitutes for a State plan or portion thereof disapproved by the

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 15080, July 27, 1972; 47 
FR 38886, Sept. 3, 1982; 61 FR 16060, Apr. 11, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 52.04  Classification of regions.

    Each subpart sets forth the priority classification, by pollutant, 
for each region in the State. Each plan for each region was evaluated 
according to the requirements of part 51 of this chapter applicable to 
regions of that priority.


<R05>
Sec. 52.05  Public availability of emission data.

    Each subpart sets forth the Administrator's disapproval of plan 
procedures

[[Page 11]]

for making emission data available to the public after correlation with 
applicable emission limitations, and includes the promulgation of 
requirements that sources report emission data to the Administrator for 
correlation and public disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 52.06  Legal authority.

    (a) The Administrator's determination of the absence or inadequacy 
of legal authority required to be included in the plan is set forth in 
each subpart. This includes the legal authority of local agencies and 
State governmental agencies other than an air pollution control agency 
if such other agencies are assigned responsibility for carrying out a 
plan or portion thereof.
    (b) No legal authority as such is promulgated by the Administrator. 
Where required regulatory provisions are not included in the plan by the 
State because of inadequate legal authority, substitute provisions are 
promulgated by the Administrator.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 33922, June 29, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 52.07  Control strategies.

    (a) Each subpart specifies in what respects the control strategies 
are approved or disapproved. Where emission limitations with a future 
effective date are employed to carry out a control strategy, approval of 
the control strategy and the implementing regulations does not supersede 
the requirements of subpart N of this chapter relating to compliance 
schedules for individual sources or categories of sources. Compliance 
schedules for individual sources or categories of sources must require 
such sources to comply with applicable requirements of the plan as 
expeditiously as practicable, where the requirement is part of a control 
strategy designed to attain a primary standard, or within a reasonable 
time, where the requirement is part of a control strategy designed to 
attain a secondary standard. All sources must be required to comply with 
applicable requirements of the plan no later than the date specified in 
this part for attainment of the national standard which the requirement 
is intended to implement.
    (b) A control strategy may be disapproved as inadequate because it 
is not sufficiently comprehensive, although all regulations provided to 
carry out the strategy may themselves be approved. In this case, 
regulations for carrying out necessary additional measures are 
promulgated in the subpart.
    (c) Where a control strategy is adequate to attain and maintain a 
national standard but one or more of the regulations to carry it out is 
not adopted or not enforceable by the State, the control strategy is 
approved and the necessary regulations are promulgated by the 
Administrator.
    (d) Where a control strategy is adequate to attain and maintain air 
quality better than that provided for by a national standard but one or 
more of the regulations to carry it out is not adopted or not 
enforceable by the State, the control strategy is approved and 
substitute regulations necessary to attain and maintain the national 
standard are promulgated.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 19807, Sept. 22, 1972; 
51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 52.08  Rules and regulations.

    Each subpart identifies the regulations, including emission 
limitations, which are disapproved by the Administrator, and includes 
the regulations which the Administrator promulgates.


<R05>
Sec. 52.09  Compliance schedules.

    (a) In each subpart, compliance schedules disapproved by the 
Administrator are identified, and compliance schedules promulgated by 
the Administrator are set forth.
    (b) Individual source compliance schedules submitted with certain 
plans have not yet been evaluated, and are not approved or disapproved.
    (c) The Administrator's approval or promulgation of any compliance 
schedule shall not affect the responsibility of the owner or operator to 
comply with any applicable emission limitation on and after the date for 
final compliance specified in the applicable schedule.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 38 FR 30877, Nov. 8, 1973]

[[Page 12]]


<R05>
Sec. 52.10  Review of new sources and modifications.

    In any plan where the review procedure for new sources and source 
modifications does not meet the requirements of subpart I of this 
chapter, provisions are promulgated which enable the Administrator to 
obtain the necessary information and to prevent construction or 
modification.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 51 FR 40677, Nov. 7, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 52.11  Prevention of air pollution emergency episodes.

    (a) Each subpart identifies portions of the air pollution emergency 
episode contingency plan which are disapproved, and sets forth the 
Administrator's promulgation of substitute provisions.
    (b) No provisions are promulgated to replace any disapproved air 
quality monitoring or communications portions of a contingency plan, but 
detailed critiques of such portions are provided to the State.
    (c) Where a State plan does not provide for public announcement 
regarding air pollution emergency episodes or where the State fails to 
give any such public announcement, the Administrator will issue a public 
announcement that an episode stage has been reached. When making such an 
announcement, the Administrator will be guided by the suggested episode 
criteria and emission control actions suggested in Appendix L of part 51 
of this chapter or those in the approved plan.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 19807, Sept. 22, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 52.12  Source surveillance.

    (a) Each subpart identifies the plan provisions for source 
surveillance which are disapproved, and sets forth the Administrator's 
promulgation of necessary provisions for requiring sources to maintain 
records, make reports, and submit information.
    (b) No provisions are promulgated for any disapproved State or local 
agency procedures for testing, inspection, investigation, or detection, 
but detailed critiques of such portions are provided to the State.
    (c) For purposes of Federal enforcement, the following test 
procedures and methods shall be used, provided that for the purpose of 
establishing whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of 
any provision of the plan, nothing in this part shall preclude the use, 
including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, 
relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with 
applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance 
test procedures or methods had been performed:
    (1) Sources subject to plan provisions which do not specify a test 
procedure and sources subject to provisions promulgated by the 
Administrator will be tested by means of the appropriate procedures and 
methods prescribed in part 60 of this chapter unless otherwise specified 
in this part.
    (2) Sources subject to approved provisions of a plan wherein a test 
procedure is specified will be tested by the specified procedure.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 40 FR 26032, June 20, 1975; 62 
FR 8328, Feb. 24, 1997]


<R05>

    Disapproved portions of the plan related to the air quality 
surveillance system, resources, and intergovernmental cooperation are 
identified in each subpart, and detailed critiques of such portions are 
provided to the State. No provisions are promulgated by the 
Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 52.14  State ambient air quality standards.

    Any ambient air quality standard submitted with a plan which is less 
stringent than a national standard is not considered part of the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 52.15  Public availability of plans.

    Each State shall make available for public inspection at least one 
copy of the plan in at least one city in each region to which such plan 
is applicable. All such copies shall be kept current.

[[Page 13]]


<R05>

Sec. 52.20  Attainment dates for national standards.

    Each subpart contains a section which specifies the latest dates by 
which national standards are to be attained in each region in the State. 
An attainment date which only refers to a month and a year (such as July 
1975) shall be construed to mean the last day of the month in question. 
However, the specification of attainment dates for national standards 
does not relieve any State from the provisions of subpart N of this 
chapter which require all sources and categories of sources to comply 
with applicable requirements of the plan--
    (a) As expeditiously as practicable where the requirement is part of 
a control strategy designed to attain a primary standard, and
    (b) Within a reasonable time where the requirement is part of a 
control strategy designed to attain a secondary standard.

Sec. 52.21  Prevention of significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a) Plan disapproval. The provisions of this section are applicable 
to any State implementation plan which has been disapproved with respect 
to prevention of significant deterioration of air quality in any portion 
of any State where the existing air quality is better than the national 
ambient air quality standards. Specific disapprovals are listed where 
applicable, in subparts B

[[Page 14]]

through DDD of this part. The provisions of this section have been 
incorporated by reference into the applicable implementation plans for 
various States, as provided in subparts B through DDD of this part. 
Where this section is so incorporated, the provisions shall also be 
applicable to all lands owned by the Federal Goverment and Indian 
Reservations located in such State. No disapproval with respect to a 
State's failure to prevent significant deterioration of air quality 
shall invalidate or otherwise affect the obligations of States, emission 
sources, or other persons with respect to all portions of plans approved 
or promulgated under this part.

1980, is being regulated under section 111 or 112 of the Act.
    (2)(i) Major modification means any physical change in or change in 
the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result 
in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant subject to 
regulation under the Act.
    (ii) Any net emissions increase that is significant for volatile 
organic compounds shall be considered significant for ozone.
    (iii) A physical change or change in the method of operation shall

unless such change would be prohibited under any federally enforceable 
permit condition which was established after January 6, 1975 pursuant to 
40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR subpart I 
or 40 CFR 51.166; or
    (2) The source is approved to use under any permit issued under 40 
CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR 51.166;
    (f) An increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate, 
unless such change would be prohibited under any federally enforceable

to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR subpart 
I or 40 CFR 51.166.
    (g) Any change in ownership at a stationary source.
    (h) The addition, replacement or use of a pollution control project 
at an existing electric utility steam generating unit, unless the 
Administrator determines that such addition, replacement, or use renders 
the unit less environmentally beneficial, or except:
    (1) When the Administrator has reason to believe that the pollution 
control project would result in a significant net increase in 
representative actual annual emissions of any criteria pollutant over 
levels used for that source in the most recent air quality impact 
analysis in the area conducted for the purpose of title I, if any, and
    (2) The Administrator determines that the increase will cause or 
contribute to a violation of any national ambient air quality standard 
or PSD increment, or visibility limitation.
    (i) The installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a 
temporary clean coal technology demonstration project, provided that the 
project complies with:
    (1) The State implementation plan for the State in which the project 
is located, and
    (2) Other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the national 
ambient air quality standards during the project and after it is 
terminated.
    (j) The installation or operation of a permanent clean coal 
technology demonstration project that constitutes repowering, provided 
that the project does not result in an increase in the potential to emit 
of any regulated pollutant emitted by the unit. This exemption shall 
apply on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis.
    (k) The reactivation of a very clean coal-fired electric utility 
steam generating unit.
    (3)(i) Net emissions increase means the amount by which the sum of 
the following exceeds zero:
    (a) Any increase in actual emissions from a particular physical 
change or change in method of operation at a stationary source; and
    (b) Any other increases and decreases in actual emissions at the 
source that are contemporaneous with the particular change and are 
otherwise creditable.
    (ii) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is contemporaneous 
with the

[[Page 16]]

increase from the particular change only if it occurs between:
    (a) The date five years before construction on the particular change 
commences; and
    (b) The date that the increase from the particular change occurs.
    (iii) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is creditable only 
if the Administrator has not relied on it in issuing a permit for the 
source under this section, which permit is in effect when the increase 
in actual emissions from the particular change occurs.
    (iv) An increase or decrease in actual emissions of sulfur dioxide, 
particulate matter, or nitrogen oxide, which occurs before the 
applicable minor source baseline date is creditable only if it is 
required to be considered in calculating the amount of maximum allowable 
increases remaining available. With respect to particulate matter, only 
PM-10 emissions can be used to evaluate the net emissions increase for 
PM-10.
    (v) An increase in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent 
that the new level of actual emissions exceeds the old level.
    (vi) A decrease in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent 
that:
    (a) The old level of actual emissions or the old level of allowable 
emissions, whichever is lower, exceeds the new level of actual 
emissions;
    (b) It is federally enforceable at and after the time that actual 
construction on the particular change begins; and
    (c) It has approximately the same qualitative significance for 
public health and welfare as that attributed to the increase from the 
particular change.
    (vii) [Reserved]
    (viii) An increase that results from a physical change at a source 
occurs when the emissions unit on which construction occurred becomes 
operational and begins to emit a particular pollutant. Any replacement 
unit that requires shakedown becomes operational only after a reasonable 
shakedown period, not to exceed 180 days.
    (4) Potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary 
source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. 
Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the source to 
emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and 
restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material 
combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design 
if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally 
enforceable. Secondary emissions do not count in determining the 
potential to emit of a stationary source.
    (5) Stationary source means any building, structure, facility, or 
installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant subject to 
regulation under the Act.
    (6) Building, structure, facility, or installation means all of the 
pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial 
grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, 
and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common 
control) except the activities of any vessel. Pollutant-emitting 
activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping 
if they belong to the same ``Major Group'' (i.e., which have the same 
first two digit code) as described in the Standard Industrial 
Classification Manual, 1972, as amended by the 1977 Supplement (U. S. 
Government Printing Office stock numbers 4101-0066 and 003-005-00176-0, 
respectively).
    (7) Emissions unit means any part of a stationary source which emits 
or would have the potential to emit any pollutant subject to regulation 
under the Act.
    (8) Construction means any physical change or change in the method 
of operation (including fabrication, erection, installation, demolition, 
or modification of an emissions unit) which would result in a change in 
actual emissions.
    (9) Commence as applied to construction of a major stationary source 
or major modification means that the owner or operator has all necessary 
preconstruction approvals or permits and either has:
    (i) Begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of actual on-
site construction of the source, to be completed within a reasonable 
time; or

[[Page 17]]

    (ii) Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, 
which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the 
owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual construction of the 
source to be completed within a reasonable time.
    (10) Necessary preconstruction approvals or permits means those 
permits or approvals required under Federal air quality control laws and 
regulations and those air quality control laws and regulations which are 
part of the applicable State Implementation Plan.
    (11) Begin actual construction means, in general, initiation of 
physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are 
of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, 
installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground 
pipework and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect 
to a change in method of operations, this term refers to those on-site 
activites other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of 
the change.
    (12) Best available control technology means an emissions limitation 
(including a visible emission standard) based on the maximum degree of 
reduction for each pollutant subject to regulation under Act which would 
be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major 
modification which the Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, taking 
into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other 
costs, determines is achievable for such source or modification through 
application of production processes or available methods, systems, and 
techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel 
combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall 
application of best available control technology result in emissions of 
any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable 
standard under 40 CFR parts 60 and 61. If the Administrator determines 
that technological or economic limitations on the application of 
measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the 
imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, 
work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be 
prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of 
best available control technology. Such standard shall, to the degree 
possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation 
of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide 
for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results.
    (13)(i) ``Baseline concentration'' means that ambient concentration 
level which exists in the baseline area at the time of the applicable 
minor source baseline date. A baseline concentration is determined for 
each pollutant for which a baseline date is established and shall 
include:
    (a) The actual emissions representative of sources in existence on 
the applicable minor source baseline date, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(13)(ii) of this section;
    (b) The allowable emissions of major stationary sources which 
commenced construction before the major source baseline date but were 
not in operation by the applicable minor source baseline date.
    (ii) The following will not be included in the baseline 
concentration and will affect the applicable maximum allowable 
increase(s):
    (a) Actual emissions from any major stationary source on which 
construction commenced after the major source baseline date; and
    (b) Actual emissions increases and decreases at any stationary 
source occurring after the minor source baseline date.
    (14)(i) Major source baseline date means:
    (a) In the case of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, January 6, 
1975, and
    (b) In the case of nitrogen dioxide, February 8, 1988.
    (ii) ``Minor source baseline date'' means the earliest date after 
the trigger date on which a major stationary source or a major 
modification subject to 40 CFR 52.21 or to regulations approved pursuant 
to 40 CFR 51.166 submits a complete application under the relevant 
regulations. The trigger date is:
    (a) In the case of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, August 7, 
1977, and

[[Page 18]]

    (b) In the case of nitrogen dioxide, February 8, 1988.
    (iii) The baseline date is established for each pollutant for which 
increments or other equivalent measures have been established if:
    (a) The area in which the proposed source or modification would 
construct is designated as attainment or unclassifiable under section 
107(d)(i) (D) or (E) of the Act for the pollutant on the date of its 
complete application under 40 CFR 52.21; and
    (b) In the case of a major stationary source, the pollutant would be 
emitted in significant amounts, or, in the case of a major modification, 
there would be a significant net emissions increase of the pollutant.
    (iv) Any minor source baseline date established originally for the 
TSP increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of 
determining the amount of available PM-10 increments, except that the 
Administrator shall rescind a minor source baseline date where it can be 
shown, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the emissions 
increase from the major stationary source, or net emissions increase 
from the major modification, responsible for triggering that date did 
not result in a significant amount of PM-10 emissions.
    (15)(i) Baseline area means any intrastate area (and every part 
thereof) designated as attainment or unclassifiable under section 
107(d)(1) (D) or (E) of the Act in which the major source or major 
modification establishing the minor source baseline date would construct 
or would have an air quality impact equal to or greater than 1 
<greek-m>g/m\3\ (annual average) of the pollutant for which the minor 
source baseline date is established.
    (ii) Area redesignations under section 107(d)(1) (D) or (E) of the 
Act cannot intersect or be smaller than the area of impact of any major 
stationary source or major modification which:
    (a) Establishes a minor source baseline date; or
    (b) Is subject to 40 CFR 52.21 and would be constructed in the same 
state as the state proposing the redesignation.
    (iii) Any baseline area established originally for the TSP 
increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of 
determining the amount of available PM-10 increments, except that such 
baseline area shall not remain in effect if the Administrator rescinds 
the corresponding minor source baseline date in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(14)(iv) of this section.
    (16) Allowable emissions means the emissions rate of a stationary 
source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless 
the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the 
operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent 
of the following:
    (i) The applicable standards as set forth in 40 CFR parts 60 and 61;
    (ii) The applicable State Implementation Plan emissions limitation, 
including those with a future compliance date; or
    (iii) The emissions rate specified as a federally enforceable permit 
condition, including those with a future compliance date.
    (17) Federally enforceable means all limitations and conditions 
which are enforceable by the Administrator, including those requirements 
developed pursuant to 40 CFR parts 60 and 61, requirements within any 
applicable State implementation plan, any permit requirements 
established pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved 
pursuant to 40 CFR part 51, subpart I, including operating permits 
issued under an EPA-approved program that is incorporated into the State 
implementation plan and expressly requires adherence to any permit 
issued under such program.
    (18) Secondary emissions means emissions which would occur as a 
result of the construction or operation of a major stationary source or 
major modification, but do not come from the major stationary source or 
major modification itself. Secondary emissions include emissions from 
any offsite support facility which would not be constructed or increase 
its emissions except as a result of the construction or operation of the 
major stationary source or major modification. Secondary emissions do 
not include any emissions which come directly

[[Page 19]]

from a mobile source, such as emissions from the tailpipe of a motor 
vehicle, from a train, or from a vessel.
    (i) Emissions from ships or trains coming to or from the new or 
modified stationary source; and
    (ii) Emissions from any offsite support facility which would not 
otherwise be constructed or increase its emissions as a result of the 
construction or operation of the major stationary source or major 
modification.
    (19) Innovative control technology means any system of air pollution 
control that has not been adequately demonstrated in practice, but would 
have a substantial likelihood of achieving greater continuous emissions 
reduction than any control system in current practice or of achieving at 
least comparable reductions at lower cost in terms of energy, economics, 
or nonair quality environmental impacts.
    (20) Fugitive emissions means those emissions which could not 
reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally 
equivalent opening.
    (21)(i) Actual emissions means the actual rate of emissions of a 
pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with 
paragraphs (b)(21) (ii) through (iv) of this section.
    (ii) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall 
equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually 
emitted the pollutant during a two-year period which precedes the 
particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. 
The Administrator shall allow the use of a different time period upon a 
determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. 
Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating 
hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or 
combusted during the selected time period.
    (iii) The Administrator may presume that source-specific allowable 
emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the 
unit.
    (iv) For any emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam 
generating unit specified in paragraph (b)(21)(v) of this section) which 
has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions 
shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date.
    (v) For an electric utility steam generating unit (other than a new 
unit or the replacement of an existing unit) actual emissions of the 
unit following the physical or operational change shall equal the 
representative actual annual emissions of the unit, provided the source 
owner or operator maintains and submits to the Administrator on an 
annual basis for a period of 5 years from the date the unit resumes 
regular operation, information demonstrating that the physical or 
operational change did not result in an emissions increase. A longer 
period, not to exceed 10 years, may be required by the Administrator if 
he determines such a period to be more representative of normal source 
post-change operations.
    (22) Complete means, in reference to an application for a permit, 
that the application contains all of the information necessary for 
processing the application.
    (23) (i) Significant means, in reference to a net emissions increase 
or the potential of a source to emit any of the following pollutants, a 
rate of emissions that would equal or exceed any of the following rates:

                      Pollutant and Emissions Rate

Carbon monoxide: 100 tons per year (tpy)

organic compounds): 45 megagrams per year (50 tons per year)

    (ii) Significant means, in reference to a net emissions increase or 
the potential of a source to emit a pollutant subject to regulation 
under the Act that paragraph (b)(23)(i) of this section, does not list, 
any emissions rate.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(23)(i) of this section, 
significant means any emissions rate or any net emissions increase 
associated with a major stationary source or major modification, which 
would construct within 10 kilometers of a Class I area, and have an 
impact on such area equal to or greater than 1 <greek-m>g/m\3\, (24-hour 
average).
    (24) Federal Land Manager means, with respect to any lands in the 
United States, the Secretary of the department with authority over such 
lands.
    (25) High terrain means any area having an elevation 900 feet or 
more above the base of the stack of a source.

States and recognized by the United States as possessing power of self 
government.
    (29) Adverse impact on visibility means visibility impairment which 
interferes with the management, protection, preservation or enjoyment of 
the visitor's visual experience of the Federal Class I area. This 
determination must be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account 
the geographic extent, intensity, duration, frequency and time of 
visibility impairment, and how these factors correlate with (1) times of 
visitor use of the Federal Class I area, and (2) the frequency and 
timing of natural conditions that reduce visibility.
    (30) Volatile organic compounds (VOC) is as defined in 
Sec. 51.100(s) of this chapter.

of operation of a unit, (or a different consecutive two-year period 
within 10 years after that

[[Page 21]]

change, where the Administrator determines that such period is more 
representative of normal source operations), considering the effect any 
such change will have on increasing or decreasing the hourly emissions 
rate and on projected capacity utilization. In projecting future 
emissions the Administrator shall:
    (i) Consider all relevant information, including but not limited to, 
historical operational data, the company's own representations, filings 
with the State or Federal regulatory authorities, and compliance plans 
under title IV of the Clean Air Act; and

from the particular physical change or change in the method of operation 
at an electric utility steam generating unit, that portion of the unit's 
emissions following the change that could have been accommodated during 
the representative baseline period and is attributable to an increase in 
projected capacity utilization at the unit that is unrelated to the 
particular change, including any increased utilization due to the rate 
of electricity demand growth for the utility system as a whole.
    (34) Clean coal technology means any technology, including 
technologies applied at the precombustion, combustion, or post 
combustion stage, at a new or existing facility which will achieve

air quality standards during the project and after it is terminated.
    (37) (i) Repowering means replacement of an existing coal-fired 
boiler with one of the following clean coal technologies: atmospheric or 
pressurized fluidized bed combustion, integrated gasification combined 
cycle, magnetohydrodynamics, direct and indirect coal-fired turbines, 
integrated gasification fuel cells, or as determined by the 
Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, a 
derivative of one or more of these technologies, and any other 
technology capable of controlling multiple combustion emissions 
simultaneously with improved boiler or generation efficiency and with 
significantly greater waste reduction relative to the performance of 
technology in widespread commercial use as of November 15, 1990.
    (ii) Repowering shall also include any oil and/or gas-fired unit 
which has been awarded clean coal technology demonstration funding as of 
January 1, 1991, by the Department of Energy.
    (iii) The Administrator shall give expedited consideration to permit 
applications for any source that satisfies the requirements of this 
subsection and is granted an extension under section 409 of the Clean 
Air Act.
    (38) Reactivation of a very clean coal-fired electric utility steam 
generating unit means any physical change or change in the method of

for such analyses at 40 CFR 52.21(m)(2) as in effect on June 19, 1978. 
Instead, the latter requirements shall apply to any such source or 
modification.
    (ii) The requirements for air quality monitoring in paragraphs 
(m)(1) (ii) through (iv) of this section shall not

[[Page 27]]

apply to a particular source or modification that was not subject to 40 
CFR 52.21 as in effect on June 19, 1978, if the owner or operator of the 
source or modification submits an application for a permit under this 
section on or before June 8, 1981, and the Administrator subsequently 
determines that the application as submitted before that date was 
complete, except with respect to the requirements in paragraphs (m)(1) 
(ii) through (iv).
    (11)(i) At the discretion of the Administrator, the requirements for 
air quality monitoring of PM<INF>10</INF> in paragraphs (m)(1) (i)--(iv) 
of this section may not apply to a particular source or modification 
when the owner or operator of the source or modification submits an 
application for a permit under this section on or before June 1, 1988 
and the Administrator subsequently determines that the application as 
submitted before that date was complete, except with respect to the 
requirements for monitoring particulate matter in paragraphs (m)(1) 
(i)--(iv).
    (ii) The requirements for air quiality monitoring pf PM<INF>10</INF> 
in paragraphs (m)(1), (ii) and (iv) and (m)(3) of this section shall 
apply to a particular source or modification if the owner or operator of 
the source or modification submits an application for a permit under 
this section after June 1, 1988 and no later than December 1, 1988. The 
data shall have been gathered over at least the period from February 1, 
1988 to the date the application becomes otherwise complete in 
accordance with the provisions set forth under paragraph (m)(1)(viii) of 
this section, except that if the Administrator determines that a 
complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data 
over a shorter period (not to be less than 4 months), the data that 
paragraph (m)(1)(iii) requires shall have been gathered over a shorter 
period.
    (12) The requirements of paragraph (k)(2) of this section shall not 
apply to a stationary source or modification with respect to any maximum 
allowable increase for nitrogen oxides if the owner or operator of the 
source or modification submitted an application for a permit under this 
section before the provisions embodying the maximum allowable increase 
took effect as part of the applicable implementation plan and the 
Administrator subsequently determined that the application as submitted 
before that date was complete.
    (13) The requirements in paragraph (k)(2) of this section shall not 
apply to a stationary source or modification with respect to any maximum 
allowable increase for PM-10 if (i) the owner or operator of the source 
or modification submitted an application for a permit under this section 
before the provisions embodying the maximum allowable increases for PM-
10 took effect in an implementation plan to which this section applies, 
and (ii) the Administrator subsequently determined that the application 
as submitted before that date was otherwise complete. Instead, the 
requirements in paragraph (k)(2) shall apply with respect to the maximum 
allowable increases for TSP as in effect on the date the application was 
submitted.
    (j) Control technology review. (1) A major stationary source or 
major modification shall meet each applicable emissions limitation under 
the State Implementation Plan and each applicable emissions standard and 
standard of performance under 40 CFR parts 60 and 61.
    (2) A new major stationary source shall apply best available control 
technology for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act that 
it would have the potential to emit in significant amounts.
    (3) A major modification shall apply best available control 
technology for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act for 
which it would result in a significant net emissions increase at the 
source. This requirement applies to each proposed emissions unit at 
which a net emissions increase in the pollutant would occur as a result 
of a physical change or change in the method of operation in the unit.
    (4) For phased construction projects, the determination of best 
available control technology shall be reviewed and modified as 
appropriate at the latest reasonable time which occurs no later than 18 
months prior to commencement of construction of each independent phase 
of the project. At such time, the owner or operator of the

[[Page 28]]

applicable stationary source may be required to demonstrate the adequacy 
of any previous determination of best available control technology for 
the source.
    (k) Source impact analysis. The owner or operator of the proposed 
source or modification shall demonstrate that allowable emission 
increases from the proposed source or modification, in conjunction with 
all other applicable emissions increases or reductions (including 
secondary emissions), would not cause or contribute to air pollution in 
violation of:
    (1) Any national ambient air quality standard in any air quality 
control region; or
    (2) Any applicable maximum allowable increase over the baseline 
concentration in any area.
    (l) Air quality models. (1) All estimates of ambient concentrations 
required under this paragraph shall be based on applicable air quality 
models, data bases, and other requirements specified in appendix W of 
part 51 of this chapter (Guideline on Air Quality Models).
    (2) Where an air quality model specified in appendix W of part 51 of 
this chapter (Guideline on Air Quality Models) is inappropriate, the 
model may be modified or another model substituted. Such a modification 
or substitution of a model may be made on a case-by-case basis or, where 
appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific state program. Written 
approval of the Administrator must be obtained for any modification or 
substitution. In addition, use of a modified or substituted model must 
be subject to notice and opportunity for public comment under procedures 
developed in accordance with paragraph (q) of this section.
    (m) Air quality analysis--(1) Preapplication analysis. (i) Any 
application for a permit under this section shall contain an analysis of 
ambient air quality in the area that the major stationary source or 
major modification would affect for each of the following pollutants:
    (a) For the source, each pollutant that it would have the potential 
to omit in a significant amount;
    (b) For the modification, each pollutant for which it would result 
in a significant net emissions increase.
    (ii) With respect to any such pollutant for which no National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard exists, the analysis shall contain such air 
quality monitoring data as the Administrator determines is necessary to 
assess ambient air quality for that pollutant in any area that the 
emissions of that pollutant would affect.
    (iii) With respect to any such pollutant (other than nonmethane 
hydrocarbons) for which such a standard does exist, the analysis shall 
contain continuous air quality monitoring data gathered for purposes of 
determining whether emissions of that pollutant would cause or 
contribute to a violation of the standard or any maximum allowable 
increase.
    (iv) In general, the continuous air quality monitoring data that is 
required shall have been gathered over a period of at least one year and 
shall represent at least the year preceding receipt of the application, 
except that, if the Administrator determines that a complete and 
adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data gathered over 
a period shorter than one year (but not to be less than four months), 
the data that is required shall have been gathered over at least that 
shorter period.
    (v) For any application which becomes complete, except as to the 
requirements of paragraphs (m)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section, 
between June 8, 1981, and February 9, 1982, the data that paragraph 
(m)(1)(iii) of this section, requires shall have been gathered over at 
least the period from February 9, 1981, to the date the application 
becomes otherwise complete, except that:
    (a) If the source or modification would have been major for that 
pollutant under 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect on June 19, 1978, any 
monitoring data shall have been gathered over at least the period 
required by those regulations.
    (b) If the Administrator determines that a complete and adequate 
analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data over a shorter period 
(not to be less than four months), the data that paragraph (m)(1)(iii) 
of this section, requires shall have been gathered over at least that 
shorter period.

[[Page 29]]

    (c) If the monitoring data would relate exclusively to ozone and 
would not have been required under 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect on June 19, 
1978, the Administrator may waive the otherwise applicable requirements 
of this paragraph (v) to the extent that the applicant shows that the 
monitoring data would be unrepresentative of air quality over a full 
year.
    (vi) The owner or operator of a proposed stationary source or 
modification of violatile organic compounds who satisfies all conditions 
of 40 CFR part 51 Appendix S, section IV may provide post-approval 
monitoring data for ozone in lieu of providing preconstruction data as 
requried under paragraph (m)(1) of this section.
    (vii) For any application that becomes complete, except as to the 
requirements of paragraphs (m)(1) (iii) and (iv) pertaining to 
PM<INF>10</INF>, after December 1, 1988 and no later than August 1, 1989 
the data that paragraph (m)(1)(iii) requires shall have been gathered 
over at least the period from August 1, 1988 to the date the application 
becomes otherwise complete, except that if the Administrator determines 
that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with 
monitoring data over a shorter period (not to be less than 4 months), 
the data that paragraph (m)(1)(iii) requires shall have been gathered 
over that shorter period.
    (viii) With respect to any requirements for air quality monitoring 
of PM<INF>10</INF> under paragraphs (i)(11) (i) and (ii) of this section 
the owner or operator of the source or modification shall use a 
monitoring method approved by the Administratorand shall estimate the 
ambient concentrations of PM<INF>10</INF> using the data collected by 
such approved monitoring method in accordance with estimating procedures 
approved by the Administrator.
    (2) Post-construction monitoring. The owner or operator of a major 
stationary source or major modification shall, after construction of the 
stationary source or modification, conduct such ambient monitoring as 
the Administrator determines is necessary to determine the effect 
emissions from the stationary source or modification may have, or are 
having, on air quality in any area.
    (3) Operations of monitoring stations. The owner or operator of a 
major stationary source or major modification shall meet the 
requirements of Appendix B to part 58 of this chapter during the 
operation of monitoring stations for purposes of satisfying paragraph 
(m) of this section.
    (n) Source information. The owner or operator of a proposed source 
or modification shall submit all information necessary to perform any 
analysis or make any determination required under this section.
    (1) With respect to a source or modification to which paragraphs 
(j), (l), (n) and (p) of this section apply, such information shall 
include:
    (i) A description of the nature, location, design capacity, and 
typical operating schedule of the source or modification, including 
specifications and drawings showing its design and plant layout;
    (ii) A detailed schedule for construction of the source or 
modification;
    (iii) A detailed description as to what system of continuous 
emission reduction is planned for the source or modification, emission 
estimates, and any other information necessary to determine that best 
available control technology would be applied.
    (2) Upon request of the Administrator, the owner or operator shall 
also provide information on:
    (i) The air quality impact of the source or modification, including 
meteorological and topographical data necessary to estimate such impact; 
and
    (ii) The air quality impacts, and the nature and extent of any or 
all general commercial, residential, industrial, and other growth which 
has occurred since August 7, 1977, in the area the source or 
modification would affect.
    (o) Additional impact analyses. (1) The owner or operator shall 
provide an analysis of the impairment to visibility, soils and 
vegetation that would occur as a result of the source or modification 
and general commercial, residential, industrial and other growth 
associated with the source or modification. The owner or operator need 
not provide an analysis of the impact on

[[Page 30]]

vegetation having no significant commercial or recreational value.
    (2) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the air 
quality impact projected for the area as a result of general commercial, 
residential, industrial and other growth associated with the source or 
modification.
    (3) Visibility monitoring. The Administrator may require monitoring 
of visibility in any Federal class I area near the proposed new 
stationary source for major modification for such purposes and by such 
means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate.
    (p) Sources impacting Federal Class I areas--additional 
requirements--(1) Notice to Federal land managers. The Administrator 
shall provide written notice of any permit application for a proposed 
major stationary source or major modification, the emissions from which 
may affect a Class I area, to the Federal land manager and the Federal 
official charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands 
within any such area. Such notification shall include a copy of all 
information relevant to the permit application and shall be given within 
30 days of receipt and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on 
the application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall 
include an analysis of the proposed source's anticipated impacts on 
visibility in the Federal Class I area. The Administrator shall also 
provide the Federal land manager and such Federal officials with a copy 
of the preliminary determination required under paragraph (q) of this 
section, and shall make available to them any materials used in making 
that determination, promptly after the Administrator makes such 
determination. Finally, the Administrator shall also notify all affected 
Federal land managers within 30 days of receipt of any advance 
notification of any such permit application.
    (2) Federal Land Manager. The Federal Land Manager and the Federal 
official charged with direct responsibility for management of such lands 
have an affirmative responsibility to protect the air quality related 
values (including visibility) of such lands and to consider, in 
consultation with the Administrator, whether a proposed source or 
modification will have an adverse impact on such values.
    (3) Visibility analysis. The Administrator shall consider any 
analysis performed by the Federal land manager, provided within 30 days 
of the notification required by paragraph (p)(1) of this section, that 
shows that a proposed new major stationary source or major modification 
may have an adverse impact on visibility in any Federal Class I area. 
Where the Administrator finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate 
to the satisfaction of the Administrator that an adverse impact on 
visibility will result in the Federal Class I area, the Administrator 
must, in the notice of public hearing on the permit application, either 
explain his decision or give notice as to where the explanation can be 
obtained.
    (4) Denial--impact on air quality related values. The Federal Land 
Manager of any such lands may demonstrate to the Administrator that the 
emissions from a proposed source or modification would have an adverse 
impact on the air quality-related values (including visibility) of those 
lands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from 
emissions from such source or modification would not cause or contribute 
to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for 
a Class I area. If the Administrator concurs with such demonstration, 
then he shall not issue the permit.
    (5) Class I variances. The owner or operator of a proposed source or 
modification may demonstrate to the Federal Land Manager that the 
emissions from such source or modification would have no adverse impact 
on the air quality related values of any such lands (including 
visibility), notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting 
from emissions from such source or modification would cause or 
contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable 
increases for a Class I area. If the Federal land manager concurs with 
such demonstration and he so certifies, the State may authorize the 
Administrator: Provided, That the applicable requirements of this 
section are otherwise met, to issue

[[Page 31]]

the permit with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure 
that emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen 
oxides would not exceed the following maximum allowable increases over 
minor source baseline concentration for such pollutants:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Maximum
                                                              allowable
                                                               increase

Nitrogen dioxide:
    Annual arithmetic mean.................................           25
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (6) Sulfur dioxide variance by Governor with Federal Land Manager's 
concurrence. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification 
which cannot be approved under paragraph (q)(4) of this section may 
demonstrate to the Governor that the source cannot be constructed by 
reason of any maximum allowable increase for sulfur dioxide for a period 
of twenty-four hours or less applicable to any Class I area and, in the 
case of Federal mandatory Class I areas, that a variance under this 
clause would not adversely affect the air quality related values of the 
area (including visibility). The Governor, after consideration of the 
Federal Land Manager's recommendation (if any) and subject to his 
concurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance from 
such maximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the 
Administrator shall issue a permit to such source or modification 
pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (q)(7) of this section: 
Provided, That the applicable requirements of this section are otherwise 
met.
    (7) Variance by the Governor with the President's concurrence. In 
any case where the Governor recommends a variance in which the Federal 
Land Manager does not concur, the recommendations of the Governor and 
the Federal Land Manager shall be transmitted to the President. The 
President may approve the Governor's recommendation if he finds that the 
variance is in the national interest. If the variance is approved, the 
Administrator shall issue a permit pursuant to the requirements of 
paragraph (q)(7) of this section: Provided, That the applicable 
requirements of this section are otherwise met.
    (8) Emission limitations for Presidential or gubernatorial variance. 
In the case of a permit issued pursuant to paragraph (q) (5) or (6) of 
this section the source or modification shall comply with such emission 
limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur 
dioxide from the source or modification would not (during any day on 
which the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases are exceeded) 
cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the following 
maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentration and to 
assure that such emissions would not cause or contribute to 
concentrations which exceed the otherwise applicable maximum allowable 
increases for periods of exposure of 24 hours or less for more than 18 
days, not necessarily consecutive, during any annual period:

                       Maximum Allowable Increase
                      [Micrograms per cubic meter]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
24-hr maximum.......................................        36        62
3-hr maximum........................................       130       221
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (q) Public participation. The Administrator shall follow the 
applicable procedures of 40 CFR part 124 in processing applications 
under this section. The Administrator shall follow the procedures at 40 
CFR 52.21(r) as in effect on June 19, 1979, to the extent that the 
procedures of 40 CFR part 124 do not apply.
    (r) Source obligation. (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or 
operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application 
submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to 
construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject 
to this section who commences construction after the effective date of 
these regulations

[[Page 32]]

without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject 
to appropriate enforcement action.
    (2) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is 
not commenced within 18 months after receipt of such approval, if 
construction is discontinued for a period of 18 months or more, or if 
construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The 
Administrator may extend the 18-month period upon a satisfactory showing 
that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the 
time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased 
construction project; each phase must commence construction within 18 
months of the projected and approved commencement date.
    (3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of 
the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the 
State implementation plan and any other requirements under local, State, 
or Federal law.
    (4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a 
major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a 
relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after 
August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise 
to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then 
the requirements or paragraphs (j) through (s) of this section shall 
apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet 
commenced on the source or modification.
    (s) Environmental impact statements. Whenever any proposed source or 
modification is subject to action by a Federal Agency which might 
necessitate preparation of an environmental impact statement pursuant to 
the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321), review by the 
Administrator conducted pursuant to this section shall be coordinated 
with the broad environmental reviews under that Act and under section 
309 of the Clean Air Act to the maximum extent feasible and reasonable.
    (t) Disputed permits or redesignations. If any State affected by the 
redesignation of an area by an Indian Governing Body, or any Indian 
Governing Body of a tribe affected by the redesignation of an area by a 
State, disagrees with such redesignation, or if a permit is proposed to 
be issued for any major stationary source or major modification proposed 
for construction in any State which the Governor of an affected State or 
Indian Governing Body of an affected tribe determines will cause or 
contribute to a cumulative change in air quality in excess of that 
allowed in this part within the affected State or Indian Reservation, 
the Governor or Indian Governing Body may request the Administrator to 
enter into negotiations with the parties involved to resolve such 
dispute. If requested by any State or Indian Governing Body involved, 
the Administrator shall make a recommendation to resolve the dispute and 
protect the air quality related values of the lands involved. If the 
parties involved do not reach agreement, the Administrator shall resolve 
the dispute and his determination, or the results of agreements reached 
through other means, shall become part of the applicable State 
implementation plan and shall be enforceable as part of such plan. In 
resolving such disputes relating to area redesignation, the 
Administrator shall consider the extent to which the lands involved are 
of sufficient size to allow effective air quality management or have air 
quality related values of such an area.
    (u) Delegation of authority. (1) The Administrator shall have the 
authority to delegate his responsibility for conducting source review 
pursuant to this section, in accordance with paragraphs (v) (2) and (3) 
of this section.
    (2) Where the Administrator delegates the responsibility for 
conducting source review under this section to any agency other than a 
Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the following 
provisions shall apply:
    (i) Where the delegate agency is not an air pollution control 
agency, it shall consult with the appropriate State and local air 
pollution control agency prior to making any determination under this 
section. Similarly, where the delegate agency does not have continuing 
responsibility for managing land use, it shall consult with the 
appropriate

[[Page 33]]

State and local agency primarily responsible for managing land use prior 
to making any determination under this section.
    (ii) The delegate agency shall send a copy of any public comment 
notice required under paragraph (r) of this section to the Administrator 
through the appropriate Regional Office.
    (3) The Administrator's authority for reviewing a source or 
modification located on an Indian Reservation shall not be redelegated 
other than to a Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, 
except where the State has assumed jurisdiction over such land under 
other laws. Where the State has assumed such jurisdiction, the 
Administrator may delegate his authority to the States in accordance 
with paragraph (v)(2) of this section.
    (4) In the case of a source or modification which proposes to 
construct in a class III area, emissions from which would cause or 
contribute to air quality exceeding the maximum allowable increase 
applicable if the area were designated a class II area, and where no 
standard under section 111 of the act has been promulgated for such 
source category, the Administrator must approve the determination of 
best available control technology as set forth in the permit.
    (v) Innovative control technology. (1) An owner or operator of a 
proposed major stationary source or major modification may request the 
Administrator in writing no later than the close of the comment period 
under 40 CFR 124.10 to approve a system of innovative control 
technology.
    (2) The Administrator shall, with the consent of the governor(s) of 
the affected state(s), determine that the source or modification may 
employ a system of innovative control technology, if: --
    (i) The proposed control system would not cause or contribute to an 
unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation 
or function;
    (ii) The owner or operator agrees to achieve a level of continuous 
emissions reduction equivalent to that which would have been required 
under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, by a date specified by the 
Administrator. Such date shall not be later than 4 years from the time 
of startup or 7 years from permit issuance;
    (iii) The source or modification would meet the requirements of 
paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section, based on the emissions rate that 
the stationary source employing the system of innovative control 
technology would be required to meet on the date specified by the 
Administrator;
    (iv) The source or modification would not before the date specified 
by the Administrator:
    (a) Cause or contribute to a violation of an applicable national 
ambient air quality standard; or
    (b) Impact any area where an applicable increment is known to be 
violated; and
    (v) All other applicable requirements including those for public 
participation have been met.
    (vi) The provisions of paragraph (p) of this section (relating to 
Class I areas) have been satisfied with respect to all periods during 
the life of the source or modification.
    (3) The Administrator shall withdraw any approval to employ a system 
of innovative control technology made under this section, if:
    (i) The proposed system fails by the specified date to achieve the 
required continuous emissions reduction rate; or
    (ii) The proposed system fails before the specified date so as to 
contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety; 
or
    (iii) The Administrator decides at any time that the proposed system 
is unlikely to achieve the required level of control or to protect the 
public health, welfare, or safety.
    (4) If a source or modification fails to meet the required level of 
continuous emission reduction within the specified time period or the 
approval is withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (v)(3) of this 
section, the Administrator may allow the source or modification up to an 
additional 3 years to meet the requirement for the application of best 
available control technology through use of a demonstrated system of 
control.
    (w) Permit rescission. (1) Any permit issued under this section or a 
prior

[[Page 34]]

version of this section shall remain in effect, unless and until it 
expires under paragraph (s) of this section or is rescinded.
    (2) Any owner or operator of a stationary source or modification who 
holds a permit for the source or modification which was issued under 40 
CFR 52.21 as in effect on July 30, 1987, or any earlier version of this 
section, may request that the Administrator rescind the permit or a 
particular portion of the permit.
    (3) The Administrator shall grant an application for rescission if 
the application shows that this section would not apply to the source or 
modification.
    (4) If the Administrator rescinds a permit under this paragraph, the 
public shall be given adequate notice of the rescission. Publication of 
an announcement of rescission in a newspaper of general circulation in 
the affected region within 60 days of the rescission shall be considered 
adequate notice.

Sec. 52.23  Violation and enforcement.

    Failure to comply with any provisions of this part, or with any 
approved regulatory provision of a State implementation plan, or with 
any permit condition or permit denial issued pursuant to approved or 
promulgated regulations for the review of new or modified stationary or 
indirect sources, or with any permit limitation or condition contained 
within an operating permit issued under an EPA-approved program that is 
incorporated into the State implementation plan, shall render the person 
or governmental entity so failing to comply in violation of a 
requirement of an applicable implementation plan and subject to 
enforcement action under section 113 of the Clean Air Act. With regard 
to compliance schedules, a person or Governmental entity will be 
considered to have failed to comply with the requirements of this part 
if it fails to timely submit any required compliance schedule, if the 
compliance schedule when submitted does not contain each of the elements 
it is required to contain, or if the person or Governmental entity fails 
to comply with such schedule.

Sec. 52.24  Statutory restriction on new sources.

    (a) After June 30, 1979, no major stationary source shall be 
constructed or modified in any nonattainment area as designated in 40 
CFR part 81, subpart C (``nonattainment area'') to which any State 
implementation plan applies, if the emissions from suy will cause or 
contribute to concentrations of any pollutant for which a national 
ambient air quality standard is exceeded in such area, unless, as of the 
time of application for a permit for such construction, such plan meets 
the requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.) (``Part D''). This section shall not apply to 
any nonattainment area once EPA has fully approved the State 
implementation plan for the area as meeting the requirements of Part D.
    (b) For any nonattainment area for which the SIP satisfies the 
requirements of Part D, permits to construct and operate new or modified 
major stationary sources may be issued only if the applicable SIP is 
being carried out for the nonattainment area in which the proposed 
source is to be constructed or modified in accordance with the 
requirements of Part D.
    (c) The Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling, 40 CFR part 51, 
Appendix S (``Offset Ruling''), rather than paragraphs (a) and (b), 
governs permits to construct and operate applied for before the deadline 
for having a revised SIP in effect that satisfies Part D. This deadline 
is July 1, 1979, for areas designated as nonattainment on March 3, 1978 
(42 FR 8962). The revised SIP, rather than paragraph (a) of this 
section, governs permits applied for during a period when the revised 
SIP is in compliance with Part D.
    (d) The restrictions in paragraphs (a) and (b) apply only to major 
stationary sources of emissions that cause or contribute to 
concentrations of the pollutant for which the nonattainment area was 
designated as nonattainment, and

[[Page 35]]

for which the SIP does not meet the requirements of Part D or is not 
being carried out in accordance with the requirements of Part D.
    (e) For any area designated as nonattainment for any national 
ambient air quality standard, the restrictions in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section, shall apply to any major stationary source or major 
modification that would be major for the pollutant for which the area is 
designated nonattainment, if the stationary source or major modification 
would be constructed anywhere in the designated nonattainment areas. A 
major stationary source or major modification that is major for volatile 
organic compounds is also major for ozone.
    (f) The following definitions shall apply under this section.
    (1) Stationary source means any building, structure, facility, or 
installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant subject to 
regulation under the Act.
    (2) Building, structure, facility or installation means all of the 
pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial 
grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, 
and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common 
control) except the activities of any vessel. Pollutant-emitting 
activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping 
if they belong to the same ``Major Group'' (i.e., which have the same 
two-digit code) as described in the following document, Standard 
Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, as amended by the 1977 
Supplement (U.S. Government Printing Office stock numbers 4101-0066 and 
003-005-00176-0, respectively).
    (3) Potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary 
source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. 
Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the source to 
emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and 
restrictions on hours of operation or on amount of material combusted, 
stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design only if the 
limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally 
enforceable. Secondary emissions do not count in determining the 
potential to emit of a stationary source.
    (4)(i) Major stationary source means:
    (a) Any stationary source of air pollutants which emits, or has the 
potential to emit, 100 tons per year or more of any pollutant subject to 
regulation under the Act; or
    (b) Any physical change that would occur at a stationary source not 
qualifying under paragraph (f)(5)(i)(a) of this section, as a major 
stationary source, if the change would constitute a major stationary 
source by itself.
    (ii) A major stationary source that is major for volatile organic 
compounds shall be considered major for ozone.
    (iii) The fugitive emissions of a stationary source shall not be 
included in determining for any of the purposes of this section whether 
it is a major stationary source, unless the source belongs to one of the 
following categories of stationary sources:
    (a) Coal cleaning plants (with thermal dryers);
    (b) Kraft pulp mills;
    (c) Portland cement plants;
    (d) Primary zinc smelters;

    (s) Secondary metal production plants;
    (t) Chemical process plants;
    (u) Fossil-fuel boilers (or combination thereof) totaling more than 
250 million British thermal units per hour heat input;
    (v) Petroleum storage and transfer units with a total storage 
capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels;
    (w) Taconite ore processing plants;

[[Page 36]]

    (x) Glass fiber processing plants;
    (y) Charcoal production plants;
    (z) Fossil fuel-fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million 
British thermal units per hour heat input;
    (aa) Any other stationary source category which, as of August 7, 
1980, is being regulated under section 111 or 112 of the Act.
    (5)(i) Major modification means any physical change in or change in 
the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result 
in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant subject to 
regulation under the Act.
    (ii) Any net emissions increase that is considered significant for 
volatile organic compounds shall be considered significant for ozone.
    (iii) A physical change or change in the method of operation shall 
not include:
    (a) Routine maintenance, repair, and replacement;
    (b) Use of an alternative fuel or raw material by reason of an order 
under sections 2 (a) and (b) of the Energy Supply and Environmental 
Coordination Act of 1974 (or any superseding legislation) or by reason 
of a natural gas curtailment plan pursuant to the Federal Power Act;
    (c) Use of an alternative fuel by reason of an order or rule under 
section 125 of the Act;
    (d) Use of an alternative fuel at a steam generating unit to the 
extent that the fuel is generated from municipal solid waste;
    (e) Use of an alternative fuel or raw material by a stationary 
source which:
    (1) The source was capable of accommodating before July 1, 1979, 
unless such change would be prohibited under any federally enforceable 
permit condition which was established after July 1, 1979 pursuant to 40 
CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR subpart I or 
40 CFR 51.166; or
    (2) The source is approved to use under any permit issued under 
regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR subpart I;
    (f) An increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate, 
unless such change is prohibited under any federally enforceable permit 
condition which was established after July 1, 1979 pursuant to 40 CFR 
52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR subpart I or 40 
CFR 51.166.
    (g) Any change in ownership at a stationary source.
    (h) The addition, replacement or use of a pollution control project 
at an existing electric utility steam generating unit, unless the 
Administrator determines that such addition, replacement, or use renders 
the unit less environmentally beneficial, or except:
    (1) When the Administrator has reason to believe that the pollution 
control project would reslt in a significant net increase in 
representative actual annual emissions of any criteria pollutant over 
levels used for that source in the most recent air quality impact 
analysis in the area conducted for the purpose of title I, if any, and
    (2) The Administrator determines that the increase will cause or 
contribute to a violation of any national ambient air quality standard 
or PSD increment, or visibility limitation.
    (i) The installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a 
temporary clean coal technology demonstration project, provided that the 
project complies with:
    (1) The State implementation plan for the State in which the project 
is located, and
    (2) Other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the national 
ambient air quality standards during the project and after it is 
terminated.
    (6)(i) Net emissions increase means the amount by which the sum of 
the following exceeds zero:
    (a) Any increase in actual emissions from a particular physical 
change or change in the method of operation at a stationary source; and
    (b) Any other increases and decreases in actual emissions at the 
source that are contemporaneous with the particular change and are 
otherwise creditable.
    (ii) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is contemporaneous 
with the increase from the particular change only if it occurs between:
    (a) The date five years before construction on the particular change 
commences and
    (b) The date that the increase from the particular change occurs.

[[Page 37]]

    (iii) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is creditable only 
if the Administrator has not relied on it in issuing a permit for the 
source under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR subpart I which 
permit is in effect when the increase in actual emissions from the 
particular change occurs.
    (iv) An increase in actual emissions is creditabletime. only to the 
extent that the new level of actual emissions exceeds the old level.
    (v) A decrease in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent 
that:
    (a) The old level of actual emissions or the old level of allowable 
emissions, whichever is lower, exceeds the new level of actual 
emissions;
    (b) It is federally enforceable at and after the time that 
construction on the particular change begins; and
    (c) The Administrator or reviewing authority has not relied on it in 
issuing any permit under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR subpart 
I or the State has not relied on it in demonstrating attainment or 
reasonable further progress.
    (d) It has approximately the same qualitative significance for 
public health and welfare as that attributed to the increase from the 
particular change.
    (vi) An increase that results from a physical change at a source 
occurs when the emissions unit on which construction occurred becomes 
operational and begins to emit a particular pollutant. Any replacement 
unit that requires shakedown becomes operational only after a reasonable 
shakedown period, not to exceed 180 days.
    (7) Emissions unit means any part of a stationary source which emits 
or would have the potential to emit any pollutant subject to regulation 
under the Act.
    (8) Secondary emissions means emissions which would occur as a 
result of the construction or operation of a major stationary source or 
major modification, but do not come from the major stationary source or 
major modification itself. For the purpose of this section, secondary 
emissions must be specific, well defined, quantifiable, and impact the 
same general area as the stationary source or modification which causes 
the secondary emissions. Secondary emissions include emissions from any 
offsite support facility which would otherwise not be constructed or 
increase its emissions except as a result of the construction or 
operation of the major stationary source or major modification. 
Secondary emissions do not include any emissions which come directly 
from a mobile source, such as emissions from the tailpipe of a motor 
vehicle, from a train, or from a vessel.
    (9) Fugitive emissions means those emissions which could not 
reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally 
equivalent opening.
    (10) Significant means, in reference to a net emissions increase or 
the potential of a source to emit any of the following pollutants, a 
rate of emissions that would equal or exceed any of the following rates:

                      Pollutant and Emissions Rate

Carbon monoxide: 100 tons per year (tpy)
Nitrogen oxides: 40 tpy
Sulfur dioxide: 40 tpy
Ozone: 40 tpy of volatile organic compounds
Lead: 0.6 tpy

    (11) Allowable emissions means the emissions rate of a stationary 
source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless 
the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the 
operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent 
of the following:
    (i) The applicable standards set forth in 40 CFR parts 60 and 61;
    (ii) Any applicable State Implementation Plan emissions limitation, 
including those with a future compliance date; or
    (iii) The emissions rate specified as a federally enforceable permit 
condition, including those with a future compliance date.
    (12) Federally enforceable means all limitations and conditions 
which are enforceable by the Administrator, including those requirements 
developed pursuant to 40 CFR parts 60 and 61, requirements within any 
applicable State implementation plan, any permit requirements 
established pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved 
pursuant to 40 CFR part 51, subpart I, including operating permits 
issued under an EPA-approved program

[[Page 38]]

that is incorporated into the State implementation plan and expressly 
requires adherence to any permit issued under such program.
    (13)(i) Actual emissions means the actual rate of emissions of a 
pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with 
paragraphs (f) (ii) through (iv) of this section.
    (ii) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall 
equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually 
emitted the pollutant during a two-year period which precedes the 
particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. 
The Administrator shall allow the use of a different time period upon a 
determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. 
Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating 
hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or 
combusted during the selected time period.
    (iii) The Administrator may presume that source-specific allowable 
emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the 
unit.
    (iv) For any emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam 
generating unit specified in paragraph (f)(13)(v) of this section) which 
has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions 
shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date.
    (v) For an electric utility steam generating unit (other than a new 
unit or the replacement of an existing unit) actual emissions of the 
unit following the physical or operational change shall equal the 
representative actual annual emissions of the unit, provided the source 
owner or operator maintains and submits to the Administrator, on an 
annual basis for a period of 5 years from the date the unit resumes 
regular operation, information demonstrating that the physical or 
operational change did not result in an emissions increase. A longer 
period, not to exceed 10 years, may be required by the Administrator if 
he determines such a period to be more representative of normal source 
post-change operations.
    (14) Construction means any physical change or change in the method 
of operation (including fabrication, erection, installation, demolition, 
or modification) of an emissions unit which would result in a change in 
actual emissions.
    (15) Commence as applied to construction of a major stationary 
source or major modification means that the owner or operator has all 
necessary preconstruction approvals or permits and either has:
    (i) Begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of actual on-
site construction of the source, to be completed within a reasonable 
time; or
    (ii) Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, 
which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the 
owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual construction of the 
source to be completed within a reasonable time.
    (16) Necessary preconstruction approvals or permits means those 
permits or approvals required under federal air quality control laws and 
regulations and those air quality control laws and regulations which are 
part of the applicable State Implementation Plan.
    (17) Begin actual construction means, in general, initiation of 
physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are 
of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, 
installation of building supports and foundations, laying of underground 
pipework, and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect 
to a change in method of operations, this term refers to those on-site 
activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation 
of change.
    (18) Volatile organic compounds (VOC) is as defined in 
Sec. 51.100(s) of this chapter.
    (19) Electric utility steam generating unit means any steam electric 
generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more 
than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 
25 MW electrical output to any utility power distribution system for 
sale. Any steam supplied to a steam distribution system for the purpose 
of providing steam to a steam-electric generator that would produce 
electrical energy for sale is also considered in determining

[[Page 39]]

the electrical energy output capacity of the affected facility.
    (20) Representative actual annual emissions means the average rate, 
in tons per year, at which the source is projected to emit a pollutant 
for the two-year period after a physical change or change in the method 
of operation of a unit, (or a different consecutive two-year period 
within 10 years after that change, where the Administrator determines 
that such period is more representative of normal source operations), 
considering the effect any such change will have on increasing or 
decreasing the hourly emissions rate and on projected capacity 
utilization. In projecting future emissions the Administrator shall:
    (i) Consider-all relevant information, including but not limited to, 
historical operational data, the company's own representations, filings 
with the State or Federal regulatory authorities, and compliance plans 
under title IV of the Clean Air Act; and
    (ii) Exclude, in calculating any increase in emissions that results 
from the particular physical change or change in the method of operation 
at an electric utility steam generating unit, that portion of the unit's 
emissions following the change that could have been accommodated during 
the representative baseline period and is attributable to an increase in 
projected capacity utilization at the unit that is unrelated to the 
particular change, including any increased utilization due to the rate 
of electricity demand growth for the utility system as a whole.
    (21) Temporary clean coal technology demonstration project means a 
clean coal technology demonstration project that is operated for a 
period of 5 years or less, and which complies with the State 
implementation plans for the State in which the project is located and 
other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient 
air quality standards during the project and after it is terminated.
    (22) Clean coal technology means any technology, including 
technologies applied at the precombustion, combustion, or post 
combustion stage, at a new or existing facility which will achieve 
significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of 
nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of 
electricity, or process steam which was not in widespread use as of 
November 15, 1990.
    (23) Clean coal technology demonstration project means a project 
using funds appropriated under the heading `Department of Energy-Clean 
Coal Technology', up to a total amount of $2,500,000,000 for commercial 
demonstration of clean coal technology, or similar projects funded 
through appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency. The 
Federal contribution for a qualifying project shall be at least 20 
percent of the total cost of the demonstration project.
    (24) Pollution control project means any activity or project 
undertaken at an existing electric utility steam generating unit for 
purposes of reducing emissions from such unit. Such activities or 
projects are limited to:
    (i) The installation of conventional or innovative pollution control 
technology, including but not limited to advanced flue gas 
desulfurization, sorbent injection for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
oxides controls and electrostatic precipitators;
    (ii) An activity or project to accommodate switching to a fuel which 
is less polluting than the fuel in use prior to the activity or project 
including, but not limited to natural gas or coal re-burning, co-firing 
of natural gas and other fuels for the purpose of controlling emissions;
    (iii) A permanent clean coal technology demonstration project 
conducted under title II, section 101(d) of the Further Continuing 
Appropriations Act of 1985 (section 5903(d) of title 42 of the United 
States Code), or subsequent appropriations, up to a total amount of 
$2,500,000,000 for commercial demonstration of clean coal technology, or 
similar projects funded through appropriations for the Environmental 
Protection Agency; or
    (iv) A permanent clean coal technology demonstration project that 
constitutes a repowering project.
    (g) This section shall not apply to a major stationary source or 
major modification if the source or modification was not subject to 40 
CFR part 51

[[Page 40]]

Appendix S, as in effect on January 16, 1979, and the owner or operator:

    (h) This section shall not apply to a source or modification that 
would be a major stationary source or major modification only if 
fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, are considered in 
calculating the potential to emit of the stationary source or 
modification and the source does not belong to any of the following 
categories:
    (1) Coal cleaning plants (with thermal dryers);
    (2) Kraft pulp mills;

    (i) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a 
major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a 
relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after 
August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise 
to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then:
    (1) If the construction moratorium imposed pursuant to this section 
is still in effect for the nonattainment area in which the source or 
modification is located, then the permit may not be so revised; or
    (2) If the construction moratorium is no longer in effect in that

<R05>
Sec. 52.26  Visibility monitoring strategy.

    (a) Plan Disapprovals. The provisions of this section are applicable 
to any State implementation plan which has been disapproved with respect 
to visibility monitoring. Specific disapprovals are listed where 
applicable in Subparts B through DD of this part. The provisions of this 
section have been incorporated by reference into the applicable 
implementation plan for various States, as provided in Subparts B 
through DDD of this part.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Visibility protection area means any area listed in 40 CFR 
81.401-81.436 (1984).
    (2) All other terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the 
Clean Air Act, or in the protection of visibility program (40 CFR 
51.301), all as in effect on July 12, 1985.
    (c) Monitoring Requirements. (1) The Administrator, in cooperation 
with the appropriate Federal land manager, shall monitor visibility 
within each visibility protection area in any State whose State 
implementation plan is subject to a disapproval for failure to satisfy 
40 CFR 51.305 (1984).
    (2) The Administrator, in monitoring visibility within each such 
area, shall determine both background visibility conditions and 
reasonably attributable visibility impairment caused by a source or 
small group of sources for that area. The extent and the form of 
monitoring shall be sufficient for use in determining the potential 
effects of a new stationary source on visibility in the area, the 
stationary source or sources that are causing any visibility impairment, 
and progress toward remedying that impairment.
    (3) The Administrator shall use the following as appropriate to 
monitor visibility within each such area: (i) photographic cameras, (ii) 
fine particulate matter samplers, (iii) teleradiometers, (iv)

    (a) Plan disapproval. The provisions of this section are applicable 
to any State implementation plan which has been disapproved with respect 
to protection of visibility, in mandatory Class I Federal areas, from 
sources emitting pollutants in any portion of any State where the 
existing air quality is better than the national ambient air quality 
standards for such pollutants, and where a State PSD program has been

[[Page 42]]

approved as part of the applicable SIP pursuant to 40 CFR 51.24. 
Specific disapprovals are listed where applicable in Subparts B through 
DDD of this part. The provisions of this section have been incorporated 
by reference into the applicable implementation plans for various 
States, as provided in Subparts B through DDD of this part.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, all terms shall have 
the meaning ascribed to them in the Clean Air Act, in the prevention of 
significant deterioration (PSD) program approved as part of the 
applicable SIP pursuant to 40 CFR 51.24 for the State, or in the 
protection of visibility program (40 CFR 51.301), all as in effect on 
July 12, 1985.
    (c) Federal visibility analysis. Any person shall have the right, in 
connection with any application for a permit to construct a major 
stationary source or major modification, to request that the 
administrator take responsibility from the State for conducting the 
required review of a proposed source's impact on visibility in any 
Fedral Class I area. If requested, the Administrator shall take such 
responsibility and conduct such review pursuant to paragraphs (e), (f) 
and (g) of this section in any case where the State fails to provide all 
of the procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this section. A 
request pursuant to this paragraph must be made within 60 days of the 
notice soliciting public comment on a permit, unless such notice is not 
properly given. The Administrator will not entertain requests 
challenging the substance of any State action concerning visibility 
where the State has provided all of the procedural steps listed in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Procedural steps in visibility review. (1) The reviewing 
authority must provide written notification to all affected Federal land 
managers of any permit application for any proposed new major stationary 
source or major modification that may affect visibility in any Federal 
Class I area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information 
relevant to the permit application and shall be given within 30 days of 
receipt and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on the 
application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall include 
the proposed source's anticipated impacts on visibility in any Federal 
Class I area as provided by the applicant. Notification must also be 
given to all affected Federal land managers within 30 days of receipt of 
any advance notification of any such permit application.
    (2) The reviewing authority must consider any analysis performed by 
the Federal land managers, provided within 30 days of the notification 
required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, that shows that such 
proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have:
    (i) An adverse impact on visibility in any Federal Class I area, or
    (ii) An adverse impact on visibility in an integral vista codified 
in part 81 of this title.
    (3) Where the reviewing authority finds that such an analysis does 
not demonstrate that the effect in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this 
section will occur, either an explanation of its decision or 
notification as to where the explanation can be obtained must be 
included in the notice of public hearing.
    (4) Where the reviewing authority finds that such an analysis does 
demonstrate that the effect in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section will 
occur, the permit shall not be issued.
    (5) Where the reviewing authority finds that such an analysis does 
demonstrate that the effect in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section will 
occur, the reviewing authority may issue a permit if the emissions from 
the source or modification will be consistent with reasonable progress 
toward the national goal. In making this decision, the reviewing 
authority may take into account the costs of compliance, the time 
necessary for compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental 
impacts of compliance, and the useful life of the source.
    (e) Federal land manager notification. The Administrator shall 
provide all of the procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this 
section in conducting reviews pursuant to this section.
    (f) Monitoring. The Administrator may require monitoring of 
visibility in any Federal Class I area near the proposed new stationary 
source or major

[[Page 43]]

modification for such purposes and by such means as the Administrator 
deems necessary and appropriate.
    (g) Public participation. The Administrator shall follow the 
applicable procedures at 40 CFR part 124 in conducting reviews under 
this section. The Administrator shall follow the procedures at 40 CFR 
52.21(q) as in effect on August 7, 1980, to the extent that the 
procedures of 40 CFR part 124 do not apply.
    (h) Federal permit. In any case where the Administrator has made a 
finding that a State consistently fails or is unable to provide the 
procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
Administrator shall require all prospective permit applicants in such 
State to apply directly to the Administrator, and the Administrator 
shall conduct a visibility review pursuant to this section for all

    (iii) The source is a portable stationary source which has 
previously received a permit under this section, and
    (A) The owner or operator proposes to relocate the source and 
emissions of the source at the new location would be temporary; and
    (B) The emissions from the source would not exceed its allowable 
emissions; and
    (C) The emissions from the source would impact no Class I area and 
no area where an applicable increment is known to be violated; and
    (D) Reasonable notice is given to the Administrator, prior to the

proposed source or modification will have an adverse impact on such 
values.
    (2) The Administrator shall provide written notification to all 
affected Federal land managers of any permit application for any 
proposed new major stationary source or major modification that may 
affect visibility in any visibility protection area.The Administrator 
shall also provide for such notification to the Federal official charged 
with direct responsibility for management of any lands within any such 
area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information relevant 
to the permit application and shall be given within 30 days of receipt 
and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on the application for 
a permit to construct.

[[Page 45]]

Such notification shall include an analysis of the proposed source's 
anticipated impacts on visibility in any visibility protection area. The 
Administrator shall also notify all affected FLM's within 30 days of 
receipt of any advance notification of any such permit application.
    (3) The Administrator shall consider any analysis performed by the 
Federal land manager, provided within 30 days of the notification 
required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section, that such proposed new 
major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact 
on visibility in any visibility protection area. Where the Administrator 
finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Administrator that an adverse impact on visibility will result in 
the visibility protection area, the Administrator must, in the notice of 
public hearing, either explain his decision or give notice as to where 
the explanation can be obtained.
    (f) Public participation. The Administrator shall follow the 
applicable procedures of 40 CFR part 124 in processing applications

permits to those sources whose emissions will be consistent with making 
reasonable progress toward the national goal of preventing any future, 
and remedying any existing, impairment of visibility in visibility 
protection areas which impairment results from man-made air pollution. 
In making the decision to issue a permit, the Administrator may take 
into account the costs of compliance, the time necessary for compliance, 
the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, and 
the useful life of the source.
    (h) Monitoring. The Administrator may require monitoring of 
visibility in any visibility protection area near the proposed new 
stationary source or major modification for such purposes and by such 
means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate.
    (i) Delegation of authority. (1) The Administrator shall have the 
authority to delegate the responsibility for conducting source review 
pursuant to this section to any agency in accordance with paragraphs 
(i)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (2) Where the Administrator delegates the responsibility for 
conducting source review under this section to any agency other than a 
Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the following 
provisions shall apply:
    (i) Where the delegate agency is not an air pollution control agency 
it shall consult with the appropriate State and local air pollution 
control agency prior to making any determination under this section. 
Similarly, where the delegate agency does not have continuing 
responsibility for managing land use, it shall consult with the 
appropriate State and local agency primarily responsible for managing 
land use prior to making any determination under this section.
    (ii) The delegate agency shall submit a copy of any public comment 
notice required under paragraph (f) of this section to the Administrator 
through the appropriate Regional Office.
    (3) The Administrator's authority for reviewing a source or

under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and 
until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove 
the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator issues such a 
proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the 
later of the date the Administrator issues such a proposed or final 
disapproval, or 18 months following the finding that started the 
sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless 
the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of 
the finding has been corrected.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 
18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed 
to fully or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an 
interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the 
deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be

[[Page 49]]

stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator 
proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole or in 
part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval 
of the plan, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator issues 
such a proposed or final disapproval. The highway sanction under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the 
later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the 
Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the 
finding has been corrected, or immediately if the proposed or final 
disapproval occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and more 
than 24 months after the finding the Administrator has proposed to fully 
or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim 
final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency 
prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and application of the highway sanction 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until 
the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the 
plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or 
final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator issues 
such proposed or final disapproval.
    (3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and the 
Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has conditionally-
approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination 
that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, 
application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section shall be deferred unless and until the conditional approval 
converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes 
final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State 
submits to fulfill the commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If 
the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator 
issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the 
later of the date the approval becomes a disapproval or the 
Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is 
applicable, or 18 months following the finding that started the 
sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless 
the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of 
the finding has been corrected.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 
18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has 
conditionally approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final 
determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting 
the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and 
until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the 
Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole 
or in part the revised SIP the

[[Page 50]]

State submits to fulfill the commitment in the conditionally-approved 
plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the 
Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset 
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the 
affected area on the date the approval becomes a disapproval or the 
Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is 
applicable. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date 
the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied 
in the affected area, unless the Administrator determines that the 
deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or 
immediately if the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the 
Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is 
applicable, more than 6 months after initial application of the offset 
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 
24 months from the finding the Administrator has conditionally approved 
the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the 
revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application 
of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and 
application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall be stayed unless and until the conditional approval 
converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes 
final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State 
submits to fulfill its commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If 
the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator 
issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on 
the date the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the 
Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is 
applicable.
    (4)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section, if the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the 
finding, has proposed to find that the State is implementing the 
approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the 
deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred 
unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, 
through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing 
the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the 
deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines 
that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area 
on the later of the date the Administrator proposes to take action or 
takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not 
been corrected, or 18 months following the finding that started the 
sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applies, 
unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the 
deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section, if after 18 months but before 24 months from the 
finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is 
implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final 
determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been 
corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and 
until the Administrator preliminarily or finally

[[Page 51]]

determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not 
implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not 
corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or 
finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in 
the affected area on the date the Administrator proposes to take action 
or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has 
not been corrected. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from 
the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator 
preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the 
basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if EPA's 
proposed or final action finding the deficiency has not been corrected 
occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset 
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section, if after 24 months from the finding the Administrator 
has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan 
and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency 
prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset 
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until 
the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a 
proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the 
approved plan, and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the 
deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines 
that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on 
the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action 
to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected.
    (5) Any sanction clock started by a finding under paragraph (c) of 
this section will be permanently stopped and sanctions applied, stayed 
or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the 
deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For a 
sanctions clock and applied sanctions based on a finding under 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, a finding that the 
deficiency has been corrected will occur by letter from the 
Administrator to the State governor. For a sanctions clock or applied, 
stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(2) 
and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been 
corrected will occur through a final notice in the Federal Register 
fully approving the revised SIP. For a sanctions clock or applied, 
stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will 
occur through a final notice in the Federal Register finding that the 
State is implementing the approved SIP.
    (6) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, nothing in 
this section will prohibit the Administrator from determining through 
notice-and-comment rulemaking that in specific circumstances the highway 
sanction, rather than the offset sanction, shall apply 18 months after 
the Administrator makes one of the findings under paragraph (c) of this 
section, and that the offset sanction, rather than the highway sanction, 
shall apply 6 months from the date the highway sanction applies.
    (e) Available sanctions and method for implementation--(1) Offset 
sanction. (i) As further set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)-(e)(1)(vi) 
of this section, the State shall apply the emissions offset requirement 
in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those 
affected areas subject under paragraph (d) of this section to the offset 
sanction. The State shall apply the emission offset requirements in 
accordance with 42 U.S.C. 7503 and 7509(b)(2), at a ratio of at least 
two units of emission reductions for each

[[Page 52]]

unit of increased emissions of the pollutant(s) and its (their) 
precursors for which the finding(s) under paragraph (c) of this section 
is (are) made. If the deficiency prompting the finding under paragraph 
(c) of this section is not specific to one or more particular pollutants 
and their precursors, the 2-to-1 ratio shall apply to all pollutants 
(and their precursors) for which an affected area within the State 
listed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is required to meet the 
offset requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7503.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a 
finding is made with respect to a requirement for the criteria pollutant 
ozone or when the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not 
apply the emissions offset requirements at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 
for emission reductions to increased emissions for nitrogen oxides 
where, under 42 U.S.C. 7511a(f), the Administrator has approved an 
NO<INF>X</INF> exemption for the affected area from the Act's new source 
review requirements under 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515 for NO<INF>X</INF> or 
where the affected area is not otherwise subject to the Act's new source 
review requirements for emission offsets under 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515 for 
NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a 
finding under paragraph (c) of this section is made with respect to PM-
10, or the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply 
the emissions offset requirements, at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for 
emission reductions to increased emissions to PM-10 precursors if the 
Administrator has determined under 42 U.S.C. 7513a(e) that major 
stationary sources of PM-10 precursors do not contribute significantly 
to PM-10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the affected area.
    (iv) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set 
forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, at the 2-to-1 ratio required under this 
section, the State shall comply with the provisions of a State-adopted 
new source review (NSR) program that EPA has approved under 42 U.S.C. 
7410(k)(3) as meeting the nonattainment area NSR requirements of 42 
U.S.C. 7501-7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or, if no plan has 
been so approved, the State shall comply directly with the nonattainment 
area NSR requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515, as amended by 
the 1990 Amendments, or cease issuing permits to construct and operate 
major new or modified sources as defined in those requirements. For 
purposes of applying the offset requirement under 42 U.S.C. 7503 where 
EPA has not fully approved a State's NSR program as meeting the 
requirements of part D, the specifications of those provisions shall 
supersede any State requirement that is less stringent or inconsistent.
    (v) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set 
forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, any permit required pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7503 
and issued on or after the date the offset sanction applies under 
paragraph (d) of this section shall be subject to the enhanced 2-to-1 
ratio under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) Highway funding sanction. The highway sanction shall apply, as 
provided in 42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(1), in the timeframe prescribed under 
paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject under 
paragraph (d) of this section to the highway sanction, but shall apply 
only to those portions of affected areas that are designated 
nonattainment under 40 CFR part 81.

Sec. 52.53  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Alabama's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements of Part D, 
Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977. In addition, continued 
satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the 
SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 
1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and 
January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of 
additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the 
previous January.

[45 FR 37431, June 3, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 52.56  Review of new sources and modifications.

    Part D conditional approval. The plan's provisions for review of new 
sources and modifications in nonattainment areas are approved on 
condition that the State submit any necessary corrections by March 9, 
1984 and, during the interim, implement these regulations in a manner 
consistent with EPA requirements.

[48 FR 9860, Mar. 9, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 52.57  Control strategy: Sulfur oxides.

    (a) The requirements of Subpart G of this chapter are not met since 
the Alabama plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards for sulfur oxides in the vicinity of the Widows Creek 
Power Plant in Jackson County, Alabama. Therefore, Part 5.1, Fuel 
Combustion, of Chapter 5, Control of Sulfur Compound Emissions, of the 
rules and regulations of the State of Alabama, as adopted by the Alabama 
Air Pollution Control Commission on May 29, 1973, and amended on March 
25, 1975, which is part of the revised sulfur oxide control strategy, is 
disapproved as it applies to the Widows Creek Plant. Part 5.1 of the 
Alabama rules and regulations as adopted on January 18, 1972, remains 
the implementation plan regulation applicable to that source.
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 52.58  Control strategy: Lead.

    The lead plan submitted by the State on March 24, 1982, is 
disapproved because it fails to provide for the attainment of the lead 
standard throughout Alabama. The lead plan submitted by the State on 
October 7, 1985, and November 13, 1986, for Jefferson County is 
conditionally approved on the condition that the State by October 1, 
1987, determine what additional control measures may be necessary, if 
any, to assure attainment and maintenance as expeditiously as 
practicable but no later than the applicable attainment deadline and 
submit those measures to EPA for approval, together with an appropriate 
demonstration of attainment. The provisions in the regulation submitted 
on October 7, 1985, that give the Jefferson County Health Officer

[[Page 64]]

discretion to vary the requirements of the regulation are approved as 
limits on that discretion, but any variances that may result from those 
provisions are not approved in advance and hence change the applicable 
implementation plan only when approved by EPA on a case-by-case basis.

Sec. 52.72  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Alaska's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards. The State included in the plan a regulation 
prohibiting idling of unattended motor vehicles. However, the plan 
stated that this regulation was included for informational purposes 
only, and was not to be considered part of the control strategy to 
implement the national standards for carbon monoxide. Accordingly, this 
regulation is not considered a partof the applicable plan.

Sec. 52.124  Part D disapproval.

    (a) The following portions of the Arizona SIP are disapproved 
because they do not meet the requirements of Part D of the Clean Air 
Act.
    (1) The attainment demonstration, conformity and contingency 
portions of the 1987 Maricopa Association of Governments Carbon Monoxide 
Plan and 1988 Addendum.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (b) Maricopa County PM-10 Nonattainment Area (Phoenix Planning

<R05>
Sec. 52.125  Control strategy and regulations: Sulfur oxides.

    (a)(1) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met 
since the control strategy does not analyze the impact of smelter 
fugitive emissions on ambient air quality (except at Hayden, Arizona) in 
the Central Arizona Intrastate, the Pima Intrastate, and the Southeast 
Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions. Arizona must 
submit these smelter fugitive emissions control strategies to EPA by 
August 1, 1984. In addition, the requirements of Sec. 51.281 of this 
chapter are not met since the plan does not require permanent control of 
fugitive smelter emissions necessary to attain and maintain the national 
standards for sulfur oxides. The control strategy for Hayden shows that 
these controls are required to attain and maintain the national 
standards, and the fugitive control strategy analyses required above may 
show that they are required for some or all of the other smelter towns 
in Arizona. Arizona must submit all fugitive emissions control 
regulations necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for 
sulfur oxides to EPA by August 1, 1984. Therefore, the control 
strategies and regulations for the six smelter areas in the Central 
Arizona Intrastate, the Pima Intrastate and the Southeast Arizona 
Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions are incomplete due to 
Arizona's failure to address the fugitive emissions problems at copper 
smelters.
    (2) Regulation 7-1-4.1 (copper smelters) of the Arizona Rules and 
Regulations for Air Pollution Control, as it pertains to existing copper 
smelters, is disapproved for the Central Arizona Intrastate, Pima 
Intrastate and Southeast Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee 
counties) Regions.
    (b) The requirements of subpart G and Sec. 51.281 of this chapter 
are not met since the plan does not provide the degree of control 
necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for sulfur 
oxides in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region. Th erefore, Regulation 
7-1-4.2(C) (fuel burning installations) of the Arizona Rules and 
Regulations for Air Pollution Control, as it pertains to existing 
sources, is disapproved in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region for 
steam power generating instal lations having a total rated capacity 
equal to or greater than 6,500 million B.t.u. per hour.
    (c) Replacement regulation for Regulation 7-1-4.2(C) (Fossil fuel-
fired steam generators in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region). (1) 
This paragraph is applicable to the fossil fuel-fired steam generating 
equipment designated as Units 1, 2, and 3 at the Navajo Power Plant in 
the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region (Sec. 81.270 of this chapter).
    (2) No owner or operator of the fossil fuel-fired steam generating 
equipment to which this paragraph is applicable shall discharge or cause 
the discharge of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere in excess of the 
amount prescribed by the following equations:

E = 12,245 S or e = 1,540 S

where:

E = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (lb./hr.) from all affected units.
e = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (gm./sec.) from all affected 
units.
S = Sulfur content, in percent by weight, prior to any pretreatment of 
the fuel being burned.

    (3) For the purposes of this paragraph:

[[Page 99]]

    (i) E shall not exceed 21,270 lb./hr. (2,680 gm./sec.).
    (ii) If the sum of sulfur oxides emissions from Units 1, 2, and 3 
would be less than 3,780 lb./hr. (475 gm./sec.) without the use of 
emission control equipment, the requirements of paragraphs (2), (4)(i) 
and (5) of this paragraph (c), shall not apply for the period of time 
that the emissions remain below this level.
    (iii) The applicability of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section may 
be determined through a sulfur balance utilizing the analyzed sulfur 
content of the fuel being burned and the total rate of fuel consumption 
in all affected units.
    (4)(i) No owner or operator of the fossil fuel-fired steam 
generating equipment subject to this paragraph shall discharge or cause 
the discharge of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere from any affected 
unit in excess of the amount prescribed by the following equations, 
except as provided in paragraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph (c).

E<INF>1</INF> = 0.333 E or e<INF>1</INF> = 0.333 e

where:

E = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (lb./hr.) from all affected units 
as determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this paragraph.
e = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (gm./sec.) from all affected units 
as determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this paragraph (c).
E<INF>1</INF> = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (lb./hr.) from each 
affected unit.
e<INF>1</INF> = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (gm./sec.) from each 
affected unit.

    (ii) The owner or operator of the fossil fuel-fired steam generating 
equipment to which this paragraph is applicable may submit a request to 
redesignate the allowable emissions specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of 
this section. Such a request shall be submitted no later than December 
2, 1974, and shall demonstrate that sulfur oxides emissions on a total 
plant basis will not exceed those specified in paragraphs (2) and (3)(i) 
of this paragraph (c). Upon receipt and evaluation of such request, the 
Administrator shall consider such and if appropriate, redesignate the 
allowable emissions specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) All sulfur oxides control equipment at the fossil fuel-fired 
steam generating equipment to which this paragraph is applicable shall 
be operated at the maximum practicable efficiency at all times, without 
regard to the allowable sulfur oxides emissions, determined according to 
paragraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph (c), except as provided in 
paragraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph (c).
    (6) Compliance with this paragraph shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 52.134(a).
    (7) The test methods and procedures used to determine compliance 
with this paragraph shall be those prescribed in Sec. 60.46(c)(2) and 
(c)(4) of this chapter. The test methods for determining the sulfur 
content of fuel shall be those specified in Sec. 60.45(c) and (d) of 
this chapter.
    (d)-(e) [Reserved]
    (f)(1) Paragraphs B through E of regulation 7-1-4.2 (R9-3-402) 
(Sulfur Emissions: Fuel Burning Installations) of the Arizona Air 
Pollution Control Regulations are disapproved because they could allow 
existing oil fired facilities to use dispersion dependent techniques 
alone as a means of attaining and maintaining the national ambient air 
quality standards. The regulation does not assure the attainment and 
maintenance of the national standards in a manner which is consistent 
with the intent of sections 110(a)(2)(B) and 123(a)(2) of the Clean Air 
Act.
    (2) The approval of paragraphs A and F of regulation 7-1-4.2 as to 
coal fired facilities does not apply to the Salt River Project 
Agricultural Improvement and Power District-Navajo Generating Station.
    (3) Paragraphs B through E of regulation 8-1-4.2 (Sulfur Emissions--
Fuel Burning Installations) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control 
Regulations are disapproved because they could allow existing facilities 
to use dispersion dependent techniques alone as a means of attaining and 
maintaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This regulation 
does not assure the attainment and maintenance of the national standards 
in a manner which is consistent with the intent of sections 
110(a)(2)(B)and 123(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act.

[[Page 100]]

    (g) Section 3, Regulation 3 (Sulfur from Primary Copper Smelters) of 
the Mohave County Health Department Air Pollution Control Regulations 
and Regulation 7-3-2.1 (Copper Smelters) of the Pinal-Gila Counties Air 
Quality Control District are disapproved since Section 36-1706 of the 
Arizona Revised Statutes grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Arizona 
Department of Health Services and the State Hearing Board over all 
existing copper smelters.
    (1) The requirements of Sec. 51.13 of this chapter are not met since 
the plan does not demonstrate that the emission limitations applicable 
to existing fuel burning equipment producing electrical energy will 
provide for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards in 
the Pima Intrastate Region (Sec. 81.269 of this chapter).
    (2) Regulation II: Rule 7A--paragraphs 2 through 5, Emission 
Limitations Fuel Burning Equipment--Sulfur Dioxide, of the Rules and 
Regulations of the Pima County Air Pollution Control District are 
disapproved because they could allow existing facilities to use 
dispersion dependent techniques along as a means of attaining and 
maintaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The regulation 
does not assure the attainment and maintenance of the national standards 
in a manner which is consistent with the intent of section 110(a)(2)(B) 
of the Clean Air Act.

    (4) Compliance with this paragraph shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 52.134(a).
    (5) The test methods and procedures used to determine compliance 
with this paragraph are set forth below. The methods referenced are 
contained in the appendix to part 60 of this chapter. Equivalent methods 
and procedures may be used if approved by the Administrator.
    (i) For each sampling repetition, the average concentration of 
particulate matter shall be determined by using method 5. Traversing 
during sampling by method 5 shall be according to method 1. The minimum 
sampling time shall be 2 hours and the minimum sampling volume shall be 
60 ft<SUP> 3</SUP>(1.70 m<SUP> 3</SUP>), corrected to standard 
conditions on a dry basis.

[[Page 101]]

    (ii) The volumetric flow rate of the total effluent shall be 
determined by using method 2 and traversing according to method 1. Gas 
analysis shall be performed using the integrated sample technique of 
method 3, and moisture content shall be determined by the condenser 
technique of method 4.
    (iii) All tests shall be conducted while the source is operating at 
the maximum production or combustion rate at which such source will be 
operated. During the tests, the source shall burn fuels or combinations 
of fuels, use raw materials, and maintain process conditions 
representative of normal operation, and shall operate under such other 
relevant conditions as the Administrator shall specify.
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 51.281 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not contain regulations for Mohave and Yuma Counties 
in the Mohave-Yuma Intrastate Region or Pinal-Gila Counties in the 
Central Arizona Intrastate Region which provide enforceable and 
reproducible test procedures for the determination of compliance with 
the emission standards. Therefore paragraph C of section 3, regulation 2 
(Particulates: Other Sources) of the Mohave County Air Pollution Control 
Regulations, paragraph B of regulation 8-1-3.6 (Particulates--Process 
Industries) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control Regulations, and 
paragraph C of regulation 7-3-1.4 (Particulate Emissions--Incineration) 
and paragraph F of regulation 7-3-1.7 (Particulate Emissions--Fuel 
Burning Equipment) of the Rules and Regulations for Pinal-Gila Counties 
Air Quality Control District are disapproved.

 Appendix A to Sec. 52.128--Test Methods To Determine Whether A Surface 
                              Is Stabilized

                I. Unpaved Roads and Unpaved Parking Lots

                         A. Opacity Observations

    Conduct opacity observations in accordance with Reference Method 9 
(40 CFR Part 60, appendix A) and Methods 203A and 203C of this appendix, 
with opacity readings taken at five second observation intervals and two 
consecutive readings per plume beginning with the first reading at zero 
seconds, in accordance with Method 203C, sections 2.3.2. and 2.4.2 of 
this appendix. Conduct visible opacity tests only on dry unpaved 
surfaces (i.e. when the surface is not damp to the touch) and on days 
when average wind speeds do not exceed 15 miles per hour (mph).

   (i) Method 203A--Visual Determination of Opacity of Emissions From 
            Stationary Sources for Time-Arranged Regulations

    Method 203A is virtually identical to EPA's Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60 
Appendix A) except for the data-reduction procedures, which provide for 
averaging times other than 6 minutes. That is, using Method 203A with a 
6-minute averaging time would be the same as following EPA Method 9 (40 
CFR Part 60, Appendix A). Additionally, Method 203A provides procedures 
for fugitive dust applications. The certification procedures provided in 
section 3 are virtually identical to Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix 
A) and are provided here, in full, for clarity and convenience.

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of the opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions for time-
averaged regulations. A time-averaged regulation is any regulation that 
requires averaging visible emission data to determine the opacity of 
visible emissions over a specific time period.
    1.2 Principle. The opacity of emissions from sources of visible 
emissions is determined visually by an observer qualified according to 
the procedures of section 3.

                              2. Procedures

    An observer qualified in accordance with section 3 of this method 
shall use the following procedures for visually determining the opacity 
of emissions.
    2.1 Procedures for Emissions from Stationary Sources. These 
procedures are not applicable to this section.
    2.2 Procedures for Fugitive Process Dust Emissions. These procedures 
are applicable for the determination of the opacity of fugitive 
emissions by a qualified observer. The qualified field observer should 
do the following:
    2.2.1 Position. Stand at a position at least 5 meters from the 
fugitive dust source in order to provide a clear view of the emissions 
with the sun oriented in the 140-degree sector to the back. Consistent 
as much as possible with maintaining the above requirements, make 
opacity observations from a position such that the line of vision is 
approximately perpendicular to the plume and wind direction. As much as 
possible, if multiple plumes are involved, do not include more than one 
plume in the line of sight at one time.
    2.2.2 Field Records. Record the name of the plant or site, fugitive 
source location, source type [pile, stack industrial process unit, 
incinerator, open burning operation activity, material handling 
(transfer, loading, sorting, etc.)], method of control used, if any, 
observer's name, certification data and affiliation, and a sketch of the 
observer's position relative to the fugitive source. Also, record the 
time, estimated distance to the fugitive source location, approximate 
wind direction, estimated wind speed, description of the sky condition 
(presence and color of clouds), observer's position relative to the 
fugitive source, and color of the plume and type of background on the 
visible emission observation form when opacity readings are initiated 
and completed.
    2.2.3 Observations. Make opacity observations, to the extent 
possible, using a contrasting background that is perpendicular to the 
line of vision. For roads, storage piles, and parking lots, make opacity 
observations approximately 1 meter above the surface from which the 
plume is generated. For other fugitive sources, make opacity 
observations at the point of greatest opacity in that portion of the 
plume where condensed water vapor is not present. For intermittent 
sources, the initial observation should begin immediately after a plume 
has been created above the surface involved. Do not look continuously at 
the plume but, instead, observe

[[Page 106]]

the plume momentarily at 15-second intervals.
    2.3 Recording Observations. Record the opacity observations to the 
nearest 5 percent every 15 seconds on an observational record sheet. 
Each momentary observation recorded represents the average opacity of 
emissions for a 15-second period.
    2.4 Data Reduction for Time-Averaged Regulations. A set of 
observations is composed of an appropriate number of consecutive 
observations determined by the averaging time specified. Divide the 
recorded observations into sets of appropriate time lengths for the 
specified averaging time. Sets must consist of consecutive observations; 
however, observations immediately preceding and following interrupted 
observations shall be deemed consecutive. Sets need not be consecutive 
in time and in no case shall two sets overlap, resulting in multiple 
violations. For each set of observations, calculate the appropriate 
average opacity.

                      3. Qualification and Testing

    3.1 Certification Requirements. To receive certification as a 
qualified observer, a candidate must be tested and demonstrate the 
ability to assign opacity readings in 5 percent increments to 25 
different black plumes and 25 different white plumes, with an error not 
to exceed 15 percent opacity on any one reading and an average error not 
to exceed 7.5 percent opacity in each category. Candidates shall be 
tested according to the procedures described in paragraph 3.2. Any smoke 
generator used pursuant to paragraph 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke 
meter which meets the requirements of paragraph 3.3. Certification tests 
that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 are not 
valid.
    The certification shall be valid for a period of 6 months, and after 
each 6-month period, the qualification procedures must be repeated by an 
observer in order to retain certification.
    3.2 Certification Procedure. The certification test consists of 
showing the candidate a complete run of 50 plumes, 25 black plumes and 
25 white plumes, generated by a smoke generator. Plumes shall be 
presented in random order within each set of 25 black and 25 white 
plumes. The candidate assigns an opacity value to each plume and records 
the observation on a suitable form. At the completion of each run of 50 
readings, the score of the candidate is determined. If a candidate fails 
to qualify, the complete run of 50 readings must be repeated in any 
retest. The smoke test may be administered as part of a smoke school or 
training program, and may be preceded by training or familiarization 
runs of the smoke generator during which candidates are shown black and 
white plumes of known opacity.
    3.3 Smoke Generator Specifications. Any smoke generator used for the 
purpose of paragraph 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke meter installed 
to measure opacity across the diameter of the smoke generator stack. The 
smoke meter output shall display in-stack opacity, based upon a path 
length equal to the stack exit diameter on a full 0 to 100 percent chart 
recorder scale. The smoke meter optical design and performance shall 
meet the specifications shown in Table A. The smoke meter shall be 
calibrated as prescribed in paragraph 3.3.1 prior to conducting each 
smoke reading test. At the completion of each test, the zero and span 
drift, shall be checked, and if the drift exceeds <plus-minus>1 percent 
opacity, the condition shall be corrected prior to conducting any 
subsequent test runs. The smoke meter shall be demonstrated at the time 
of installation to meet the specifications listed in Table A. This 
demonstration shall be repeated following any subsequent repair or 
replacement of the photocell or associated electronic circuitry 
including the chart recorder or output meter, or every 6 months, 
whichever occurs first.
    3.3.1 Calibration. The smoke meter is calibrated after allowing a 
minimum of 30 minutes warm-up by alternately producing simulated opacity 
of 0 percent and 100 percent. When stable response at 0 percent or 100 
percent is noted, the smoke meter is adjusted to produce an output of 0 
percent or 100 percent, as appropriate. This calibration shall be 
repeated until stable 0 percent and 100 percent readings are produced 
without adjustment. Simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values 
may be produced by alternately switching the power to the light source 
on and off while the smoke generator is not producing smoke.
    3.3.2 Smoke Meter Evaluation. The smoke meter design and performance 
are to be evaluated as follows:
    3.3.2.1 Light Source. Verify from manufacturer's data and from 
voltage measurements made at the lamp, as installed, that the lamp is 
operated within <plus-minus>5 percent of the nominal rated voltage.
    3.3.2.2 Spectral Response of Photocell. Verify from manufacturer's 
data that the photocell has a photopic response; i.e., the spectral 
sensitivity of the cell shall closely approximate the standard spectral-
luminosity curve for photopic vision which is referenced in (b) of Table 
A.
    3.3.2.3 Angle of View. Check construction geometry to ensure that 
the total angle of view of the smoke plume, as seen by the photocell, 
does not exceed 15 degrees. Calculate the total angle of view as 
follows:

<greek-ph><INF>v</INF> = 2 tan<SUP>-1</SUP> d/2L

Where:

<greek-ph><INF>v</INF> = total angle of view;

[[Page 107]]

d = the photocell diameter + the diameter of the limiting aperture; and
L = distance from the photocell to the limiting aperture.

    The limiting aperture is the point in the path between the photocell 
and the smoke plume where the angle of view is most restricted. In smoke 
generator smoke meters, this is normally an orifice plate.
    3.3.2.4 Angle of Projection. Check construction geometry to ensure 
that the total angle of projection of the lamp on the smoke plume does 
not exceed 15 degrees. Calculate the total angle of projection as 
follows:

<greek-ph><INF>p</INF> = 2 tan<SUP>-1</SUP> d/2L

Where:

<greek-ph><INF>p</INF> = total angle of projection;
d = the sum of the length of the lamp filament + the diameter of the 
limiting aperture; and
L = the distance from the lamp to the limiting aperture.

    3.3.2.5 Calibration Error. Using neutral-density filters of known 
opacity, check the error between the actual response and the theoretical 
linear response of the smoke meter. This check is accomplished by first 
calibrating the smoke meter according to 3.3.1 and then inserting a 
series of three neutral-density filters of nominal opacity of 20, 50, 
and 75 percent in the smoke meter path length. Use filters calibrated 
within <plus-minus>2 percent. Care should be taken when inserting the 
filters to prevent stray light from affecting the meter. Make a total of 
five nonconsecutive readings for each filter. The maximum opacity error 
on any one reading shall be <plus-minus>3 percent.
    3.3.2.6 Zero and Span Drift. Determine the zero and span drift by 
calibrating and operating the smoke generator in a normal manner over a 
1-hour period. The drift is measured by checking the zero and span at 
the end of this period.
    3.3.2.7 Response Time. Determine the response time by producing the 
series of five simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values and 
observing the time required to reach stable response. Opacity values of 
0 percent and 100 percent may be simulated by alternately switching the 
power to the light source off and on while the smoke generator is not 
operating.

  (ii) Method 203C--Visual Determination of Opacity of Emissions From 
       Stationary Sources for Instantaneous Limitation Regulations

    Method 203C is virtually identical to EPA's Method 9 (40 CFR Part 
60, Appendix A), except for the data-reduction procedures which have 
been modified for application to instantaneous limitation regulations. 
Additionally, Method 203C provides procedures for fugitive dust 
applications which were unavailable when Method 9 was promulgated. The 
certification procedures in section 3 are identical to Method 9. These 
certification procedures are provided in Method 203A as well, and, 
therefore, have not been repeated in this method.

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of the opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions for 
instantaneous limitations. An instantaneous limitation regulation is an 
opacity limit which is never to be exceeded.
    1.2 Principle. The opacity of emissions from sources of visible 
emissions is determined visually by a qualified observer.

                              2. Procedures

    The observer qualified in accordance with section 3 of this method 
shall use the following procedures for visually determining the opacity 
of emissions.
    2.1 Procedures for Emissions From Stationary Sources. Same as 2.1, 
Method 203A.
    2.1.1 Position. Same as 2.1.1, Method 203A.
    2.1.2 Field Records. Same as 2.1.2, Method 203A.

[[Page 108]]

    2.1.3 Observations. Make opacity observations at the point of 
greatest opacity in that portion of the plume where condensed water 
vapor is not present.
    Do not look continuously at the plume. Instead, observe the plume 
momentarily at the interval specified in the subject regulation. Unless 
otherwise specified, a 15-second observation interval is assumed.
    2.1.3.1 Attached Steam Plumes. Same as 2.1.3.1, Method 203A.
    2.1.3.2 Detached Steam Plumes. Same as 2.1.3.2, Method 203A.
    2.2 Procedures for Fugitive Process Dust Emissions.
    2.2.1 Position. Same as section 2.2.1, Method 203A.
    2.2.2 Field Records. Same as section 2.2.2, Method 203A.
    2.2.3 Observations.
    2.2.3.1 Observations for a 15-second Observation Interval 
Regulations. Same as section 2.2.3, Method 203A.
    2.2.3.2 Observations for a 5-second Observation Interval 
Regulations. Same as section 2.2.3, Method 203A, except, observe the 
plume momentarily at 5-second intervals.
    2.3 Recording Observations. Record opacity observations to the 
nearest 5 percent at the prescribed interval on an observational record 
sheet. Each momentary observation recorded represents the average of 
emissions for the prescribed period. If a 5-second observation period is 
not specified in the applicable regulation, a 15-second interval is 
assumed. The overall time for which recordings are made shall be of a 
length appropriate to the regulation for which opacity is being 
measured.
    2.3.1 Recording Observations for 15-second Observation Interval 
Regulations. Record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at 15-
second intervals on an observational record sheet. Each momentary 
observation recorded represents the average of emissions for a 15-second 
period.
    2.3.2 Recording Observations for 5-second Observation Interval 
Regulations. Record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at 5-
second intervals on an observational record sheet. Each momentary 
observation recorded represents the average of emissions for 5-second 
period.
    2.4 Data Reduction for Instantaneous Limitation Regulations. For an 
instantaneous limitation regulation, a 1-minute averaging time will be 
used. Divide the observations recorded on the record sheet into sets of 
consecutive observations. A set is composed of the consecutive 
observations made in 1 minute. Sets need not be consecutive in time, and 
in no case shall two sets overlap. Reduce opacity observations by 
dividing the sum of all observations recorded in a set by the number of 
observations recorded in each set.
    2.4.1 Data Reduction for 15-second Observation Intervals. Reduce 
opacity observations by averaging four consecutive observations recorded 
at 15-second intervals. Divide the observations recorded on the record 
sheet into sets of four consecutive observations. For each set of four 
observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of the four 
observations and dividing this sum by four.
    2.4.2 Data Reduction for 5-second Observation Intervals. Reduce 
opacity observations by averaging 12 consecutive observations recorded 
at 5-second intervals. Divide the observations recorded on the record 
sheet into sets of 12 consecutive observations. For each set of 12 
observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of the 12 
observations and dividing this sum by 12.

                             B. Silt Content

    Conduct the following test method to determine the silt loading and 
silt content of unpaved road and unpaved parking lot surfaces.
    (i) Collect a sample of loose surface material from an area 30 cm by 
30 cm (1 foot by 1 foot) in size to a depth of approximately 1 cm or 
until a hard subsurface is reached, whichever occurs first. Use a brush 
and dustpan or other similar device. Collect the sample from a 
routinely-traveled portion of the surface which receives a preponderance 
of vehicle traffic, i.e. as commonly evidenced by tire tracks. Conduct 
sweeping slowly so

[[Page 109]]

that fine surface material is not released into the air. Only collect 
samples from surfaces that are not wet or damp due to precipitation or 
dew.
    (ii) Obtain a shallow, lightweight container and a scale with 
readings in half ounce increments or less. Place the scale on a level 
surface and zero it with the weight of the empty container. Transfer the 
entire sample collected to the container, minimizing escape of particles 
into the air. Weigh the sample and record its weight.
    (iii) Obtain and stack a set of sieves with the following openings: 
4 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm. Place the sieves in order 
according to size openings beginning with the largest size opening at 
the top. Place a collector pan underneath the bottom (0.25 mm) sieve. 
Pour the entire sample into the top sieve, minimizing escape of 
particles into the air by positioning the sieve/collector pan unit in an 
enclosed or wind barricaded area. Cover the sieve/collector pan unit 
with a lid. Shake the covered sieve/collector pan unit vigorously for a 
period of at least one (1) minute in both the horizontal and vertical 
planes. Remove the lid from the sieve/collector pan unit and disassemble 
each sieve separately beginning with the largest sieve. As each sieve is 
removed, examine it for a complete separation of material in order to 
ensure that all material has been sifted to the finest sieve through 
which it can pass. If not, reassemble and cover the sieve/collector pan 
unit and shake it for period of at least one (1) minute. After 
disassembling the sieve/collector pan unit, transfer the material which 
is captured in the collector pan into the lightweight container 
originally used to collect and weigh the sample. Minimize escape of 
particles into the air when transferring the material into the 
container. Weigh the container with the material from the collector pan 
and record its weight. Multiply the resulting weight by 0.38 if the 
source is an unpaved road or by 0.55 if the source is an unpaved parking 
lot to estimate silt loading. Divide by the total sample weight and 
multiply by 100 to arrive at the percent silt content.
    (iv) As an alternative to conducting the procedure described above 
in section I.B.(ii) and section I.B.(iii) of this appendix, the sample 
(collected according to section I.B.(i) of this appendix) may be taken 
to an independent testing laboratory or engineering facility for silt 
loading (e.g. net weight  200 mesh) and silt content analysis according 
to the following test method from ``Procedures For Laboratory Analysis 
Of Surface/Bulk Dust Loading Samples'', (Fifth Edition, Volume I, 
Appendix C.2.3 ``Silt Analysis'', 1995), AP-42, Office of Air Quality 
Planning & Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research 
Triangle Park, North Carolina.
    1. Objective--Several open dust emission factors have been found to 
be correlated with the silt content( 200 mesh) of the material being 
disturbed. The basic procedure for silt content determination is 
mechanical, dry sieving. For sources other than paved roads, the same 
sample which was oven-dried to determine moisture content is then 
mechanically sieved.
    2.1 Procedure--Select the appropriate 20-cm (8-in.) diameter, 5-cm 
(2-in.) deep sieve sizes.
    Recommended U. S. Standard Series sizes are 3/8 in., No. 4, No. 40, 
No. 100, No. 140, No. 200, and a pan. Comparable Tyler Series sizes can 
also be used. The No. 20 and the No. 200 are mandatory. The others can 
be varied if the recommended sieves are not available, or if buildup on 
1 particulate sieve during sieving indicates that an intermediate sieve 
should be inserted.
    2.2 Obtain a mechanical sieving device, such as a vibratory shaker 
or a Roto-Tap <SUP></SUP><greek-d><SUP></SUP> <SUP>1</SUP> without the 
tapping function.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ CFR part 60, App. A, Meth. 5, 2.1.2, footnote 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.3 Clean the sieves with compressed air and/or a soft brush. Any 
material lodged in the sieve openings or adhering to the sides of the 
sieve should be removed, without handling the screen roughly, if 
possible.
    2.4 Obtain a scale (capacity of at least 1600 grams [g] or 3.5 lb) 
and record make, capacity, smallest division, date of last calibration, 
and accuracy. (See Figure A)
    2.5 Weigh the sieves and pan to determine tare weights. Check the 
zero before every weighing. Record the weights.
    2.6 After nesting the sieves in decreasing order of size, and with 
pan at the bottom, dump dried laboratory sample (preferably immediately 
after moisture analysis) into the top sieve. The sample should weigh 
between  cents 400 and 1600 g ( cents 0.9 and 3.5 lb). This amount will 
vary for finely textured materials, and 100 to 300 g may be sufficient 
when 90% of the sample passes a No. 8 (2.36 mm) sieve. Brush any fine 
material adhering to the sides of the container into the top sieve and 
cover the top sieve with a special lid normally purchased with the pan.
    2.7 Place nested sieves into the mechanical sieving device and sieve 
for 10 minutes (min). Remove pan containing minus No. 200 and weigh. 
Repeat the sieving at 10-min intervals until the difference between 2 
successive pan sample weighings (with the pan tare weight subtracted) is 
less than 3.0%. Do not sieve longer than 40 min.
    2.8 Weigh each sieve and its contents and record the weight. Check 
the zero before every weighing.
    2.9 Collect the laboratory sample. Place the sample in a separate 
container if further analysis is expected.

    (v) The silt loading and percent silt content for any given unpaved 
road surface or unpaved parking lot surface shall be based on the 
average of at least three (3) samples that are representative of 
routinely-traveled portions of the road or parking lot surface. In order 
to simplify the sieve test procedures in section I.B.(ii) and section 
I.B.(iii) of this appendix, the three samples may be combined as long as 
all material is sifted to the finest sieve through which it can pass, 
each sample weighs within 1 ounce of the other two samples, and the 
combined weight of the samples and unit area from which they were 
collected is calculated and recorded accurately.

                             II. Vacant Lots

    The following test methods shall be used for determining whether a 
vacant lot, or portion thereof, has a stabilized surface.
    Should a disturbed vacant lot contain more than one type of 
disturbance, soil, vegetation or other characteristics which are visibly 
distinguishable, test each representative surface for stability 
separately in random areas according to the test methods in section II. 
of this appendix and include or eliminate it from the total size 
assessment of disturbed surface area(s) depending upon test method 
results. A vacant lot surface shall be considered stabilized if any of 
the test methods in section II. of this appendix indicate that the 
surface is stabilized such that the conditions defined in paragraph 
(b)(16)(ii) of this section are met:

                     1. Visible Crust Determination

    (i) Where a visible crust exists, drop a steel ball with a diameter 
of 15.9 millimeters (0.625 inches) and a mass ranging from 16 to 17 
grams from a distance of 30 centimeters (one foot) directly above (at a 
90 degree angle perpendicular to) the soil surface. If blowsand is 
present, clear the blowsand from the surfaces on which the visible crust 
test method is conducted. Blowsand is defined as thin deposits of loose 
uncombined grains covering less than 50 percent of a vacant lot which 
have not originated from the representative vacant lot surface being 
tested. If material covers a visible crust which is not blowsand, apply 
the test method in section II.2 of this appendix to the loose material 
to determine whether the surface is stabilized.
    (ii) A sufficient crust is defined under the following conditions: 
once a ball has been dropped according to section II.1.(i) of this 
appendix, the ball does not sink into the surface so that it is 
partially or fully surrounded by loose grains and, upon removing the 
ball, the surface upon which it fell has not been pulverized so that 
loose grains are visible.
    (iii) Conduct three tests, dropping the ball once per test, within a 
survey area the size of one foot by one foot. The survey area shall be 
considered sufficiently crusted if at least two out of three tests meet 
the definition in section II.1.(ii) of this appendix. Select at least 
two other survey areas that represent the disturbed surface area and 
repeat this procedure. Whether a sufficient crust covers the disturbed 
surface area shall be based on

[[Page 111]]

a determination that all of the survey areas tested are sufficiently 
crusted.
    (iv) At any given site, the existence of a sufficient crust covering 
one portion of a disturbed surface may not represent the existence or 
protectiveness of a crust on another disturbed surface(s). Repeat the 
visible crust test as often as necessary on each representative 
disturbed surface area for an accurate assessment of all disturbed 
surfaces at a given site.

          2. Determination of Threshold Friction Velocity (TFV)

    For disturbed surface areas that are not crusted or vegetated, 
determine threshold friction velocity (TFV) according to the following 
sieving field procedure (based on a 1952 laboratory procedure published 
by W. S. Chepil).
    (i) Obtain and stack a set of sieves with the following openings: 4 
millimeters (mm), 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm. Place the sieves in 
order according to size openings beginning with the largest size opening 
at the top. Place a collector pan underneath the bottom (0.25 mm) sieve. 
Collect a sample of loose surface material from an area at least 30 cm 
by 30 cm in size to a depth of approximately 1 cm using a brush and 
dustpan or other similar device. Only collect soil samples from dry 
surfaces (i.e. when the surface is not damp to the touch). Remove any 
rocks larger than 1 cm in diameter from the sample. Pour the sample into 
the top sieve (4 mm opening) and cover the sieve/collector pan unit with 
a lid. Minimize escape of particles into the air when transferring 
surface soil into the sieve/collector pan unit. Move the covered sieve/
collector pan unit by hand using a broad, circular arm motion in the 
horizontal plane. Complete twenty circular arm movements, ten clockwise 
and ten counterclockwise, at a speed just necessary to achieve some 
relative horizontal motion between the sieves and the particles. Remove 
the lid from the sieve/collector pan unit and disassemble each sieve 
separately beginning with the largest sieve. As each sieve is removed, 
examine it for loose particles. If loose particles have not been sifted 
to the finest sieve through which they can pass, reassemble and cover 
the sieve/collector pan unit and gently rotate it an additional ten 
times. After disassembling the sieve/collector pan unit, slightly tilt 
and gently tap each sieve and the collector pan so that material aligns 
along one side. In doing so, minimize escape of particles into the air. 
Line up the sieves and collector pan in a row and visibly inspect the 
relative quantities of catch in order to determine which sieve (or 
whether the collector pan) contains the greatest volume of material. If 
a visual determination of relative volumes of catch among sieves is 
difficult, use a graduated cylinder to measure the volume. Estimate TFV 
for the sieve catch with the greatest volume using Table 1, which 
provides a correlation between sieve opening size and TFV.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Collect at least three (3) soil samples which are representative of 
the disturbed surface area, repeat the above TFV test method for each 
sample and average the resulting TFVs together to determine the TFV 
uncorrected for non-erodible elements.
    (ii) Non-erodible elements are distinct elements on the disturbed 
surface area that are larger than one (1) cm in diameter, remain firmly 
in place during a wind episode and inhibit soil loss by consuming part 
of the shear stress of the wind. Non-erodible elements include stones 
and bulk surface material but do not include flat or standing 
vegetation. For surfaces with non-erodible elements, determine 
corrections to the TFV by identifying the fraction of the survey area, 
as viewed from directly overhead, that is occupied by non-erodible 
elements using the following procedure. Select a survey area of one (1) 
meter by 1 meter. Where many non-erodible elements lie on the disturbed 
surface area, separate them into groups according to size. For each 
group, calculate the overhead area for the non-erodible elements 
according to the following equations:

(Average length)  x  (Average width) = Average Dimensions    Eq. 1
(Average Dimensions)  x  (Number of Elements) = Overhead Area    Eq. 2
Overhead Area of Group 1 + Overhead Area of Group 2 (etc.) = Total 
Overhead Area    Eq. 3
Total Overhead Area/2 = Total Frontal
Area Eq. 4
(Total Frontal Area/Survey Area)  x  100 = Percent Cover of Non-erodible 
Elements    Eq. 5
(Ensure consistent units of measurement, e.g. square meters or square 
inches when calculating percent cover.)

    Repeat this procedure on an additional two (2) distinct survey areas 
representing a disturbed surface and average the results. Use Table 2 to 
identify the correction factor for the percent cover of non-erodible 
elements. Multiply the TFV by the corresponding correction factor to 
calculate the TFV corrected for non-erodible elements.

                3. Determination of Flat Vegetation Cover

    Flat vegetation includes attached (rooted) vegetation or unattached 
vegetative debris lying on the surface with a predominant horizontal 
orientation that is not subject to movement by wind. Flat vegetation 
which is dead but firmly attached shall be considered equally protective 
as live vegetation. Stones or other aggregate larger than one centimeter 
in diameter shall be considered protective cover in the course of 
conducting the line transect method. Where flat vegetation exists, 
conduct the following line transect method.
    (i) Stretch a one-hundred (100) foot measuring tape across a 
disturbed surface area. Firmly anchor both ends of the measuring tape 
into the surface using a tool such as a screwdriver with the tape 
stretched taut and close to the soil surface. If vegetation exists in 
regular rows, place the tape diagonally (at approximately a 45 degree 
angle) away from a parallel or perpendicular position to the vegetated 
rows. Pinpoint an area the size of a \3/32\ inch diameter brazing rod or 
wooden dowel centered above each one-foot interval mark along one edge 
of the tape. Count the number of times that flat vegetation lies 
directly underneath the pinpointed area at one-foot intervals. 
Consistently observe the underlying surface from a 90 degree angle 
directly above each pinpoint on one side of the tape. Do not count the 
underlying surface as vegetated if any portion of the pinpoint extends 
beyond the edge of the vegetation underneath in any direction. If clumps 
of vegetation or vegetative debris lie underneath the pinpointed area, 
count the surface as vegetated unless bare soil is visible directly 
below the pinpointed area. When 100 observations have been made, add 
together the number of times a surface was counted as vegetated. This 
total represents the percent of flat vegetation cover (e.g. if 35 
positive counts were made, then vegetation cover is 35 percent). If the 
disturbed surface area is too small for 100 observations, make as many 
observations as possible. Then multiply the count of vegetated surface 
areas by the appropriate conversion factor to obtain percent cover. For 
example, if vegetation was counted 20 times within a total of 50 
observations, divide 20 by 50 and multiply by 100 to obtain a flat 
vegetation cover of 40 percent.
    (ii) Conduct the above line transect test method an additional two 
(2) times on areas representative of the disturbed surface and average 
results.

              4. Determination of Standing Vegetation Cover

    Standing vegetation includes vegetation that is attached (rooted) 
with a predominant vertical orientation. Standing vegetation which is 
dead but firmly rooted shall be considered equally protective as live 
vegetation. Conduct the following standing vegetation test method to 
determine if 30 percent cover or more exists. If the resulting percent 
cover is less than 30 percent but equal to or greater than 10 percent, 
then conduct the Threshold Friction Velocity test in section II.2 of 
this appendix in order to determine whether the disturbed surface area 
is stabilized according to paragraph (b)(16)(ii)(E) of this section.
    (i) For standing vegetation that consists of large, separate 
vegetative structures (for example, shrubs and sagebrush), select a 
survey area representing the disturbed surface that is the shape of a 
square with sides equal to at least ten (10) times the average height of 
the vegetative structures. For smaller standing vegetation, select a 
survey area of three (3) feet by 3 feet.
    (ii) Count the number of standing vegetative structures within the 
survey area. Count vegetation which grows in clumps as a single unit. 
Where different types of vegetation exists and/or vegetation of 
different height and width exists, separate the vegetative structures 
with similar dimensions into groups. Count the number of vegetative 
structures in each group within the survey area. Select an individual 
structure within each group that represents the average height and width 
of the vegetation in the group. If the structure is dense (i.e. when 
looking at it vertically from base to top there is little or zero open 
air space within its perimeter), calculate and record its frontal 
silhouette area according to Equation 6 of this appendix. Also use 
Equation 6 if the survey area is larger than nine square feet, 
estimating the average height and width of the vegetation. Otherwise, 
use the procedure in section II.4.(iii) of this appendix to calculate 
the Frontal Silhouette Area. Then calculate the percent cover of 
standing vegetation according to Equations 7, 8 and 9 of this appendix. 
(Ensure consistent units of measurement, e.g. square feet or square 
inches when calculating percent cover.)
    (iii) Vegetative Density Factor. Cut a single, representative piece 
of vegetation (or consolidated vegetative structure) to within 1 cm of 
surface soil. Using a white paper grid or transparent grid over white 
paper, lay the vegetation flat on top of the grid (but do not apply 
pressure to flatten the structure). Grid boxes of one inch or one half 
inch squares are sufficient for most vegetation when conducting this 
procedure. Using a marker or pencil, outline the shape of the vegetation

[[Page 113]]

along its outer perimeter according to Figure B, C or D of this 
appendix, as appropriate. (Note: Figure C differs from Figure D 
primarily in that the width of vegetation in Figure C is narrow at its 
base and gradually broadens to its tallest height. In Figure D, the 
width of the vegetation generally becomes narrower from its midpoint to 
its tallest height.) Remove the vegetation and count and record the 
total number of gridline intersections within the outlined area, but do 
not count gridline intersections that connect with the outlined shape. 
There must be at least 10 gridline intersections within the outlined 
area and preferably more than 20, otherwise, use smaller grid boxes. 
Draw small circles (no greater than a \3/32\ inch diameter) at each 
gridline intersection counted within the outlined area. Replace the 
vegetation on the grid within its outlined shape. From a distance of 
approximately two feet directly above the grid, observe each circled 
gridline intersection. Count and record the number of circled gridline 
intersections that are not covered by any piece of the vegetation. To 
calculate percent vegetative density, use Equations 10 and 11 of this 
appendix. If percent vegetative density is equal to or greater than 30, 
use the equation (Eq. 14, 15 or 16) that matches the outline used to 
trace the vegetation (Figure B, C or D) to calculate its Frontal 
Silhouette Area. If percent vegetative density is less than 30, use 
Equations 12 and 13 of this appendix to calculate the Frontal Silhouette 
Area.
    (iv) Within a disturbed surface area that contains multiple types of 
vegetation with each vegetation type uniformly distributed, results of 
the percent cover associated with the individual vegetation types may be 
added together.
    (v) Repeat this procedure on an additional two (2) distinct survey 
areas representing the disturbed surface and average the results.

Height  x  Width = Frontal Silhouette Area    Eq. 6
(Frontal Silhouette Area of Individual Vegetative Structure)  x  Number 
of Vegetation Structures Per Group = Group Frontal Silhouette Area of 
Group    Eq. 7
Frontal Silhouette Area of Group 1 + Frontal Silhouette Area of Group 2 
(etc.) = Total Frontal Silhouette Area    Eq. 8
(Total Frontal Silhouette Area/Survey Area)  x  100 = Percent Cover of 
Standing Vegetation    Eq. 9
[(Number of circled gridlines within the outlined area counted that are 
not covered by vegetation / Total number of gridline intersections 
within the outlined area)  x  100] = Percent Open Space    Eq. 10
100 = Percent Open Space = Percent Vegetative Density    Eq. 11
Percent Vegetative Density/100 = Vegetative Density    Eq. 12

Sec. 52.130  Source surveillance.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.211 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not contain legally enforceable procedures for 
requiring sources in the Northern Arizona, Mohave-Yuma, Central Arizona, 
and Southeast Arizona Intrastate Regions to maintain records of and 
periodically report on the nature and amounts of emissions.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.213 of this chapter are not met 
because the plan does not provide procedures for obtaining and 
maintaining data on actual emission reductions achieved as a result of 
implementing transportation control measures.
    (c) Regulation for source recordkeeping and reporting. (1) The owner 
or operator of any stationary source in the Northern Arizona, Mohave-
Yuma, Central Arizona, or Southeast Arizona Intrastate Region 
(Secs. 81.270, 81.268, 81.271, and 81.272 of this chapter) shall, upon 
notification from the Administrator, maintain records of the nature and 
amounts of emissions from such source or any other information as may be 
deemed necessary by the Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures.
    (2) The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the 
Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of 
the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and 
July 1 to December 31, except that the initial reporting period shall 
commence on the date the Administrator issues notification of the 
recordkeeping requirements.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of the 
summarizing reports submitted to the Administrator shall be retained by 
the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent 
report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures. All such emission data will be available during 
normal business hours at the regional office (region IX). The 
Administrator will designate one or more places in Arizona where such 
emission data and correlations will be available for public inspection.
    (d) The requirements of Sec. 51.214 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not contain legally enforceable procedures for 
requiring certain stationary sources subject to emission standards to 
install, calibrate, operate, and maintain equipment for continuously 
monitoring and recording emissions, and to provide other information as 
specified in Appendix P of part 51 of this chapter.
    (e) The requirements of Sec. 51.214 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide sufficient regulations to meet the 
minimum specifications of Appendix P in the Maricopa Intrastate Region. 
Additionally, Maricopa County Air Pollution Control Regulation IV, rule 
41, paragraph B, sections 6.0-6.4 (Special Consideration) is disapproved 
since it does not contain the specific criteria for determining those 
physical limitations or extreme economic situations where alternative 
monitoring requirements would be applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 52.133  Rules and regulations.

    (a) Regulation 7-1-1.4(A) (Exceptions) of the Arizona Rules and 
Regulations for Air Pollution Control, regulations 12-3-2 (Emission 
Standards) of the Coconino County Rules and Regulations for Air 
Pollution Control, section 3, regulation 5 (Exceptions) of the Mohave 
County Air Pollution Control Regulations, regulation 8-1-1.6 
(Exceptions) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control Regulations, and 
regulation 7-1-2.8 (Exceptions) of the Rules and Regulations for Pinal-
Gila Counties Air Quality Control District all provide for an exemption 
from enforcement action if the violation is attributable to certain 
events. These events are too broad in scope and the source can obtain 
the exemption merely by reporting the occurrence. Therefore, the above 
regulations are disapproved

[[Page 120]]

since these regulations make all approved emission limiting regulations 
potentially unenforceable.
    (b) Paragraph E of regulation 7-1-1.3 (R9-3-103) (Air Pollution 
Prohibited) prohibits any person from causing ground level 
concentrations to exceed ambient standards outside the boundaries of 
this operation. This regulation could allow violations of ambient air 
quality standards to occur in areas to which the public has access, 
contrary to the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. 
Therefore, paragraph E of regulation 7-1-1.3 (R9-3-103) of the Arizona 
Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control is disapproved.
    (c) The requirements of subpart G and Sec. 51.281 of this chapter 
are not met since the plan does not provide any enforceable regulations 
and a demonstration that such regulations will cause the attainment and 
maintenance of national ambient air quality standards in Graham and 
Greenlee Counties.
    (d) Section 3, regulation 4 (Ground Level Concentrations) of the 
Mohave County Air Pollution Control Regulations, paragraph E of 
regulation 8-1-1.3 (Air Pollution Prohibited) of the Yuma County Air 
Pollution Control Regulations, and paragraph C of regulation 7-1-1.3 
(Air Pollution Prohibited) of the Rules and Regulations for Pinal-Gila 
Counties Air Quality Control District prohibits any person from causing 
ground level concentrations to exceed ambient standards outside the 
boundaries of hisoperation. These regulations could allow violations of 
ambient air quality standards to occur in areas to which the general 
public has access, contrary to the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of 
the Clean Air Act. Therefore, these regulations are disapproved.

resulting from the implementation of the plan/program over the period 
covered by the applicable plan considering any growth likely to result 
from the implementation of the plan or program.
    (ii) Findings. Prior to approving a transportation plan/program, the 
MPO shall determine if the plan/program conforms to the applicable 
implementation plan. In making this determination, the MPO shall make 
and support each of the following findings for each transportation plan 
and program using the information documented in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of 
this section:
    (A) that implementation of the transportation plan/program will 
provide for the implementation of TCMs in the applicable plan on the 
schedule set forth in the applicable plan;
    (B) that CO emission levels, microscale and regional, resulting from 
the implementation of the plan/program will not delay attainment or 
achievement of any interim emission reductions needed for attainment 
and/or interfere with maintenance of the CONAAQS throughout the 
nonattainment area during the period covered by the applicable plan; and
    (C) that implementation of the plan/program would not cause or 
contribute to a violation of the CO NAAQS anywhere within the 
nonattainment area during the period covered by the applicable plan.
    (2) Amendments to a Transportation Plan or Transportation 
Implementation Program. Prior to approving any amendment to a 
transportation plan or program, the MPO shall first determine that the 
amendment does not substantially change the information provided under

    (3) Transportation Projects. As part of any individual 
transportation project approval made by the MPO, the MPO shall determine 
whether the project conforms to the applicable implementation plan using 
the following procedure:
    (i) For projects from a plan and TIP that has been found to conform 
under procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section within the last 
three years or from a Plan or TIP amendment that has been found to 
conform under procedures in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in the past 
three years, the MPO shall document as part of the approval document:
    (A) the TIP project number;
    (B) whether the project is an exempt project as defined in paragraph 
(e) of this section; and
    (C) whether the design and scope of the project has changed 
significantly from the design and scope of the project as described in 
the conforming TIP:
    (1) If the design and scope of the project has not changed 
significantly, the MPO may find the project conforming; or
    (2) If the design and scope of the project has changed significantly 
or the design and scope of the project could not be determined from the 
TIP, the MPO shall use the procedures in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section to determine if the project conforms to the applicable 
implementation plan.
    (ii) For projects not exempted under paragraph (e) of this section 
and not in a plan or a TIP that has been found to conform under 
procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section within the last three 
years:
    (A) Documentation. The MPO shall document as part of the approval 
document for each such project:
    (1) the disaggregated population and employment projections, to the 
extent they are used in
    (i) the applicable plan, and
    (ii) designing and scoping the project;
    (2) the levels of vehicle trips, vehicle miles traveled, and 
congestion that are
    (i) assumed in the applicable plan, and
    (ii) expected to result over the period covered by the applicable 
plan from the construction of the project considering any growth likely 
to result from the project;
    (3) for each transportation control measure in the applicable plan 
likely to be affected by the project:
    (i) its implementation schedule and expected emission reduction 
effectiveness from the applicable plan,
    (ii) its current implementation status and, if feasible, its current 
effectiveness, and
    (iii) any actions as part of the project which may beneficially or 
adversely affect the implementation and/or effectiveness of the TCM;
    (4) CO emission levels which will result from the project over the 
period covered by the applicable plan considering any growth likely to 
result from the project; and
    (5) ambient CO concentration levels which will result from the 
project over the period covered by the applicable plan considering any 
growth likely to result from the project.
    (B) Findings. Prior to approving any transportation project, the MPO 
shall determine if the project conforms to the applicable implementation 
plan. In making this determination, the MPO shall make and support the 
following findings for each project using the information documented in 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:
    (1) that the project will provide for the implementation of TCMs 
affected by the project on the schedule set forth in the applicable 
plan;
    (2) that CO emission levels, microscale and regional, resulting from 
the implementation of the project during the period covered by the 
applicable plan will not delay attainment or any required interim 
emission reductions and/or interfere with maintenance of the CO NAAQS in 
an area substantially affected by the project;
    (3) that the project will not cause or contribute to a violation of 
the CO NAAQS during the period covered by the applicable plan near the 
project; and
    (4) that the projected emissions from the project, when considered 
together with emissions projected for the conforming plan and program 
within the

[[Page 124]]

nonattainment area, do not cause the plan and program to exceed the 
emission reduction projections and schedules assigned to such plans and 
programs in the applicable implementation plan.
    (e) Exempt Projects. An individual project is exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section if it is:
    (1) located completely outside the nonattainment area;
    (2) a safety project which is included in the statewide safety 
improvement program, will not alter the functional traffic capacity or 
capability of the facility being improved, and does not adversely affect 
the TCMs in the applicable plan;
    (3) a transportation control measure from the approved applicable 
plan; or
    (4) a mass transit project funded under the Urban Mass 
Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C.

generating equipment designated as Units 1, 2, and 3 at the Navajo 
Generating Station in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Air Quality 
Control Region (Sec. 81.270 of this chapter).
    (1) Definitions.
    Administrator means the Administrator of EPA or his/her designee.
    Affected Unit(s) means the steam-generating unit(s) at the Navajo 
Generating Station, all of which are subject to the emission limitation 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, that has accumulated at least 365 
boiler operating days since the passage of the date defined in paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section applicable to it.
    Boiler Operating Day for each of the boiler units at the Navajo 
Generating Station is defined as a 24-hour calendar day (the period of 
time between 12:01 a.m. and 12:00 midnight in Page, Arizona) during 
which coal is combusted in that unit for the entire 24 hours.
    Owner or Operator means the owner, participant in, or operator of 
the Navajo Generating Station to which this paragraph is applicable.
    Unit-Week of Maintenance means a period of 7 days during which a 
fossil fuel-fired steam-generating unit is under repair, and no coal is 
combusted in the unit.
    (2) Emission limitation. No owner or operator shall discharge or 
cause the discharge of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere in excess of 42 
ng/J [0.10 pound per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu)] heat 
input.
    (3) Compliance determination. Until at least one unit qualifies as 
an affected unit, no compliance determination is appropriate. As each 
unit qualifies for treatment as an affected unit, it shall be included 
in the compliance determination. Compliance with this emission limit 
shall be determined daily on a plant-wide rolling annual basis as 
follows:
    (i) For each boiler operating day at each steam generating unit 
subject to the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, 
the owner or operator shall record the unit's hourly SO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions using the data from the continuous emission monitoring 
systems, [required in paragraph (d)(4) of this section] and the daily 
electric energy generated by the unit (in megawatt-hours) as measured by 
the megawatt-hour meter for the unit.
    (ii) Compute the average daily SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate in ng/J 
(lb/MMBtu) following the procedures set out in method 19, appendix A, 40 
CFR part 60 in effect on October 3, 1991.

[[Page 126]]

    (iii) For each boiler operating day for each affected unit, 
calculate the product of the daily SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate 
(computed according to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) and the 
daily electric energy generated (recorded according to paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section) for each unit.
    (iv) For each affected unit, identify the previous 365 boiler 
operating days to be used in the compliance determination. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (d)(9) and (d)(10) of this section, all of the 
immediately preceding 365 boiler operating days will be used for 
compliance determinations.
    (v) Sum, for all affected units, the products of the daily 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate-electric energy generated (as calculated 
according to paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) for the boiler 
operating days identified in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section.
    (vi) Sum, for all affected units, the daily electric energy 
generated (recorded according to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section) 
for the boiler operating days identified in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this 
section.
    (vii) Calculate the weighted plant-wide annual average 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate by dividing the sum of the products 
determined according to paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section by the sum 
of the electric energy generated determined according to paragraph 
(d)(3)(vi) of this section.
    (viii) The weighted plant-wide annual average SO<INF>2</INF> 
emission rate shall be used to determine compliance with the emission 
limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (4) Continuous emission monitoring. The owner or operator shall 
install, maintain, and operate continuous emission monitoring systems to 
determine compliance with the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section as calculated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. This 
equipment shall meet the specifications in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60 
in effect on October 3, 1991. The owner or operator shall comply with 
the quality assurance procedures for continuous emission monitoring 
systems found in appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 in effect on October 3, 
1991.
    (5) Reporting requirements. For each steam generating unit subject 
to the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the 
owner or operator:
    (i) Shall furnish the Administrator written notification of the 
SO<INF>2</INF>, oxygen, and carbon dioxide emissions according to the 
procedures found in 40 CFR Sec. 60.7 in effect on October 3, 1991.
    (ii) Shall furnish the Administrator written notification of the 
daily electric energy generated in megawatt-hours.
    (iii) Shall maintain records according to the procedures in 40 CFR 
60.7 in effect on October 3, 1991.
    (iv) Shall notify the Administrator by telephone or in writing 
within one business day of any outage of the control system needed for 
compliance with the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section and shall submit a follow-up written report within 30 days of 
the repairs stating how the repairs were accomplished and justifying the 
amount of time taken for the repairs.
    (6) Compliance dates. The requirements of this paragraph shall be 
applicable to one unit at the Navajo Generating Station beginning 
November 19, 1997, to two units beginning November 19, 1998, and to all 
units beginning on August 19, 1999.
    (7) Schedule of compliance. The owner or operator shall take the 
following actions by the dates specified:
    (i) By June 1, 1992, award binding contracts to an architectural and 
engineering firm to design and procure the control system needed for 
compliance with the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (ii) By January 1, 1995, initiate on-site construction or 
installation of a control system for the first unit.
    (iii) By May 1, 1997, initiate start-up testing of the control 
system for the first unit.
    (iv) By May 1, 1998, initiate start-up testing of the control system 
for the second unit.
    (v) By February 1, 1999, initiate start-up testing of the control 
system for the third unit.

The interim deadlines will be extended if the owner or operators can 
demonstrate to the Administrator that

[[Page 127]]

compliance with the deadlines in paragraph (d)(6) of this section will 
not be affected.
    (8) Reporting on compliance schedule. Within 30 days after the 
specified date for each deadline in the schedule of compliance 
(paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the owner or operator shall notify 
the Administrator in writing whether the deadline was met. If it was not 
met the notice shall include an explanation why it was not met and the 
steps which shall be taken to ensure future deadlines will be met.
    (9) Exclusion for equipment failure during initial operation. For 
each unit, in determining compliance for the first year that such unit 
is required to meet the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, periods during which one of the following conditions are met 
shall be excluded:
    (i) Equipment or systems do not meet designer's or manufacturer's 
performance expectations.
    (ii) Field installation including engineering or construction 
precludes equipment or systems from performing as designed.

The periods to be excluded shall be determined by the Administrator 
based on the periodic reports of compliance with the emission limitation 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section which shall identify the times 
proposed for exclusion and provide the reasons for the exclusion, 
including the reasons for the control system outage. The report also 
shall describe the actions taken to avoid the outage, to minimize its 
duration, and to reduce SO<INF>2</INF> emissions at the plant to the 
extent practicable while the control system was not fully operational. 
Whenever the time to be excluded exceeds a cumulative total of 30 days 
for any control system for any affected unit, the owner or operators 
shall submit a report within 15 days addressing the history of and 
prognosis for the performance of the control system.
    (10) Exclusion for catastrophic failure. In addition to the 
exclusion of periods allowed in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, any 
periods of emissions from an affected unit for which the Administrator 
finds that the control equipment or system for such unit is out of 
service because of catastrophic failure of the control system which 
occurred for reasons beyond the control of the owner or operators and 
could not have been prevented by good engineering practices will be 
excluded from the compliance determination. Events which are the 
consequence of lack of appropriate maintenance or of intentional or 
negligent conduct or omissions of the owner or operators or the control 
system design, construction, or operating contractors do not constitute 
catastrophic failure.
    (11) Equipment operation. The owner or operator shall optimally 
operate all equipment or systems needed to comply with the requirements 
of this paragraph consistent with good engineering practices to keep 
emissions at or below the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section, and following outages of any control equipment or systems 
the control equipment or system will be returned to full operation as 
expeditiously as practicable.
    (12) Maintenance scheduling. On March 16 of each year starting in 
1993, the owner or operator shall prepare and submit to the 
Administrator a long-term maintenance plan for the Navajo Generating 
Station which accommodates the maintenance requirements for the other 
generating facilities on the Navajo Generating Station grid covering the 
period from March 16 to March 15 of the next year and showing at least 6 
unit-weeks of maintenance for the Navajo Generating Station during the 
November 1 to March 15 period, except as provided in paragraph (d)(13) 
of this section. This plan shall be developed consistent with the 
criteria established by the Western States Coordinating Council of the 
North American Electric Reliability Council to ensure an adequate 
reserve margin of electric generating capacity. At the time that a plan 
is transmitted to the Administrator, the owner or operator shall notify 
the Administrator in writing if less than the full scheduled unit-weeks 
of maintenance were conducted for the period covered by the previous 
plan and shall furnish a written report stating how that year qualified 
for one of the exceptions identified in paragraph (d)(13) of this 
section.

[[Page 128]]

    (13) Exceptions for maintenance scheduling. The owner or operator 
shall conduct a full 6 unit-weeks of maintenance in accordance with the 
plan required in paragraph (d)(12) of this section unless the owner or 
operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a 
full 6 unit-weeks of maintenance during the November 1 to March 15 
period should not be required because of the following:
    (i) There is no need for 6 unit-weeks of scheduled periodic 
maintenance in the year covered by the plan;
    (ii) The reserve margin on any electrical system served by the 
Navajo Generating Station would fall to an inadequate level, as defined 
by the criteria referred to in paragraph (d)(12) of this section.
    (iii) The cost of compliance with this requirement would be 
excessive. The cost of compliance would be excessive when the economic 
savings to the owner or operator of moving maintenance out of the 
November 1 to March 15 period exceeds $50,000 per unit-day of 
maintenance moved.
    (iv) A major forced outage at a unit occurs outside of the November 
1 to March 15 period, and necessary periodic maintenance occurs during 
the period of forced outage.

If the Administrator determines that a full 6 unit-weeks of maintenance 
during the November 1 to March 15 period should not be required, the 
owner or operator shall nevertheless conduct that amount of scheduled 
maintenance that is not precluded by the Administrator. Generally, the 
owner or operator shall make best efforts to conduct as much scheduled 
maintenance as practicable during the November 1 to March 15 period.

Sec. 52.219  Identification of plan--conditional approval.

    The plan revision commitments listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section were submitted on the date specified.
    (a) On November 13, 1992, California submitted a commitment to 
prepare a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) for 
the California ozone nonattainment areas to address the requirement in 
section 182(c)(4)(B) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that requires 
the States to develop a SIP revision for all ozone nonattainment areas 
classified as serious and above to opt-out of the Clean-Fuel Fleet 
Program by submitting for EPA approval a substitute program(s) resulting 
in as much or greater long-term reductions in ozone-producing and toxic 
air emissions. The State submittal contained an interim milestone to 
supply more accurate emission reduction data demonstrating equivalence 
no later than one year after the publication date of the Federal 
Register notice approving the State's committal SIP revision. California 
is required to submit the final SIP revision by May 15, 1994. The State 
held a public meeting on this committal SIP on March 17, 1992. The 
California SIP revisions are met automatically when the SIP revision 
concerns a regulation previously adopted by the Board.

Sec. 52.235  Control strategy for ozone: Oxides of nitrogen.

    EPA is approving an exemption request submitted by the Monterey Bay 
Unified Air Pollution Control District on April 26, 1994 for the 
Monterey Bay ozone nonattainment area from the NO<INF>X</INF> RACT 
requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This 
approval exempts the area from implementing the oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) requirements for reasonably available control 
technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), the related requirements

[[Page 213]]

of general and transportation conformity regulations, and applicable 
inspection and maintenance (I/M). The exemption is based on ambient air 
monitoring data and lasts for only as long as the area's monitoring 
efforts continue to demonstrate attainment without NO<INF>X</INF> 
reductions from major stationary sources.

inconsistent with the Clean Air Act, because the regulations could 
permit violations of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under 
some circumstances. Therefore, the following regulations are 
disapproved:

since the State lacks the authority to require owners or operators of 
stationary sources to install, maintain, and use emission monitoring 
devices and to make periodic reports to the State on the nature and 
amounts of emissions from such stationary sources.
    (b) Delegation of authority: Pursuant to section 114 of the Act, 
Colorado requested a delegation of authority to enable it to require 
sources to install and maintain monitoring equipment and to report 
periodically on the nature and amount of their emissions. The 
Administrator has determined that Colorado is qualified to receive a 
delegation of the authority it requested. Accordingly, the Administrator 
delegates to Colorado his authority under section 114(a)(1)(B) and (C) 
of the Act, i.e., authorityto require sources within the State of 
Colorado to install and maintain monitoring equipment and to report 
periodically on the nature and amount of their emissions.

Sec. 52.376  Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.

    (a) Approval--On January 12, 1993, the Connecticut Department of 
Environmental Protection submitted a revision to the carbon monoxide 
State Implementation Plan for the 1990 base year emission inventory. The 
inventory was submitted by the State of Connecticut to satisfy Federal 
requirements under sections 172(c)(3) and 187(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act 
as amended in 1990, as a revision to the carbon monoxide State 
Implementation Plan for the Hartford/New Britain/Middletown carbon 
monoxide nonattainment area, the New Haven/Meriden/Waterbury carbon 
monoxide nonattainment area, and the Connecticut Portion of the New 
York-N. New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide nonattainment area.
    (b) Approval--On September 30, 1994, the Connecticut Department of 
Environmental Protection submitted a request to redesignate the 
Hartford/New Britain/Middletown Area carbon monoxide nonattainment area 
to attainment for carbon monoxide. As part of the redesignation request, 
the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean 
Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance 
plan include a base year (1993 attainment year) emission inventory for 
carbon monoxide, a demonstration of maintenance of the carbon monoxide 
NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2005 for carbon 
monoxide, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and 
an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 
years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation 
of the carbon monoxide NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), 
Connecticut will implement one or more appropriate contingency 
measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of 
contingency measure includes enhanced motor vehicle inspection and 
maintenance program and implementation of the oxygenated fuels program. 
The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation 
requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 
1990, respectively.
    (c) Approval--On January 12, 1993 and April 7, 1994, the Connecticut 
Department of Environmental Protection submitted revisions to the carbon 
monoxide State Implementation Plan for VMT forecasts, contingency 
measures, and attainment demonstration for CO. These VMT forecasts, 
contingency measures, and attainment demonstration were submitted by 
Connecticut to satisfy Federal requirements under sections 187(a)(2)(A), 
187(a)(3) and 187(a)(7) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, as 
revisions to the carbon monoxide State Implementation Plan.
    (d) Approval--On January 17, 1997, the Connecticut Department of 
Environmental Protection submitted a request to redesignate the New 
Haven/Meriden/Waterbury carbon monoxide nonattainment area to attainment 
for carbon monoxide. As part of the redesignation request, the State 
submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, 
as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan 
include a base year emission inventory for carbon monoxide, a 
demonstration of maintenance of the carbon monoxide NAAQS with projected 
emission inventories to the year 2008 for carbon monoxide, a plan to 
verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to 
submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by 
the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the carbon 
monoxide NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Connecticut will 
implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are 
contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measure 
includes reformulated gasoline and the enhanced motor vehicle inspection 
and maintenance program. The redesignation request establishes a motor 
vehicle emissions budget of 229 tons per day for carbon monoxide to be 
used in determining transportation conformity for the New Haven/Meriden/
Waterbury area. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the 
redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act 
as amended in 1990, respectively.

[[Page 290]]

    (e) Approval--In December, 1996, the Connecticut Department of 
Environmental Protection submitted a revision to the carbon monoxide 
State Implementation Plan for the 1993 periodic emission inventory. The 
inventory was submitted by the State of Connecticut to satisfy Federal 
requirements under section 187(a)(5) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1990, as a revision to the carbon monoxide State Implementation Plan.
    (f) Approval--On May 29, 1998, the Connecticut Department of 
Environmental Protection submitted a request to redesignate the 
Connecticut portion of the New York-N. New Jersey-Long Island carbon 
monoxide nonattainment area to attainment for carbon monoxide. As part 
of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as 
required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of 
the section 175A maintenance plan include a periodic emission inventory 
for carbon monoxide, a demonstration of maintenance of the carbon 
monoxide NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2010 for 
carbon monoxide, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency 
plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision 
in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records an 
exceedance of the carbon monoxide NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the 
State), Connecticut will implement one or more appropriate contingency 
measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of 
contingency measure includes investigating local traffic conditions, the 
enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program, and the low 
emissions vehicles program (LEV). The redesignation request establishes 
a motor vehicle emissions budget of 205 tons per day for carbon monoxide 
to be used in determining transportation conformity in the Connecticut 
Portion of the New York-N. New Jersey-Long Island Area. The 
redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation 
requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 
1990, respectively.
    (g) Approval--On October 7, 1999, the Connecticut Department of 
Environmental Protection submitted a revision to the carbon monoxide 
State Implementation Plan that removes the oxygenated fuel requirement 
for the Connecticut portion of the New York--N. New Jersey--Long Island

the rate of progress requirement of section 182(c)(2) through 1999, and 
the contingency measure requirements of sections 172(c)(9) and 182(c)(9) 
of the Clean Air Act, for the Greater Hartford serious ozone 
nonattainment area, and the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT severe 
ozone nonattainment area.
    (b) Approval--Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted 
by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on September 
16, 1998 and February 8, 2000. The revisions are for the purpose of 
satisfying the attainment demonstration requirements of section 
182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act for the Greater Connecticut serious 
ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes an attainment date of 
November 15, 2007 for the Greater Connecticut serious ozone 
nonattainment area. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions 
budgets for 2007 of 30.0 tons per day of volatile organic compounds 
(VOC) and 79.6 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) to be 
used in transportation conformity in the Greater Connecticut serious 
ozone nonattainment area, until revised budgets pursuant to MOBILE6 are 
submitted and found adequate. In the revision, Connecticut commits to 
revise their VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> transportation conformity budgets 
within one year of the release of MOBILE6. Connecticut also

Sec. 52.472  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves the District of Columbia's plan for the attainment and 
maintenance of the national standards.
    (b) With respect to the transportation control strategies submitted 
on April 19, July 9, and July 16, 1973, the Administrator approves the 
measures for parking surcharge, car pool locator, vehicle inspection, 
express bus lanes, increased bus fleet and service, elimination of free 
parking by private employers, with exceptions set forth in Secs. 52.476, 
52.483, 52.486, and 52.479.

[[Page 325]]

    (c) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves the District of Columbia's plan for the attainment and 
maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air 
Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all 
requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1977.
    (d) Section 710 of title 20 of the District of Columbia Regulations 
is approved with the following condition: Any alternative controls or 
exemptions under section 710.8 approved or granted by the District of 
Columbia are subject to a public notice and public hearing requirements 
and must be submitted to EPA as SIP revisions. Such alternatives or 
exemptions are not effective until approved as SIP revisions by EPA.

    (f) Disapproval of revisions to the District of Columbia State 
Implementation Plan, District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) 
Title 20, Sections 200, 201, 202, 204 and 299, pertaining to permitting 
of sources, and associated definitions in Section 199 submitted on June 
21, 1985 and October 22, 1993 by the Mayor of the District of Columbia 
(1985 submittal) and by the Administrator of the District of Columbia 
Environmental Regulation Administration (1993 submittal). The 
disapproved regulations include those applicable to major new and major 
modified sources wishing to locate in the District. A new source review 
program for such major sources is required under sections 182 and 184 of 
the Clean Air Act. There are many deficiencies in the DCMR permitting 
regulations. Some of these deficiencies are the lack of public notice 
and comment procedures for new and modified sources applying for 
construction permits, the existence of a provision that allows the Mayor 
to grant indefinite 1-month temporary permits to those sources whose 
permits he/she determines have been delayed because of his/her office, 
the inclusion of a major source operating permit program, the inclusion 
of a minor source operating permit program that does not meet Part D 
requirements of the Act, the exemption of certain fuel burning (nitrogen 
oxide emitting) sources, incorrect citations of the Clean Air Act, a 
provision that allows circumvention of the offset requirement, and the 
lack of the de minimis special modification provisions required in 
serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas (section 182(c)(6) of the 
Clean Air Act).

Sec. 52.522  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Florida's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements of Part D, 
Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. 
In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D, for 
the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of 
RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for those sources covered by CTGs 
issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal 
by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources 
covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.

Sec. 52.525  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission 
data is inadequate.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as

[[Page 337]]

specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source 
subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may 
request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make 
public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written 
request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator 
of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature 
and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as 
may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine 
whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission 
limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable 
plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation on April 7, 1980, as 
a revision of the plan does not meet the requirements of Section 110 of 
the Clean Air Act and the requirements of section 51.8 of this chapter,

Sec. 52.528  Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.

    (a) In a letter dated October 10, 1986, the Florida Department of 
Environmental Regulation certified that no emission limits in the 
State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's 
stack height rules.
    (b) The variance granted to the Turkey Point and Port Everglades 
plants of Florida Power and Light Company from the particulate emission 
limits of the plan is disapproved because the relaxed limits would cause 
violation of the Class I increment for sulfur dioxide in the Everglades 
National Park. These plants must meet the 0.1/MMBTU particulate limit 
of the plan.

Sec. 52.530  Significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a) EPA approves the Florida Prevention of Significant Deterioration 
(PSD) rule on condition that the State submit to EPA by December 14, 
1983, a demonstration that its method of calculating increment 
consumption is consistent with Federal law and regulations. After 
receipt of the submittal

[[Page 338]]

and consideration of additional comments, EPA will, if it finds the 
State's method to be consistent, fully approve the Florida plan. If not, 
the State will change its regulation to implement EPA's approach.
    (b) Pending final full approval of the State's PSD plan by EPA, if a 
source's application can be approved under Florida's rules, but not 
under EPA's rules, solely because of the different methods of 
calculating increment consumption, the source must obtain a PSD permit 
from EPA before beginning construction.
    (c) All applications and other information required pursuant to 
Sec. 52.21 of this part from sources located in the State of Florida 
shall be submitted to the Florida Department of Environmental 
Regulation, Bureau of Air Quality Management, Twin Towers Office 
Building, 2600 Blair Stone Road, Tallahassee, Florida 32301.
    (d) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the CAA are not 
met since the Florida plan, as submitted, does not apply to certain 
sources. Therefore, the provisions of Sec. 52.21(b) through (w) are 
hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of the Florida plan 
for:
    (1) Sources proposing to locate on Indian reservations in Florida; 
and
    (2) Permits issued by EPA prior to approval of the Florida PSD rule.

required by Sec. 52.12(c)(1) of this part, EPA test methods (found at 40 
CFR part 60) will be used by EPA to determine compliance with the 
following emission limiting standards:
    (a) Particulate emissions from citrus plants controlled by a 
scrubber and subject to the process weight table (submitted as 17-
2.05(2) and reformatted as 17-2.610(1)1.a).

Sec. 52.572  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Georgia's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements of Part D, 
Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below.

[44 FR 54050, Sept. 18, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 52.573  Control strategy: General.

    The generic rules and procedures for emission trades (bubbles), 
submitted on October 27, 1982, by the Georgia Department of Natural 
Resources, are disapproved because they do not meet the requirements of 
the Clean Air Act.

Sec. 52.576  Compliance schedules.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) The extended compliance schedule for the General Motors Lakewood 
Assembly Plant submitted on July 30, 1982, is disapproved because the 
State has failed to show that the schedule would not interfere with the 
attainment of the ozone standard in the Atlanta nonattainment area.

Sec. 52.578  Control Strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.

    In a letter dated March 26, 1987, the Georgia Department of Natural

<R05>
Sec. 52.579  Economic feasibility considerations.

    Section 88-906(h), (i), (k), (o) and (q) of the Georgia Code is 
disapproved, since consideration of economic feasibility could, in some 
cases, conflict, with the requirements of the Act that primary standards 
be attained as expeditiously as practicable, but in no case later than 
July 1975.

Sec. 52.623  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Hawaii's plan for attainment and maintenance of the national 
standards. The State included various provisions in its plan to provide 
for the attainment of State ambient air quality standards. As described 
in the Governor's letters of January 28, May 8, and May 22, 1972, these 
provisions were included for information purposes only and were not to 
be considered a part of the plan to

[[Page 360]]

implement national standards. Accordingly, these additional provisions 
are not considered a part of the applicable plan.

Sec. 52.624  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission 
data is inadequate.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 52.625  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, 
since sections 322-64(5) and 322-66 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes 
could, in some circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data 
to the public. Therefore, sections 322-64(5) and 322-66 are disapproved.

Sec. 52.675  Control strategy: Sulfur oxides--Eastern Idaho Intrastate Air Quality Control Region.

    (a)(1) Regulation R of the Rules and Regulations for the Control of 
Air Pollution in Idaho, which is part of the sulfur dioxide 
(SO<INF>2</INF>) control strategy, is disapproved since it is 
inconsistent with the purposes and provisions of subpart G of this 
chapter. These requirements are not met by Regulation R in that the 
SO<INF>2</INF> control strategy contained therein is not adequate for 
the attainment and maintenance of SO<INF>2</INF> national ambient air 
quality standards (NAAQS).
    (2) Rules 1-1801 through 1-1804 (Rules for Control of Sulfur Oxide 
Emissions from Sulfuric Acid Plants) of the ``Rules and Regulations for 
the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho'' are inadequate to ensure 
attainment and maintenance of Sulfur Dioxide National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards in the Eastern Idaho Intrastate Air Quality Control 
Region. Special limits have previously been established for certain 
existing acid plants in this Air Quality Control Region 
(Secs. 52.670(c)(15) and 52.675(b)). Therefore, Rules 1-1801 through 1-
1804 are approved except as they apply to existing acid plants with 
approved or promulgated emission limits that are more stringent than the 
limit found in 1-1802.
    (b) Regulation for control of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) 
emissions: Sulfuric Acid Plants. (1) The provisions of this paragraph 
shall apply to the owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot 
Company's Minerals and Chemical Division, located in Power County, 
Idaho, in the Eastern Idaho Intrastate Air Quality Control Region.
    (2) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company 
facility shall utilize best engineering techniques in the operation of

but are not limited to:
    (i) Operating and maintaining all conducts, flues, and stacks in a 
leakfree condition.
    (ii) Operating and maintaining all process equipment and gas 
collection systems in such a fashion that leakage of SO<INF>2</INF> 
gases will be prevented to the maximum extent possible.
    (3) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company 
facility shall limit SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from their sulfuric acid 
plants per the following:
    (i) The combined SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the designated 100 
and 200 sulfric acid plants shall not exceed 2 kilograms (kg) per metric 
ton (4 pounds per ton) of 100 percent sulfuric acid produced.
    (ii) The SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the designated 300 sulfuric 
acid plant and stack shall not exceed 994 kg per hour (2190 pounds per 
hour).
    (4) (i) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company 
shall achieve compliance with the requirements specified in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section in accordance with the following

schedules for pollution abatement projects within 30 days of the 
effective date of this regulation.
    (B) Attain final compliance by July 31, 1976.
    (ii) A performance test of the 300 acid plant shall be necessary to 
determine whether compliance has been achieved with the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Such test must be completed within 15 
days of the final compliance date specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of 
this section. Notice must be given to the Administrator at least 10 days 
prior to such a test to afford him an opportunity to have an observer 
present.
    (iii) Within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at 
which the 100 and 200 acid plant will be operated, but not later than 
180 days after initial start-up of these plants and at such other times 
as may be required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Clean 
Air Act, the owner(s) and operator(s) of the facility shall conduct 
performance test(s) in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.8.
    (iv) If the owner(s) and operator(s) of the J. R. Simplot Company 
facility are

[[Page 367]]

presently in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section or in compliance with a portion of these 
requirements, such compliance shall be certified to the Administrator

    (B) Continuously monitoring and recording gas volumetric flow rates 
in the exhaust stack of the designated 300 sulfuric acid plant.
    (ii) By no later than October 30, 1976, and at such other times 
following that date as the Administrator may specify, the SO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration measurement system(s) and stack gas volumetric flow rate 
system(s) installed and used pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
demonstrated to meet the measurement system performance specifications 
prescribed in 40 CFR 60.13 and Appendix E to this part, respectively. 
The Administrator shall be notified at least 10 days prior to the start 
of this field test period to afford the Administrator the opportunity to 
have an observer present.
    (iii) The sampling point for monitoring the concentration of 
SO<INF>2</INF> emissions shall be in the duct at the centroid of the 
cross section of the discharge stack if the cross sectional area is less 
than 4.65 m<SUP> 2</SUP> (50 ft<SUP> 2</SUP>) or at a point no closer to 
the wall than 0.91 m (3 ft) if the cross sectional area is 4.65 
m<SUP> 2</SUP> (50 ft<SUP> 2</SUP>) or more. The monitor sample point 
shall be representative of the average concentration in the duct.
    (iv) The measurement system(s) shall be maintained, operated and

emission rates expressed in kg SO<INF>2</INF> per hour shall be 
calculated. The results of these calculations for each month shall be 
submitted to the Administrator within 15 days following the end of each 
month. Such submission shall identify each period of excess emissions 
that occurred and the nature and cause of any malfunction (if known), 
the corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted. The 
records of such measurements including strip charts and other 
appropriate raw data shall be retained for a minimum of two years 
following the date of such measurements.
    (vi) The continuous monitoring and recordkeeping requirements of 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section shall become applicable September 30, 
1976.
    (6)(i) Compliance with the requirements set forth in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section shall be determined using the emission rates 
measured by the continuous measurement system(s) installed, calibrated, 
maintained and operated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section.
    (ii) At the Administrator's discretion, compliance may also be 
determined using the manual source test methods per 40 CFR 60.85 and 
Appendix A to part 60 of this title. Emission rates for each stack shall 
be expressed in units consistent with those in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (iii) A violation of the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section shall

[[Page 368]]

occur whenever the SO<INF>2</INF> emission rates determined according to 
paragraph (b)(6)(i) or (b)(6)(ii) of this section exceed the 
corresponding SO<INF>2</INF> emission rates specified in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section.
    (7) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company 
facility shall by September 30, 1976, install, calibrate, maintain and

Sec. 52.676  Control strategy: Particulate matter.

    Revocation of PM-10 NAAQS--On July 24, 1998, the State of Idaho 
submitted a request that EPA determine that the PM-10 NAAQS in effect as 
of September 16, 1997, no longer apply to the Northern Ada County/Boise 
area and to revoke the nonattainment designation associated with that 
NAAQS. The State has satisfied the requirements of the Clean Air Act as 
well as 40 CFR 50.6(d) and Guideline for Implementing the 1-Hour Ozone 
and Pre-Existing PM-10 NAAQS dated December 29, 1997. (A copy of the 
guidance document may be found on the World Wide Web site at the 
following URL: http://www.epa.gov/ttncaaa1/1pgm.html). Therefore, EPA 
revokes the pre-existing NAAQS for particulate matter as delineated in 
40 CFR 50.6. The revised NAAQS for particulate matter in 40 CFR 50.7 
remain in effect.

    (105) On February 7, 1994, the State submitted revisions intended to 
create a permit program for small sources. The purpose of these 
revisions is to lessen the permitting burden on small sources and the 
permitting authority by reducing the frequency and/or the requirement of 
operating permit renewal for sources emitting a total of less than 25 
tons per year of regulated air pollutants. A permit obtained through 
these procedures is intended to continue as a legally binding State 
document until the source modifies its operations, withdraws its permit 
or becomes subject to a new applicable requirement. At that time, the 
State will determine whether the small source procedures continue to be 
appropriate and issue a revised small source permit or direct the source 
in following the correct permit procedures. Since small source permits 
are not subject to a public comment period or review by USEPA, they are 
not federally enforceable and cannot be used to limit sources' potential 
to emit and thereby exempt them from the requirements of the title v 
operating permit program.

Sec. 52.722  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approved Illinois' plan for the attainment and maintenance of the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards under section 110 of the Clean 
Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plan satisfies all 
requirements of part D, title I of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, 
except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the 
requirements of part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the 
adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980, for the 
sources covered by CTGs between January 1978 and January 1979 and 
adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT 
requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) The Administrator finds that the transportation control plans 
for the East St. Louis and Chicago areas submitted on December 3, 1982, 
satisfy the related requirements of part D, title I of the Clean Air 
Act, as amended in 1977.
    (c) The Administrator finds that the carbon monoxide control 
strategy submitted on May 4, 1983, satisfies all requirements of part D, 
title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, except for section 
172(b)(6).

Sec. 52.724  Control strategy: Sulfur dioxide.

    (a) Part D--Conditional Approval--The Illinois plan is approved 
provided that the following condition is satisfied:
    (1) The plan includes a reanalysis of the Pekin, Illinois area, a 
submittal of the analysis results to USEPA, the proposal of any 
additional regulations to the Illinois Pollution Control Board necessary 
to insure attainment and maintenance of the sulfur dioxide standard, and 
the promulgation of any necessary regulations. The State must complete 
the reanalysis, submit the results to USEPA and submit any necessary, 
additional regulations to the Illinois Pollution Control Board by 
September 30, 1980. Any necessary regulation must be finally promulgated 
by the State and submitted to USEPA by September 30, 1981.

[[Page 404]]

    (2) Extension of Condition--USEPA approves the date of July 1, 1984 
for submitting the draft sulfur dioxide rule revisions and supporting 
documentation as required in (a)(1) for Peoria, Hollis and Groveland 
Townships in Illinois. The State must complete final rule adoption as 
expeditiously as possible but no later than December 31, 1985.
    (b) Part D--Disapproval--USEPA disapproves Rules 204(c)(1)(B), Rule 
204(c)(1)(C), Rule 204(e)(1) and Rule 204(e)(2) for those sources for 
which these rules represent a relaxation of the federally enforceable 
State Implementation Plan. Rule 204(c)(1)(B), Rule 204(c)(1)(C), Rule 
204(e)(1) and Rule 204(e)(2) are approved as not representing 
relaxations of the State Implementation Plan for the following sources:

   Sources of 10 Million Btu per Hour or More Not Increasing Allowable Sulfur Dioxide Emissions as a Result of
 Record Rules 204(c) and 204(e) Because New Allowable Emissions Rate is Same as or Less Than Old Allowable Rate

This disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth 
restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(1).
    (c) Disapproval--USEPA disapproves Rule 204(e)(4) as not being 
adequate to protect the NAAQS. This disapproval does not in and of 
itself result in the growth restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(I).
    (d) Disapproval--USEPA disapproves Rule 204(f)(1)(D) as completely 
deregulating SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from existing processes without 
providing an assessment of the ambient air quality impact or a showing 
that increasing the allowable emissions from these sources will not 
cause or contribute to violations of the NAAQS or PSD increments. This 
disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions 
of section 110(a)(2)(I).
    (e) Disapproval--USEPA disapproves Rule 204(h) for those sources for 
which USEPA has disapproved rules 204(c) and 204(e). This disapproval 
does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 
110(a)(2)(I).
    (f) Approval--USEPA approves rule 204(e)(3) for those sources able 
to show that the proposed emission rate will not cause or contribute to 
a violation of the NAAQS. The State must submit these emission 
limitations, along with the technical support to USEPA for approval.

[[Page 405]]

    (g) Part D--Approval--The State plan for Alton Township, Madison 
County, which consists of a federally Enforceable State Operating Permit 
controlling sulfur dioxide emissions from the boilers and reheat 
furnaces at Laclede Steel, which was submitted on November 18, 1993, is 
approved.
    (h) Approval--On November 10, 1994, the Illinois Environmental 
Protection Agency submitted a sulfur dioxide redesignation request and 
maintenance plan for Peoria and Hollis Townships in Peoria County and 
Groveland Township in Tazewell County to redesignate the townships to 
attainment for sulfur dioxide. The redesignation request and maintenance 
plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(d) of the 
Clean Air Act (Act) as amended in 1990.

<R05>
Sec. 52.725  Control strategy: Particulates.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Part D--Disapproval. (1) U.S. EPA disapproves the provisions of 
Rule 203(f) which allow the use of an equivalent method without review 
and approval of that method. Any source subject to Rule 203(f) which 
chooses to use an equivalent method must have that equivalent method 
submitted to U.S. EPA and approved as a SIP revision.
    (2) U.S. EPA disapproves the following portions of Rule 203(d)(5) 
which regulate the control of particulate matter from specific sources 
within the iron and steel industry: Rule 205(d)(5)(B)(ii), Rule 
205(d)(5)(B)(iii), Rule 205(d)(5)(D), and Rule 205(d)(5)(K).
    (3) USEPA disapproves a proposed SIP revision submitted by the State 
on May 12, 1982, in the form of a May 18, 1981 Consent Decree (Civil 
Action 81-3009) to which USEPA, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency 
and National Steel Corporation are parties and a draft Alternative 
Control Strategy Permit. This submission was modified by the State, 
September 30, 1982, with the submission of a separate document embodying 
the elements of the Alternative Control Strategy. This separate document 
was intended to become an enforceable part of the SIP.
    (c) Approval--On September 28, 1988, the State of Illinois submitted 
a committal SIP for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 
equal to or less than 10 micrometers (PM<INF>10</INF>) for the Illinois 
Group II areas of concern in DuPage, Will, Rock Island, Macon, Randolph, 
and St. Clair Counties. The committal SIP contains all the requirements 
identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the SIP requirements for 
PM<INF>10</INF> at 52 FR 24681.
    (d) Approval--On June 2, 1995, and January 9, 1996, the State of 
Illinois submitted a maintenance plan for the particulate matter 
nonattainment portion of LaSalle County, and requested that it be 
redesignated to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard 
for particulate matter. The redesignation request and maintenance plan 
satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
    (e) Approval--On March 19, 1996, and October 15, 1996, Illinois 
submitted requests to redesignate the Granite City Particulate Matter 
(PM) nonattainment area to attainment status for the PM National Ambient 
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), as well as a maintenance plan for the 
Granite City area to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS. The 
redesignation request and maintenance plan satisfy all applicable 
requirements of the Clean Air Act.
    (f) On November 14, 1995, May 9, 1996, and June 14, 1996, the State 
of Illinois submitted State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision requests 
to meet commitments related to the conditional approval of Illinois' May 
15, 1992, SIP submittal for the Lake Calumet (SE Chicago), McCook, and 
Granite City, Illinois, Particulate Matter (PM) nonattainment areas. The 
EPA is approving the SIP revision request as it applies to the McCook PM 
nonattainment area. For the McCook PM nonattainment area, all of the 
deficiencies of the May 15, 1992, submittal have been corrected.
    (g) Approval--On May 5, 1992, November 14, 1995, May 9, 1996, June 
14, 1996, February 3, 1997, October 16, 1997, October 21, 1997, February 
1, 1999, and May 19, 1999, Illinois submitted SIP revision requests to 
meet the Part D particulate matter (PM) nonattainment plan requirements 
for the Lake Calumet,

[[Page 406]]

Granite City and McCook moderate PM nonattainment areas. The submittals 
include federally enforceable construction permit, application number 
93040047, issued on January 11, 1999, to Acme Steel Company. The part D 
plans for these areas are approved.

<R05>
Sec. 52.726  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) Part D--Conditional Approval--The Illinois plan is approved 
provided that the following conditions are satisfied:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) The State conducts a study to demonstrate that the 75 percent 
overall control efficiency requirement in Rule 205(n) represents RACT, 
submits the results of the study to USEPA, and submits any necessary 
regulations representing RACT to the Illinois Pollution Control Board. 
The State must comply with these conditions by February 28, 1981. Any 
necessary regulations must be finally promulgated by the State and 
submitted to USEPA by February 28, 1982.
    (3) Extension of Condition--USEPA approves the date of July 31, 1984 
for the State of Illinois to satisfy the condition of approval to the 
ozone State Implementation Plan listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (b) Disapproval--USEPA disapproves the compliance schedule in Rule 
205(j) as it applies to loading rack controls for all emission sources 
subject to Rule 205(b)(1), as approved by USEPA on May 31, 1972 which 
were required to be in compliance by December 31, 1973. This disapproval 
does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 
110(a)(2)(I).
    (c) Negative Declarations--Stationary Source Categories. The State 
of Illinois has certified to the satisfaction of USEPA that no sources 
are located in the nonattainment areas of the State which are covered by 
the following Control Technique Guidelines:
    (1) High density polyethylene and polypropylene manufacturers.
    (2) Vegetable oil processing sources with volatile organic compound 
emissions equal to or greater than 100 tons per year.
    (d) Part D Disapproval--The Administrator finds that Illinois' ozone 
plan for Cook, Lake, DuPage and Kane Counties, which was required to be 
submitted by July 1, 1982, does not satisfy all the requirements of Part 
D, Title I of the Clean Air Act and, thus, is disapproved. No major new 
stationary source, of major modification of a stationary source, or 
volatile organic compounds may be constructed in Cook, Lake, DuPage or 
Kane Counties, unless the construction permit application is complete on 
or before November 16, 1988. This disapproval does not affect USEPA's 
approval (or conditional approval) of individual parts of Illinois' 
ozone plan, and they remain approved.
    (e) Disapproval--The Administrator finds that the following State 
rules have not been demonstrated to be consistent with the reasonably 
available control technology requirements of section 172 of the Clean 
Air Act, as amended in 1977, and thus, are disapproved: subpart F, 
section 215.204(c); subpart F, section 215.206(b); subpart F, section 
215.204(j)(4); subpart I; subpart AA; subpart PP; subpart QQ; subpart 
RR; subpart A, section 215.102; subpart T; subpart H, section 215.245; 
subpart F, section 215.207; and subpart A, section 215.107, all of title 
35; Environmental Protection; subtitle B: Air Pollution; Chapter 1: 
Pollution Control Board of the Illinois Administrative Code (June 1989).
    (f) On September 30, 1992, the State submitted rules regulating 
volatile organic compound emissions from gasoline dispensing facilities' 
motor vehicle fuel operations (Stage II vapor recovery rules) in the 
Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The Illinois Environmental Protection 
Agency Bureau of Air must as part of the program conduct inspections of 
facilities subject to this rule to ensure compliance with the applicable 
rules. These inspections will be conducted on an annual basis or an 
alternative schedule as approved in the USEPA Fiscal Year Inspection 
Program Plan.

[[Page 407]]

    (g) Approval--The Administrator approves the incorporation of the 
photochemical assessment ambient monitoring system submitted by Illinois 
on November 4, 1993, into the Illinois State Implementation Plan. This 
submittal satisfies 40 CFR 58.20(f) which requires the State to provide 
for the establishment and maintenance of photochemical assessment 
monitoring stations (PAMS) by November 12, 1993.
    (h) Approval--On November 12, 1993, the Illinois Environmental 
Protection Agency submitted an ozone redesignation request and 
maintenance plan for Jersey County ozone nonattainment area and 
requested that Jersey County be redesignated to attainment for ozone. 
The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation 
requirements in section 107(d)(3)(d) of the Act. The redesignation meets 
the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a 
revision to the Illinois ozone State Implementation Plan for Jersey 
County.
    (i) The base year (1990) ozone emission inventory requirement of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been 
satisfied for the following Illinois ozone nonattainment areas: the 
Chicago nonattainment area--Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Will and McHenry 
Counties, Aux Sable and Gooselake Townships in Grundy County, and Oswego 
Township in Kendall County; the Metro-East St. Louis nonattainment 
area--Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair Counties; and Jersey County.
    (j) Approval--On July 14, 1994, Illinois submitted two of three 
elements required by section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Amendments of 
1990 to be incorporated as part of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) 
State Implementation Plan intended to offset any growth in emissions 
from a growth in vehicle miles traveled. These elements are the 
offsetting of growth in emissions attributable to growth in VMT which 
was due November 15, 1992, and, transportation control measures (TCMs) 
required as part of Illinois' 15 percent reasonable further progress 
(RFP) plan which was due November 15, 1993. Illinois satisfied the first 
requirement by projecting emissions from mobile sources and 
demonstrating that no increase in emissions would take place. Illinois 
satisfied the second requirement by submitting the TCMs listed in Table 
1 which are now approved into the Illinois SIP.

    (k) Approval--EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new 
source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general 
conformity exemptions for the Illinois portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake 
County severe ozone nonattainment area as requested by the States of 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. 
This approval does not cover the exemption of NO<INF>X</INF> 
transportation conformity requirements of section 176(c) for this area. 
Approval of these exemptions is contingent on the results of the final 
ozone attainment demonstration expected to be submitted in mid-1997. The 
approval will be modified if the final attainment demonstration 
demonstrates that NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls are needed in the 
nonattainment area to attain the ozone standard in the Lake Michigan 
Ozone Study modeling domain.
    (l) Approval--The United States Environmental Protection Agency is 
approving under section 182(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act the exemption of 
the Chicago severe, ozone nonattainment area from the build/no-build and 
less than-1990 interim transportation conformity oxides of nitrogen 
requirements as requested by the State of Illinois in a June 20, 1995 
submittal. In light of the modeling completed thus far and considering 
the importance of the OTAG process and attainment plan modeling efforts, 
USEPA grants this NO<INF>X</INF> waiver on a contingent basis. As the 
OTAG modeling results and control recommendations are completed in 1996, 
this information will be incorporated into attainment plans being 
developed by the LADCO States. When these attainment plans are submitted 
to USEPA in mid-1997, these new modeling analyses will be reviewed to 
determine if the NO<INF>X</INF> waiver should be continued, altered, or 
removed. USEPA's rulemaking action to reconsider the initial 
NO<INF>X</INF> waiver may occur simultaneously with rulemaking action on 
the attainment plans. The

[[Page 410]]

USEPA also reserves the right to require NO<INF>X</INF> emission 
controls for transportation sources under section 110(a)(2)(D) of the 
Act if future ozone modeling demonstrates that such controls are needed 
to achieve the ozone standard in downwind areas. The Chicago severe 
ozone nonattainment area includes the Counties of Cook, DuPage, Grundy 
(Aux Sable and Gooselake Townships), Kane, Kendall (Oswego Township), 
Lake, McHenry, and Will.
    (m) [Reserved]
    (n) Negative declaration-- Shipbuilding and ship repair industry. On 
October 11, 1996, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction of 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources 
categorized as part of the shipbuilding and ship repair industry are 
located in the Chicago, Illinois ozone nonattainment area which is 
comprised of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will Counties and Aux 
Sable and Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County and Oswego Township in 
Kendall County or the Metro-East, Illinois ozone nonattainment area 
which is comprised of Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair Counties.
    (o) Negative declaration-- Aerospace manufacturing and rework 
industry. On October 11, 1996, the State of Illinois certified to the 
satisfaction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that 
no major sources categorized as part of the Aerospace Manufacturing and 
Rework Industry are located in the Chicago, Illinois ozone nonattainment 
area which is comprised of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will 
Counties and Aux Sable and Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County and 
Oswego Township in Kendall County or the Metro-East, Illinois ozone 
nonattainment area which is comprised of Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair 
Counties.
    (p) Approval--On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted 15 percent 
rate-of-progress and 3 percent contingency plans for the Chicago ozone 
nonattainment area as a requested revision to the Illinois State 
Implementation Plan. These plans satisfy sections 182(b)(1), 172(c)(9), 
and 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990.
    (q) Approval--On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted 15 percent 
rate-of-progress and 3 percent contingency plans for the Metro-East St. 
Louis ozone nonattainment area as a requested revision to the Illinois 
State Implementation Plan. These plans satisfy sections 182(b)(1) and 
172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990.
    (r) Approval--On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted the following 
transportation control measures as part of the 15 percent rate-of-
progress and 3 percent contingency plans for the Metro-East ozone 
nonattainment area: Work trip reductions; transit improvements; and 
traffic flow improvements.
    (s) On October 10, 1997, Illinois submitted a site-specific revision 
to the State Implementation Plan, in the form of a letter from Bharat 
Mathur, Chief, Bureau of Air, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. 
This October 10, 1997, letter requests a change in regulatory status for 
Riverside Laboratories, Inc.'s Kane County facility, to reflect that the 
Federal site-specific rule for Riverside (40 CFR 52.741(e)(10)) has been 
superseded by the State of Illinois regulations, including the emission 
limits in 35 Illinois Administrative Code 218.204(c) and the associated 
control requirements, test methods and recordkeeping requirements in 
Part 218 and the associated definitions in part 211. These State 
regulations shall become the federally approved regulations applicable 
to Riverside on August 31, 1998. The site-specific rule, applicable to 
Riverside, promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency on August 
21, 1995 (40 CFR 52.741(e)(10)), remains in effect and is enforceable 
after August 31, 1998 for the period before August 31, 1998.
    (t) The Illinois volatile organic compound (VOC) rules that apply to 
the Stepan Company Millsdale Plant for volatile organic liquid storage 
(35 Ill. Admin. Code Part 218, Subpart B), batch processing (35 Ill. 
Admin. Code Parts 218 and 219, Subpart V) and continuous reactor and 
distillation processes (35 Ill. Admin. Code Part 218, Subpart Q) were 
approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) on 
August 8, 1996, April 2, 1996, and June 17, 1997, respectively. Because 
these rules have been

[[Page 411]]

approved into the State Implementation Plan and represent reasonably 
available control technology for VOC, USEPA revokes the June 29, 1990 
Federal Implementation Plan as it applies to Stepan and replaces it with 
Illinois' volatile organic liquid storage, batch process, and continuous 
reactor and distillation process rules.
    (u) Negative declaration--Industrial wastewater category. On October 
2, 1998, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction of the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources 
categorized as part of the Industrial wastewater category are located in 
the Metro-East ozone nonattainment area (Metro-East). The Metro-East 
area is comprised of Madison, Monroe and St. Clair Counties which are 
located in southwest Illinois, adjacent to St. Louis, Missouri.
    (v) Negative declaration--Industrial cleaning solvents category. On 
October 2, 1998, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction of 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources 
categorized as part of the Industrial cleaning solvents category are 
located in the Metro-East ozone nonattainment area (Metro-East). The 
Metro-East area is comprised of Madison, Monroe and St. Clair Counties 
which are located in southwest Illinois, adjacent to St. Louis, 
Missouri.
    (w) Approval--On December 18, 1997, December 17, 1999, January 14, 
2000, and January 21, 2000, Illinois submitted a post-1996 Rate Of 
Progress Plan for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area as a requested 
revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan. This plan reduces 
ozone precursor emissions by 9 percent from 1990 baseline emissions by 
November 15, 1999. This plan also supports a mobile source emissions 
budget of 279.3 tons/day of volatile organic compounds for 
transportation conformity purposes.
    (x) Approval--On December 18, 1997, Illinois submitted a contingency 
measure plan as part of the Chicago Area post-1996 Rate of Progress 
Plan. This plan reduces volatile organic compound emissions in the 
Chicago ozone nonattainment area by 3 percent from 1990 baseline 
emissions by November 15, 1999.
    (y) Approval--On December 18, 1997, Illinois submitted 
Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) as part of the post-1996 Rate Of 
Progress Plan for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The TCMs being 
approved are listed in the following documents published by the Chicago 
Area Transportation Study: ``Transportation Control Measures 
Contribution to the Post-1996 Rate-Of-Progress State Implementation 
Plan,'' March 22, 1996; ``Transportation Control Measures Contribution 
to the 9 percent Control Strategy State Implementation Plan,'' June 11, 
1998; and ``1999 Transportation Control Measures Contribution to the 9 
percent Rate of Progress Control Strategy State Implementation Plan,'' 
December 9, 1999.
    (z) Negative declaration--Industrial cleaning solvents category. On 
December 23, 1999, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction 
of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major 
sources categorized as part of the industrial cleaning solvents category 
are located in the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The Chicago ozone 
nonattainment area includes Cook County, DuPage County, Aux Sable and 
Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County, Kane County, Oswego Township in 
Kendall County, Lake County, McHenry County and Will County.
    (aa) Negative declaration--Industrial wastewater category. On 
December 23, 1999, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction 
of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major 
sources categorized as part of the Industrial Wastewater Category are 
located in the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The Chicago ozone 
nonattainment area includes Cook County, DuPage County, Aux Sable and 
Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County, Kane County, Oswego Township in 
Kendall County, Lake County, McHenry County and Will County.
    (bb) Approval--Revisions to the SIP submitted by Illinois on 
November 15, 1999; February 10, 2000; April 13, 2001; and April 30, 
2001. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the attainment 
demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Act for the

[[Page 412]]

Metro-East St. Louis area. The revision establishes an attainment date 
of November 15, 2004, for the St. Louis moderate ozone nonattainment 
area. This revision establishes MVEBs for 2004 of 26.62 TPD of VOC and 
35.52 TPD of NO<INF>X</INF> to be used in transportation conformity in 
the Metro-East St. Louis area until revised budgets pursuant to MOBILE6 
are submitted and found adequate. In the revision, Illinois commits to 
revise its VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> transportation conformity budgets 
within two years of the release of MOBILE6. No conformity determinations 
will be made during the second year following the release of MOBILE6 
unless and until the MVEBs have been recalculated using MOBILE6 and 
found adequate by EPA. EPA is granting a waiver for the Metro East St. 
Louis area to the state of Illinois from the NO<INF>X</INF> RACT 
requirements of the Act and disapproving the request for a waiver from 
the NO<INF>X</INF> NSR and NO<INF>X</INF> general conformity 
requirements. EPA is finding that the Contingency Measures identified by 
Illinois are adequate to meet the requirements of the Act. EPA finds 
that the Illinois SIP meets the requirements pertaining to RACM under 
the Act for the Metro-East St. Louis area.

The requirements of paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this section shall 
apply to all VOM emitting processes employing capture equipment (e.g., 
hoods, ducts), except those cases noted below.
    (1) If a source installs a permanent total enclosure (PTE) that 
meets USEPA specifications, and which directs all VOM to a control 
device, then the source is exempted from the requirements described in 
paragraph (B). The USEPA specifications to determine whether a strucutre 
is considered a PTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of this 
section. In this instance, the capture efficiency is assumed to be 100 
percent and the source is still required to measure control efficiency 
using appropriate test methods as specified in (a)(4)(iv) of this 
section.
    (2) If a source uses a control device designed to collect and 
recover VOM (e.g., carbon adsorber), an explicit measurement of capture 
efficiency is not necessary provided that the conditions given below are 
met. The overall control of the system can be determined by directly 
comparing the input liquid VOM to the recovered liquid VOM. The general 
procedure for use in this situation is given in 40 CFR 60.433, with the 
following additional restrictions:
    (i) The source must be able to equate solvent usage with solvent 
recovery on a 24-hour (daily) basis, rather than a 30-day weighted 
average, within 72 hours following the 24-hour period. In addition, one 
of the following two criteria must be met:
    (ii) The solvent recovery system (i.e., capture and control system) 
must be dedicated to a single process line (e.g., one process line 
venting to a carbon adsorber system), or
    (iii) If the solvent recovery system controls multiple process 
lines, then the source must be able to demonstrate that the overall 
control (i.e., the total recovered solvent VOM divided by the sum of 
liquid VOM input to all process lines venting to the control system) 
meets or exceeds the most stringent standard applicable for any process 
line venting to the control system.
    (B) Specific requirements. The capture efficiency of a process line 
shall be measured using one of the four protocols given below. Any error 
margin associated with a test protocol may not be incorporated into the 
results of a capture efficiency test. If these techniques are not 
suitable for a particular process, then the source must present an 
alternative capture efficiency protocol and obtain approval for it by 
the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revisions.
    (1) Gas/gas method using temporary total enclosure (TTE). The USEPA 
specifications to determine whether a temporary enclosure is considered 
a TTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of this section. The

    (3) Gas/gas method using the building or room (building or room 
enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and 
in which ``F'' and ``G'' are measured while operating only the affected 
facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated 
as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation 
to be used for this protocol is:

CE = G / (G + F<INF>B</INF>)

Where:

CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
G=mass of VOM captured and delivered to control device.
F<INF>B</INF>=mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from building enclosure.


Procedure G.2 contained in appendix B of this section is used to obtain 
G. Procedure F.2 in appendix B of this section is used to obtain 
F<INF>B</INF>.
    (4) Liquid/gas method using the building or room (building or room 
enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and 
in which ``F'' and ``L'' are measured while operating only the affected 
facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated 
as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation 
to be used for this protocol is:

CE = (L - F<INF>B</INF>) / L

Where:

CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
L=mass of liquid VOM input to process.
F<INF>B</INF>=mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from building enclosure.

maintain a copy of the capture efficiency protocol submitted to USEPA on 
file. All results of the appropriate test methods and capture efficiency 
protocols must be reported to USEPA within sixty (60) days of the test 
date. A copy of the results must be kept on file with the source for a 
period of three (3) years.
    (2) If any changes are made to capture or control equipment, then 
the source is required to notify USEPA of these changes and a new test 
may be required by USEPA.
    (3) The source must notify the Administrator 30 days prior to 
performing any capture efficiency or control test. At that time, the 
source must notify the Administrator which capture efficiency protocol 
and control device test methods will be used.
    (4) Sources utilizing a PTE must demonstrate that this enclosure 
meets the requirement given in Procedure T (in appendix B of this 
section) for a PTE during any testing of their control device.
    (5) Sources utilizing a TTE must demonstrate that their TTE meets 
the requirements given in Procedure T (in appendix B of this section) 
for a TTE during testing of their control device. The source must also 
provide documentation that the quality assurance criteria for a TTE have 
been achieved.

control device efficiency shall be determined by simultaneously 
measuring the inlet and outlet gas phase VOM concentrations and gas 
volumetric flow rates in accordance with the gas phase test methods 
specified in paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section.
    (B) Any owner or operator that uses an afterburner or carbon 
adsorber to comply with any paragraph of Sec. 52.741 shall use USEPA 
approved continuous monitoring equipment which is installed, calibrated, 
maintained, and operated according to vendor specifications at all times 
the afterburner or carbon adsorber is in use. The continuous monitoring 
equipment must monitor the following parameters:
    (1) Combustion chamber temperature of each afterburner.
    (2) Temperature rise across each catalytic afterburner bed or VOM 
concentration of exhaust.
    (3) The VOM concentration of each carbon adsorption bed exhaust.

[[Page 433]]

control system shall be determined as the product of the capture system 
efficiency and the control device efficiency or by the liquid/liquid 
test protocol as specified in 40 CFR 60.433 (and revised by paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii)(A)(2) of this section for each solvent recovery system. In 
those cases in which the overall efficiency is being determined for an 
entire line, the capture efficiency used to calculate the product of the 
capture and control efficiency is the total capture efficiency over the 
entire line.
    (B) For coating lines which are both chosen by the owner or operator 
to comply with paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(iv), 
(e)(2)(v), or (e)(2)(vi) of this section by the alternative in paragraph 
(e)(2)(i)(B) of this section and meet the criteria allowing them to 
comply with paragraph (e)(2) of this section instead of paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section, the overall efficiency of the capture system and 
control device, as determined by the test methods and procedures 
specified in paragraphs (a)(4) (iii), (iv) and (v)(A) of this section, 
shall be no less than the equivalent overall efficiency which shall be 
calculated by the following equation:

E = ([VOM<INF>a</INF> - VOM<INF>1</INF>]/VOM<INF>a</INF>)  x  100

Where:

E = Equivalent overall efficiency of the capture system and control 
device as a percentage,
VOM<INF>a</INF> = Actual VOM content of a coating, or the daily-weighted 
average VOM content of two or more coatings (if more than one coating is 
used), as applied to the subject coating line as determined by the 
applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) 
of this section in units of kg VOM/l (lb VOM/gal) of coating solids as

the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section shall apply 
coatings to wood furniture on the subject coating line unless the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(E) (1) or (2) of this section, in 
addition to the requirements specified in the note to paragraph 
(e)(1)(i)(L) of this section, are met.
    (1) For each coating line which applies multiple coatings, all of 
which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within 
paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section, during the same day (e.g., all 
coatings used on the line are subject to 0.67 kg/l [5.6 lbs/gal]), the 
daily-weighted average VOM content shall not exceed the coating VOM 
content limit corresponding to the category of coating used, or
    (2) For each coating line which applies coatings subject to more 
than one numerical emission limitation in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this 
section, during the same day, the owner or operator shall submit to and 
receive approval from the Administrator for a site-specific FIP 
revision. To receive approval, the requirements of USEPA's Emissions 
Trading Policy Statement (and related policy) must be satisfied.
    (F) No owner or operator of an existing diesel-electric locomotive 
coating line in Cook County, subject to the limitations of paragraph 
(e)(1)(i)(M) of this section shall apply coatings to diesel-electric 
locomotives on the subject coating line unless the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(F) (1) or (2) of this section are met.
    (1) For each coating line which applies multiple coatings, all of 
which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within 
paragraph (e)(1)(i)(M) of this section, during the same day (e.g., all 
coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/

[[Page 440]]

gal]), the daily-weighted average VOM content shall not exceed the 
coating VOM content limit corresponding to the category of coating used, 
or
    (2) For each coating line which applies coatings subject to more 
than one numerical emission limitation in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(M) of this 
section, during the same day, the owner or operator shall submit to and 
receive approval from the Administrator for a site-specific FIP 
revision. To receive approval, the requirements of USEPA's Emissions 
Trading Policy Statement (and related policy) must be satisfied.
    (iii) Limitations in terms of kg (lbs) of VOM emissions per l (gal) 
of solids as applied at each coating applicator shall be determined by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07NO91.006

Where:

S=The limitation on VOM emissions in terms of kg VOM/l (lbs VOM/gal) of 
solids,
C=The limitation on VOM emissions in terms of kg/l (lbs/gal) of coating 
(minus water and any compounds which are specifically excluded from the 
definition of VOM) specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section,
D=The density of VOM in the coating. For the purposes of calculating S, 
the density is 0.882 kg VOM/l VOM (7.36 lbs VOM/gal VOM).

    (2) Alternative emission limitations. Any owner or operator of a 
coating line subject to paragraph (e)(1) of this section may comply with 
this paragraph, rather than with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if a 
capture system and control device are operated at all times and the 
owner or operator demonstrates compliance with paragraphs (e)(2) (ii), 
(iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of this section (depending upon the 
source category) through the applicable coating analysis and capture 
system and control device efficiency test methods and procedures 
specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this 
section; and the control device is equipped with the applicable 
monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section 
and the monitoring equipment is installed, calibrated, operated and 
maintained according to vendor specifications at all times the control 
device is in use. The use of a capture system and control device, which 
does not demonstrate compliance with paragraph (e)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), 
(v), (vi), or (vii), may only be used as an alternative to compliance 
with paragraph (e)(1) of this section if approved as a FIP revision.
    (i) Alternative add-on control methodologies. (A) The coating line 
is equipped with a capture system and control device that provides 81 
percent reduction in the overall emissions of VOM from the coating line 
and the control device has a 90 percent efficiency, or
    (B) The system used to control VOM from the coating line is 
demonstrated to have an overall efficiency sufficient to limit VOM 
emissions to no more than what is allowed under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section. Use of any control system other than an afterburner, carbon 
absorption, condensation, or absorption scrubber system can only be 
allowed if approved by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. 
Transfer efficiency credits can only be allowed if approved by the 
Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. Baseline transfer efficiencies 
and transfer efficiency test methods must be approved by the 
Administrator.
    Such overall efficiency is to be determined as follows:
    (1) Obtain the emission limitation from the appropriate paragraph in 
(e)(1) of this section,
    (2) Calculate ``S'' according to the equation in paragraph 
(e)(1)(iii) of this section,
    (3) Calculate the overall efficiency required according to paragraph 
(a)(4)(v) of this section. For the purposes of calculating this value, 
according to the equation in (a)(4)(v)(B) of this section 
VOM<INF>1</INF> is equal to the value of ``S'' as determined above in 
(i)(B)(2).
    (ii) No owner or operator of a coating line subject to only one of 
the emission limitations from among paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A)(1), 
(e)(1)(i)(A)(2), (e)(1)(i)(A)(4), (e)(1)(i)(C), (e)(1)(i)(D), 
(e)(1)(i)(E), (e)(1)(i)(F), (e)(1)(i)(G),

[[Page 441]]

(e)(1)(i)(H), or (e)(1)(i)(I) of this section and equipped with a 
capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating line 
unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this 
section are met. No owner or operator of a coating line subject to 
paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A)(3) of this section and equipped with a capture 
system and control device shall operate the coating line unless the 
owner or operator demonstrates compliance with the topcoat limitation in 
accordance with the topcoat protocol for automobile or light-duty trucks 
referenced in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) No owner or operator of a miscellaneous metal parts and 
products coating line which applies one or more coatings during the same 
day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation 
within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(J) of this section (e.g., all coatings used 
on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gal]), and which is 
equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate the 
subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) 
or (B) of this section are met.
    (iv) No owner or operator of a heavy off-highway vehicle products 
coating line which applies one or more coatings during the same day, all 
of which are subject to the same numerical emission limitation within 
paragraph (e)(1)(i)(K) of this section (e.g., all coatings used on the 
line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gal]), and which is equipped with 
a capture system and control device shall operate the subject coating 
line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this 
section are met.
    (v) No owner or operator of an existing diesel-electric locomotive 
coating line in Cook County which applies one or more coatings during 
the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission 
limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(M) of this section (e.g., all 
coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gals]), and 
which is equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate 
the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) 
(A) or (B) of this section are met.
    (vi) No owner or operator of a wood furniture coating line which 
applies one or more coatings during the same day, all of which are 
subject to the same numerical emission limitation within paragraph 
(e)(1)(i)(L) (e.g., all coatings used on the line are subject to 0.67 
kg/l [5.6 lbs/gal]), and which is equipped with a capture system and 
control device shall operate the subject coating line unless the 
requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section are met. 
If compliance is achieved by meeting the requirements in paragraph 
(e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, then the provisions in the note to 
paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) of this section must also be met.
    (vii) No owner or operator of a can coating facility and equipped 
with a capture system and control device shall operate the subject 
coating facility unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(vii) (A) or 
(B) of this section are met.
    (A) An alternative daily emission limitation shall be determined 
according to paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(C)(2) of this section. Actual daily 
emissions shall never exceed the alternative daily emission limitation 
and shall be calculated by use of the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07NO91.007

Where:

E<INF>d</INF>=Actual VOM emissions for the day in units of kg/day (lbs/
day),
i=Subscript denoting the specific coating applied,
n=Total number of surface coatings as applied in the can coating 
operation,
V<INF>i</INF>=Volume of each coating as applied for the day in units of 
1/day (gal/day) of coating (minus water and any compounds which are 
specifically exempted from the definition of VOM),
C<INF>i</INF>=The VOM content of each coating as applied in units of kg 
VOM/l (lbs VOM/gal) of coating (minus water and any compounds which are 
specifically exempted from the definition of VOM), and
F<INF>i</INF>=Fraction, by weight, of VOM emissions from the surface 
coating, reduced or prevented from being emitted to the ambient air. 
This is the overall efficiency of the capture system and control device.

    (B) The coating line is equipped with a capture system and control 
device

[[Page 442]]

that provide 75 percent reduction in the overall emissions of VOM from 
the coating line and the control device has a 90 percent efficiency.
    (3) Exemptions from emission limitations--(i) Exemptions for all 
source categories except wood furniture coating. The limitations of 
paragraph (e) of this section shall not apply to coating lines within a 
facility, that otherwise would be subject to the same subparagraph of 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section (because they belong to the same 
source category, e.g. can coating), provided that combined actual 
emissions of VOM from all lines at the facility subject to that 
subparagraph never exceed 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application 
of capture systems and control devices. (For example, can coating lines 
within a plant would not be subject to the limitations of subparagraph 
(e)(1)(i)(B) of this section if the combined actual emissions of VOM 
from the can coating lines never exceed 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before 
the application of capture systems and control devices.) Volatile 
organic material emissions from heavy off-highway vehicle products 
coating lines must be combined with VOM emissions from miscellaneous 
metal parts and products coating lines to determine applicability. Any 
owner or operator of a coating facility shall comply with the applicable 
coating analysis test methods and procedures specified in paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section if total 
VOM emissions from the subject coating lines are always less than or 
equal to 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture 
systems and control devices and, therefore, are not subject to the 
limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Once a category of 
coating lines at a facility is subject to the limitations in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, the coating lines are always subject to the 
limitations in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Applicability for wood furniture coating. (A) The limitations 
of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to a plant's wood furniture 
coating lines if the plant contains process emission sources, not 
regulated by paragraphs (d), (e) (excluding paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L)), (h) 
(excluding paragraph (h)(5)), (i), (j), or (q)(1), or subparts B, Q 
(excluding sections 215.432 and 215.436), R (excluding sections 215.447, 
215.450, and 215.452), S, V, X, Y (sections 215.582-215.584), or Z of 35 
Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 
52.742), which as a group both:
    (1) Have maximum theoretical emissions of 91 Mg (100 tons) or more 
per calendar year of VOM if no air pollution control equipment were 
used, and
    (2) Are not limited to less than 91 Mg (100 tons) of VOM per 
calendar year if no air pollution control equipment were used, through 
production or capacity limitations contained in a federally enforceable 
construction permit or SIP or FIP version.
    (B) If a plant ceases to fulfill the criteria of paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) 
of this section shall continue to apply to any wood furniture coating 
line which was ever subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) 
of this section.
    (C) For the purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, an 
emission source shall be considered regulated by a subpart (of the 
Illinois rules), section, or paragraph if it is subject to the 
limitations of that subpart (of the Illinois rules), section, or 
paragraph. An emission source is not considered regulated by a subpart 
(of the Illinois rules), section, or paragraph if its emissions are 
below the applicability cutoff level or if the source is covered by an 
exemption.
    (D) Any owner or operator of a wood furniture coating line to which 
the limitations of paragraph (e) of this section are not applicable due 
to the criteria in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section shall, upon 
request by the Administrator, submit records to the Administrator within 
30 calendar days from the date of the request that document that the 
coating line is exempt from the limitations of paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (4) Exemption from general rule on use of organic material. No owner 
or operator of a coating line subject to the limitations of paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section is required to meet the limitations of subpart K 
(section 215.301 or

[[Page 443]]

215.302) of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as 
specified in 40 CFR 52.742), after the date by which the coating line is 
required to meet paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (5) Compliance schedule. Except as specified in paragraph (e)(7) of 
this section, every owner or operator of a coating line (of a type 
included within paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section) shall comply with 
the requirements of paragraph (e)(1),(e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section 
and paragraph (e)(6) of this section in accordance with the appropriate 
compliance schedule as specified in paragraph (e)(5)(i),(ii),(iii) or 
(iv) of this section.
    (i) No owner or operator of a coating line which is exempt from the 
limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section because of the criteria 
in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section shall operate said coating line 
on or after July 1, 1991, unless the owner or operator has complied 
with, and continues to comply with, paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section. 
Wood furniture coating lines are not subject to paragraph (e)(6)(i) of 
this section.
    (ii) No owner or operator of a coating line complying by means of 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section shall operate said coating line on 
or after July 1, 1991, unless the owner or operator has complied with, 
and continues to comply with, paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(6)(ii) of 
this section.
    (iii) No owner or operator of a coating line complying by means of 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section shall operate said coating line on 
or after July 1, 1991, unless the owner or operator has complied with, 
and continues to comply with, paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(6)(iii) of 
this section.
    (iv) No owner or operator of a coating line complying by means of 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall operate said coating line on or 
after July 1, 1991, unless the owner or operator has complied with, and 
continues to comply with, paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(6)(iv) of this 
section.
    (6) Recordkeeping and reporting. The VOM content of each coating and 
the efficiency of each capture system and control device shall be 
determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section to establish the records required under 
paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
    (i) Any owner or operator of a coating line which is exempted from 
the limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section because of paragraph

<SUP>a</SUP> Tank not in use.

    (B) The throughput shall be calculated as follows:
    (1) Compute the monthly throughput for each tank by the 15th day of 
the following month.
    (2) By the 15th day of each month, add the monthly throughputs for 
the 12 previous months to obtain the yearly throughput.
    (ii) Recordkeeping. (A) On and after October 1, 1992, the owner and 
operator of the Nalco Chemical Company facility in Bedford Park, 
Illinois, shall keep the following records for all storage tanks. These 
records shall be compiled on a monthly basis, be retained at the 
facility for a period of 3 years, and be made available to the 
Administrator upon request.
    (1) The molecular weight of vapor in each storage tank 
(M<INF>v</INF>), the true vapor pressure at bulk liquid conditions for 
each tank (P), the paint factor (F<INF>p</INF>), and their product. 
F<INF>p</INF> shall be determined from Table 4.3-1 of ``Compilation of 
Air Pollutant Emission Factors, Volume I: Stationary Point and Area 
Sources,'' AP-42, September 1985.
    (2) The monthly throughput.
    (3) The total throughput per year for the 12 previous months.
    (B) [Reserved]

[[Page 480]]

    (iii) Test Methods. (A) The true vapor pressure at bulk liquid 
temperature shall be determined by using the procedures specified in 
paragraph (a)(8) of this section.
    (B) The molecular weight of vapor in the storage tank shall be 
determined by using Table 4.3-2 ``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission 
Factors, Volume I: Stationary Point and Area Sources,'' AP-42, September 
1985, or by analysis of vapor samples. Where mixtures of organic liquids 
are stored in a tank, M<INF>v</INF> shall be estimated from the liquid 
composition using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21MR95.008

Where:

M<INF>a</INF>=Molecular weight of pure component a;
P<INF>a</INF>=Vapor pressure of pure component a;
X<INF>a</INF>=Mole fraction of pure component a in the liquid;
M<INF>b</INF>=Molecular weight of pure component b;
P<INF>b</INF>=Vapor pressure of pure component b;
X<INF>b</INF>=Mole fraction of pure component b in the liquid; and
P<INF>t</INF>=P<INF>a</INF> X<INF>2=</INF> P<INF>b</INF> X<INF>b</INF>.

    (11) The control requirements in this paragraph apply to the 
fugitive emission sources listed in paragraph (x)(11)(i)(A) of this 
section at the Nalco Chemical Company facility in Bedfore Park, 
Illinois, instead of the control requirements in paragraph (x)(3) of 
this section.
    (i) Production and Operation Restrictions.
    (A) On and after October 1, 1992, all components (e.g., pumps, 
valves, flanges, pressure relief valves (PRV's), and open end lines) at 
the specified locations (e.g., Building 32--Tube Reactor System, etc.), 
and in the specified type of service (e.g., heavy liquid stratified, 
light liquid stratified, etc.) shall be limited by the maximum monthly 
hours in the following table:
    (ii) Recordkeeping.
    (A) On and after October 1, 1992, the owner and operator of the 
Nalco Chemical Company facility in Bedford Park, Illinois, shall keep 
the following records for all fugitive emission sources. These records 
shall be compiled on a monthly basis, be retained at the facility for a 
period of 3 years, and be made available to the Administrator upon 
request.
    (1) The total number of hours of organic service for each component 
at each location specified in paragraphs (x)(11)(i)(A) (1) through (10) 
of this section.
    (2) The vapor pressure of each organic compound in each component at 
each location specified in paragraphs (x)(11)(i)(A) (1) through (10) of 
this section.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (12) The control and recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as 
well as the test methods in this paragraph, apply to the gravure and 
screen press operations at the Meyercord Corporation (Meyercord) in 
Carol Stream, Illinois, instead of the requirements in paragraphs (x)(1) 
through (x)(5) of this section.
    (i) After July 1, 1991, no materials which contain volatile organic 
material (VOM), including coatings, inks, and cleaning material, may be 
used at any gravure or screen press unless the total VOM emissions 
remain below 100 tons of VOM for every consecutive 365-day period, or 
fraction thereof, starting on July 1, 1991. A new 365-day period starts 
on each day. The VOM emissions, which are to be calculated on a daily 
basis, are to be added to the VOM emissions for the prior 364 days (but 
not including any day prior to July 1, 1991). VOM emissions are based 
upon the VOM content of the material and the volume of material used. 
The effect of add-on control equipment is not considered in calculating 
VOM emissions; that is, the VOM emissions are to be determined as if the 
press(es) do(es) not have add-on control equipment. The applicable test 
methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section are 
to be used in determining daily VOM emissions.
    (ii) The VOM content of each coating, ink, and cleaning solution 
shall be determined by the applicable test methods and procedures 
specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to establish the records 
required under paragraph (x)(12)(ii) of this section. Beginning on July 
1, 1991, the owner or operator of the subject presses shall collect and 
record all of the following information

[[Page 481]]

each day and maintain the information at the facility for 3 years:
    (A) The name and identification number of each coating, ink, and 
cleaning solution as applied on any press.
    (B) The pounds (lbs) of VOM per gallon of each coating, ink, and 
cleaning solution (minus water and any compounds which are specifically 
exempted from the definition of VOM) as applied on any press.
    (C) The total gallons of each coating, ink, and cleaning solution 
(minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the 
definition of VOM) used per day.
    (D) The total lbs of VOM contained in the volume of each coating, 
ink, and cleaning solution used per day on any press. The lbs of VOM per 
day is to be calculated by multiplying the lbs of VOM per gallon (minus 
water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the 
definition of VOM) times the gallons (minus water and any compounds 
which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) used per 
day.
    (E) The total lbs of VOM per day from all coatings, inks, and 
cleaning solutions used on all presses. The total lbs of VOM per day is 
to be obtained by adding the lbs of VOM per day contained in all 
coatings, inks, and cleaning solutions.
    (F) Within 7 days after each 365-day period, the VOM emissions (as 
calculated in paragraph (x)(12)(ii)(E)) of this section before add-on 
control, from the 365-day period, are to be determined.
    Starting on July 7, 1992, VOM emissions are to be determined for the 
365 days ending 7 days earlier. Each day concludes a new 365-day period. 
However, no VOM emissions are to be included for any days prior to July 
1, 1991. For example, on July 17, 1991, the emissions from July 1,

      Appendix B--VOM Measurement Techniques for Capture Efficiency

                  Procedure G.1--Captured VOC Emissions

                             1. Introduction

    1.1  Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
volatile organic compounds (VOC) content of captured gas streams. It is 
intended to be used as a segment in the development of liquid/gas or 
gas/gas protocols for determining VOC capture efficiency (CE) for 
surface coating and printing operations. The procedure may not be 
acceptable in certain site-specific situations, e.g., when: (1) Direct 
fired heaters or other circumstances affect the quantity of VOC at the 
control device inlet; and (2) particulate organic aerosols are formed in 
the process and are present in the captured emissions.
    1.2  Principle. The amount of VOC captured (G) is calculated as the 
sum of the products of the VOC content (C<INF>Gj</INF>), the flow rate 
(Q<INF>Gj</INF>), and the sample time (T<INF>C</INF>) from each captured 
emissions point.
    1.3  Estimated measurement uncertainty. The measurement 
uncertainties are estimated for each captured or fugitive emissions 
point as follows: Q<INF>Gj</INF>=<plus-minus>5.5 percent and 
C<INF>Gj</INF>=<plus-minus>5.0 percent. Based on these numbers, the 
probable uncertainty for G is estimated at about <plus-minus>7.4 
percent.
    1.4  Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5  Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly 
explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing 
appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of 
trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas 
concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

                        2. Apparatus and Reagents

    2.1  Gas VOC concentration. A schematic of the measurement system is 
shown in Figure 1. The main components are described below:
    2.1.1  Sample probe. Stainless steel, or equivalent. The probe shall 
be heated to prevent VOC condensation.
    2.1.2  Calibration valve assembly. Three-way valve assembly at the 
outlet of sample probe to direct the zero and calibration gases to the 
analyzer. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route 
calibration gases to the outlet of the sample probe are acceptable.
    2.1.3  Sample line. Stainless steel or Teflon tubing to transport 
the sample gas to the analyzer. The sample line must be heated to 
prevent condensation.
    2.1.4  Sample pump. A lead-free pump, to pull the sample gas through 
the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of 
the measurement system. The components of the pump that contact the gas 
stream shall be constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. The sample 
pump must be heated to prevent condensation.
    2.1.5  Sample flow rate control. A sample flow rate control valve 
and rotameter, or equivalent, to maintain a constant sampling rate 
within 10 percent. The flow rate control valve and rotameter must be 
heated to prevent condensation. A control valve may also be located on 
the sample pump bypass loop to assist in controlling the sample pressure 
and flow rate.
    2.1.6  Sample gas manifold. Capable of diverting a portion of the 
sample gas stream to the flame ionization analyzer (FIA), and the 
remainder to the bypass discharge vent. The manifold components shall be 
constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. If captured or fugitive 
emissions are to be measured at multiple locations, the measurement 
system shall be designed to use separate sampling probes, lines, and 
pumps for each measurement location and a common sample gas manifold and 
FIA. The sample gas manifold and connecting lines to the FIA must be 
heated to prevent condensation.
    2.1.7  Organic concentration analyzer. An FIA with a span value of 
1.5 times the expected concentration as propane; however, other span 
values may be used if it can be demonstrated that they would provide 
more accurate measurements.
    The system shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the following 
specifications:
    2.1.7.1  Zero drift. Less than <plus-minus>3.0 percent of the span 
value.
    2.1.7.2  Calibration drift. Less than <plus-minus>3.0 percent of the 
span value.
    2.1.7.3  Calibration error. Less than <plus-minus>5.0 percent of the 
calibration gas value.
    2.1.7.4  Response time. Less than 30 seconds.

[[Page 489]]

    2.1.8  Integrator/data acquisition system. An analog or digital 
device or computerized data acquisition system used to integrate the FIA 
response or compute the average response and record measurement data. 
The minimum data sampling frequency for computing average or integrated 
values is one measurement value every 5 seconds. The device shall be 
capable of recording average values at least once per minute.
    2.1.9  Calibration and other gases. Gases used for calibration, 
fuel, and combustion air (if required) are contained in compressed gas 
cylinders. All calibration gases shall be traceable to NIST standards 
and shall be certified by the manufacturer to <plus-minus>1 percent of 
the tag value. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder should 
provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over 
which the concentration does not change more than <plus-minus>2 percent 
from the certified value. For calibration gas values not generally 
available, alternative methods for preparing calibration gas mixtures, 
such as dilution systems, may be used with prior approval.
    2.1.9.1  Fuel. A 40 percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent He or 40 
percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent N<INF>2</INF> gas mixture is 
recommended to avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs 
when oxygen concentration varies significantly from a mean value.
    2.1.9.2  Carrier gas. High purity air with less than 1 ppm of 
organic material (as propane or carbon equivalent) or less than 0.1 
percent of the span value, whichever is greater.
    2.1.9.3  FIA Linearity calibration gases. Low-, mid-, and high-range 
gas mixture standards with nominal propane concentrations of 20-30, 45-
55, and 70-80 percent of the span value in air, respectively. Other 
calibration values and other span values may be used if it can be shown 
that more accurate measurements would be achieved.
    2.1.10  Particulate filter. An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass 
fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is 
significant. An out-of-stack filter must be heated to prevent any 
condensation unless it can be demonstrated that no condensation occurs.
    2.2  Captured emissions volumetric flow rate.
    2.2.1  Method 2 or 2A apparatus. For determining volumetric flow 
rate.
    2.2.2  Method 3 apparatus and reagents. For determining molecular 
weight of the gas stream. An estimate of the molecular weight of the gas 
stream may be used if it can be justified.
    2.2.3  Method 4 apparatus and reagents. For determining moisture 
content, if necessary.

     3. Determinations of Volumetric Flow Rate of Captured Emissions

    3.1  Locate all points where emissions are captured from the 
affected facility. Using Method 1, determine the sampling points. Be 
sure to check each site for cyclonic or swirling flow.
    3.2  Measure the velocity at each sampling site at least once every 
hour during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A.

         4. Determinations of VOC Content of Captured Emissions

    4.1  Analysis duration. Measure the VOC responses at each captured 
emissions point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the 
process is operating. If there are multiple captured emission locations, 
design a sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to determine 
the VOC responses at all sampling locations.
    4.2  Gas VOC concentration.
    4.2.1  Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the 
FIA according to the procedure in section 5.1.
    4.2.2  Conduct a system check according to the procedure in section 
5.3.
    4.2.3  Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally 
located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack 
port connection.
    4.2.4  Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Allow the 
measurement system response to reach zero. Measure the system response 
time as the time required for the system to reach the effluent 
concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to the 
effluent sampling position.
    4.2.5  Conduct a system check before and a system check after each 
sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. If the 
drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, the run 
is not valid. The tester may elect to perform system drift checks during 
the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.
    4.2.6  Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures 
are 120<plus-minus>5  deg.C.
    4.2.7  Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue 
to sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times 
and any required process information as appropriate. If multiple 
captured emission locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at 
each location for the same amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) and continue 
to switch from one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure 
that total sampling time at each location is the same at the end of the 
test run. Collect at least 4 separate measurements from each sample 
point during each hour of testing. Disregard the measurements at each 
sampling location until two times the response time of the measurement 
system has elapsed. Continue sampling for at least 1 minute and record 
the concentration measurements.
    4.3  Background concentration.
    4.3.1  Locate all NDO's of the TTE. A sampling point shall be 
centrally located outside

[[Page 490]]

of the TTE at 4 equivalent diameters from each NDO, if possible. If 
there are more than 6 NDO's, choose 6 sampling points evenly spaced 
among the NDO's.
    4.3.2  Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 2. Calibrate the 
FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 
5.1 and 5.3.

    Note: This sample train shall be a separate sampling train from the 
one to measure the captured emissions.

    4.3.3  Position the probe at the sampling location.
    4.3.4  Determine the response time, conduct the system check and 
sample according to the procedures described in sections 4.2.4 to 4.2.7.
    4.4  Alternative procedure. The direct interface sampling and 
analysis procedure described in section 7.2 of Method 18 may be used to 
determine the gas VOC concentration. The system must be designed to 
collect and analyze at least one sample every 10 minutes.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1 FIA  calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the 
back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates 
specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range 
calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the 
proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the 
responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of 
the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 
5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system 
is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity 
check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the 
analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.
    5.2  Systems drift checks. Select the calibration gas that most 
closely approximates the concentration of the captured emissions for 
conducting the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas at 
the calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas flow 
rate and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement system 
responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of the 
system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check 
measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent 
of the span value. Conduct the system drift checks at the end of each 
run.
    5.3  System check. Inject the high range calibration gas at the 
inlet to the sampling probe while the dilution air is turned off. Record 
the response. The performance of the system is acceptable if the 
measurement system response is within 5 percent of the value obtained in 
section 5.1 for the high range calibration gas. Conduct a system check 
before and after each test run.
    5.4  Analysis audit. Immediately before each test analyze an audit 
cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with 
the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

       Procedure G.2--Captured VOC Emissions (Dilution Technique)

                             1. Introduction

    1.1  Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
volatile organic compounds (VOC) content of captured gas streams. It is 
intended to be used as a segment in the development of a gas/gas 
protocol in which fugitive emissions are measured for determining VOC 
capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations. A 
dilution system is used to reduce the VOC concentration of the captured 
emission to about the same concentration as the fugitive emission. The 
procedure may not be acceptable in certain site-specific situations, 
e.g., when: (1) Direct fired heaters or other circumstances affect the 
quantity of VOC at the control device inlet; and (2) particulate organic 
aerosols are formed in the process and are present in the captured 
emissions.
    1.2  Principle. The amount of VOC captured (G) is calculated as the 
sum of the products of the VOC content (C<INF>Gj</INF>), the flow rate 
(Q<INF>Gj</INF>), and the sampling time (T<INF>C</INF>) from each 
captured emissions point.
    1.3  Estimated measurement uncertainty. The measurement 
uncertainties are estimated for each captured or fugitive emissions 
point as follows: O<INF>Gj</INF>=<plus-minus>5.5 percent and 
C<INF>Gj</INF>=<plus-minus>5 percent. Based on these numbers, the 
probable uncertainty for G is estimated at about <plus-minus>7.4 
percent.
    1.4  Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5  Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly 
explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing 
appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of 
trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas 
concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

                        2. Apparatus and Reagents

shown in Figure 1. The main components are described below:
    2.1.1  Dilution system. A Kipp in-stack dilution probe and 
controller or similar device may be used. The dilution rate may be 
changed by substituting different critical orifices or adjustments of 
the aspirator supply pressure. The dilution system shall be heated to 
prevent VOC condensation.
    Note: An out-of-stack dilution device may be used.
    2.1.2  Calibration valve assembly. Three-way valve assembly at the 
outlet of sample probe to direct the zero and calibration gases to the 
analyzer. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route 
calibration gases to the outlet of the sample probe are acceptable.
    2.1.3  Sample line. Stainless steel or Teflon tubing to transport 
the sample gas to the analyzer. The sample line must be heated to 
prevent condensation.
    2.1.4  Sample pump. A leak-free pump, to pull the sample gas through 
the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of 
the measurement system. The components of the pump that contract the gas 
stream shall be constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. The sample 
pump must be heated to prevent condensation.
    2.1.5  Sample flow rate control. A sample flow rate control valve 
and rotameter, or equivalent, to maintain a constant sampling rate

sample pump bypass loop to assist in controlling the sample pressure and 
flow rate.
    2.1.6  Sample gas manifold. Capable of diverting a portion of the 
sample gas stream to the flame ionization analyzer (FIA), and the 
remainder to the bypass discharge vent. The manifold components shall be 
constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. If captured or fugitive 
emissions are to be measured at multiple locations, the measurement 
system shall be designed to use separate sampling probes, lines, and 
pumps for each measurement location and a common sample gas manifold and 
FIA. The sample gas manifold and connecting lines to the FIA must be 
heated to prevent condensation.
    2.1.7  Organic concentration analyzer. An FIA with a span value of 
1.5 times the expected concentration as propane; however, other span 
values may be used if it can be demonstrated that they would provide 
more accurate measurements.
    The system shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the following 
specifications:
    2.1.7.1  Zero drift. Less than <plus-minus>3.0 percent of the span

device or computerized data acquisition system used to integrate the FIA 
response or compute the average response and record measurement data. 
The minimum data sampling frequency for computing average or integrated 
values is one measurement value every 5 seconds. The device shall be 
capable of recording average values at least once per minute.
    2.1.9  Calibration and other gases. Gases used for calibration, 
fuel, and combustion air (if required) are contained in compressed gas 
cylinders. All calibration gases shall be traceable to NIST standards 
and shall be certified by the manufacturer to <plus-minus>1 percent of 
the tag value. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder should 
provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over 
which the concentration does not change more than <plus-minus>2 percent 
from the certified value. For calibration gas values not generally 
available, alternative methods for preparing calibration gas mixtures, 
such as dilution system, may be used with prior approval.
    2.1.9.1  Fuel. A 40 percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent He or 40 
percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent N<INF>2</INF> gas mixture is 
recommended to avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs 
when oxygen concentration varies signficantly from a mean value.
    2.1.9.2.  Carrier gas and dilution air supply. High purity air with 
less than 1 ppm of organic material (as propane or carbon equivalent) or 
less than 0.1 percent of the span value, whichever is greater.
    2.1.9.3  FIA linearity calibration gases. Low-, mid-, and high-range 
gas mixture standards with nominal propane concentrations of 20-30, 45-
55, and 70-80 percent of the span value in air, respectively. Other 
calibration values and other span values may be used if it can be shown 
that more accurate measurements would be achieved.
    2.1.9.4  Dilution check gas. Gas mixture standard containing propane 
in air, approximately half the span value after dilution.
    2.1.10  Particulate filter. An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass 
fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is 
significant. An out-of-stack filter must be heated to prevent any 
condensation unless it can be demonstrated that no condensation occurs.
    2.2  Captured emissions volumetric flow rate.
    2.2.1  Method 2 or 2A apparatus. For determining volumetric flow 
rate.

weight of the gas stream. An estimate of the molecular weight of the gas 
stream may be used if it can be justified.

content, if necessary.

     3. Determination of Volumetric Flow Rate of Captured Emissions

    3.1  Locate all points where emissions are captured from the 
affected facility. Using Method 1, determine the sampling points. Be 
sure to check each site for cyclonic or swirling flow.
    3.2  Measure the velocity at each sampling site at least once every 
hour during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A.

          4. Determination of VOC Content of Captured Emissions

    4.1  Analysis duration. Measure the VOC responses at each captured 
emissions point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the 
process is operating. If there are multiple captured emissions 
locations, design a sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to 
determine the VOC responses at all sampling locations.
    4.2  Gas VOC concentration.
    4.2.1  Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the 
FIA according to the procedure in section 5.1.
    4.2.2  Set the dilution ratio and determine the dilution factor 
according to the procedure in section 5.3.
    4.2.3  Conduct a system check according to the procedure in section 
5.4.
    4.2.4  Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally 
located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack 
port connection.
    4.2.5  Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Measure 
the system response time as the time required for the system to reach 
the effluent concentration after the calibration valve has been returned 
to the effluent sampling position.
    4.2.6  Conduct a system check before and a system drift check after 
each sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.4. 
If the drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, 
the run is not valid. The tester may elect to perform system drift 
checks during the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.
    4.2.7  Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures 
are 120<plus-minus>5  deg.C.
    4.2.8  Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue 
to sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times 
and any required process information as appropriate. If multiple 
captured emission locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at 
each location for the same amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) and continue 
to switch from one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure 
that total sampling time at each location is the

[[Page 493]]

same at the end of the test run. Collect at least 4 separate 
measurements from each sample point during each hour of testing. 
Disregard the measurements at each sampling location until two times the 
response time of the measurement system has elapsed. Continue sampling 
for at least 1 minute and record the concentration measurements.
    4.3  Background concentration.
    4.3.1  Locate all NDO's of the TTE. A sampling point shall be 
centrally located outside of the TTE at 4 equivalent diameters from each 
NDO, if possible. If there are more than 6 NDO's, choose 6 sampling 
points evenly spaced among the NDO's.
    4.3.2  Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 2. Calibrate the 
FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 
5.1 and 5.4.
    4.3.3  Position the probe at the sampling location.
    4.3.4  Determine the response time, conduct the system check and 
sample according to the procedures described in sections 4.2.4 to 4.2.8.
    4.4  Alternative procedure. The direct interface sampling and 
analysis procedure described in section 7.2 of Method 18 may be used to 
determine the gas VOC concentration. The system must be designed to 
collect and analyze at least one sample every 10 minutes.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1  FIA Calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system after the dilution 
system and adjust the back-pressure regulator to the value required to 
achieve the flow rates specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- 
and the high-range calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration 
to provide the proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and 
record the responses of the measurement system. The calibration and 
linearity of the system are acceptable if the responses for all four 
gases are within 5 percent of the respective gas values. If the 
performance of the system is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system 
and repeat the linearity check. Conduct a calibration and linearity 
check after assembling the analysis system and after a major change is 
made to the system.
    5.2  Systems drift checks. Select the calibration gas that most 
closely approximates the concentration of the diluted captured emissions 
for conducting the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas 
at the calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas 
flow rate and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement 
system responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of 
the system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check 
measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent 
of the span value. Conduct the system drift check at the end of each 
run.
    5.3  Determination of dilution factor. Inject the dilution check gas 
into the measurement system before the dilution system and record the 
response. Calculate the dilution factor using Equation 3.
    5.4  System check. Inject the high range calibration gas at the 
inlet to the sampling probe while the dilution air is turned off. Record 
the response. The performance of the system is acceptable if the 
measurement system response is within 5 percent of the value obtained in 
section 5.1 for the high range calibration gas. Conduct a system check 
before and after each test run.
    5.5  Analysis audit. Immediately before each test analyze an audit 
cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with 
the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

     Procedure F.2--Fugitive VOC Emissions from Building Enclosures

                             1. Introduction

    1.1  Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
fugitive volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions from a building 
enclosure (BE). It is intended to be used as a segment in the 
development of liquid/gas or gas/gas protocols for determining VOC 
capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations.
    1.2  Principle. The total amount of fugitive VOC emissions 
(F<INF>B</INF>) from the BE is calculated as the sum of the products of 
the

[[Page 497]]

VOC content (C<INF>Fj</INF>) of each fugitive emissions point, its flow 
rate (Q<INF>Fj</INF>), and time (T<INF>F</INF>).
    1.3  Measurement uncertainty. The measurement uncertainties are 
estimated for each fugitive emissions point as follows: 
Q<INF>Fj</INF>=<plus-minus>5.0 percent and 
C<INF>Fj</INF>=<plus-minus>5.0 percent. Based on these numbers, the 
probable uncertainty for F<INF>B</INF> is estimated at about 
<plus-minus>11.2 percent.
    1.4  Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5  Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly

    3.1.2  NDO's exhaust points. The NDO's in the roof of a facility are 
considered to be exhaust points. Determine volumetric flow rate from 
these NDO's. Divide the cross-sectional area according to Method 1 using 
12 equal areas. Use the appropriate velocity measurement devices, e.g., 
propeller anemometers.
    3.1.3  Other NDO's.
    3.1.3.1  This step is optional. Determine the exhaust flow rate, 
including that of the control device, from the enclosure and the intake 
air flow rate. If the exhaust flow rate divided by the intake air flow 
rate is greater than 1.1, then all other NDO's are not considered to be 
significant exhaust points.
    3.1.3.2  If the option above is not taken, identify all other NDO's 
and other potential points through which fugitive emissions may escape 
the enclosure. Then use the following criteria to determine whether flow 
rates and VOC concentrations need to be measured:
    3.1.3.2.1  Using the appropriate flow direction indicator, determine 
the flow direction. An NDO with zero or inward flow is not an exhaust 
point.
    3.1.3.2.2  Measure the outward volumetric flow rate from the 
remainder of the NDO's. If the collective flow rate is 2 percent, or 
less, of the flow rate from sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, then these NDO's, 
except those within two equivalent diameters (based on NDO opening) from 
VOC sources, may be considered to be non-exhaust points.
    3.1.3.2.3  If the percentage calculated in section 3.1.3.2.2 is 
greater than 2 percent, those NDO's (except those within two equivalent 
diameters from VOC sources) whose volumetric flow rate totals 2 percent 
of the flow rate from sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 may be considered as non-
exhaust points. All remaining NDO's shall be measured for volumetric 
flow rate and VOC concentrations during the CE test.
    3.1.3.2.4  The tester may choose to measure VOC concentrations at 
the forced exhaust points and the NDO's. If the total VOC emissions from 
the NDO's are less than 2 percent of the emissions from the forced draft 
and roof NDO's, then these NDO's may be eliminated from further 
consideration.
    3.2  Determination of flow rates.
    3.2.1  Measure the volumetric flow rate at all locations identified 
as exhaust points in section 3.1. Divide each exhaust opening into 9 
equal areas for rectangular openings and 8 for circular openings.
    3.2.2  Measure the velocity at each site at least once every hour 
during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A, if applicable, or using 
the low velocity instruments in section 2.2.2.

          4. Determination of VOC Content of Fugitive Emissions

    4.1  Analysis duration. Measure the VOC responses at each fugitive 
emission point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the 
process is operating. If there are multiple emissions locations, design 
a sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to determine the VOC 
responses at all sampling locations.
    4.2  Gas VOC concentration.
    4.2.1  Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the 
FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 
5.1 and 5.3, respectively.
    4.2.2  Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally 
located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack 
port connection.
    4.2.3  Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Allow the 
measurement system response to reach zero. Measure the system response 
time as the time required for the system to reach the effluent 
concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to the 
effluent sampling position.
    4.2.4  Conduct a system check before and a system drift check after 
each sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. 
If the drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, 
the run is not valid. The tester may elect to perform drift checks 
during the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.

[[Page 499]]

    4.2.5  Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures 
are 120<plus-minus>5  deg.C.
    4.2.6  Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue 
to sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times 
and any required process information as appropriate. If multiple 
emission locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at each 
location for the same amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) and continue to 
switch from one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure 
that total sampling time at each location is the same at the end of the 
test run. Collect at least 4 separate measurements from each sample 
point during each hour of testing. Disregard the response measurements 
at each sampling location until two times the response time of the 
measurement system has elapsed. Continue sampling for at least 1 minute 
and record the concentration measurements.
    4.3  Alternative procedure. The direct interface sampling and 
analysis procedure described in section 7.2 of Method 18 may be used to 
determine the gas VOC concentration. The system must be designed to 
collect and analyze at least one sample every 10 minutes.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1  FIA calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the 
back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates 
specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range 
calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the 
proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the 
responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of 
the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 
5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system 
is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity 
check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the 
analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.
    5.2  Systems drift checks. Select the calibration gas that most 
closely approximates the concentration of the captured emissions for 
conducting the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas at 
the calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas flow 
rate and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement system 
responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of the 
system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check 
measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent 
of the span value. Conduct a system drift check at the end of each run.
    5.3  System check. Inject the high range calibration gas at the 
inlet of the sampling probe and record the response. The performance of 
the system is acceptable if the measurement system response is within 5 
percent of the value obtained in section 5.1 for the high range 
calibration gas. Conduct a system check before each test run.
    5.4  Analysis audit. Immediately before each test analyze an audit 
cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with 
the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

     Procedure F.1--Fugitive VOC Emissions From Temporary Enclosures

                             1. Introduction

    1.1  Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
fugitive volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions from a temporary 
total enclosure (TTE). It is intended to be used as a segment in the 
development of liquid/gas or gas/gas protocols for determining VOC 
capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations.
    1.2  Principle. The amount of fugitive VOC emissions (F) from the 
TTE is calculated as the sum of the products of the VOC content

[[Page 501]]

(C<INF>Fj</INF>), the flow rate (Q<INF>Fj</INF>), and the sampling time 
(T<INF>F</INF>) from each fugitive emissions point.
    1.3  Estimated measurement uncertainty. The measurement 
uncertainties are estimated for each fugitive emission point as follows: 
Q=<plus-minus>5.5 percent and C<INF>Fj</INF>=<plus-minus>5.0 percent. 
Based on these numbers, the probable uncertainty for F is estimated at 
about <plus-minus>7.4 percent.
    1.4  Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5  Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly 
explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing 
appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of 
trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas 
concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

                        2. Apparatus and Reagents

    2.1  Gas VOC concentration. A schematic of the measurement system is 
shown in Figure 1. The main components are described below:
    2.1.1  Sample probe. Stainless steel, or equivalent. The probe shall 
be heated to prevent VOC condensation.
    2.1.2  Calibration valve assembly. Three-way valve assembly at the 
outlet of sample probe to direct the zero and calibration gases to the 
analyzer. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route 
calibration gases to the outlet of the sample probe are acceptable.
    2.1.3  Sample line. Stainless steel or Teflon tubing to transport 
the sample gas to the analyzer. The sample line must be heated to 
prevent condensation.
    2.1.4  Sample pump. A leak-free pump, to pull the sample gas through 
the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of 
the measurement system. The components of the pump that contact the gas 
stream shall be constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. The sample 
pump must be heated to prevent condensation.
    2.1.5  Sample flow rate control. A sample flow rate control valve 
and rotameter, or equivalent, to maintain a constant sampling rate 
within 10 percent. The flow control valve and rotameter must be heated 
to prevent condensation. A control valve may also be located on the 
sample pump bypass loop to assist in controlling the sample pressure and 
flow rate.
    2.1.6  Sample gas manifold. Capable of diverting a portion of the 
sample gas stream to the flame ionization analyzer (FIA), and the 
remainder to the bypass discharge vent. The manifold components shall be 
constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. If emissions are to be 
measured at multiple locations, the measurement system shall be designed 
to use separate sampling probes, lines, and pumps for each measurement 
location and a common sample gas manifold and FIA. The sample gas 
manifold and connecting lines to the FIA must be heated to prevent 
condensation.
    2.1.7  Organic concentration analzyer. An FIA with a span value of 
1.5 times the expected concentration as propane; however, other span 
values may be used if it can be demonstrated that they would provide 
more accurate measurements. The system shall be capable of meeting or 
exceeding the following specifications:
    2.1.7.1  Zero drift. Less than <plus-minus>3.0 percent of the span 
value.
    2.1.7.2  Calibration drift. Less than <plus-minus>3.0 percent of the 
span value.
    2.1.7.3  Calibration error. Less than <plus-minus>5.0 percent of the 
calibration gas value.
    2.1.7.4  Response time. Less than 30 seconds.
    2.1.8  Integrator/data acquisition system. An analog or digital 
device or computerized data acquisition system used to integrate the FIA 
response or compute the average response and record measurement data. 
The minimum data sampling frequency for computing average or integrated 
values is one measurement value every 5 seconds. The device shall be 
capable of recording average values at least once per minute.
    2.1.9  Calibration and other gases. Gases used for calibration, 
fuel, and combustion air (if required) are contained in compressed gas 
cylinders. All calibration gases shall be traceable to NIST standards 
and shall be certified by the manufacturer to <plus-minus>1 percent of 
the tag value. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder should 
provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over 
which the concentration does not change more than <plus-minus>2 percent 
from the certified value. For calibration gas values not generally 
available, alternative methods for preparing calibration gas mixtures, 
such as dilution systems, may be used with prior approval.
    2.1.9.1  Fuel. A 40 percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent He or 40 
percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent N<INF>2</INF> gas mixture is 
recommended to avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs 
when oxygen concentration varies significantly from a mean value.
    2.1.9.2  Carrier gas. High purity air with less than 1 ppm of 
organic material (as propane or carbon equivalent) or less than 0.1 
percent of the span value, whichever is greater.
    2.1.9.3  FIA linearity calibration gases. Low-, mid-, and high-range 
gas mixture standards with nominal propane concentrations of 20-30, 45-
55, and 70-80 percent of the span value in air, respectively. Other 
calibration values and other span values may be used if it can be shown 
that more accurate measurements would be achieved.
    2.1.10  Particulate filter. An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass 
fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading

[[Page 502]]

is significant. An out-of-stack filter must be heated to prevent any 
condensation unless it can be demonstrated that no condensation occurs.
    2.2  Fugitive emissions volumetric flow rate.
    2.2.1  Method 2 or 2A apparatus. For determining volumetric flow 
rate.
    2.2.2  Method 3 apparatus and reagents. For determining molecular 
weight of the gas stream. An estimate of the molecular weight of the gas 
stream may be used if it can be justified.
    2.2.3  Method 4 apparatus and reagents. For determining moisture 
content, if necessary.
    2.3  Temporary total enclosure. The criteria for designing a TTE are 
discussed in Procedure T.

     3. Determination of Volumetric Flow Rate of Fugitive Emissions

hour during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A.

          4. Determination of VOC Content of Fugitive Emissions

emission point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the 
process is operating. If there are multiple emission locations, design a 
sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to determine the VOC 
responses at all sampling locations.
    4.2  Gas VOC concentration.
    4.2.1  Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the 
FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 
5.1 and 5.3, respectively.
    4.2.2  Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally 
located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack 
port connection.
    4.2.3  Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Allow the 
measurement system response to reach zero. Measure the system response 
time as the time required for the system to reach the effluent 
concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to the 
effluent sampling position.
    4.2.4  Conduct a system check before and a system drift check after 
each sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. 
If the drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, 
the run is not valid. The tester may elect to perform system drift 
checks during the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.
    4.2.5  Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures 
are 120 <plus-minus> 5  deg.C.
    4.2.6  Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue 
to sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times 
and any required process information as appropriate. If multiple 
emission locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at each 
location for the same amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) and continue to 
switch from one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure 
that total sampling time at each location is the same at the end of the 
test run. Collect at least 4 separate measurements from each sample 
point during each hour of testing. Disregard the response measurements 
at each sampling location until two times the response time of the 
measurement system has elapsed. Continue sampling for at least 1 minute 
and record the concentration measurements.
    4.3  Background concentration.
    4.3.1  Determination of VOC background concentration.
    4.3.1.1  Locate all NDO's of the TTE. A sampling point shall be 
centrally located outside of the TTE at 4 equivalent diameters from each 
NDO, if possible. If there are more than 6 NDO's, choose 6 sampling 
points evenly spaced among the NDO's.
    4.3.1.2  Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 2. Calibrate 
the FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in 
sections 5.1 and 5.3.
    4.3.1.3  Position the probe at the sampling location.
    4.3.1.4  Determine the response time, conduct the system check and 
sample according to the procedures described in sections 4.2.3 to 4.2.6.
    4.4  Alternative procedure. The direct interface sampling and 
analysis procedure described in section 7.2 of Method 18 may be used to 
determine the gas VOC concentration. The system must be designed to 
collect and analyze at least one sample every 10 minutes.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1  FIA calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the 
back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates 
specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range 
calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the 
proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the 
responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of 
the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 
5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system 
is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity 
check. Conduct a

[[Page 503]]

calibration and linearity check after assembling the analysis system and 
after a major change is made to the system.
    5.2  Systems drift checks. Select the calibration gas concentration 
that most closely approximates that of the fugitive gas emissions to 
conduct the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas at the 
calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas flow rate 
and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement system 
responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of the 
system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check 
measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent 
of the span value. Conduct a system drift check at the end of each run.
    5.3  System check. Inject the high range calibration gas at the 
inlet of the sampling probe and record the response. The performance of 
the system is acceptable if the measurement system response is within 5 
percent of the value obtained in section 5.1 for the high range 
calibration gas. Conduct a system check before each test run.
    5.4  Analysis audit. Immediately before each test analyze an audit 
cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with 
the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

                         Procedure L--VOC Input

                             1. Introduction

    1.1  Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
input of volatile organic compounds (VOC). It is intended to be used as 
a segment in the development of liquid/gas protocols for determining VOC 
capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations.
    1.2  Principle. The amount of VOC introduced to the process (L) is 
the sum of the products of the weight (W) of each VOC containing liquid 
(ink, paint, solvent, etc.) used and its VOC content (V). A sample of 
each

[[Page 506]]

VOC containing liquid is analyzed with a flame ionization analyzer (FIA) 
to determine V.
    1.3  Estimated measurement uncertainty. The measurement 
uncertainties are estimated for each VOC containing liquid as follows: 
W=<plus-minus>2.0 percent and V=<plus-minus>12.0 percent. Based on these 
numbers, the probable uncertainty for L is estimated at about 
<plus-minus>12.2 percent for each VOC containing liquid.
    1.4  Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5  Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly 
explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing 
appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of 
trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas 
concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

same accuracy as direct weight measurements.
    2.2  VOC content (flame ionization analyzer technique). The liquid 
sample analysis system is shown in Figures 1 and 2. The following 
equipment is required:
    2.2.1  Sample collection can. An appropriately sized metal can to be 
used to collect VOC containing materials. The can must be constructed in 
such a way that it can be grounded to the coating container.

temperature of 120<plus-minus>5  deg.C.
    2.2.5  Atmospheric vent. A tee and 0- to 0.5-liter/min rotameter 
placed in the sampling line between the carrier gas cylinder and the VOC 
sample vessel to release the excess carrier gas. A toggle valve placed 
between the tee and the rotameter facilitates leak tests of the analysis 
system.

    2.2.13  Rubber stopper. Two-hole stopper to accommodate 3.2-mm (\1/
8\-in.) Teflon tubing, appropriately sized to fit the opening of the 
sample vessel. The rubber stopper should be wrapped in Teflon tape to 
provide a tighter seal and to prevent any reaction of the sample with 
the rubber stopper. Alternatively, any leak-free closure fabricated of 
non-reactive materials and accommodating the necessary tubing fittings 
may be used.
    2.2.14  Critical orifices. Calibrated critical orifices capable of 
providing constant flow rates from 50 to 250 ml/min at known pressure 
drops. Sapphire orifice assemblies (available from O'Keefe Controls 
Company) and glass capillary tubing have been found to be adequate for 
this application.

1.5 times the expected concentration as propane; however other span 
values may be used if it can be demonstrated that they would provide 
more accurate measurements. The system shall be capable of meeting or 
exceeding the following specifications:

    2.2.21  Chart recorder (optional). A chart recorder or similar 
device is recommended to provide a continuous analog display of the 
measurement results during the liquid sample analysis.
    2.2.22  Calibration and other gases. For calibration, fuel, and 
combustion air (if required) contained in compressed gas cylinders. All

certified by the manufacturer to <plus-minus>1 percent of the tag value. 
Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder should provide a 
recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over which the 
concentration does not change more than <plus-minus>2 percent from the 
certified value. For calibration gas values not generally available, 
alternative methods for preparing calibration gas mixtures, such as

                 3. Determination of Liquid Input Weight

    3.1  Weight difference. Determine the amount of material introduced 
to the process as the weight difference of the feed material before and 
after each sampling run. In determining the total VOC containing liquid 
usage, account for: (a) The initial (beginning) VOC containing liquid 
mixture; (b) any solvent added during the test run; (c) any coating 
added during the test run; and (d) any residual VOC containing liquid 
mixture remaining at the end of the sample run.
    3.1.1  Identify all points where VOC containing liquids are 
introduced to the process. To obtain an accurate measurement of VOC 
containing liquids, start with an empty fountain (if applicable). After 
completing the run, drain the liquid in the fountain back into the 
liquid drum (if possible), and weigh the drum again. Weigh the VOC 
containing liquids to <plus-minus>0.5 percent of the total weight (full) 
or <plus-minus>0.1 percent of the total weight of VOC containing liquid 
used during the sample run, whichever is less. If the residual liquid 
cannot be returned to the drum, drain the fountain into a preweighted 
empty drum to determine the final weight of the liquid.
    3.1.2  If it is not possible to measure a single representative 
mixture, than weigh the various components separately (e.g., if solvent 
is added during the sampling run, weigh the solvent before it is added 
to the mixture). If a fress drum of VOC containing liquid is needed 
during the run, then weigh both the empty drum and fresh drum.
    3.2  Volume measurement (alternative). If direct weight measurements 
are not feasible, the tester may use volume meters and flow rate meters 
(and density measurements) to determine the weight of liquids used if it 
can be demonstrated that the technique produces results equivalent to 
the direct weight measurements. If a single representative mixture 
cannot be measured, measure the components separately.

            4. Determination of VOC Content in Input Liquids

    4.1  Collection of liquid samples.
    4.1.1  Collect a 100-ml or larger sample of the VOC containing 
liquid mixture at each application location at the beginning and end of 
each test run. A separate sample should be taken of each VOC containing 
liquid added to the application mixture during the test run. If a fresh 
drum is needed during the sampling run, then obtain a sample from the 
fresh drum.
    4.1.2  When collecting the sample, ground the sample container to 
the coating drum. Fill the sample container as close to the rim as 
possible to minimize the amount of headspace.
    4.1.3  After the sample is collected, seal the container so the 
sample cannot leak out or evaporate.
    4.1.4  Label the container to identify clearly the contents.
    4.2  Liquid sample VOC content.
    4.2.1  Assemble the liquid VOC content analysis system as shown in 
Figure 1.
    4.2.2  Permanently identify all of the critical orifices that may be 
used. Calibrate each critical orifice under the expected operating 
conditions (i.e., sample vacuum and temperature) against a volume meter 
as described in section 5.3.
    4.2.3  Label and tare the sample vessels (including the stoppers and 
caps) and the syringes.
    4.2.4  Install an empty sample vessel and perform a leak test of the 
system. Close the carrier gas valve and atmospheric vent and evacuate 
the sample vessel to 250 mm (10 in.) Hg absolute or less using the 
aspirator. Close

[[Page 508]]

the toggle valve at the inlet to the aspirator and observe the vacuum 
for at least one minute. If there is any change in the sample pressure, 
release the vacuum, adjust or repair the apparatus as necessary and 
repeat the leak test.
    4.2.5  Perform the analyzer calibration and linearity checks 
according to the procedure in section 5.1. Record the responses to each 
of the calibration gases and the back-pressure setting of the FIA.
    4.2.6  Establish the appropriate dilution ratio by adjusting the 
aspirator air supply or substituting critical orifices. Operate the 
aspirator at a vacuum of at least 25 mm (1 in.) Hg greater than the 
vacuum necessary to achieve critical flow. Select the dilution ratio so 
that the maximum response of the FIA to the sample does not exceed the 
high-range calibration gas.
    4.2.7  Perform system calibration checks at two levels by 
introducing compressed gases at the inlet to the sample vessel while the 
aspirator and dilution devices are operating. Perform these checks using 
the carrier gas (zero concentration) and the system calibration gas. If 
the response to the carrier gas exceeds <plus-minus>0.5 percent of span, 
clean or repair the apparatus and repeat the check. Adjust the dilution 
ratio as necessary to achieve the correct response to the upscale check, 
but do not adjust the analyzer calibration. Record the identification of 
the orifice, aspirator air supply pressure, FIA back-pressure, and the 
responses of the FIA to the carrier and system calibration gases.
    4.2.8  After completing the above checks, inject the system 
calibration gas for approximately 10 minutes. Time the exact duration of 
the gas injection using a stopwatch. Determine the area under the FIA 
response curve and calculate the system response factor based on the 
sample gas flow rate, gas concentration, and the duration of the 
injection as compared to the integrated response using Equations 2 and 
3.
    4.2.9  Verify that the sample oven and sample line temperatures are 
120<plus-minus>5  deg.C and that the water bath temperature is 
100<plus-minus>5  deg.C.
    4.2.10  Fill a tared syringe with approximately 1 g of the VOC 
containing liquid and weigh it. Transfer the liquid to a tared sample 
vessel. Plug the sample vessel to minimize sample loss. Weigh the sample 
vessel containing the liquid to determine the amount of sample actually 
received. Also, as a quality control check, weigh the empty syringe to 
determine the amount of material delivered. The two coating sample 
weights should agree within <plus-minus>0.02 g. If not, repeat the 
procedure until an acceptable sample is obtained.
    4.2.11  Connect the vessel to the analysis system. Adjust the 
aspirator supply pressure to the correct value. Open the valve on the 
carrier gas supply to the sample vessel and adjust it to provide a 
slight excess flow to the atmospheric vent. As soon as the initial 
response of the FIA begins to decrease, immerse the sample vessel in the 
water bath. (Applying heat to the sample vessel too soon may cause the 
FID response to exceed the calibrated range of the instrument, and thus 
invalidate the analysis.)
    4.2.12  Continuously measure and record the response of the FIA 
until all of the volatile material has been evaporated from the sample 
and the instrument response has returned to the baseline (i.e., response 
less than 0.5 percent of the span value). Observe the aspirator supply 
pressure, FIA back-pressure, atmospheric vent, and other system 
operating parameters during the run; repeat the analysis procedure if 
any of these parameters deviate from the values established during the 
system calibration checks in Section 4.2.7. After each sample perform 
the drift check described in Section 5.2. If the drift check results are 
acceptable, calculate the VOC content of the sample using the equations 
in Section 7. Integrate the area under the FIA response curve, or 
determine the average concentration response and the duration of sample 
analysis.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1  FIA calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the 
back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates 
specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range 
calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the 
proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the 
responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of 
the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 
5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system 
is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity 
check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the 
analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.
    5.2  Systems drift checks. After each sample, repeat the system 
calibration checks in Section 4.2.7 before any adjustments to the FIA or 
measurement system are made. If the zero or calibration drift exceeds 
<plus-minus>3 percent of the span value, discard the result and repeat 
the analysis.
    5.3  Critical orifice calibration.
    5.3.1  Each critical orifice must be calibrated at the specific 
operating conditions that it will be used. Therefore, assemble all 
components of the liquid sample analysis system as shown in Figure 3. A 
stopwatch is also required.

[[Page 509]]

    5.3.2 Turn on the sample oven, sample line, and water bath heaters 
and allow the system to reach the proper operating temperature. Adjust 
the aspirator to a vacuum of 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. Measure the time 
required for one soap bubble to move a known distance and record 
barometric pressure.
    5.3.3 Repeat the calibration procedure at a vacuum of 406 mm (16 
in.) Hg and at 25-mm (1-in.) Hg intervals until three consecutive 
determinations provide the same flow rate. Calculate the critical flow 
rate for the orifice in ml/min at standard conditions. Record the vacuum 
necessary to achieve critical flow.

 Procedure T--Criteria for and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary 
                             Total Enclosure

                             1. Introduction

    1.1  Applicability. This procedure is used to determine whether a 
permanent or temporary enclosure meets the criteria of a total 
enclosure.
    1.2  Principle. An enclosure is evaluated against a set of criteria. 
If the criteria are met and if all the exhaust gases are ducted to a 
control device, then the volatile organic compounds (VOC) capture 
efficiency (CE) is assumed to be 100 percent and CE need not be 
measured. However, if part of the exhaust gas stream is not ducted to a 
control device, CE must be determined.

                             2. Definitions

    2.1  Natural Draft Opening (NDO)--Any permanent opening in the 
enclosure that remains open during operation of the facility and is not 
connected to a duct in which a fan is installed.
    2.2  Permanent Total Enclosure (PTE)--A permanently installed 
enclosure that completely surrounds a source of emissions such that all 
VOC emissions are captured and contained for discharge through a control 
device.
    2.3  Temporary Total Enclosure (TTE)--A temporarily installed 
enclosure that completely surrounds a source of emissions such that all 
VOC emissions are captured and contained for discharge through ducts 
that allow for the accurate measurement of VOC rates.

               3. Criteria of a Temporary Total Enclosure

    3.1  Any NDO shall be at least 4 equivalent opening diameters from 
each VOC emitting point.
    3.2  Any exhaust point from the enclosure shall be at least 4 
equivalent duct or hood diameters from each NDO.
    3.3  The total area of all NDO's shall not exceed 5 percent of the 
surface area of the enclosure's four walls, floor, and ceiling.
    3.4  The average facial velocity (FV) of air through all NDO's shall 
be at least 3,600 m/hr (200 fpm). The direction of air through all NDO's 
shall be into the enclosure.
    3.5  All access doors and windows whose areas are not included in 
section 3.3 and are not included in the calculation in section 3.4 shall 
be closed during routine operation of the process.

               4. Criteria of a Permanent Total Enclosure

    4.1  Same as sections 3.1 and 3.3-3.5.
    4.2  All VOC emissions must be captured and contained for discharge 
through a control device.

                              5. Procedure

    5.1  Determine the equivalent diameters of the NDO's and determine 
the distances from each VOC emitting point to all NDO's. Determine the 
equivalent diameter of each exhaust duct or hood and its distance to all 
NDO's. Calculate the distances in terms of equivalent diameters. The 
number of equivalent diameters shall be at least 4.
    5.2  Measure the total area (A<INF>t</INF>) of the enclosure and the 
total area (A<INF>N</INF>) of all NDO's of the enclosure. Calculate the 
NDO to enclosure area ratio (NEAR) as follows:

NEAR=A<INF>N</INF>/A<INF>t</INF>
    The NEAR must be <ls-thn-eq>0.05.
    5.3  Measure the volumetric flow rate, corrected to standard 
conditions, of each gas stream exiting the enclosure through an exhaust 
duct or hood using EPA Method 2. In some cases (e.g., when the building 
is the enclosure), it may be necessary to measure the volumetric flow 
rate, corrected to standard conditions, of each gas stream entering the 
enclosure through a forced makeup air duct using Method 2. Calculate FV 
using the following equation:

FV=[Q<INF>O</INF> - Q<INF>I</INF>]/A<INF>N</INF>

Where:

Q<INF>O</INF>=the sum of the volumetric flow from all gas streams 
exiting the enclosure through an exhaust duct or hood.
Q<INF>I</INF>=the sum of the volumetric flow from all gas streams into 
the enclosure through a forced makeup air duct; zero, if there is no 
forced makeup air into the enclosure.
A<INF>N</INF>=total area of all NDO's in enclosure.

    The FV shall be at least 3,600 m/hr (200 fpm).
    5.4  Verify that the direction of air flow through all NDO's is 
inward. Use streamers, smoke tubes, tracer gases, etc. Strips of plastic 
wrapping film have been found to be effective. Monitor the direction of 
air flow at intervals of at least 10 minutes for at least 1 hour.

                          6. Quality Assurance

    6.1  The success of this protocol lies in designing the TTE to 
simulate the conditions that exist without the TTE, i.e., the effect of 
the TTE on the normal flow patterns around the affected facility or the 
amount of fugitive VOC emissions should be minimal. The TTE must enclose 
the application stations, coating reservoirs, and all areas from the 
application station to the oven. The oven does not have to be enclosed 
if it is under negative pressure. The NDO's of the temporary enclosure 
and a fugitive exhaust fan must be properly sized and placed.
    6.2  Estimate the ventilation rate of the TTE that best simulates 
the conditions that exist without the TTE, i.e., the effect of the TTE 
on the normal flow patterns around the affected facility or the amount 
of fugitive

[[Page 514]]

VOC emissions should be minimal. Figure 1 may be used as an aid. Measure 
the concentration (C<INF>G</INF>) and flow rate (Q<INF>G</INF>) of the 
captured gas stream, specify a safe concentration (C<INF>F</INF>) for 
the fugitive gas stream, estimate the CE, and then use the plot in 
Figure 1 to determine the volumetric flowrate of the fugitive gas stream 
(Q<INF>F</INF>). A fugitive VOC emission exhaust fan that has a variable 
flow control is desirable.
    6.2.1  Monitor the concentration of VOC into the capture device 
without the TTE. To minimize the effect of temporal variation on the 
captured emissions, the baseline measurement should be made over as long 
a time period as practical. However, the process conditions must be the 
same for the measurement in section 6.2.3 as they are for this baseline 
measurement. This may require short measuring times for this quality 
control check before and after the construction of the TTE.
    6.2.2  After the TTE is constructed, monitor the VOC concentration 
inside the TTE. This concentration shall continue to increase and must 
not exceed the safe level according to OSHA requirements for permissible 
exposure limits. An increase in VOC concentration indicates poor TTE 
design or poor capture efficiency.
    6.2.3  Monitor the concentration of VOC into the capture device with 
the TTE. To limit the effect of the TTE on the process, the VOC 
concentration with and without the TTE must be within <plus-minus>10 
percent. If the measurements do not agree, adjust the ventilation rate 
from the TTE until they agree within 10 percent.

Sec. 52.743  Continuous monitoring.

    (a) Alternative monitoring requirements established under Section 
201.402 of Title 35, IAC must be either: Incorporated into a federally 
enforceable operating permit or construction permit or submitted to 
USEPA for approval as

[[Page 517]]

a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP). Illinois 
shall set forth alternative emissions monitoring and reporting 
requirements to satisfy the intent of 40 CFR part 51, appendix P 
whenever Illinois exempts any source subject to Section 201.401 from 
installing continuous emission monitoring systems. Illinois may exempt a 
source if the source cannot install a continuous emission monitoring 
system because of physical plant limitations or extreme economic 
reasons, according to the criteria of Section 201.402.
    (b) As codified at 40 CFR 52.737 (USEPA's approval of the Illinois 
operating permit program for the purpose of issuing federally 
enforceable construction and operating permits), USEPA reserves the 
right to deem an operating permit not federally enforceable. Such a 
determination will be made according to appropriate procedures including 
operating permit requirements promulgated at 54 FR 27274 (June 28, 1989) 
and will be based upon either; the permit, permit approval procedures or 
state or local permit requirements which do not conform with the 
operating permit program requirements or the requirements of USEPA's 
underlying regulations. Among other things, underlying requirements 
include 40 CFR 51.214 and part 51, appendix P and Illinois' approved 
SIP, 40 CFR part 52. Should USEPA deem an operating or construction 
permit containing alternative monitoring requirements not federally 
enforceable, the underlying continuous monitoring requirements at 
Section 201.401 of the State rule would be the Federal requirements 
contained in the SIP to which the source would be subject. This 
interpretation of the impact of an operating permit deemed not federally 
enforceable by USEPA on a source to which it was issued was acknowledged 
by the State in a March 3, 1993, letter from Bharat Mathur, Chief, 
Bureau of Air, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, to Stephen 
Rothblatt, Chief, Regulation Development Branch, Region 5, USEPA.

    (51) On February 7, 1983, Indiana submitted revised opacity limits 
for existing boilers at Olin Corporation, located in Covington, Indiana. 
These ``equivalent visible emission limits'' (EVEL) are approved for as 
long as the SIP mass emission limit determined from 325 IAC 6-2 (October 
6, 1980 submittal) for this source remains in the SIP. See 
Sec. 52.770(c) (6) and (35) and Sec. 52.776(h)(2).

original petition, including Method 9 opacity data.
    (52) On February 23, 1984, the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board 
submitted a revision to Indiana's SO<INF>2</INF> SIP waiving the self-
monitoring requirement for Public Service Indiana's Edwardsport 
Generating Station, as set forth in section 4(a) of Rule 325 IAC 7-1. 
See (c)(19). This revision becomes effective once the Edwardsport 
Station achieves an annual operating capacity of no greater than 10%.
    (53) On October 6, 1980, Indiana submitted revised opacity 
regulation 325 IAC 5-1. It replaces 1972 APC 3 for process sources, 
approved at paragraph (b), and SIP 1974 APC 3 for combustion sources, 
approved in part at subparagraph (c)(14). Indiana does not intend 325 
IAC 5-1 to regulate the emission points in Lake County listed in Table 2 
of 325 IAC 6-1-110.2 (subparagraph (c)(57)). USEPA is disapproving 325 
IAC 5-1 for these sources. Indiana does not intend 325 IAC 5-1 to 
regulate certain coke battery emission sources listed in 325 IAC 11-3 
(subparagraph (c)(42)). USEPA is disapproving 325 IAC 5-1 as it applies 
to the provisions of 325 IAC 11-3 which USEPA disapproved at (c)(42), 
i.e., pushing and quenching sources throughout the State and coke oven 
doors in Lake and Marion Counties. Additionally, Indiana has modified 
325 IAC 5-1 as it applies to the stack emission points in Porter County 
listed at 325 IAC 6-6-4. USEPA disapproved 325 IAC 5-1 as it applies to 
these Porter County sources on February 5, 1987 (52 FR 3640). For those 
source categories where USEPA is disapproving 325 IAC 5-1, they remain 
regulated by the previously approved opacity SIP which consists of SIP 
1974 APC 3 for combustion sources and 1972 APC 3 for process sources. 
Additionally, as long as the Bethlehem Steel Corporation No. 2 Coke Oven 
Battery Underfire Stack EVEL (subparagraph (c)(49)) remains approved, it 
replaces 325 IAC 5-1.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) A letter dated October 6, 1980 from the State of Indiana Air 
Pollution Control Board and 325 IAC 5-1, Visible Emission Limitations, 
State promulgated on August 26, 1980.
    (ii) Additional material.
    (A) February 12, 1985, letter from the Technical Secretary of the 
Air Pollution Control Board committing the State to make certain 
technical changes to 325 IAC 5-1.
    (54) On March 28, 1984, Indiana submitted a revised TSP emission 
limitation for Richmond State Hospital, Wayne County, Indiana. This 
limitation replaces the one in 325 IAC 6-1-14 which was previously 
approved at (c)(34).
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) On January 13, 1984, Indiana issued to Richmond State Hospital 
an amendment to operating permit, 89-04-85-0153, which revised its TSP 
emission limitations for the four boilers to 0.60 lbs/MMBTU with an 
annual total limit of 452 tons/yr.
    (55) On January 30, 1985, Indiana submitted revised VOC regulations 
325 IAC 8-1.1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4 and 8-5 to satisfy certain conditions of 
USEPA's approval.

[[Page 522]]

Those regulations amended those approved at (c)(33) and (c)(34). In 
addition, the applicability of the regulations was extended to cover St. 
Joseph and Elkhart Counties. USEPA is taking no action on changes to 325 
IAC 8-1.1-2(f), Methods of Compliance, and the repeal of 325 IAC 8-5-6, 
Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning, because these exempt the compound 
perchloroethylene from control without the State justifying that such 
exemption is consistent with the Part D reasonably available control 
technology (RACT) requirements.

    Note: If Indiana allows use of a non-USEPA test method in the 
future, its use must be submitted to USEPA as a SIP revision.

    (i) Incorporation by reference.

<R05>
Sec. 52.776  Control strategy: Particulate matter.

    (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since 
the plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the 
secondary standards for particulate matter in the Metropolitan 
Indianapolis Intrastate Region.
    (b) APC 4-R of Indiana's ``Air Pollution Control Regulations'' 
(emission limitation for particulate matter from fuel combustion 
sources), which is part of the control strategy for the secondary 
standards for particulate matter, is disapproved for the Metropolitan 
Indianapolis Intrastate Region since it does not provide the degree of 
control needed to attain and maintain the secondary standards for 
particulate matter. APC 4-R is approved for attainment and maintenance 
of the primary standards for particulate matter in the Metropolitan 
Indianapolis Intrastate Region.
    (c) APC-3 of Indiana's Air Pollution Control Regulations (visible 
emission limitation) is disapproved insofar as the phrase ``for more 
than a cumulative total of 15 minutes in a 24-hour period'' will 
interfere with attainment and maintenance of particulate standards.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Part D--Conditional Approval--The complete Indiana plan for 
Clark, Dearborn, Dubois, Marion (except for coke batteries), St. Joseph, 
Vanderburgh, and Vigo Counties is approved provided that the following 
condition is satisfied:
    (1) The Part D Plan must contain Industrial Fugitive Dust 
Regulations. The State must submit these by July 31, 1982.
    (f) 325 IAC 11-3-2(f), (as amended on August 27, 1981) is not 
approved as it applies to Lake and Marion Counties, insofar as it does 
not meet the requirements of section 172(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act.
    (g) 325 IAC 11-3-2(g) and 11-3-2(h) (as amended on August 27, 1981) 
are disapproved insofar as they do not meet the requirements of section 
110(a)(2)(D) of the Clean Air Act.
    (h) Equivalent Visible Emission Limits (EVEL). (1) A 20% 2-hour 
opacity limit for the underfire stack at Bethlehem Steel Corporation's 
Coke Battery No. 2 in Porter County is approved as an EVEL to determine 
compliance with the 325 IAC 6-2 SIP limit of 0.33 lbs/MMBTU. This EVEL 
is approved for as long as the SIP mass emission limit for this source 
remains the same as determined by 325 IAC 6-2 (October 6, 1980, 
submittal). See Sec. 52.770(c)(6), (35), and (42).
    (2) Revised opacity limits for the boilers at Olin Corporation in 
Warren County are approved at Sec. 52.770(c)(51) as an EVEL to determine 
compliance with the 325 IAC 6-2 SIP limit of 0.80 lbs/MMBTU. This EVEL 
is approved for as long as the SIP mass emission limit for this source 
remains the same as determined by 325 IAC 6-2 (October 6, 1980 
submittal). See Sec. 52.770(c)(6) and (35).
    (i) 325 IAC 6-2.1 is approved with the State's March 27, 1985, 
commitment that any ``bubble'' approved by the State under 325 IAC 6-
2.1-2(b) and 3(b) will also be subject to the State's general ``bubble'' 
regulation, 325 IAC 2-4. The State additionally committed that until 
such time as 325 IAC 2-4 is approved as a part of the SIP, all such 
limits approved under the bubbling provisions of 325 IAC 6-2.1-2(b) and 
3(b) will be submitted as site specific revisions to the SIP. Unless and 
until these emission point specific limits are approved as a portion of 
the SIP, the SIP limit for each individual emission point will remain 
the general limit calculated by means of the formulae in 325 IAC 6-2.1-
2(a) and 3(a), even though a revised emission point specific limit has 
been adopted by Indiana under 325 IAC 6-2.1-2(b) and 3(b). See 
52.770(c)(50).
    (j) The revised Lake County Total Suspended Particulates (TSP) Plan, 
comprised of submittals dated October 11, 1983, October 24, 1983, and 
April 16, 1984, is disapproved because the State did not demonstrate 
that it assures attainment and maintenance of the primary TSP National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards in Lake County, Indiana. See 40 CFR 
51.10(b).

[[Page 541]]

    (k) On January 18, 1984, Indiana submitted a visible emission limit 
on coke oven battery doors and a limit on total dissolved solids content 
of coke quench makeup water for Battery Number One at Citizens Gas and 
Coke Utility in Marion County. These limits are disapproved because they 
are impermissible relaxations of requirements for each new major 
stationary sources, as provided at Sec. 52.21(j)(2) and section 173 of 
the Clean Air Act. See Sec. 52.770(c)(60).
    (l) The revised Porter County TSP plan, as submitted by Indiana on 
October 15, 1984, is disapproved, because the State did not demonstrate 
that it assures the attainment and maintenance of the primary TSP NAAQS 
in Porter County, Indiana. See Sec. 52.770(c)(61).
    (m) The Indiana Part D TSP plan is disapproved insofar as it does 
not contain RACT level opacity limits for certain process fugitive 
sources in TSP nonattainment areas and, therefore, does not meet the 
requirements of section 172 of the Clean Air Act.
    (n) Approval--On June 23, 1988, and July 17, 1989, the State of 
Indiana submitted committal SIPs for particulate matter with an 
aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 micrometers 
(PM<INF>10</INF>) for the Group II areas within Marion and Vigo Counties 
and all of Porter County, respectively. The committal SIPs meet all the 
requirements identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the SIP 
requirements for PM<INF>10</INF> at 52 FR 24681.
    (o) Approval--On November 16, 1988 and September 10, 1992, Indiana 
submitted the following list of control measures for particulate matter 
(PM) already in its State Implementation Plan as a Group III Plan: 326 
IAC 1-3-2, its air monitoring network, its list of possible additional 
sites for PM, its Prevention of Significant Deterioration rules and the 
following control measures which are part of 325 IAC: 2, Permit Review 
Rules; 5-1, Opacity Limitations; 6-1-1 to 6-1-6, Nonattainment Area 
Limitations; 6-1-8, Dearborn County; 6-1-9, Dubois County; 6-1-12, 
Marion County; 6-1-13, Vigo County; 6-1-14, Wayne County; 6-1-15, Howard 
County; 6-1-16, Vandenburgh County; 6-1-17, Clark County; 6-1-18, St. 
Joseph County; 6-2, Particulate Emissions Limitations for Sources of 
Indirect Heating; 6-3, Process Operations; 6-4, Fugitive Dust Emissions; 
11-1, Existing Foundries; 11-4, Fiberglass Insulation Manufacturing; 11-
5, Fluoride Emission Limitations for Existing Primary Aluminum Plants.
    (p) Approval-On January 13, 1993, the State of Indiana submitted a 
particulate matter State Implementation Plan revision for the Vermillion 
County nonattainment area. Additional information was submitted on 
February 22, 1993, and April 8, 1993. These materials demonstrate that 
the plan will provide for attainment of the National ambient air quality 
standards for particulate matter by December 31, 1994, in accordance 
with section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act.
    (q) Approval--On April 8, 1993, and supplemented on June 17, 1997, 
the State of Indiana submitted a maintenance plan and a request that 
sections 15, 16, 21, 22, 27, 28, 33 and 34 of Clinton Township in 
Vermillion County be redesignated to attainment of the National Ambient 
Air Quality Standard for particulate matter. The redesignation request 
and maintenance plan satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean 
Air Act.

<R05>
Sec. 52.777  Control strategy: photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons).

    (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met 
because the plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards for photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons) in the 
Metropolitan Indianapolis Intrastate Region by May 31, 1975.
    (b) The requirements of subpart G are not met by Revised APC-15 
(November 8, 1974 submission) because it does not provide for attainment 
and maintenance of the photochemical oxidant (hydrocarbon) standards 
throughout Indiana.
    (c) Part D--Conditional approval--The 1979 Indiana plan for Clark, 
Floyd, Elkhart, Lake, Marion, Porter, and St.

[[Page 542]]

Joseph Counties is approved provided the following conditions are 
satisfied:
    (1) The plan for stationary source volatile organic compound control 
must contain the following:
    (i)-(iv) [Reserved]
    (v) For regulation 325 IAC 8-5, Section 6, Perchloroethylene Dry 
Cleaning, the State must conduct a study to demonstrate that the 1,500 
gallons exemption meets RACT requirements and submit the results to EPA 
within 6 months of the effective date of final rulemaking on 325 IAC 8 
for VOC from Group II CTG source categories. If the demonstrated 
emissions resulting from the State's exemption are not essentially 
equivalent to those resulting from the RACT requirements, then the State 
must submit to EPA by July 1, 1983, a rule which requires control of 
emissions from dry cleaning sources using less than 1,500 gallons of 
perchloroethylene per year.
    (2) The stationary source volatile organic control measures 
submitted by the State on October 23, 1990, and August 19, 1991, are 
approved as described in 40 CFR 52.770(c)(87) with the exception of 326 
IAC 8-5-4 Pneumatic Rubber Tire Manufacturing, on which USEPA has taken 
no action. It should be noted that although the State's control measures 
provide that equivalent test methods, alternative emission controls, and 
revisions in rule applicability must be submitted to the USEPA as 
proposed revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP), such proposed 
SIP revisions are not part of the SIP unless and until they are approved 
as such by the USEPA.
    (d) Part D--Disapproval. The 1982 Indiana plan for Lake and Porter 
County is disapproved because it does not assure the attainment and 
maintenance of the NAAQS there. See Secs. 52.770(c)(69) and 52.773(i). 
The disapproval does not affect USEPA's approval (or conditional 
approval) of individual parts of Indiana's ozone plan and they remain 
approved.
    (e) Approval--The Administrator approves the incorporation of the 
photochemical assessment ambient monitoring system submitted by Indiana 
on November 15, 1993, into the Indiana State Implementation Plan. This 
submittal satisfies 40 CFR 58.20(f), which requires the State to provide 
for the establishment and maintenance of photochemical assessment 
monitoring stations (PAMS) by November 12, 1993.
    (f) Approval. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management 
submitted two ozone redesignation requests and maintenance plans 
requesting the ozone nonattainment areas to be redesignated to 
attainment for ozone: South Bend/Elkhart (St. Joseph and Elkhart 
Counties), submitted on September 22, 1993; Indianapolis (Marion 
County), submitted on November 12, 1993. The redesignation requests and 
maintenance plans meet the redesignation requirements in section 
107(d)(3)(d) of the Act as amended in 1990. The redesignations meet the 
Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a 
revision to the Indiana Ozone State Implementation Plan for the above 
mentioned counties.
    (g) The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been 
satisfied for the following areas: Vanderburgh County in the Evansville 
Metropolitan Area; Marion County in the Indianapolis Metropolitan Area; 
and St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties in the South Bend Metropolitan Area.
    (h) On November 17, 1993, Indiana submitted two of three elements 
required by section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 to 
be incorporated as part of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) State 
Implementation Plan intended to offset any growth in emissions from a 
growth in vehicle miles traveled. These elements are the offsetting of 
growth in emissions attributable to growth in VMT which was due November 
15, 1992, and, any transportation control measures (TCMs) required as 
part of Indiana's 15 percent reasonable further progress (RFP) plan 
which was due November 15, 1993. Indiana satisfied the first requirement 
by projecting emissions from mobile sources and demonstrating that no 
increase in emissions would take place. Indiana satisfied the second 
requirement by determining that no TCMs were required as part of 
Indiana's 15 percent RFP plan.
    (i) Approval--EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>)

[[Page 543]]

reasonably available control technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), 
vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general conformity exemptions 
for the Indiana portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County severe ozone 
nonattainment area as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, 
Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. This approval does 
not cover the exemption of NO<INF>X</INF> transportation conformity 
requirements of section 176(c) for this area. Approval of these 
exemptions is contingent on the results of the final ozone attainment 
demonstration expected to be submitted in mid-1997. The approval will be 
modified if the final attainment demonstration demonstrates that 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls are needed in the nonattainment area to 
attain the ozone standard in the Lake Michigan Ozone Study modeling 
domain.
    (j) The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been 
satisfied for Lake and Porter Counties, Indiana.
    (k) On June 26, 1995, and June 13, 1997, Indiana submitted a 15 
percent rate-of-progress plan for the Lake and Porter Counties portion 
of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County ozone nonattainment area. This plan 
satisfies the counties' requirements under section 182(b)(1) of the 
Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990.
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) On July 12, 1995, Indiana submitted a 15 percent rate-of-
progress plan for the Clark and Floyd Counties portion of the Louisville 
ozone nonattainment area. This plan satisfies Clark and Floyd Counties' 
requirements under section 182(b) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 
1990.
    (n) On July 12, 1995, Indiana submitted corrections to the 1990 base 
year emissions inventory for Clark and Floyd Counties. The July 12, 
1995, corrections are recognized revisions to Indiana's emissions 
inventory.
    (o) On July 12, 1995, Indiana submitted as a revision to the Indiana 
State Implementation Plan a ridesharing transportation control measure 
which affects commuters in Clark and Floyd Counties.
    (p) On August 26, 1996, Indiana submitted a rule for the purpose of 
meeting oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control 
technology (RACT) requirements under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act 
(Act) for the Clark and Floyd Counties moderate ozone nonattainment 
area. The rule's NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements meets RACT for 
major sources of portland cement kilns, electric utility boilers, and 
industrial, commercial, or institutional boilers. In addition, on April 
30, 1997, Indiana certified to the satisfaction of the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency that, to the best of the State's 
knowledge, there are no remaining major sources of NO<INF>X</INF> in 
Clark and Floyd Counties which need RACT rules. Indiana, therefore, has 
satisfied the NO<INF>X</INF> RACT requirements under section 182(f) of 
the Act for the Clark and Floyd Counties ozone nonattainment area.
    (q) Approval--On February 5, 1997, Indiana submitted a 
transportation control measure under section 108(f)(1)(A) of the Clean 
Air Amendments of 1990 for Vanderburgh County, Indiana to aid in 
reducing emissions of precursors of ozone. The transportation control 
measure being approved as a revision to the ozone state implementation 
plan is the conversion of at least 40 vehicles from gasoline as a fuel 
to compressed natural gas.
    (r) Indiana's November 15, 1996, request for a 1-year attainment 
date extension for the Indiana portion of the Louisville moderate ozone 
nonattainment area which consists of Clark and Floyd Counties is 
approved. The date for attaining the ozone standard in these counties is 
November 15, 1997.
    (s) Approval--On November 4, 1993, the State of Indiana submitted a 
maintenance plan and a request that Vanderburgh County be redesignated 
to attainment of the 1-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard for 
ozone. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the 
redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Clean Air Act 
as amended in 1990. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Indiana 
ozone State Implementation Plan.
    (t) Approval--On May 24, 1996, the Indiana Department of 
Environmental

[[Page 544]]

Management submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan 
for Lake and Porter Counties. The submittal pertained to a plan for the 
implementation of the Federal transportation conformity requirements in 
accordance with 40 CFR part 51 subpart T--Conformity to State or Federal 
Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects 
Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal 
Transit Act.
    (u) On December 17, 1997, and January 22, 1998, Indiana submitted 
the Post-1996 rate-of-progress plan for the Lake and Porter Counties 
portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County ozone nonattainment area. This 
plan satisfies the counties' requirements under section 182(c)(2)(B) of 
the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. The plan contains a 1999 mobile 
source vehicle emission budget for volatile organic compounds of 40,897 
pounds per average summer day.
    (v) Negative declarations--Aerospace coating operations, industrial 
clean up solvents, industrial wastewater processes, offset lithography 
operations, business plastics, automotive plastics, and synthetic 
organic chemical manufacturing industries (SOCMI) batch processes, 
reactors and distillation units categories. On November 8, 1999, the 
State of Indiana certified to the satisfaction of the Environmental 
Protection Agency that no major sources categorized as part of the nine 
categories listed above and have a potential to emit 100 tons or more of 
volatile organic compounds annually are located in Clark or Floyd 
Counties in southeast Indiana, adjacent to Louisville, Kentucky.
    (w) Negative declarations--Aerospace coating operations, industrial 
clean up solvents, industrial wastewater processes, offset lithography 
operations, business plastics, automotive plastics, and synthetic 
organic chemical manufacturing industries (SOCMI) batch processes, 
reactors and distillation units categories. On November 8, 1999, and 
January 10, 2000, the State of Indiana certified to the satisfaction of 
the Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources categorized as 
part of the nine categories listed above and have a potential to emit 25 
tons or more of volatile organic compounds annually are located in Lake 
or Porter Counties in northwest Indiana.

Sec. 52.780  Review of new sources and modifications.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.160(a) of this chapter are not met 
in that the plan does not contain procedures to enable the State to 
determine whether construction or modification of coal burning equipment 
having a heat input of between 350,000 Btu per hour and 1,500,000 Btu 
per hour will result in violations of applicable portions of the control

    (g) Delegation of authority. (1) The Administrator shall have the 
authority to delegate responsibility for implementing the procedures for 
conducting source review pursuant to this section in accordance with 
paragraphs (f) (2), (3), and (4) of this section.
    (2) Where the Administrator delegates the responsibility for 
implementing the procedures for conducting source review pursuant to 
this section to any Agency, other than a Regional Office of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, a copy of the notice pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section shall be sent to the Administrator 
through the appropriate Regional Office.
    (3) In accordance with Executive Order 11752, the Administrator's 
authority for implementing the procedures for conducting source review 
pursuant to this section shall not be delegated, other than to a 
Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, for new or 
modified sources which are owned or operated by the Federal Government 
or for new or modified sources located on Federal lands; except that, 
with respect to the latter category, where new or modified sources are 
constructed or operated on Federal lands pursuant to leasing or other 
Federal agreements, the Federal Land Manager may at his discretion, to 
the extent permissible under applicable statutes and regulations, 
require the lessee or permittee to be subject to new source review 
requirements which have been delegated to a State or local agency 
pursuant to this paragraph.
    (4) The Administrator's authority for implementing the procedures 
for conducting source review pursuant to this section shall not be

his authority to the States in accordance with paragraphs (g) (2), (3), 
and (4) of this section.
    (h) On March 7, 1994, Indiana requested a revision to the State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) for New Source Review (NSR) to satisfy the 
requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Indiana 326 
IAC regulations do not include a definition of ``federally 
enforceable''. On July 13, 1994, Pamela Carter, Attorney General of the 
State of Indiana, sent a letter to USEPA clarifying Indiana's 
interpretation of the definition of federally enforceable. The letter 
states that federally enforceable, e.g. as used in 326 IAC 2-3-1, should 
be interpreted in accordance with the federal definition at 40 CFR 
51.165(a)(1)(xiv). The USEPA took the opportunity of rulemaking on the 
State's submittal to recodify the permitting SIP to conform to Title 326 
the Indiana Administrative Code.

[[Page 549]]

rarely used on public streets and highways (such as classic or antique 
vehicles) may be exempted.
    (2) Provisions for regulatory criteria that are consistent with 
achieving an 11 percent reduction of hydrocarbon emissions from light-
duty vehicles.
    (3) Provisions ensuring that failed vehicles receive, within 30 
days, the maintenance necessary to achieve compliance with the 
inspection standards. These provisions shall impose sanctions against 
owners of non-complying vehicles, require retest of failed vehicles 
following maintenance, require a suitable distinctive tag or sticker for 
display on complying vehicles, and include such other measures as are 
necessary or appropriate.
    (4) Provisions establishing a certification program to ensure that 
testing stations performing the required tests have the necessary 
equipment and knowledgeable operators to perform the tests 
satisfactorily, imposing sanctions against non-complying testing 
stations, and containing such other measures as necessary or appropriate 
to a testing program.
    (5) Provisions prohibiting vehicles from being intentionally 
readjusted or modified subsequent to the inspection and/or maintenance 
in such a way as would cause them no longer to comply with the 
inspection standards. These may include authorization of spot checks of 
idle adjustments or of a suitable type of physical seal or tag on 
vehicles. These provisions shall include appropriate penalties for 
violation by any person.
    (6) Designation of agency or agencies responsible for conducting, 
overseeing, and enforcing the inspection/maintenance program. Private 
parties may be designated to conduct parts of the program to certify 
compliance.

to the inspection program established pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section that does not comply with the applicable standards and 
procedures adopted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) After July 1, 1976, no person shall operate or allow the 
operation of any motor vehicle subject to the inspection program 
established pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section that does not 
comply with the applicable standards and procedures adopted in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (g) No later than October 1, 1974, the State of Indiana, County of 
Marion, and the Consolidated City of Indianapolis shall jointly submit 
to the Administrator, for his approval, a detailed compliance schedule 
showing the steps they will take to establish, operate and enforce the 
inspection program required by paragraph (c) of this section including:
    (1) A detailed description of the inspection program required by 
paragraph (c) of this section (including a description of the way in 
which the program will be established, operated, and enforced and the 
respective responsibilities of the State, county, and municipalities for 
such tasks).
    (2) A description of the legal authority for establishing and 
enforcing the inspection/maintenance program, including the text of 
proposed or adopted legislation and regulations.
    (3) Specific dates (day, month, and year) by which various steps to 
implement the inspection/maintenance system will be completed, such 
steps to include, at a minimum, the following: submitting final plans 
and specifications for the system to the Administrator for this approval 
(this date to be no later than February 1, 1975), ordering necessary 
equipment (this date to be no later than April 15, 1975), commencement 
of onsite construction and/or installation, and system operational (this 
date to be no later than April 15, 1975, commencement of onsite 
construction and/ior installation, and system operational (this date to 
be no later than July 1, 1975).

    (c) No person shall transfer or permit the transfer of gasoline from 
any delivery vessel into any stationary source container with a capacity 
greater than 250 gallons unless such container is equipped with a 
submerged fill pipe and unless the displaced vapors from the storage 
container are processed by a control system that prevents release to the 
atmosphere of no less than 90 percent by weight of organic compounds in 
said vapors displaced from the stationary storage container location. 
The control system shall include one or more of the following:
    (1) A vapor-tight return line from the storage container to the 
delivery vessel and a system that will ensure that the vapor return line 
is connected before gasoline can be transferred into the container. If a 
``vapor-balance return'' system is used to meet the requirements of this 
section, the system shall be so constructed as to be readily adapted to 
retrofit with an adsorption system, refrigeration-condensation system or 
equivalent system connected to the stationary storage container.
    (2) Refrigeration-condensation sys- tem or adsorption system 
connected to the stationary storage container.
    (3) An equivalent system, approved by the Administrator or his 
designee, designed to recover or eliminate no less than 90 percent by 
weight of the organic compounds in the displaced vapor.
    (d) No person shall own or operate a delivery vessel containing 
gasoline unless the delivery vessel is so designed and maintained as to 
be vapor-tight at all times. This paragraph (d) shall not apply to 
delivery vessels in transit through Marion County which neither are 
filled nor deliver gasoline therein, nor shall this paragraph (d) be 
construed to prohibit safety-valves on other devices required by 
governmental safety regulations. Delivery vessels which are filled in 
Marion County but do not deliver in Marion County may be controlled only 
for filling.
    (e) No person shall own or operate a facility for the filling of 
delivery vessels with gasoline unless the facility is equipped with a 
control system, which can recover or eliminate at least 90 percent by 
weight of the organic compounds in the vapors displaced from the 
delivery vessel during refilling. Facilities which have a daily 
throughput of 20,000 gallons or less are required to have a vapor 
recovery system in operation no later than May 31, 1977. Delivery 
vessels and storage containers served exclusively by facilities required 
to have a vapor recovery system in operation no later than May 31, 1977, 
also will be required to meet the provisions of this section no later 
than May 31, 1977.
    (f) After March 1, 1976, no person shall intentionally release 
gasoline vapors from a delivery vessel, except to a control system that 
can recover or eliminate at least 90 percent by weight of organic 
compounds in the vapors released.

(d), or (e) of this section, shall not be a violation of paragraph (c), 
(d), or (e), respectively, if the following acts shall be completed with 
respect to such source before the following dates:
    (1) October 1, 1974. The owner of the source or his designee shall 
submit to the Administrator, a final control plan, which describes at a 
minimum the steps that will be taken by the source to achieve compliance 
with the applicable provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this 
section.
    (2) March 1, 1975. Negotiate and sign all necessary contracts for

paragraph (h) of this section:
    (1) The owner of a source which is in compliance with the provisions 
of paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, shall certify such 
compliance to the Administrator by October 1, 1974. The Administrator 
may request whatever supporting information he considers necessary for 
proper certification.
    (2) A source for which a compliance schedule is adopted by the State 
and approved by the Administrator may operate in conformity with such 
compliance schedule.
    (3) The owner of a source may submit to the Administrator, by 
October 1, 1974, a proposed alternative compliance schedule. No such 
schedule may provide for compliance after March 1, 1976. Until 
promulgated by the Administrator, such source shall conform with 
applicable portions of paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (h) of this section. 
Upon promulgation of the compliance schedule by the Administrator, no 
person shall own or operate the source except in conformity with the 
promulgated schedule.
    (j) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Administrator from 
promulgating a separate schedule for any source to which the application 
of the compliance schedule in paragraph (h) of this section fails to 
satisfy the requirements of Sec. 51.15 (b) and (c) of this chapter.
    (k) Any new container, facility, or vessel subject to this

Sec. 52.794  Source surveillance.

    (a) The requirements of 51.212 of this chapter are not met by the 
phrase ``for more than a cumulative total of 15 minutes in a 24-hour 
period'' contained in section 1 of APC-3 of the Indiana Air Pollution 
Control Regulations.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) 325 IAC 5-1 (October 6, 1980, submittal--Sec. 52.770(c)(53)) is 
disapproved for the Lake County sources specifically listed in Table 2 
of 325 IAC 6-1-10.2 (Sec. 52.770(c)(57)); for pushing and quenching 
sources throughout the State (August 27, 1981, 325 IAC 11-3-2 (g) and 
(h)--Sec. 52.770(c)(42)); and for coke oven doors in Lake and Marion 
Counties (325 IAC 11-3-2(f)--Sec. 52.770(c)(42)). Applicability of this 
regulation to these sources is being disapproved because 325 IAC 5-1 
does not meet the enforceability requirements of Sec. 51.22 as it 
applies to these sources. Opacity limits in 325 IAC 6-1-10.2 and certain 
opacity limits in 325 IAC 11-3 supersede those in 325 IAC 5-1, and USEPA 
has previously disapproved these superseding regulations (Sec. 52.776 
(j), (g), and (f), respectively).

Sec. 52.795  Control strategy: Sulfur dioxide.

    (a) Revised APC-13 (December 5, 1974 submission) of Indiana's Air 
Pollution Control regulations (sulfur dioxide emission limitation) is 
disapproved insofar as the provisions identified below will interfere 
with the attainment and maintenance of the suffix dioxide ambient air 
quality standards:
    (1) The phrase ``equivalent full load'' in section 1(b)(2).
    (2) The formula ``E<INF>p</INF>=17.0 Q<INF>m<SUP> 0.67</SUP></INF> 
where E<INF>p</INF>=E<INF>m</INF> x Q<INF>m</INF>'' in section 2(a).
    (3) The phrase ``Direct fired process operations'' in sections 2(a), 
3(c), 4(b), and 4(c).
    (4) The modification of Q<INF>m</INF> for non-Indiana coal as 
expressed in Section 2(a).
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.281 are not met by Warrick and 
Culley electrical generating stations enforcement orders which would 
revise the sulfur dioxide emission limitations for these two stations.
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 51.110(e) are not met by Wayne, 
Dearborn, Jefferson, Porter, and Warrick Counties.
    (d)--(e) [Reserved]
    (f) Approval--On March 14, 1996, the State of Indiana submitted a 
maintenance plan for Lawrence, Washington, and Warren Townships in 
Marion County and the remainder of the county, and requested that it be 
redesignated to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard 
for sulfur dioxide. The redesignation request and maintenance plan 
satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
    (g) Approval--On June 17, 1996, the State of Indiana submitted a 
maintenance plan for LaPorte, Vigo, and Wayne Counties and requested 
redesignation to attainment for the National

Sec. 52.796  Industrial continuous emission monitoring.

    (a) APC-8, Appendix I 1.2.3, 3.3, and 6.0 are disapproved because 
they do not meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.214.
    (b)(1) The requirements of 40 CFR 51, Appendix P 3.3 are hereby 
incorporated and made a part of the applicable implementation plan for 
the State of Indiana.
    (2) APC-8 does not apply to any source scheduled for retirement by 
October 6, 1980, or within five years after the promulgation of 
continuous emission monitoring requirements for that source category in 
40 CFR part 51, Appendix P 1.1, provided that adequate evidence and 
guarantees are provided that clearly show that the source will cease 
operations on or before such date.

Sec. 52.797  Control strategy: Lead.

    (a)-(b) [Reserved]
    (c) On January 12, 1988, Indiana'a Office of Air Management (OAM), 
Indiana Department of Environmental Management, agreed to review all 
relevant hood designs and performance guidance to determine which 
criteria to use in determining ongoing compliance with the capture 
efficiency provisions in 326 IAC 15-1 for Quemetco, Inc., and Refined 
Metals. Because these efficiencies are closely related to equipment 
design, OAM believes that a review of the process and control equipment 
designs and operating paramenters should provide the necessary 
determination of compliance. OAM will work with the Indianapolis local 
agency, the Indianapolis Air Pollution Control Division, on viable 
alternatives and will keep USEPA up to date on its progress. OAM 
anticipates that specific criteria for determining compliance will be 
incorporated into the sources' operation permits (and forwarded to USEPA 
for informational purposes), and, should the opportunity arise, 326 IAC 
15-1 will be revised to similarly incorporate capture efficiency 
criteria.
    (d) On March 2, 2000, Indiana submitted a maintenance plan for 
Marion County as part of its request to redesignate the County to 
attainment of the lead standard.

Sec. 52.822  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Iowa's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national 
standards. Further, the Administrator finds the plan satisfies all 
requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1977, except as noted below.

Sec. 52.823  PM<INF>10</INF> State Implementation Plan Development in Group II Areas.

    The Iowa Department of Natural Resources committed to comply with 
the PM<INF>10</INF> regulations as set forth in 40 CFR part 51. In a 
letter to Morris Kay, EPA, dated October 28, 1988, Mr. Larry J. Wilson, 
Director, Iowa Department of Natural Resources, stated:

    Three groups within the State of Iowa have been classified as Group 
II areas for fine particulate (PM-10) State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
development purposes. This includes portions of the cities of Des 
Moines, Mason City, and Cedar Rapids. The specific boundaries of these 
areas were identified in a letter of October 13, 1987, from Peter R. 
Hamlin to Carl Walter. The remainder of the State was classified as 
Group III.
    In accordance with the SIP development procedures identified in the 
preamble of the PM-10 regulations for Implementing Revised Particulate 
Matter Standards, promulgated July 1, 1987, the State of Iowa commits to 
perform the following activities in these three Group II areas of the 
state:

    (a) Gather ambient PM-10 data, to an extent consistent with minimum 
EPA requirements (note the network description contained in a letter of 
January 26, 1988, from Peter R. Hamlin to John Helvig).
    (b) Analyze and verify the ambient PM-10 data and report exceedances 
of the 24-hour PM-10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to 
the Regional Office within 60 days of each exceedance.
    (c) Immediately notify the Regional Office:
    (1) Upon the availability of an appropriate number of verifiable 24-
hour NAAQS exceedances to indicate a violation (see Section 2.0 of the 
PM-10 SIP development guideline) or
    (2) when an annual arithmetic mean (AAM) above the annual PM-10 
NAAQS becomes available.
    (d) Within thirty (30) days of any notification of the Regional 
Office pursuant to (c) above (or upon collection of thirty-six (36) 
months of PM-10 ambient air quality data acceptable to EPA, whichever 
comes first) determine whether the measures in the existing SIP will 
assure timely attainment and maintenance of the primary PM-10 NAAQS and 
immediately notify the Regional Office of the results of this 
determination.
    (e) Within six (6) months of any notification pursuant to (d) above, 
adopt and submit to EPA a PM-10 control strategy that assures attainment 
as expeditiously as practicable but not later than three (3) years from 
approval of the Committal SIP.

    Because of the uncertainty about when the determination can be made 
pursuant to (d)

[[Page 559]]

above, it is difficult to determine if that control strategy could 
provide for the attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS within three years from 
the date EPA approves thisCommittal SIP. Therefore, I reserve the right 
to request a two-year extension of the attainment date as provided in 
Section 110(e) of the Clean Air Act, if and when the State of Iowa 
submits a SIP revision for any of these areas of the state.
    The State of Iowa also commits to develop a PM-10 emission inventory 
for the areas submitted as part of any PM-10 SIP pursuant to items (c), 
(d), and (e) above. If the PM-10 NAAQS are not violated, the State of 
Iowa will proceed with this inventory for the three Group II areas in 
accordance with the following schedule:

October 1, 1988--Request special assistance funds from EPA to perform 
the inventory.
October 1, 1989--Initiate inventory.
August 1, 1990--Complete inventory.
October 31, 1990*--Submit inventory as part of a determination of 
adequacy that the current SIP will attain and maintain the PM-10 NAAQS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *Presuming that sufficient ambient data acceptable to EPA are 
collected by July 31, 1990, and available by September 30, 1990.

City Ozone Maintenance Area are conditionally approved. This includes a 
commitment to implement the additional reductions as expeditiously as 
practicable. Full approval of the SIP is conditioned upon receipt of one 
of the following by June 28, 2000: a request from the Governor of Kansas 
to require the sale of Federal reformulated gasoline within the Kansas 
portion of the Kansas City Maintenance Area; adopted regulations 
implementing the contingency measures identified in the 1992 maintenance 
plan, i.e., Stage II Vapor Recovery or an Enhanced Inspection and 
Maintenance Program; or any combination of adopted regulations that will 
achieve the minimum volatile organic compound reductions (8.4 tons per 
day) required by the contingency measures identified in the 1992 SIP. In 
the case of options 2 or 3, upon receipt of regulations implementing 
these provisions and a request to amend the maintenance plan 
accordingly, EPA will initiate a rulemaking on this subsequent revision. 
If the state fails to submit one of the above requirements within the 
time specified, the conditional approval automatically converts to a 
disapproval without further regulatory action.

Sec. 52.872  Operating permits.

    Emission limitations and related provisions which are established in 
Kansas operating permits as Federally enforceable conditions shall be 
enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not 
Federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to 
appropriate procedures and be based upon the permit, permit approval 
procedures, or permit requirements which do not conform with the 
operating permit program requirements or the requirements of EPA 
underlying regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 52.873  Approval status.

    (a) The Kansas portion of the Kansas City metropolitan area was 
designated as nonattainment for ozone in 40 CFR part 81. Therefore, the 
Administrator approves continuation of the 7.8 RVP limit as federally 
enforceable in the Kansas City metropolitan area, even after the area is 
redesignated to attainment, because of its nonattainment designation 
effective January 6, 1992. Also, the requirement for 7.8 psi RVP 
volatility is deemed necessary to ensure attainment and maintenance of 
the ozone standard as demonstrated by the emissions inventory 
projections (based on use of 7.8 psi RVP) in Kansas' ozone maintenance 
plan for the Kansas City metropolitan area.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The Administrator approves Rule K.A.R. 28-19-31 as identified at 
Sec. 52.870(c)(29), with the understanding that any alternative 
compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved by EPA as 
individual SIP revisions.

<R05>
Sec. 52.874  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met 
since authority to make emission data available to the public is 
inadequate. Kansas Statutes Annotated 65-3015 would require confidential 
treatment if the data related to processes or production unique to the 
owner or would tend to affect adversely the competitive position of the 
owner.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.232(b) of this chapter are not met 
since the following deficiencies exist in the local agency legal 
authority:
    (1) Kansas City, Kans.-Wyandotte County Health Department. (i) 
Authority to make emission data available to the public is inadequate 
because the Kansas Statutes Annotated 65-3016 provides a designated 
local air quality conservation authority with the same authority as the 
State (Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter).
    (2) Topeka-Shawnee County Health Department. (i) Authority to make 
emission data available to the public is inadequate because the Kansas 
Statutes Annotated 65-3016 provides a designated air quality 
conservation authority with the same authority as the State 
(Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter).
    (3) Wichita-Sedgwick County Health Department. (i) Authority to make 
emission data available to the public is inadequate because the Kansas 
Statutes Annotated 65-3016 provides a designated local air quality 
conservation

authority with the same authority as the State (Sec. 51.230(f) of this 
chapter).
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met 
since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or 
operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or 
combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions 
of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance 
of a national air quality standard is not adequate.

    (20) Revisions to the ozone attainment plan for the Kansas City 
metropolitan area were submitted by the Governor on July 2, 1986. 
Pursuant to this plan, revised regulations for the control of volatile 
organic compound emissions were submitted by the Secretary of the Kansas 
Department of Health and Environment on January 6, 1988. In numerous 
instances, the revised Kansas regulations provide for departmental 
discretion to approve compliance plans and test methods which are 
alternatives to the EPA reference methods. EPA approves these 
regulations with the understanding that all such alternative compliance 
plans and test methods must be submitted to EPA, and approved, as 
individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the 
enforceable requirements of the SIP shall be the emission limits or 
reduction requirements stated in the regulations. Also, the Kansas 
regulations contain provisions whereby testing is required when the 
facility intends to demonstrate compliance by improved operations or new 
emission controls, yet no test procedures are specified. Examples of 
such provisions are transfer efficiency (TE) and vapor processing 
systems. Test methods which are developed by the state must be approved 
by EPA before facilities may demonstrate compliance through alternative 
controls and/or TE.

Sec. 52.876  Compliance schedules.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.260 and of Sec. 51.15(a)(2) of this 
chapter as of September 19, 1976 (40 FR 43216), are not met since the 
plan does not contain legally enforceable compliance schedules setting 
forth the dates by which all stationary sources or categories of such 
sources must be in compliance with applicable portions of the control 
strategy. Paragraphs C and D of Kansas Regulation 28-19-9 specify that 
all sources not in compliance must submit an acceptable compliance 
schedule within 120 days after receiving notification from the State. 
There are no assurances that all sources will be notified by the State 
in a timely manner, therefore, paragraphs C and D of Regulation 28-19-9 
are disapproved.
    (b) Federal compliance schedule. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(2) of this paragraph (b), the owner or operator of any stationary 
source subject to any emission regulation which is part of the approved 
plan shall be in compliance on or before January 31, 1974.
    (i) Any owner or operator in compliance with any such applicable 
regulation on the effective date of this paragraph shall certify such 
compliance to the Administrator no later than December 31, 1972.
    (ii) Any owner or operator who achieves compliance with any such 
applicable regulation after the effective date of this paragraph shall 
certify such compliance to the Administrator within 5 days of the date 
compliance is achieved.
    (2) An owner or operator of a stationary source subject to any 
emission regulation approved by the Administrator may no later than 
December 31, 1972, submit to the Administrator for approval a proposed 
compliance schedule that demonstrates compliance with such regulation as 
expeditiously as practicable, but no later than July 31, 1975. The 
compliance schedule shall provide for periodic increments of progress 
toward compliance. The dates for achievement of such increments shall be 
specified. Increments of progress shall include, but not be limited to: 
Letting of necessary contracts for construction or process changes, if 
applicable; initiation of construction; completion and startup of 
control systems; performance tests; and submittal of performance test 
analysis and results.
    (3) Any owner or operator who submits a compliance schedule pursuant 
to this paragraph shall, within 5 days after the deadline for each 
increment of progress, certify to the Administrator whether or not the 
required increment of the approved compliance schedule has been met.
    (4) Any compliance schedule adopted by the State and approved by the 
Administrator shall satisfy the requirements of this paragraph for the 
affected source.
    (c) State compliance schedules. (1) [Reserved]
    (2) The compliance schedules identified below are disapproved as not 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 51.102 or subpart N of this chapter. 
All regulations cited are air pollution control regulations of the 
state, unless otherwise noted.

Sec. 52.922  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.923  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Kentucky's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all

[[Page 586]]

requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the 
requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the 
adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the 
sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and 
adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT 
requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) New Source review permits issued pursuant to Section 173 of the 
Clean Air Act will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of 
Section V of Appendix S of 40 CFR part 51 are met.

[45 FR 72157, Oct. 31, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 52.924  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met 
since K.R.S. 224.380 of the Air Pollution Control Law of the 
Commonwealth of Kentucky (June 18, 1970) does not provide for the 
release, under certain circumstances, of emission data to the public.
    (b) Delegation of Authority: Pursuant to section 114 of the Act, 
Kentucky requested a delegation of authority to enable it to collect, 
correlate, and release emission data to the public. The Administrator 
has determined that Kentucky is qualified to receive a delegation of the 
authority it requested. Accordingly, the Administrator delegates to 
Kentucky his authority under section 114(a) (1) and (2) and section 
114(c) of the Act, i.e., authority to collect, correlate, and release 
emission data to the public.

<R05>
Sec. 52.925  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission 
data is inadequate.

Sec. 52.930  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) The VOC bubble for Alcan Foil Products in Louisville submitted 
as a SIP revision on March 3, 1986, is disapproved. The source must 
continue to meet all the requirements of Jefferson County Regulation 
6.29.
    (b) Part D--disapproval--(1) Campbell and Kenton Counties 
nonattainment area. The 1979 SIP revisions for these two counties are 
disapproved because the Commonwealth failed to submit evidence of legal 
authority to implement a vehicle inspection and maintenance program as 
required under section 172(b)(11)(B) of the Clean Air Act. No major new 
or modified sources of volatile organic compounds can be built in these 
two counties by virtue of the provisions of section 110(a)(2)(l) of the 
Clean Air Act.
    (2) Northern Kentucky (Boone, Campbell and Kenton Counties) ozone 
nonattainment area. The demonstration of attainment of the ozone 
standards by the end of 1982, submitted as part of

[[Page 589]]

Kentucky's ozone SIP revision on June 23, 1982, (draft), September 27, 
1982, and November 3, 1982, is disapproved. As a result, the extension 
of the attainment deadline until December 31, 1987, remains in effect, 
along with the related requirement to submit a SIP revision addressing 
all requirements of Part D extension areas.
    (c) The redesignation request submitted by the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, on November 11, 1994, for the Kentucky portion of the 
Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky moderate interstate ozone nonattainment 
area from nonattainment to attainment was disapproved on September 27, 
1996.
    (d) Kentucky's November 15, 1996, request for a 1-year attainment 
date extension for the Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton 
metropolitan moderate ozone nonattainment area which consists of Kenton, 
Boone, and Campbell Counties is approved. The date for attaining the 
ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1997.
    (e) Kentucky's November 15, 1996, request for a 1-year attainment 
date extension for the Kentucky portion of the Louisville moderate ozone 
nonattainment area which consists of Jefferson County and parts of 
Bullitt and Oldham Counties is approved. The date for attaining the 
ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1997.
    (f) Kentucky's January 7, 1998, request for a 1-year attainment date 
extension for the Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton 
metropolitan moderate ozone nonattainment area which consists of Kenton, 
Boone, and Campbell Counties is approved. The date for attaining the 
ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1998.
    (g) The redesignation request submitted by the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, on October 29, 1999, for the Kentucky portion of the 
Cincinnati-Hamilton moderate interstate ozone nonattainment area from 
nonattainment to attainment was approved on July 5, 2000. The mobile 
source budgets for the Kentucky portion of the area for the purposes of 
transportation conformity are now 5.83 tons per summer day of volatile 
organic compounds and 15.13 tons per summer day of nitrogen oxides for 
the year 2010.
    (h) Determination--EPA is determining that as of July 5, 2000, the 
Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone nonattainment area 
(which includes the Counties of Boone, Kenton, and Campbell) has 
attained the 1-hour ozone standard and that the attainment demonstration 
requirements of section 182(b)(1), 182(j), and 172(c)(1), along with the 
section 172(c)(9) contingency measure requirements, do not apply to the 
area.
    (i) Approval--EPA is approving an exemption from the requirements 
contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts 
Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties in Kentucky from the NO<INF>X</INF> 
related general conformity provisions; nonattainment NSR for new sources 
and modifications that are major for NO<INF>X</INF>; NO<INF>X</INF> 
RACT; and the requirement for a demonstration of compliance with the 
enhanced I/M performance standard for NO<INF>X</INF>.

Sec. 52.931  Significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a) Regulations for preventing significant deterioration of air 
quality. The provisions of Sec. 52.21 (b) through (w) are hereby 
incorporated and made a part of the applicable state plan for the State 
of Kentucky only as they apply to permits issued pursuant to Sec. 52.21 
prior to final approval of Kentucky's Regulation for Prevention of 
Significant Deterioration (PSD), Visibility Monitoring, and Visibility 
New Source Review in Attainment Areas. The provisions of Sec. 52.21 (b) 
through (w) are rescinded for permits issued after final approval of 
Kentucky's Regulation for Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), 
Visibility Monitoring, and Visibility New Source Review in Attainment 
Areas.
    (b) The Commonwealth of Kentucky has committed to revising the 
state's regulations accordingly when EPA amends the federal vessel 
emissions provisions contained in 40 CFR 51.166.

[[Page 590]]

In a letter dated October 17, 1986, Kentucky stated:

    As requested, the Division of Air Pollution Control hereby commits 
to changing the definition of ``building, structure, facility, or 
installation,'' and any other applicable definitions, when the issue of 
vessel emissions is resolved at the federal level, and after the federal 
regulation, 40 CFR 51.24, is amended.

    (c) In a letter dated May 3, 1988, EPA informed Kentucky that the 
following caveat must be included in all potentially affected permits 
due to a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit (NRDC v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1224):

    In approving this permit, the Kentucky Division for Air Quality has 
determined that the application complies with the applicable provisions 
of the stack height regulations as revised by the EPA on July 8, 1985 
(50 FR 27892). Portions of the regulations have been remanded by a panel 
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in NRDC v. Thomas, 838 
F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Consequently, this permit may be subject to 
modification if and when the EPA revises the regulation in response to 
the court decision. This may result in revised emission limitations or 
may affect other actions taken by the source owners or operators.

    Kentucky responded with a letter dated May 11, 1988, stating in 
part:

    This is in response to your letter dated May 3, 1988 * * *. As 
requested by your letter, the Kentucky Division for Air Quality agrees 
to include the condition set forth in your letter, in all potentially 
affected permits issued under regulation 401 KAR 51:017 or 401 KAR 
51:052. Therefore, we request that you consider this letter as our 
commitment that the required caveat will be included in all potentially 
affected permits * * *.

    (a) The last sentence of section 3(1) of Kentucky regulation 401 KAR 
3:050, which specifies that a new fossil fuel fired steam electric 
generator's allowable SO<INF>2</INF> emissions may be calculated by 
averaging SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from existing units of this type and 
from new ones, is disapproved since it contravenes subpart D of 40 CFR 
part 60, New Source Performance Standards.
    (b) Section 8(2)(a) of regulation 401 KAR 61:015 is disapproved in 
that it allows the Tennessee Valley Authority's Shawnee power plant 
until October 1, 1981, to achieve compliance with emissions limits which 
are not made more stringent by the 1979 Part D revisions, and which the 
source was previously required to meet by July 1, 1977.
    (c) Section 8(2)(d) of regulation 401 KAR 61:015 is disapproved in 
that it allows sources until December 31, 1982, to achieve compliance 
with emission limits which are not made more stringent by the 1979 Part 
D revisions, and which the sources were previously required to meet 
prior to 1979.

Sec. 52.975  Redesignations and maintenance plans; ozone.

    (a) Approval. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality 
(LDEQ) submitted redesignation requests and maintenance plans for the 
areas of Beauregard, Lafourche, and St. Mary Parishes on June 14, 1993. 
Redesignation requests and maintenance plans were submitted for the 
areas of Grant and Lafayette on May 25, 1993. The EPA deemed these 
requests complete on September 10, 1993. Several approvability issues 
existed, however. The LDEQ addressed these approvability issues in 
supplemental ozone redesignation requests and revised maintenance plans. 
These supplemental submittals were received for the areas of Beauregard, 
Grant, Lafayette, Lafourche, and St. Mary Parishes on March 27, 1995, 
December 12, 1994, October 21, 1994, November 18, 1994, and November 23, 
1994, respectively. The redesignation requests and maintenance plans 
meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act 
as amended in 1990. The redesignations meet the Federal requirements of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Louisiana 
ozone State Implementation Plan for these areas. The EPA therefore 
approved the request for redesignation to attainment with respect to 
ozone for the areas of Beauregard, Grant, Lafayette, Lafourche, and St. 
Mary Parishes on October 17, 1995.
    (b) Approval--The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality 
(LDEQ) submitted a redesignation request and maintenance plan for St. 
James Parish on May 25, 1993. The EPA deemed this request complete on 
September 10, 1993. Several approvability issues existed, however. The 
LDEQ addressed these approvability issues in a supplemental ozone 
redesignation request and revised maintenance plan.

[[Page 614]]

This supplemental submittal was received for St. James Parish on 
December 15, 1994. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet 
the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act as 
amended in 1990. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Louisiana 
ozone State Implementation Plan for this parish. The EPA therefore 
approved the request for redesignation to attainment with respect to 
ozone for St. James Parish on November 13, 1995.
    (c) Approval--The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality 
(LDEQ) submitted a redesignation request and maintenance plan for the 
New Orleans CMSA on April 23, 1993. The EPA deemed this request complete 
on September 10, 1993. Several approvability issues existed, however. 
The LDEQ addressed these approvability issues in a supplemental ozone 
redesignation request and revised maintenance plan. This supplemental 
submittal was received on October 14, 1994. The redesignation request 
and maintenance plans meet the redesignation requirements in section 
107(d)(3)(E) of the Act as amended in 1990. The redesignation meets the 
Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a 
revision to the Louisiana ozone State Implementation Plan for Jefferson, 
Orleans, St. Bernard, and St. Charles Parishes. The EPA therefore 
approved the request for redesignation to attainment with respect to 
ozone for 7Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard, and St. Charles Parishes on 
December 1, 1995.
    (d) Approval--The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality

Parish on December 20, 1995. The redesignation request and maintenance 
plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the 
Act as amended in 1990. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements 
of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Louisiana 
ozone State Implementation Plan for Pointe Coupee Parish. The EPA 
therefore approved the request for redesignation to attainment with 
respect to ozone for Pointe Coupee Parish on December 20, 1996.
    (e) Approval--The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality 
submitted a redesignation request and maintenance plan for Calcasieu 
Parish on December 20, 1995. The redesignation request and maintenance 
plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the 
Act. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 
182(a)(1) of the Act as a revision to the Louisiana ozone State 
Implementation Plan for Calcasieu Parish. The EPA therefore approved the 
request for redesignation to attainment with respect to ozone for 
Calcasieu Parish on June 2, 1997.
    (f) Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, is designated back to nonattainment 
for ozone. The original classification of incomplete data is retained.

Sec. 52.990  Stack height regulations.

    The State of Louisiana has committed to submit to EPA a SIP revision 
whenever a new or revised emission limitation for a specific source 
exceeds the height allowed by Section 921(A) ``Good Engineering Practice 
(GEP) Stack Height 1 or 2'' of the State regulations. A letter from the 
Secretary of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, dated 
September 23, 1986, stated that:

    In specific, the State regulation, Section 17.14.2 [now LAC 33: Part 
III, Section 921(B)], provides that the degree of emission limitation 
required of any source for control of any air pollutant must not be 
affected by so much of any source's stack height that exceeds good 
engineering practice or by any other dispersion technique. In reference 
to this requirement, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality 
or the Administrative Authority will submit to EPA a SIP revision 
whenever the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality adopts a new 
or revised emission limitation for a specific source that is based on a 
stack height that exceeds the height allowed by Section 17.14.1(e)(1) 
[now LAC 33: Part III, Section 921(A) ``Good Engineering Practice (GEP) 
Stack Height 1''] or Section 17.14.1(e)(2) [now LAC 33: Part III,

Sec. 52.992  Area-wide nitrogen oxides exemptions.

    (a) The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality submitted to 
the EPA on August 5, 1994, a petition requesting that the 
nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas in the State of Louisiana be 
exempted from the requirement to meet the NO<INF>X</INF> provisions of 
the Federal transportation conformity rule. The exemption request was 
based on monitoring data which demonstrated that the National Ambient 
Air Quality Standard for ozone had been attained in this area for the 3 
years prior to the petition. The parishes for which the NO<INF>X</INF> 
exemption was requested include: Beauregard, Grant, Lafayette, 
Lafourche, Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, and 
St. Mary. The EPA approved this exemption request on March 2, 1995.
    (b) The LDEQ submitted to the EPA on November 17, 1994, a petition 
requesting that the Baton Rouge serious ozone nonattainment area be 
exempted from the NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements of

[[Page 617]]

the CAA. In addition, supplemental information was submitted to the EPA 
by the LDEQ on January 26, 1995, June 6, 1995, and June 16, 1995. The 
Baton Rouge nonattainment area consists of East Baton Rouge, West Baton 
Rouge, Pointe Coupee, Livingston, Iberville, and Ascension Parishes. The 
exemption request was based on photochemical grid modeling which shows 
that reductions in NO<INF>X</INF> would not contribute to attainment in 
the nonattainment area. On January 18, 1996, the EPA approved the 
State's request for an areawide exemption from the following 
requirements: NO<INF>X</INF> new source review, NO<INF>X</INF> 
reasonably available control technology, NO<INF>X</INF> general 
conformity, and NO<INF>X</INF> inspection and maintenance requirements.
    (c) The LDEQ submitted to the EPA on July 25, 1995, a revision to 
the SIP, pursuant to section 182(b)(1), requesting that the Baton Rouge 
serious ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the transportation 
conformity NO<INF>X</INF> requirements of the CAA. The Baton Rouge 
nonattainment area consists of East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, 
Pointe Coupee, Livingston, Iberville, and Ascension Parishes. The 
exemption request was based on photochemical grid modeling which shows 
that additional reductions in NO<INF>X</INF> would not contribute to 
attainment in the nonattainment area. On February 12, 1996, the EPA 
approved the State's request for an areawide exemption from the 
transportation conformity NO<INF>X</INF> requirements.
    (d) The LDEQ submitted to the EPA on October 28, 1994, a petition 
requesting that the Lake Charles marginal ozone nonattainment area be 
exempted from the NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements of the Act. The 
Lake Charles nonattainment area consists of Calcasieu Parish. The 
exemption request was based on photochemical grid modeling which shows 
that reductions in NO<INF>X</INF> would not contribute to attainment in 
the nonattainment area. On May 27, 1997, the EPA approved the State's 
request for an area-wide exemption from the following requirements: 
NO<INF>X</INF> new source review, NO<INF>X</INF> general conformity, and 
NO<INF>X</INF> transportation conformity requirements. The waiver was 
granted on the basis of modeling, and ambient air quality data 
demonstrating the area has attained the ozone NAAQS.

Sec. 52.993  Emissions inventories.

    (a) The Governor of the State of Louisiana submitted the 1990 base 
year emission inventories for the Baton Rouge (BTR) and Calcasieu Parish 
(CAL) ozone nonattainment areas on November 16, 1992 as a revision to 
the State Implementation Plan (SIP). The 1990 base year emission 
inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as 
amended in 1990, has been satisfied for each of these areas.
    (b) The inventories are for the ozone precursors which are volatile 
organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventories 
cover point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic 
sources.
    (c) The BTR nonattainment area is classified as Serious and includes 
Ascension, East Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston, Point Coupee, and 
West Baton Rouge Parishes; the CAL nonattainment area is classified as 
Marginal and includes Calcasieu Parish.
    (d) On December 15, 1995, the Governor of the State of Louisiana 
submitted a revision to the 1990 base year volatile organic compound 
(VOC) emissions inventory for the Baton Rouge, Louisiana ozone 
nonattainment area. The revised inventory was submitted as part of the 
revised Baton Rouge 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plan. This revision to 
the base year inventory modified the point source VOC emissions. The 
revisions satisfy the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air 
Act, as amended in 1990.
    (e) On January 2, 1997, the Governor of the State of Louisiana 
submitted a revision to the 1990 base year volatile organic compound 
(VOC) emissions inventory for the Baton Rouge, Louisiana ozone 
nonattainment area. The revised inventory was submitted as part of the 
revised Baton Rouge Post-1996 Rate-of-Progress Plan. This revision to 
the base year inventory modified the point, area, non-road mobile, on-
road mobile, and biogenic sources of VOC emissions. The revisions 
satisfy

Sec. 52.996  Disapprovals.

    The State of Louisiana motor vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/
M) program SIP submittal of August 18, 1995, with later editions, is 
disapproved based on the failure of the State Legislature to grant legal 
authority to reauthorize and continuously operate the program until the 
program is no longer necessary. The Baton Rouge serious ozone 
nonattainment area is required to have an enhanced I/M program under 
section 182 of the Clean Air Act (the Act) as amended in 1990. This 
disapproval initiates the sanction process of section 179(a) of the Act.

    (72) Revisions to the Louisiana SIP addressing VOC RACT Negative 
Declarations. The Governor of Louisiana submitted the negative 
declarations for reasonably available control technology (RACT) for the 
Baton Rouge ozone nonattainment area on December 15, 1996. Section 
172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act requires nonattainment areas to adopt, at 
a minimum, RACT to reduce emissions from existing sources. Pursuant to 
section 182(b)(2) of the Act, for moderate and above ozone nonattainment 
areas, the EPA has identified 13 categories for such sources and 
developed the Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) or Alternate Control 
Techniques (ACTs) documents to implement RACT at those sources. When no 
major volatile organic compound (VOC) sources for a CTG/ACT category 
exist in a nonattainment area, a State may submit a negative declaration 
for that category. Louisiana's submittal included two negative 
declaration letters from Mr. Gustave Von Bodungen to Ms. Karen Alvarez 
dated April 6, 1994, and June 20, 1994, for the following source 
categories: offset lithography, plastic parts-business machines, plastic 
parts-others, wood furniture, aerospace coatings, autobody refinishing, 
and shipbuilding coatings/repair. This submittal satisfies section 
182(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for these particular 
CTG/ACT source categories for the Baton Rouge ozone nonattainment area.
    (i) Incorporation by reference. The letter dated December 15, 1995,

therefore approved the request for redesignation to attainment with 
respect to ozone for Calcasieu Parish on June 2, 1997.
