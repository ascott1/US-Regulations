                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2010), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

INQUIRIES

    For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this 
volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at

Sec. 52.02  Introduction.

    (a) This part sets forth the Administrator's approval and 
disapproval of State plans and the Administrator's promulgation of such 
plans or portions thereof. Approval of a plan or any portion thereof is 
based upon a determination by the Administrator that such plan or 
portion meets the requirements of section 110 of the Act and the 
provisions of part 51 of this chapter.
    (b) Any plan or portion thereof promulgated by the Administrator 
substitutes for a State plan or portion thereof disapproved by the 
Administrator or not submitted by a State, or supplements a State plan 
or portion thereof. The promulgated provisions, together with any 
portions of a State plan approved by the Administrator, constitute the 
applicable plan for purposes of the Act.
    (c) Where nonregulatory provisions of a plan are disapproved, the 
disapproval is noted in this part and a detailed evaluation is provided 
to the State, but no substitute provisions are promulgated by the 
Administrator.
    (d) All approved plans and plan revisions listed in subparts B 
through DDD of this part and on file at the Office of the Federal 
Register are approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of 
the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 
51. Notice of amendments to the plans will be published in the Federal 
Register. The plans and plan revisions are available for inspection at

provisions, to set forth reasons for disapproval, and to set forth 
provisions of the plan promulgated by the Administrator. Except as 
otherwise specified, all supplemental information submitted to the 
Administrator with respect to any plan has been submitted by the 
Governor of the State.
    (f) Revisions to applicable plans will be included in this part when 
approved or promulgated by the Administrator.

FR 38886, Sept. 3, 1982; 61 FR 16060, Apr. 11, 1996; 72 FR 38793, July 
16, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 52.04  Classification of regions.

    Each subpart sets forth the priority classification, by pollutant, 
for each region in the State. Each plan for each region was evaluated 
according to the requirements of part 51 of this chapter applicable to 
regions of that priority.


<R05>
Sec. 52.05  Public availability of emission data.

    Each subpart sets forth the Administrator's disapproval of plan 
procedures for making emission data available to the public after 
correlation with applicable emission limitations, and includes the 
promulgation of requirements that sources report emission data to the 
Administrator for correlation and public disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 52.06  Legal authority.

    (a) The Administrator's determination of the absence or inadequacy 
of legal authority required to be included in the plan is set forth in 
each subpart. This includes the legal authority of local agencies and 
State governmental agencies other than an air pollution control agency 
if such other agencies are assigned responsibility for carrying out a 
plan or portion thereof.
    (b) No legal authority as such is promulgated by the Administrator. 
Where required regulatory provisions are not included in the plan by the 
State because of inadequate legal authority, substitute provisions are 
promulgated by the Administrator.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 33922, June 29, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 52.07  Control strategies.

    (a) Each subpart specifies in what respects the control strategies 
are approved or disapproved. Where emission limitations with a future 
effective date are employed to carry out a control strategy, approval of 
the control strategy and the implementing regulations does not supersede 
the requirements of subpart N of this chapter relating to compliance 
schedules for individual sources or categories of sources. Compliance 
schedules for individual sources or categories of sources must require 
such sources to comply with applicable requirements of the plan as 
expeditiously as practicable, where the requirement is part of a control 
strategy designed to attain a primary standard, or within a reasonable 
time, where the requirement is part of a control strategy designed to 
attain a secondary standard. All sources must be required to comply with 
applicable requirements of the plan no later than the date specified in 
this part for attainment of the national standard which the requirement 
is intended to implement.
    (b) A control strategy may be disapproved as inadequate because it 
is not sufficiently comprehensive, although all regulations provided to 
carry out the strategy may themselves be approved. In this case, 
regulations

[[Page 12]]

for carrying out necessary additional measures are promulgated in the 
subpart.
    (c) Where a control strategy is adequate to attain and maintain a 
national standard but one or more of the regulations to carry it out is 
not adopted or not enforceable by the State, the control strategy is 
approved and the necessary regulations are promulgated by the 
Administrator.
    (d) Where a control strategy is adequate to attain and maintain air 
quality better than that provided for by a national standard but one or 
more of the regulations to carry it out is not adopted or not 
enforceable by the State, the control strategy is approved and 
substitute regulations necessary to attain and maintain the national 
standard are promulgated.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 19807, Sept. 22, 1972; 
51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 52.08  Rules and regulations.

    Each subpart identifies the regulations, including emission 
limitations, which are disapproved by the Administrator, and includes 
the regulations which the Administrator promulgates.


<R05>
Sec. 52.09  Compliance schedules.

    (a) In each subpart, compliance schedules disapproved by the 
Administrator are identified, and compliance schedules promulgated by 
the Administrator are set forth.
    (b) Individual source compliance schedules submitted with certain 
plans have not yet been evaluated, and are not approved or disapproved.
    (c) The Administrator's approval or promulgation of any compliance 
schedule shall not affect the responsibility of the owner or operator to 
comply with any applicable emission limitation on and after the date for 
final compliance specified in the applicable schedule.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 38 FR 30877, Nov. 8, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 52.10  Review of new sources and modifications.

    In any plan where the review procedure for new sources and source 
modifications does not meet the requirements of subpart I of this 
chapter, provisions are promulgated which enable the Administrator to 
obtain the necessary information and to prevent construction or 
modification.

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 51 FR 40677, Nov. 7, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 52.11  Prevention of air pollution emergency episodes.

    (a) Each subpart identifies portions of the air pollution emergency 
episode contingency plan which are disapproved, and sets forth the 
Administrator's promulgation of substitute provisions.
    (b) No provisions are promulgated to replace any disapproved air 
quality monitoring or communications portions of a contingency plan, but 
detailed critiques of such portions are provided to the State.
    (c) Where a State plan does not provide for public announcement 
regarding air pollution emergency episodes or where the State fails to 
give any such public announcement, the Administrator will issue a public 
announcement that an episode stage has been reached. When making such an 
announcement, the Administrator will be guided by the suggested episode 
criteria and emission control actions suggested in Appendix L of part 51 
of this chapter or those in the approved plan.

plan, nothing in this part shall preclude the use, including the 
exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, relevant to 
whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable 
requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test 
procedures or methods had been performed:
    (1) Sources subject to plan provisions which do not specify a test 
procedure and sources subject to provisions promulgated by the

does not relieve any State from the provisions of subpart N of this 
chapter which require all sources and categories of sources to comply 
with applicable requirements of the plan--
    (a) As expeditiously as practicable where the requirement is part of 
a control strategy designed to attain a primary standard, and
    (b) Within a reasonable time where the requirement is part of a

<R05>
Sec. 52.21  Prevention of significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a)(1) Plan disapproval. The provisions of this section are 
applicable to any State implementation plan which has been disapproved 
with respect to prevention of significant deterioration of air quality 
in any portion of any State where the existing air quality is better 
than the national ambient air quality standards. Specific disapprovals 
are listed where applicable, in subparts B through DDD of this part. The 
provisions of this section have been incorporated by reference into the 
applicable implementation plans for various States, as provided in 
subparts B through DDD of this part. Where this section is so 
incorporated, the provisions shall also be applicable to all lands owned 
by the Federal Government and Indian Reservations located in such State. 
No disapproval with respect to a State's failure to prevent significant 
deterioration of air quality shall invalidate or otherwise affect the 
obligations of States, emission sources, or other persons with respect 
to all portions of plans approved or promulgated under this part.
    (2) Applicability procedures. (i) The requirements of this section 
apply to the construction of any new major stationary source (as defined 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) or any project at an existing major 
stationary source in an area designated as attainment or unclassifiable 
under sections 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Act.
    (ii) The requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section 
apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the 
major modification of any existing major stationary source, except as 
this section otherwise provides.
    (iii) No new major stationary source or major modification to which 
the requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r)(5) of this section apply 
shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the 
major stationary source or major modification will meet those 
requirements. The Administrator has authority to issue any such permit.
    (iv) The requirements of the program will be applied in accordance 
with the principles set out in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(a) through (f) of 
this section.
    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(v) and (vi) of 
this section, and consistent with the definition of major modification 
contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a project is a major 
modification for a regulated NSR pollutant if it causes two types of 
emissions increases--a significant emissions increase (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(40) of this section), and a significant net emissions 
increase (as defined in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(23) of this section). 
The project is not a major modification if it does not cause a 
significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant 
emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it 
also results in a significant net emissions increase.
    (b) The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual 
construction)

[[Page 15]]

whether a significant emissions increase (i.e., the first step of the 
process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being 
modified, according to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(c) through (f) of this 
section. For these calculations, fugitive emissions (to the extent 
quantifiable) are included only if the emissions unit is part of one of 
the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section or 
if the emission unit is located at a major stationary source that 
belongs to one of the listed source categories. Fugitive emissions are 
not included for those emissions units located at a facility whose 
primary activity is not represented by one of the source categories 
listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section and that are not, by 
themselves, part of a listed source category. The procedure for 
calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant 
net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source (i.e., 
the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Regardless of any such preconstruction 
projections, a major modification results if the project causes a 
significant emissions increase and a significant net emissions increase.
    (c) Actual-to-projected-actual applicability test for projects that 
only involve existing emissions units. A significant emissions increase 
of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the 
difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(41) of this section) and the baseline actual emissions (as 
defined in paragraphs (b)(48)(i) and (ii) of this section), for each 
existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for 
that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section).
    (d) Actual-to-potential test for projects that only involve 
construction of a new emissions unit(s). A significant emissions 
increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum 
of the difference between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section) from each new emissions unit following 
completion of the project and the baseline actual emissions (as defined 
in paragraph (b)(48)(iii) of this section) of these units before the 
project equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as 
defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section).
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of 
emissions units. A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR 
pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the emissions increases 
for each emissions unit, using the method specified in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(iv)(c) through (d) of this section as applicable with respect to 
each emissions unit, for each type of emissions unit equals or exceeds 
the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph 
(b)(23) of this section).
    (v) For any major stationary source for a PAL for a regulated NSR 
pollutant, the major stationary source shall comply with the 
requirements under paragraph (aa) of this section.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1)(i) Major stationary source means:

    (2)(i) Major modification means any physical change in or change in 
the method of operation of a major stationary source that would result 
in: a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (b)(40) of 
this section) of a regulated NSR pollutant (as defined in paragraph 
(b)(50) of this section); and a significant net emissions increase of 
that pollutant from the major stationary source.
    (ii) Any significant emissions increase (as defined at paragraph 
(b)(40) of this section) from any emissions units or net emissions 
increase (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) at a major 
stationary source that is significant for volatile organic compounds or 
NO<INF>X</INF> shall be considered significant for ozone.
    (iii) A physical change or change in the method of operation shall 
not include:
    (a) Routine maintenance, repair and replacement. Routine 
maintenance, repair and replacement shall include, but not be limited 
to, any activity(s) that meets the requirements of the equipment 
replacement provisions contained in paragraph (cc) of this section;

    Note to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(a): By court order on December 24, 
2003, the second sentence of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(a) is stayed 
indefinitely. The stayed provisions will become effective immediately if 
the court terminates the stay. At that time, EPA will publish a document 
in the Federal Register advising the public of the termination of the 
stay.

    (b) Use of an alternative fuel or raw material by reason of an order 
under sections 2 (a) and (b) of the Energy

[[Page 17]]

Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 (or any superseding

    (e) Use of an alternative fuel or raw material by a stationary 
source which:
    (1) The source was capable of accommodating before January 6, 1975, 
unless such change would be prohibited under any federally enforceable 
permit condition which was established after January 6, 1975 pursuant to 
40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR subpart I 
or 40 CFR 51.166; or
    (2) The source is approved to use under any permit issued under 40 
CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR 51.166;
    (f) An increase in the hours of operation or in the production rate, 
unless such change would be prohibited under any federally enforceable 
permit condition which was established after January 6, 1975, pursuant 
to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR subpart 
I or 40 CFR 51.166.
    (g) Any change in ownership at a stationary source.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) The installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a 
temporary clean coal technology demonstration project, provided that the 
project complies with:
    (1) The State implementation plan for the State in which the project 
is located, and
    (2) Other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the national 
ambient air quality standards during the project and after it is 
terminated.
    (j) The installation or operation of a permanent clean coal 
technology demonstration project that constitutes repowering, provided 
that the project does not result in an increase in the potential to emit 
of any regulated pollutant emitted by the unit. This exemption shall 
apply on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis.
    (k) The reactivation of a very clean coal-fired electric utility 
steam generating unit.
    (iv) This definition shall not apply with respect to a particular 
regulated NSR pollutant when the major stationary source is complying 
with the requirements under paragraph (aa) of this section for a PAL for 
that pollutant. Instead, the definition at paragraph (aa)(2)(viii) of 
this section shall apply.
    (v) Fugitive emissions shall not be included in determining for any 
of the purposes of this section whether a physical change in or change 
in the method of operation of a major stationary source is a major 
modification, unless the source belongs to one of the source categories 
listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3)(i) Net emissions increase means, with respect to any regulated 
NSR pollutant emitted by a major stationary source, the amount by which 
the sum of the following exceeds zero:
    (a) The increase in emissions from a particular physical change or 
change in the method of operation at a stationary source as calculated 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section; and
    (b) Any other increases and decreases in actual emissions at the 
major stationary source that are contemporaneous with the particular 
change and are otherwise creditable. Baseline actual emissions for 
calculating increases and decreases under this paragraph (b)(3)(i)(b) 
shall be determined as provided in paragraph (b)(48) of this section, 
except that paragraphs (b)(48)(i)(c) and (b)(48)(ii)(d) of this section 
shall not apply.
    (ii) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is contemporaneous 
with the increase from the particular change only if it occurs between:
    (a) The date five years before construction on the particular change 
commences; and
    (b) The date that the increase from the particular change 
occurs.(iii) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is creditable 
only if:
    (a) The Administrator or other reviewing authority has not relied on 
it in issuing a permit for the source under this section, which permit 
is in effect

[[Page 18]]

when the increase in actual emissions from the particular change occurs; 
and
    (b) The increase or decrease in emissions did not occur at a Clean 
Unit except as provided in paragraphs (x)(8) and (y)(10) of this 
section; and
    (c) As it pertains to an increase or decrease in fugitive emissions 
(to the extent quantifiable), it occurs at an emissions unit that is 
part of one of the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section or it occurs at an emission unit that is located at a major 
stationary source that belongs to one of the listed source 
categories.(iv) An increase or decrease in actual emissions of sulfur 
dioxide, particulate matter, or nitrogen oxides that occurs before the 
applicable minor source baseline date is creditable only if it is 
required to be considered in calculating the amount of maximum allowable 
increases remaining available.
    (v) An increase in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent 
that the new level of actual emissions exceeds the old level.
    (vi) A decrease in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent 
that:
    (a) The old level of actual emissions or the old level of allowable 
emissions, whichever is lower, exceeds the new level of actual 
emissions;
    (b) It is enforceable as a practical matter at and after the time 
that actual construction on the particular change begins.
    (c) It has approximately the same qualitative significance for 
public health and welfare as that attributed to the increase from the 
particular change; and
    (vii) [Reserved]
    (viii) An increase that results from a physical change at a source 
occurs when the emissions unit on which construction occurred becomes 
operational and begins to emit a particular pollutant. Any replacement 
unit that requires shakedown becomes operational only after a reasonable 
shakedown period, not to exceed 180 days.
    (ix) Paragraph (b)(21)(ii) of this section shall not apply for 
determining creditable increases and decreases.
    (4) Potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary 
source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. 
Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the source to 
emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and 
restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material 
combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design 
if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally 
enforceable. Secondary emissions do not count in determining the 
potential to emit of a stationary source.
    (5) Stationary source means any building, structure, facility, or 
installation which emits or may emit a regulated NSR pollutant.
    (6) Building, structure, facility, or installation means all of the 
pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial 
grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, 
and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common 
control) except the activities of any vessel. Pollutant-emitting 
activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping 
if they belong to the same ``Major Group'' (i.e., which have the same 
first two digit code) as described in the Standard Industrial 
Classification Manual, 1972, as amended by the 1977 Supplement (U. S. 
Government Printing Office stock numbers 4101-0066 and 003-005-00176-0, 
respectively).
    (7) Emissions unit means any part of a stationary source that emits 
or would have the potential to emit any regulated NSR pollutant and 
includes an electric utility steam generating unit as defined in 
paragraph (b)(31) of this section. For purposes of this section, there 
are two types of emissions units as described in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) 
and (ii) of this section.
    (i) A new emissions unit is any emissions unit that is (or will be) 
newly constructed and that has existed for less than 2 years from the 
date such emissions unit first operated.
    (ii) An existing emissions unit is any emissions unit that does not 
meet the requirements in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section. A 
replacement unit, as defined in paragraph (b)(33) of this section, is an 
existing emissions unit.

[[Page 19]]

    (8) Construction means any physical change or change in the method 
of operation (including fabrication, erection, installation, demolition, 
or modification of an emissions unit) that would result in a change in 
emissions.
    (9) Commence as applied to construction of a major stationary source 
or major modification means that the owner or operator has all necessary 
preconstruction approvals or permits and either has:
    (i) Begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of actual on-
site construction of the source, to be completed within a reasonable 
time; or
    (ii) Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, 
which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the 
owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual construction of the 
source to be completed within a reasonable time.
    (10) Necessary preconstruction approvals or permits means those 
permits or approvals required under Federal air quality control laws and 
regulations and those air quality control laws and regulations which are 
part of the applicable State Implementation Plan.
    (11) Begin actual construction means, in general, initiation of 
physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are 
of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, 
installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground 
pipework and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect 
to a change in method of operations, this term refers to those on-site 
activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation 
of the change.
    (12) Best available control technology means an emissions limitation 
(including a visible emission standard) based on the maximum degree of 
reduction for each pollutant subject to regulation under Act which would 
be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major 
modification which the Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, taking 
into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other 
costs, determines is achievable for such source or modification through 
application of production processes or available methods, systems, and 
techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel 
combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall 
application of best available control technology result in emissions of 
any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable 
standard under 40 CFR parts 60 and 61. If the Administrator determines 
that technological or economic limitations on the application of 
measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the 
imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, 
work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be 
prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of 
best available control technology. Such standard shall, to the degree 
possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation 
of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide 
for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results.
    (13)(i) Baseline concentration means that ambient concentration 
level that exists in the baseline area at the time of the applicable 
minor source baseline date. A baseline concentration is determined for 
each pollutant for which a minor source baseline date is established and 
shall include:
    (a) The actual emissions, as defined in paragraph (b)(21) of this 
section, representative of sources in existence on the applicable minor 
source baseline date, except as provided in paragraph (b)(13)(ii) of 
this section; and
    (b) The allowable emissions of major stationary sources that 
commenced construction before the major source baseline date, but were 
not in operation by the applicable minor source baseline date.
    (ii) The following will not be included in the baseline 
concentration and will affect the applicable maximum allowable 
increase(s):

the trigger date on which a major stationary source or a major 
modification subject to 40 CFR 52.21 or to regulations approved pursuant 
to 40 CFR 51.166 submits a complete application under the relevant 
regulations. The trigger date is:
    (a) In the case of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, August 7, 
1977, and
    (b) In the case of nitrogen dioxide, February 8, 1988.
    (iii) The baseline date is established for each pollutant for which

construct is designated as attainment or unclassifiable under section 
107(d)(i) (D) or (E) of the Act for the pollutant on the date of its 
complete application under 40 CFR 52.21; and
    (b) In the case of a major stationary source, the pollutant would be 
emitted in significant amounts, or, in the case of a major modification, 
there would be a significant net emissions increase of the pollutant.
    (iv) Any minor source baseline date established originally for the 
TSP increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of 
determining the amount of available PM-10 increments, except that the 
Administrator shall rescind a minor source baseline date where it can be 
shown, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the emissions 
increase from the major stationary source, or net emissions increase 
from the major modification, responsible for triggering that date did 
not result in a significant amount of PM-10 emissions.
    (15)(i) Baseline area means any intrastate area (and every part 
thereof) designated as attainment or unclassifiable under section 
107(d)(1) (D) or (E) of the Act in which the major source or major

baseline date is established.
    (ii) Area redesignations under section 107(d)(1) (D) or (E) of the 
Act cannot intersect or be smaller than the area of impact of any major 
stationary source or major modification which:
    (a) Establishes a minor source baseline date; or
    (b) Is subject to 40 CFR 52.21 and would be constructed in the same 
state as the state proposing the redesignation.
    (iii) Any baseline area established originally for the TSP 
increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of 
determining the amount of available PM-10 increments, except that such

the corresponding minor source baseline date in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(14)(iv) of this section.
    (16) Allowable emissions means the emissions rate of a stationary 
source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless 
the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the 
operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent

    (17) Federally enforceable means all limitations and conditions 
which are enforceable by the Administrator, including those requirements 
developed pursuant to 40 CFR parts 60 and 61, requirements within any 
applicable State implementation plan, any permit requirements 
established pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved 
pursuant to 40 CFR part 51, subpart I, including operating permits 
issued under an EPA-approved program

[[Page 21]]

that is incorporated into the State implementation plan and expressly 
requires adherence to any permit issued under such program.
    (18) Secondary emissions means emissions which would occur as a 
result of the construction or operation of a major stationary source or 
major modification, but do not come from the major stationary source or 
major modification itself. Secondary emissions include emissions from 
any offsite support facility which would not be constructed or increase 
its emissions except as a result of the construction or operation of the 
major stationary source or major modification. Secondary emissions do 
not include any emissions which come directly from a mobile source, such 
as emissions from the tailpipe of a motor vehicle, from a train, or from 
a vessel.
    (i) Emissions from ships or trains coming to or from the new or 
modified stationary source; and

reduction than any control system in current practice or of achieving at 
least comparable reductions at lower cost in terms of energy, economics, 
or nonair quality environmental impacts.
    (20) Fugitive emissions means those emissions which could not 
reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally 
equivalent opening. Fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, are 
addressed as follows for the purposes of this section:
    (i) In calculating whether a project will cause a significant 
emissions increase, fugitive emissions are included only for those 
emissions units that are part of one of the source categories listed in 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, or for any emissions units that 
are located at a major stationary source that belongs to one of the 
listed source categories. Fugitive emissions are not included for those 
emissions units located at a facility whose primary activity is not 
represented by one of the source categories listed in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section and that are not, by themselves, part of a 
listed source category. (See paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(b) of this section.)
    (ii) In determining whether a stationary source or modification is 
major, fugitive emissions from an emissions unit are included only if 
the emissions unit is part of one of the source categories listed in 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section or if the emission unit is located 
at a stationary source that belongs to one of the source categories 
listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Fugitive emissions are 
not included for those emissions units located at a facility whose 
primary activity is not represented by one of the source categories 
listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section and that are not, by 
themselves, part of a listed source category. (See paragraphs 
(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(v) of this section.)
    (iii) For purposes of determining the net emissions increase 
associated with a project, an increase or decrease in fugitive emissions 
is creditable only if it occurs at an emissions unit that is part of one 
of the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section 
or if the emission unit is located at a major stationary source that 
belongs to one of the listed source categories. Fugitive emission 
increases or decreases are not included for those emissions units 
located at a facility whose primary activity is not represented by one 
of the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section 
and that are not, by themselves, part of a listed source category. (See 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(c) of this section.)
    (iv) For purposes of determining the projected actual emissions of 
an emissions unit after a project, fugitive emissions are included only 
if the emissions unit is part of one of the source categories listed in 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section or if the emission unit is located 
at a major stationary source that belongs to one of the listed source 
categories. Fugitive emissions are not included for those emissions 
units located at a facility

[[Page 22]]

whose primary activity is not represented by one of the source 
categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section and that are 
not, by themselves, part of a listed source category. (See paragraph 
(b)(41)(ii)(b) and (d) of this section.
    (v) For purposes of determining the baseline actual emissions of an 
emissions unit, fugitive emissions are included only if the emissions 
unit is part of one of the source categories listed in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section or if the emission unit is located at a 
major stationary source that belongs to one of the listed source 
categories, except that, for a PAL, fugitive emissions shall be included 
regardless of the source category. With the exception of PALs, fugitive 
emissions are not included for those emissions units located at a 
facility whose primary activity is not represented by one of the source 
categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section and that are 
not, by themselves, part of a listed source category. (See paragraphs 
(b)(48)(i)(a), (b)(48)(ii)(a), (b)(48)(iii), and (b)(48)(iv) of this 
section.)
    (vi) For purposes of monitoring and reporting emissions from a 
project after normal operations have been resumed, fugitive emissions 
are included only for those emissions units that are part of one of the 
source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, or 
for any emissions units that are located at a major stationary source 
that belongs to one of the listed source categories. Fugitive emissions 
are not included for those emissions units located at a facility whose 
primary activity is not represented by one of the source categories 
listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section and that are not, by 
themselves, part of a listed source category. (See paragraphs 
(r)(6)(iii) and (iv) of this section.)
    (vii) For all other purposes of this section, fugitive emissions are 
treated in the same manner as other, non-fugitive emissions. This 
includes, but is not limited to, the treatment of fugitive emissions for 
the application of best available control technology (see paragraph (j) 
of this section), source impact analysis (see paragraph (k) of this 
section), additional impact analyses (see paragraph (o) of this 
section), and PALs (see paragraph (aa)(4)(i)(d) of this section).
    (21)(i) Actual emissions means the actual rate of emissions of a 
regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in 
accordance with paragraphs (b)(21)(ii) through (iv) of this section, 
except that this definition shall not apply for calculating whether a 
significant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL 
under paragraph (aa) of this section. Instead, paragraphs (b)(41) and 
(b)(48) of this section shall apply for those purposes.
    (ii) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall 
equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually 
emitted the pollutant during a consecutive 24-month period which 
precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal 
source operation. The Administrator shall allow the use of a different 
time period upon a determination that it is more representative of 
normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the 
unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials 
processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period.
    (iii) The Administrator may presume that source-specific allowable 
emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the 
unit.
    (iv) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on 
the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit 
of the unit on that date.
    (22) Complete means, in reference to an application for a permit, 
that the application contains all of the information necessary for 
processing the application.
    (23)(i) Significant means, in reference to a net emissions increase

government.
    (29) Adverse impact on visibility means visibility impairment which 
interferes with the management, protection, preservation or enjoyment of 
the visitor's visual experience of the Federal Class I area. This 
determination must be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account 
the geographic extent, intensity, duration, frequency and time of 
visibility impairment, and how these factors correlate with (1) times of 
visitor use of the Federal Class I area, and (2) the frequency and

of providing steam to a steam-electric generator that would produce 
electrical energy for sale is also considered in determining the 
electrical energy output capacity of the affected facility.
    (32) [Reserved]
    (33) Replacement unit means an emissions unit for which all the 
criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(33)(i) through (iv) of this section

    (iv) The replaced emissions unit is permanently removed from the 
major stationary source, otherwise permanently disabled, or permanently 
barred

[[Page 24]]

the replaced emissions unit is brought back into operation, it shall 
constitute a new emissions unit.
    (34) Clean coal technology means any technology, including 
technologies applied at the precombustion, combustion, or post 
combustion stage, at a new or existing facility which will achieve

following the date the unit resumes regular operation after the project, 
or in any one of the 10 years following that date, if the project 
involves increasing the emissions unit's design capacity or its 
potential to emit that regulated NSR pollutant and full utilization of 
the unit would result in a significant emissions increase or a

equipment required for the determination and recording of the pollutant 
mass emissions rate (in terms of mass per unit of time).
    (48) Baseline actual emissions means the rate of emissions, in tons 
per year, of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with 
paragraphs (b)(48)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, 
baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tons per year, at 
which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive 24-
month period selected by the owner or operator within the 5-year period 
immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual 
construction of the project. The Administrator shall allow the use of a 
different time period upon a determination that it is more 
representative of normal source operation.
    (a) The average rate shall include emissions associated with 
startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions; and, for an emissions unit that 
is part of one of the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) 
of this section or for an emissions unit that is located at a major 
stationary source that belongs to one of the listed source categories, 
shall include fugitive emissions (to the extent quantifiable).
    (b) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non-
compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above 
any emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the 
consecutive 24-month period.
    (c) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple 
emissions units, only one consecutive 24-month period must be used to 
determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being 
changed. A different consecutive 24-month period can be used For each 
regulated NSR pollutant.
    (d) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive 24-month 
period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual 
emissions, in tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required 
by paragraph (b)(48)(i)(b) of this section.
    (ii) For an existing emissions unit (other than an electric utility 
steam generating unit), baseline actual emissions means the average 
rate, in tons per year, at which the emissions unit actually emitted the 
pollutant during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner 
or operator within the 10-year period immediately preceding either the 
date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or 
the date a complete permit application is received by the Administrator 
for a permit required under this section or by the reviewing authority

10-year period shall not include any period earlier than November 15, 
1990.
    (a) The average rate shall include emissions associated with 
startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions; and, for an emissions unit that 
is part of one of the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) 
of this section or for an emissions unit that is located at a major 
stationary source that belongs to one of the listed source categories, 
shall include fugitive emissions (to the extent quantifiable).
    (b) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non-
compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above 
an emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the 
consecutive 24-month period.
    (c) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any 
emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the 
major stationary source must currently comply, had such major stationary 
source been required to comply with such limitations during the 
consecutive 24-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part 
of a maximum achievable control technology standard that the 
Administrator proposed or promulgated under part 63 of this chapter, the 
baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if the State has taken 
credit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or 
maintenance plan consistent with the requirements of Sec. 
51.165(a)(3)(ii)(G) of this chapter.
    (d) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple 
emissions units, only one consecutive 24-

[[Page 27]]

month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for 
all the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive 24-month 
period can be used For each regulated NSR pollutant.
    (e) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive 24-month 
period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual 
emissions, in tons per year, and for adjusting this amount if required 
by paragraphs (b)(48)(ii)(b) and (c) of this section.
    (iii) For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for 
purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the 
initial construction and operation of such unit shall equal zero; and 
thereafter, for all other purposes, shall equal the unit's potential to 
emit. In the latter case, fugitive emissions, to the extent 
quantifiable, shall be included only if the emissions unit is part of 
one of the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section or if the emissions unit is located at a major stationary source 
that belongs to one of the listed source categories.
    (iv) For a PAL for a major stationary source, the baseline actual 
emissions shall be calculated for existing electric utility steam 
generating units in accordance with the procedures contained in 
paragraph (b)(48)(i) of this section, for other existing emissions units 
in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (b)(48)(ii) of 
this section, and for a new emissions unit in accordance with the 
procedures contained in paragraph (b)(48)(iii) of this section, except 
that fugitive emissions (to the extent quantifiable) shall be included 
regardless of the source category.
    (49) [Reserved]
    (50) Regulated NSR pollutant, for purposes of this section, means 
the following:
    (i) Any pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard 
has been promulgated and any pollutant identified under this paragraph 
(b)(50)(i) as a constituent or precursor for such pollutant. Precursors 
identified by the Administrator for purposes of NSR are the following:
    (a) Volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides are precursors to 
ozone in all attainment and unclassifiable areas.
    (b) Sulfur dioxide is a precursor to PM<INF>2.5</INF> in all 
attainment and unclassifiable areas.
    (c) Nitrogen oxides are presumed to be precursors to 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> in all attainment and unclassifiable areas, unless the 
State demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction or EPA 
demonstrates that emissions of nitrogen oxides from sources in a 
specific area are not a significant contributor to that area's ambient 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> concentrations.
    (d) Volatile organic compounds are presumed not to be precursors to 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> in any attainment or unclassifiable area, unless the 
State demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction or EPA 
demonstrates that emissions of volatile organic compounds from sources 
in a specific area are a significant contributor to that area's ambient 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> concentrations.
    (ii) Any pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under 
section 111 of the Act;
    (iii) Any Class I or II substance subject to a standard promulgated 
under or established by title VI of the Act;
    (iv) Any pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the 
Act; except that any or all hazardous air pollutants either listed in 
section 112 of the Act or added to the list pursuant to section 
112(b)(2) of the Act, which have not been delisted pursuant to section 
112(b)(3) of the Act, are not regulated NSR pollutants unless the listed 
hazardous air pollutant is also regulated as a constituent or precursor 
of a general pollutant listed under section 108 of the Act.
    (v) [Reserved]
    (vi) Particulate matter (PM) emissions, PM<INF>2.5</INF> emissions 
and PM<INF>10</INF> emissions shall include gaseous emissions from a 
source or activity which condense to form particulate matter at ambient 
temperatures. On or after January 1, 2011 (or any earlier date 
established in the upcoming rulemaking codifying test methods), such 
condensable particulate matter shall be accounted for in applicability 
determinations and in establishing emissions

[[Page 28]]

limitations for PM, PM<INF>2.5</INF> and PM<INF>10</INF> in PSD permits. 
Compliance with emissions limitations for PM, PM<INF>2.5</INF> and 
PM<INF>10</INF> issued prior to this date shall not be based on 
condensable particular matter unless required by the terms and 
conditions of the permit or the applicable implementation plan. 
Applicability determinations made prior to this date without accounting 
for condensable particular matter shall not be considered in violation 
of this section unless the applicable implementation plan required 
condensable particular matter to be included.
    (51) Reviewing authority means the State air pollution control 
agency, local agency, other State agency, Indian tribe, or other agency 
authorized by the Administrator to carry out a permit program under 
Sec. 51.165 and Sec. 51.166 of this chapter, or the Administrator in 
the case of EPA-implemented permit programs under this section.
    (52) Project means a physical change in, or change in the method of 
operation of, an existing major stationary source.
    (53) Lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) is as defined in Sec. 
51.165(a)(1)(xiii) of this chapter.
    (54) Reasonably available control technology (RACT) is as defined in 
Sec. 51.100(o) of this chapter.
    (55)(i) In general, process unit means any collection of structures 
and/or equipment that processes, assembles, applies, blends, or 
otherwise uses material inputs to produce or store an intermediate or a 
completed product. A single stationary source may contain more than one 
process unit, and a process unit may contain more than one emissions 
unit.
    (ii) Pollution control equipment is not part of the process unit, 
unless it serves a dual function as both process and control equipment. 
Administrative and warehousing facilities are not part of the process 
unit.
    (iii) For replacement cost purposes, components shared between two 
or more process units are proportionately allocated based on capacity.
    (iv) The following list identifies the process units at specific 
categories of stationary sources.
    (a) For a steam electric generating facility, the process unit 
consists of those portions of the plant that contribute directly to the 
production of electricity. For example, at a pulverized coal-fired 
facility, the process unit would generally be the combination of those 
systems from the coal receiving equipment through the emission stack 
(excluding post-combustion pollution controls), including the coal 
handling equipment, pulverizers or coal crushers, feedwater heaters, ash 
handling, boiler, burners, turbine-generator set, condenser, cooling 
tower, water treatment system, air preheaters, and operating control 
systems. Each separate generating unit is a separate process unit.
    (b) For a petroleum refinery, there are several categories of 
process units: those that separate and/or distill petroleum feedstocks; 
those that change molecular structures; petroleum treating processes; 
auxiliary facilities, such as steam generators and hydrogen production 
units; and those that load, unload, blend or store intermediate or 
completed products.
    (c) For an incinerator, the process unit would consist of components 
from the feed pit or refuse pit to the stack, including conveyors, 
combustion devices, heat exchangers and steam generators, quench tanks, 
and fans.

    Note to paragraph (b)(55): By a court order on December 24, 2003, 
this paragraph (b)(55) is stayed indefinitely. The stayed provisions 
will become effective immediately if the court terminates the stay. At 
that time, EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register advising 
the public of the termination of the stay.

    (56) Functionally equivalent component means a component that serves 
the same purpose as the replaced component.

    Note to paragraph (b)(56): By a court order on December 24, 2003, 
this paragraph (b)(56) is stayed indefinitely. The stayed provisions

that time, EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register advising 
the public of the termination of the stay.

    (57) Fixed capital cost means the capital needed to provide all the 
depreciable components. ``Depreciable components'' refers to all 
components of fixed capital cost and is calculated by subtracting land 
and working capital

[[Page 29]]

from the total capital investment, as defined in paragraph (b)(58) of 
this section.

    Note to paragraph (b)(57): By a court order on December 24, 2003, 
this paragraph (b)(57) is stayed indefinitely. The stayed provisions 
will become effective immediately if the court terminates the stay. At 
that time, EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register advising 
the public of the termination of the stay.

    (58) Total capital investment means the sum of the following: all 
costs required to purchase needed process equipment (purchased equipment 
costs); the costs of labor and materials for installing that equipment 
(direct installation costs); the costs of site preparation and 
buildings; other costs such as engineering, construction and field 
expenses, fees to contractors, startup and performance tests, and 
contingencies (indirect installation costs); land for the process 
equipment; and working capital for the process equipment.

    Note to paragraph (b)(58): By a court order on December 24, 2003, 
this paragraph (b)(58) is stayed indefinitely. The stayed provisions 
will become effective immediately if the court terminates the stay. At

For any period other than an annual period, the applicable maximum 
allowable increase may be exceeded during one such period per year at 
any one location.
    (d) Ambient air ceilings. No concentration of a pollutant shall 
exceed:
    (1) The concentration permitted under the national secondary ambient 
air quality standard, or
    (2) The concentration permitted under the national primary ambient 
air quality standard, whichever concentration is lowest for the 
pollutant for a period of exposure.
    (e) Restrictions on area classifications. (1) All of the following 
areas which were in existence on August 7, 1977, shall be Class I areas 
and may not be redesignated:
    (i) International parks,
    (ii) National wilderness areas which exceed 5,000 acres in size,
    (iii) National memorial parks which exceed 5,000 acres in size, and
    (iv) National parks which exceed 6,000 acres in size.

promulgated before August 7, 1977, shall remain Class I, but may be 
redesignated as provided in this section.
    (3) Any other area, unless otherwise specified in the legislation 
creating such an area, is initially designated Class II, but may be 
redesignated as provided in this section.
    (4) The following areas may be redesignated only as Class I or II:
    (i) An area which as of August 7, 1977, exceeded 10,000 acres in

[[Page 30]]

wild and scenic river, a national wildlife refuge, a national lakeshore 
or seashore; and
    (ii) A national park or national wilderness area established after 
August 7, 1977, which exceeds 10,000 acres in size.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Redesignation. (1) All areas (except as otherwise provided under 
paragraph (e) of this section) are designated Class II as of December 5, 
1974. Redesignation (except as otherwise precluded by paragraph (e) of 
this section) may be proposed by the respective States or Indian 
Governing Bodies, as provided below, subject to approval by the 
Administrator as a revision to the applicable State implementation plan.
    (2) The State may submit to the Administrator a proposal to 
redesignate areas of the State Class I or Class II provided that:
    (i) At least one public hearing has been held in accordance with 
procedures established in Sec. 51.102 of this chapter;
    (ii) Other States, Indian Governing Bodies, and Federal Land 
Managers whose lands may be affected by the proposed redesignation were 
notified at least 30 days prior to the public hearing;
    (iii) A discussion of the reasons for the proposed redesignation, 
including a satisfactory description and analysis of the health, 
environmental, economic, social and energy effects of the proposed 
redesignation, was prepared and made available for public inspection at 
least 30 days prior to the hearing and the notice announcing the hearing 
contained appropriate notification of the availability of such 
discussion;
    (iv) Prior to the issuance of notice respecting the redesignation of 
an area that includes any Federal lands, the State has provided written 
notice to the appropriate Federal Land Manager and afforded adequate 
opportunity (not in excess of 60 days) to confer with the State 
respecting the redesignation and to submit written comments and 
recommendations. In redesignating any area with respect to which any 
Federal Land Manager had submitted written comments and recommendations, 
the State shall have published a list of any inconsistency between such 
redesignation and such comments and recommendations (together with the 
reasons for making such redesignation against the recommendation of the 
Federal Land Manager); and
    (v) The State has proposed the redesignation after consultation with 
the elected leadership of local and other substate general purpose 
governments in the area covered by the proposed redesignation.
    (3) Any area other than an area to which paragraph (e) of this 
section refers may be redesignated as Class III if--
    (i) The redesignation would meet the requirements of paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section;
    (ii) The redesignation, except any established by an Indian 
Governing Body, has been specifically approved by the Governor of the 
State, after consultation with the appropriate committees of the 
legislature, if it is in session, or with the leadership of the 
legislature, if it is not in session (unless State law provides that the 
redesignation must be specifically approved by State legislation) and if 
general purpose units of local government representing a majority of the 
residents of the area to be redesignated enact legislation or pass 
resolutions concurring in the redesignation:
    (iii) The redesignation would not cause, or contribute to, a 
concentration of any air pollutant which would exceed any maximum 
allowable increase permitted under the classification of any other area 
or any national ambient air quality standard; and
    (iv) Any permit application for any major stationary source or major 
modification, subject to review under paragraph (l) of this section, 
which could receive a permit under this section only if the area in 
question were redesignated as Class III, and any material submitted as 
part of that application, were available insofar as was practicable for 
public inspection prior to any public hearing on redesignation of the 
area as Class III.
    (4) Lands within the exterior boundaries of Indian Reservations may 
be redesignated only by the appropriate Indian Governing Body. The 
appropriate Indian Governing Body may submit to

[[Page 31]]

the Administrator a proposal to redesignate areas Class I, Class II, or 
Class III: Provided, That:
    (i) The Indian Governing Body has followed procedures equivalent to 
those required of a State under paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3)(iii), and 
(g)(3)(iv) of this section; and
    (ii) Such redesignation is proposed after consultation with the 
State(s) in which the Indian Reservation is located and which border the 
Indian Reservation.
    (5) The Administrator shall disapprove, within 90 days of 
submission, a proposed redesignation of any area only if he finds, after 
notice and opportunity for public hearing, that such redesignation does 
not meet the procedural requirements of this paragraph or is 
inconsistent with paragraph (e) of this section. If any such disapproval 
occurs, the classification of the area shall be that which was in effect 
prior to the redesignation which was disapproved.
    (6) If the Administrator disapproves any proposed redesignation, the 
State or Indian Governing Body, as appropriate, may resubmit the 
proposal after correcting the deficiencies noted by the Administrator.
    (h) Stack heights. (1) The degree of emission limitation required 
for control of any air pollutant under this section shall not be 
affected in any manner by--
    (i) So much of the stack height of any source as exceeds good 
engineering practice, or
    (ii) Any other dispersion technique.
    (2) Paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall not apply with respect to 
stack heights in existence before December 31, 1970, or to dispersion 
techniques implemented before then.
    (i) Exemptions. (1) The requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) 
of this section shall not apply to a particular major stationary source 
or major modification, if;
    (i) Construction commenced on the source or modification before 
August 7, 1977. The regulations at 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect before 
August 7, 1977, shall govern the review and permitting of any such

more and completed construction within a reasonable time; or
    (iii) The source or modification was subject to 40 CFR 52.21 as in 
effect before March 1, 1978, and the review of an application for 
approval for the stationary source or modification under 40 CFR 52.21 
would have been completed by March 1, 1978, but for an extension of the 
public comment period pursuant to a request for such an extension. In 
such a case, the application shall continue to be processed, and granted 
or denied, under 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect prior to March 1, 1978; or
    (iv) The source or modification was not subject to 40 CFR 52.21 as

    (x) The source or modification was subject to 40 CFR 52.21, with 
respect to particulate matter, as in effect before July 31, 1987 and the 
owner or operator submitted an application for a permit under this 
section before that date, and the Administrator subsequently determines 
that the application as submitted was complete with respect to the 
particular matter requirements

[[Page 33]]

then in effect in the section. Instead, the requirements of paragraphs 
(j) through (r) of this section that were in effect before July 31, 1987 
shall apply to such source or modification.(xi) The source or 
modification was subject to 40 CFR 52.21, with respect to 
PM<INF>2.5</INF>, as in effect before July 15, 2008, and the owner or 
operator submitted an application for a permit under this section before 
that date consistent with EPA recommendations to use PM<INF>10</INF> as 
a surrogate for PM<INF>2.5</INF>, and the Administrator subsequently 
determines that the application as submitted was complete with respect 
to the PM<INF>2.5</INF> requirements then in effect, as interpreted in 
the EPA memorandum entitled ``Interim Implementation of New Source 
Review Requirements for PM<INF>2.5</INF>'' (October 23, 1997). Instead, 
the requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section, as 
interpreted in the aforementioned memorandum, that were in effect before 
July 15, 2008 shall apply to such source or modification.
    (2) The requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section 
shall not apply to a major stationary source or major modification with 
respect to a particular pollutant if the owner or operator demonstrates 
that, as to that pollutant, the source or modification is located in an 
area designated as nonattainment under section 107 of the Act.
    (3) The requirements of paragraphs (k), (m) and (o) of this section 
shall not apply to a major stationary source or major modification with 
respect to a particular pollutant, if the allowable emissions of that 
pollutant from the source, or the net emissions increase of that 
pollutant from the modification:
    (i) Would impact no Class I area and no area where an applicable 
increment is known to be violated, and
    (ii) Would be temporary.
    (4) The requirements of paragraphs (k), (m) and (o) of this section 
as they relate to any maximum allowable increase for a Class II area 
shall not apply to a major modification at a stationary source that was 
in existence on March 1, 1978, if the net increase in allowable 
emissions of each regulated NSR pollutant from the modification after 
the application of best available control technology would be less than 
50 tons per year.
    (5) The Administrator may exempt a stationary source or modification 
from the requirements of paragraph (m) of this section, with respect to 
monitoring for a particular pollutant if:
    (i) The emissions increase of the pollutant from the new source or 
the net emissions increase of the pollutant from the modification would 
cause, in any area, air quality impacts less than the following amounts:

Carbon monoxide--575 [micro]g/m\3\, 8-hour average;
Nitrogen dioxide--14 [micro]g/m\3\, annual average;
Particulate matter--10 [micro]g/m\3\ of PM-10, 24-hour average;
Sulfur dioxide--13 [micro]g/m\3\, 24-hour average;
Ozone; \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ No de minimis air quality level is provided for ozone. However, 
any net emissions increase of 100 tons per year or more of volatile 
organic compounds or nitrogen oxides subject to PSD would be required to 
perform an ambient impact analysis, including the gathering of ambient

or modification would affect are less than the concentrations listed in 
paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section; or
    (iii) The pollutant is not listed in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this 
section.
    (6) The requirements for best available control technology in 
paragraph (j) of this section and the requirements for air quality 
analyses in paragraph (m)(1) of this section, shall not apply to a 
particular stationary source or modification that was subject to 40 CFR 
52.21 as in effect on June 19, 1978, if the owner or operator of the 
source or modification submitted an application for a permit under those 
regulations before August 7, 1980, and the Administrator subsequently 
determines that the application as submitted before that date was 
complete. Instead, the requirements at 40 CFR 52.21(j) and (n) as in 
effect on June 19, 1978 apply to any such source or modification.

[[Page 34]]

    (7)(i) The requirements for air quality monitoring in paragraphs 
(m)(1) (ii) through (iv) of this section shall not apply to a particular 
source or modification that was subject to 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect on 
June 19, 1978, if the owner or operator of the source or modification 
submits an application for a permit under this section on or before June 
8, 1981, and the Administrator subsequently determines that the 
application as submitted before that date was complete with respect to 
the requirements of this section other than those in paragraphs (m)(1) 
(ii) through (iv) of this section, and with respect to the requirements 
for such analyses at 40 CFR 52.21(m)(2) as in effect on June 19, 1978. 
Instead, the latter requirements shall apply to any such source or 
modification.
    (ii) The requirements for air quality monitoring in paragraphs 
(m)(1) (ii) through (iv) of this section shall not apply to a particular 
source or modification that was not subject to 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect 
on June 19, 1978, if the owner or operator of the source or modification 
submits an application for a permit under this section on or before June 
8, 1981, and the Administrator subsequently determines that the 
application as submitted before that date was complete, except with 
respect to the requirements in paragraphs (m)(1) (ii) through (iv).
    (8)(i) At the discretion of the Administrator, the requirements for 
air quality monitoring of PM<INF>10</INF> in paragraphs (m)(1) (i)-(iv) 
of this section may not apply to a particular source or modification 
when the owner or operator of the source or modification submits an 
application for a permit under this section on or before June 1, 1988 
and the Administrator subsequently determines that the application as 
submitted before that date was complete, except with respect to the 
requirements for monitoring particulate matter in paragraphs (m)(1) (i)-
(iv).
    (ii) The requirements for air quality monitoring pf PM<INF>10</INF> 
in paragraphs (m)(1), (ii) and (iv) and (m)(3) of this section shall 
apply to a particular source or modification if the owner or operator of 
the source or modification submits an application for a permit under 
this section after June 1, 1988 and no later than December 1, 1988. The 
data shall have been gathered over at least the period from February 1, 
1988 to the date the application becomes otherwise complete in 
accordance with the provisions set forth under paragraph (m)(1)(viii) of 
this section, except that if the Administrator determines that a 
complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data 
over a shorter period (not to be less than 4 months), the data that 
paragraph (m)(1)(iii) requires shall have been gathered over a shorter 
period.
    (9) The requirements of paragraph (k)(2) of this section shall not 
apply to a stationary source or modification with respect to any maximum 
allowable increase for nitrogen oxides if the owner or operator of the 
source or modification submitted an application for a permit under this 
section before the provisions embodying the maximum allowable increase 
took effect as part of the applicable implementation plan and the 
Administrator subsequently determined that the application as submitted 
before that date was complete.
    (10) The requirements in paragraph (k)(2) of this section shall not 
apply to a stationary source or modification with respect to any maximum 
allowable increase for PM-10 if (i) the owner or operator of the source 
or modification submitted an application for a permit under this section 
before the provisions embodying the maximum allowable increases for PM-
10 took effect in an implementation plan to which this section applies, 
and (ii) the Administrator subsequently determined that the application 
as submitted before that date was otherwise complete. Instead, the 
requirements in paragraph (k)(2) shall apply with respect to the maximum 
allowable increases for TSP as in effect on the date the application was 
submitted.
    (j) Control technology review. (1) A major stationary source or 
major modification shall meet each applicable emissions limitation under 
the State Implementation Plan and each applicable emissions standard and 
standard of performance under 40 CFR parts 60 and 61.

[[Page 35]]

    (2) A new major stationary source shall apply best available control 
technology for each regulated NSR pollutant that it would have the 
potential to emit in significant amounts.
    (3) A major modification shall apply best available control 
technology for each regulated NSR pollutant for which it would result in 
a significant net emissions increase at the source. This requirement 
applies to each proposed emissions unit at which a net emissions 
increase in the pollutant would occur as a result of a physical change 
or change in the method of operation in the unit.
    (4) For phased construction projects, the determination of best 
available control technology shall be reviewed and modified as 
appropriate at the latest reasonable time which occurs no later than 18 
months prior to commencement of construction of each independent phase 
of the project. At such time, the owner or operator of the applicable 
stationary source may be required to demonstrate the adequacy of any 
previous determination of best available control technology for the 
source.
    (k) Source impact analysis. The owner or operator of the proposed 
source or modification shall demonstrate that allowable emission 
increases from the proposed source or modification, in conjunction with 
all other applicable emissions increases or reductions (including 
secondary emissions), would not cause or contribute to air pollution in 
violation of:
    (1) Any national ambient air quality standard in any air quality 
control region; or
    (2) Any applicable maximum allowable increase over the baseline 
concentration in any area.
    (l) Air quality models. (1) All estimates of ambient concentrations 
required under this paragraph shall be based on applicable air quality 
models, data bases, and other requirements specified in appendix W of 
part 51 of this chapter (Guideline on Air Quality Models).
    (2) Where an air quality model specified in appendix W of part 51 of 
this chapter (Guideline on Air Quality Models) is inappropriate, the 
model may be modified or another model substituted. Such a modification 
or substitution of a model may be made on a case-by-case basis or, where 
appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific state program. Written 
approval of the Administrator must be obtained for any modification or 
substitution. In addition, use of a modified or substituted model must 
be subject to notice and opportunity for public comment under procedures 
developed in accordance with paragraph (q) of this section.
    (m) Air quality analysis--(1) Preapplication analysis. (i) Any 
application for a permit under this section shall contain an analysis of 
ambient air quality in the area that the major stationary source or 
major modification would affect for each of the following pollutants:
    (a) For the source, each pollutant that it would have the potential 
to omit in a significant amount;
    (b) For the modification, each pollutant for which it would result 
in a significant net emissions increase.
    (ii) With respect to any such pollutant for which no National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard exists, the analysis shall contain such air 
quality monitoring data as the Administrator determines is necessary to 
assess ambient air quality for that pollutant in any area that the 
emissions of that pollutant would affect.
    (iii) With respect to any such pollutant (other than nonmethane 
hydrocarbons) for which such a standard does exist, the analysis shall 
contain continuous air quality monitoring data gathered for purposes of 
determining whether emissions of that pollutant would cause or 
contribute to a violation of the standard or any maximum allowable 
increase.
    (iv) In general, the continuous air quality monitoring data that is 
required shall have been gathered over a period of at least one year and 
shall represent at least the year preceding receipt of the application, 
except that, if the Administrator determines that a complete and 
adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data gathered over 
a period shorter than one year (but not to be less than four months), 
the data that is required shall have been gathered over at least that 
shorter period.

[[Page 36]]

    (v) For any application which becomes complete, except as to the 
requirements of paragraphs (m)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section, 
between June 8, 1981, and February 9, 1982, the data that paragraph 
(m)(1)(iii) of this section, requires shall have been gathered over at 
least the period from February 9, 1981, to the date the application 
becomes otherwise complete, except that:
    (a) If the source or modification would have been major for that 
pollutant under 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect on June 19, 1978, any 
monitoring data shall have been gathered over at least the period 
required by those regulations.
    (b) If the Administrator determines that a complete and adequate 
analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data over a shorter period 
(not to be less than four months), the data that paragraph (m)(1)(iii) 
of this section, requires shall have been gathered over at least that 
shorter period.
    (c) If the monitoring data would relate exclusively to ozone and 
would not have been required under 40 CFR 52.21 as in effect on June 19, 
1978, the Administrator may waive the otherwise applicable requirements 
of this paragraph (v) to the extent that the applicant shows that the 
monitoring data would be unrepresentative of air quality over a full 
year.
    (vi) The owner or operator of a proposed stationary source or 
modification of volatile organic compounds who satisfies all conditions 
of 40 CFR part 51 Appendix S, section IV may provide post-approval 
monitoring data for ozone in lieu of providing preconstruction data as 
required under paragraph (m)(1) of this section.
    (vii) For any application that becomes complete, except as to the 
requirements of paragraphs (m)(1) (iii) and (iv) pertaining to 
PM<INF>10</INF>, after December 1, 1988 and no later than August 1, 1989 
the data that paragraph (m)(1)(iii) requires shall have been gathered 
over at least the period from August 1, 1988 to the date the application 
becomes otherwise complete, except that if the Administrator determines 
that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with 
monitoring data over a shorter period (not to be less than 4 months), 
the data that paragraph (m)(1)(iii) requires shall have been gathered 
over that shorter period.
    (viii) With respect to any requirements for air quality monitoring 
of PM<INF>10</INF> under paragraphs (i)(11) (i) and (ii) of this section 
the owner or operator of the source or modification shall use a 
monitoring method approved by the Administrator and shall estimate the 
ambient concentrations of PM<INF>10</INF> using the data collected by 
such approved monitoring method in accordance with estimating procedures 
approved by the Administrator.
    (2) Post-construction monitoring. The owner or operator of a major 
stationary source or major modification shall, after construction of the 
stationary source or modification, conduct such ambient monitoring as 
the Administrator determines is necessary to determine the effect 
emissions from the stationary source or modification may have, or are 
having, on air quality in any area.
    (3) Operations of monitoring stations. The owner or operator of a 
major stationary source or major modification shall meet the 
requirements of Appendix B to part 58 of this chapter during the 
operation of monitoring stations for purposes of satisfying paragraph 
(m) of this section.
    (n) Source information. The owner or operator of a proposed source 
or modification shall submit all information necessary to perform any 
analysis or make any determination required under this section.
    (1) With respect to a source or modification to which paragraphs 
(j), (l), (n) and (p) of this section apply, such information shall 
include:
    (i) A description of the nature, location, design capacity, and 
typical operating schedule of the source or modification, including 
specifications and drawings showing its design and plant layout;
    (ii) A detailed schedule for construction of the source or 
modification;
    (iii) A detailed description as to what system of continuous 
emission reduction is planned for the source or modification, emission 
estimates, and any other information necessary to determine that best 
available control technology would be applied.

[[Page 37]]

    (2) Upon request of the Administrator, the owner or operator shall 
also provide information on:
    (i) The air quality impact of the source or modification, including 
meteorological and topographical data necessary to estimate such impact; 
and
    (ii) The air quality impacts, and the nature and extent of any or 
all general commercial, residential, industrial, and other growth which 
has occurred since August 7, 1977, in the area the source or 
modification would affect.
    (o) Additional impact analyses. (1) The owner or operator shall 
provide an analysis of the impairment to visibility, soils and 
vegetation that would occur as a result of the source or modification 
and general commercial, residential, industrial and other growth 
associated with the source or modification. The owner or operator need 
not provide an analysis of the impact on vegetation having no 
significant commercial or recreational value.
    (2) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the air 
quality impact projected for the area as a result of general commercial, 
residential, industrial and other growth associated with the source or 
modification.
    (3) Visibility monitoring. The Administrator may require monitoring 
of visibility in any Federal class I area near the proposed new 
stationary source for major modification for such purposes and by such 
means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate.
    (p) Sources impacting Federal Class I areas--additional 
requirements--(1) Notice to Federal land managers. The Administrator 
shall provide written notice of any permit application for a proposed 
major stationary source or major modification, the emissions from which 
may affect a Class I area, to the Federal land manager and the Federal 
official charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands 
within any such area. Such notification shall include a copy of all 
information relevant to the permit application and shall be given within 
30 days of receipt and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on 
the application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall 
include an analysis of the proposed source's anticipated impacts on 
visibility in the Federal Class I area. The Administrator shall also 
provide the Federal land manager and such Federal officials with a copy 
of the preliminary determination required under paragraph (q) of this 
section, and shall make available to them any materials used in making 
that determination, promptly after the Administrator makes such 
determination. Finally, the Administrator shall also notify all affected 
Federal land managers within 30 days of receipt of any advance 
notification of any such permit application.
    (2) Federal Land Manager. The Federal Land Manager and the Federal 
official charged with direct responsibility for management of such lands 
have an affirmative responsibility to protect the air quality related 
values (including visibility) of such lands and to consider, in 
consultation with the Administrator, whether a proposed source or 
modification will have an adverse impact on such values.
    (3) Visibility analysis. The Administrator shall consider any 
analysis performed by the Federal land manager, provided within 30 days 
of the notification required by paragraph (p)(1) of this section, that 
shows that a proposed new major stationary source or major modification 
may have an adverse impact on visibility in any Federal Class I area. 
Where the Administrator finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate 
to the satisfaction of the Administrator that an adverse impact on 
visibility will result in the Federal Class I area, the Administrator 
must, in the notice of public hearing on the permit application, either 
explain his decision or give notice as to where the explanation can be 
obtained.
    (4) Denial--impact on air quality related values. The Federal Land 
Manager of any such lands may demonstrate to the Administrator that the 
emissions from a proposed source or modification would have an adverse 
impact on the air quality-related values (including visibility) of those 
lands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from 
emissions from such source or modification would not cause or contribute 
to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable

[[Page 38]]

increases for a Class I area. If the Administrator concurs with such 
demonstration, then he shall not issue the permit.
    (5) Class I variances. The owner or operator of a proposed source or 
modification may demonstrate to the Federal Land Manager that the 
emissions from such source or modification would have no adverse impact 
on the air quality related values of any such lands (including 
visibility), notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting 
from emissions from such source or modification would cause or 
contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable 
increases for a Class I area. If the Federal land manager concurs with 
such demonstration and he so certifies, the State may authorize the 
Administrator: Provided, That the applicable requirements of this 
section are otherwise met, to issue the permit with such emission 
limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur 
dioxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides would not exceed the 
following maximum allowable increases over minor source baseline 
concentration for such pollutants:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       Maximum allowable

Nitrogen dioxide:
    Annual arithmetic mean...........................                 25
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (6) Sulfur dioxide variance by Governor with Federal Land Manager's 
concurrence. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification 
which cannot be approved under paragraph (q)(4) of this section may 
demonstrate to the Governor that the source cannot be constructed by 
reason of any maximum allowable increase for sulfur dioxide for a period 
of twenty-four hours or less applicable to any Class I area and, in the 
case of Federal mandatory Class I areas, that a variance under this 
clause would not adversely affect the air quality related values of the 
area (including visibility). The Governor, after consideration of the 
Federal Land Manager's recommendation (if any) and subject to his 
concurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance from 
such maximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the 
Administrator shall issue a permit to such source or modification 
pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (q)(7) of this section: 
Provided, That the applicable requirements of this section are otherwise 
met.
    (7) Variance by the Governor with the President's concurrence. In 
any case where the Governor recommends a variance in which the Federal 
Land Manager does not concur, the recommendations of the Governor and 
the Federal Land Manager shall be transmitted to the President. The 
President may approve the Governor's recommendation if he finds that the 
variance is in the national interest. If the variance is approved, the 
Administrator shall issue a permit pursuant to the requirements of 
paragraph (q)(7) of this section: Provided, That the applicable 
requirements of this section are otherwise met.
    (8) Emission limitations for Presidential or gubernatorial variance. 
In the case of a permit issued pursuant to paragraph (q) (5) or (6) of 
this section the source or modification shall comply with such emission 
limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur 
dioxide from the source or modification would not (during any day on 
which the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases are exceeded) 
cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the following 
maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentration and to 
assure that such emissions would not cause or contribute to 
concentrations which exceed the otherwise applicable maximum allowable 
increases for periods of exposure of 24 hours or less for more than 18 
days, not necessarily consecutive, during any annual period:

                       Maximum Allowable Increase
                      [Micrograms per cubic meter]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 39]]

    (q) Public participation. The Administrator shall follow the 
applicable procedures of 40 CFR part 124 in processing applications 
under this section. The Administrator shall follow the procedures at 40 
CFR 52.21(r) as in effect on June 19, 1979, to the extent that the 
procedures of 40 CFR part 124 do not apply.
    (r) Source obligation. (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or 
operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application 
submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to 
construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject 
to this section who commences construction after the effective date of 
these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, 
shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action.
    (2) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is 
not commenced within 18 months after receipt of such approval, if 
construction is discontinued for a period of 18 months or more, or if 
construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The 
Administrator may extend the 18-month period upon a satisfactory showing 
that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the 
time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased 
construction project; each phase must commence construction within 18 
months of the projected and approved commencement date.
    (3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of 
the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the 
State implementation plan and any other requirements under local, State, 
or Federal law.
    (4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a 
major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a 
relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after 
August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise 
to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then 
the requirements or paragraphs (j) through (s) of this section shall 
apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet 
commenced on the source or modification.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (r)(6)(vi)(b) of this 
section, the provisions of this paragraph (r)(6) apply with respect to 
any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at existing emissions 
units at a major stationary source (other than projects at a source with 
a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility, within 
the meaning of paragraph (r)(6)(vi) of this section, that a project that 
is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant 
emissions increase of such pollutant, and the owner or operator elects 
to use the method specified in paragraphs (b)(41)(ii)(a) through (c) of 
this section for calculating projected actual emissions.
    (i) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner 
or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following 
information:
    (a) A description of the project;
    (b) Identification of the emissions unit(s) whose emissions of a 
regulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and
    (c) A description of the applicability test used to determine that 
the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, 
including the baseline actual emissions, the projected actual emissions, 
the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (b)(41)(ii)(c) of this 
section and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any 
netting calculations, if applicable.
    (ii) If the emissions unit is an existing electric utility steam 
generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or 
operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph 
(r)(6)(i) of this section to the Administrator. Nothing in this 
paragraph (r)(6)(ii) shall be construed to require the owner or operator 
of such a unit to obtain any determination from the Administrator before 
beginning actual construction.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any 
regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the project 
and that is emitted by any emissions unit identified in

[[Page 40]]

paragraph (r)(6)(i)(b) of this section; and calculate and maintain a 
record of the annual emissions, in tons per year on a calendar year 
basis, for a period of 5 years following resumption of regular 
operations after the change, or for a period of 10 years following 
resumption of regular operations after the change if the project 
increases the design capacity or potential to emit of that regulated NSR 
pollutant at such emissions unit. For purposes of this paragraph 
(r)(6)(iii), fugitive emissions (to the extent quantifiable) shall be 
monitored if the emissions unit is part of one of the source categories 
listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section or if the emissions unit 
is located at a major stationary source that belongs to one of the 
listed source categories.
    (iv) If the unit is an existing electric utility steam generating 
unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Administrator 
within 60 days after the end of each year during which records must be 
generated under paragraph (r)(6)(iii) of this section setting out the 
unit's annual emissions, as monitored pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(iii) 
of this section, during the calendar year that preceded submission of 
the report.
    (v) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utility 
steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to 
the Administrator if the annual emissions, in tons per year, from the 
project identified in paragraph (r)(6)(i) of this section, exceed the 
baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to 
paragraph (r)(6)(i)(c) of this section), by a significant amount (as 
defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section) for that regulated NSR 
pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction 
projection as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph 
(r)(6)(i)(c) of this section. Such report shall be submitted to the 
Administrator within 60 days after the end of such year. The report 
shall contain the following:
    (a) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary 
source;
    (b) The annual emissions as calculated pursuant to paragraph 
(r)(6)(iii) of this section; and
    (c) Any other information that the owner or operator wishes to 
include in the report (e.g., an explanation as to why the emissions 
differ from the preconstruction projection).
    (vi) A ``reasonable possibility'' under paragraph (r)(6) of this 
section occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to 
result in either:
    (a) A projected actual emissions increase of at least 50 percent of 
the amount that is a ``significant emissions increase,'' as defined 
under paragraph (b)(40) of this section (without reference to the amount 
that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR 
pollutant; or
    (b) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount 
of emissions excluded under paragraph (b)(41)(ii)(c) of this section, 
sums to at least 50 percent of the amount that is a ``significant 
emissions increase,'' as defined under paragraph (b)(40) of this section 
(without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions 
increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a 
reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of paragraph 
(r)(6)(vi)(b) of this section, and not also within the meaning of 
paragraph (r)(6)(vi)(a) of this section, then provisions (r)(6)(ii) 
through (v) do not apply to the project.
    (7) The owner or operator of the source shall make the information 
required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6) of 
this section available for review upon a request for inspection by the 
Administrator or the general public pursuant to the requirements 
contained in Sec. 70.4(b)(3)(viii) of this chapter.
    (s) Environmental impact statements. Whenever any proposed source or 
modification is subject to action by a Federal Agency which might 
necessitate preparation of an environmental impact statement pursuant to 
the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321), review by the 
Administrator conducted pursuant to this section shall be coordinated 
with the broad environmental reviews under that Act and under section 
309 of the Clean Air Act to the maximum extent feasible and reasonable.

    (t) Disputed permits or redesignations. If any State affected by the 
redesignation of an area by an Indian Governing Body, or any Indian 
Governing Body of a tribe affected by the redesignation of an area by a 
State, disagrees with such redesignation, or if a permit is proposed to 
be issued for any major stationary source or major modification proposed 
for construction in any State which the Governor of an affected State or 
Indian Governing Body of an affected tribe determines will cause or 
contribute to a cumulative change in air quality in excess of that 
allowed in this part within the affected State or Indian Reservation, 
the Governor or Indian Governing Body may request the Administrator to 
enter into negotiations with the parties involved to resolve such 
dispute. If requested by any State or Indian Governing Body involved, 
the Administrator shall make a recommendation to resolve the dispute and 
protect the air quality related values of the lands involved. If the 
parties involved do not reach agreement, the Administrator shall resolve 
the dispute and his determination, or the results of agreements reached 
through other means, shall become part of the applicable State 
implementation plan and shall be enforceable as part of such plan. In 
resolving such disputes relating to area redesignation, the 
Administrator shall consider the extent to which the lands involved are 
of sufficient size to allow effective air quality management or have air 
quality related values of such an area.
    (u) Delegation of authority. (1) The Administrator shall have the 
authority to delegate his responsibility for conducting source review 
pursuant to this section, in accordance with paragraphs (v) (2) and (3) 
of this section.
    (2) Where the Administrator delegates the responsibility for 
conducting source review under this section to any agency other than a 
Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the following 
provisions shall apply:
    (i) Where the delegate agency is not an air pollution control 
agency, it shall consult with the appropriate State and local air 
pollution control agency prior to making any determination under this 
section. Similarly, where the delegate agency does not have continuing 
responsibility for managing land use, it shall consult with the 
appropriate State and local agency primarily responsible for managing 
land use prior to making any determination under this section.
    (ii) The delegate agency shall send a copy of any public comment 
notice required under paragraph (r) of this section to the Administrator 
through the appropriate Regional Office.
    (3) The Administrator's authority for reviewing a source or 
modification located on an Indian Reservation shall not be redelegated 
other than to a Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, 
except where the State has assumed jurisdiction over such land under 
other laws. Where the State has assumed such jurisdiction, the 
Administrator may delegate his authority to the States in accordance 
with paragraph (v)(2) of this section.
    (4) In the case of a source or modification which proposes to 
construct in a class III area, emissions from which would cause or 
contribute to air quality exceeding the maximum allowable increase 
applicable if the area were designated a class II area, and where no 
standard under section 111 of the act has been promulgated for such 
source category, the Administrator must approve the determination of 
best available control technology as set forth in the permit.
    (v) Innovative control technology. (1) An owner or operator of a 
proposed major stationary source or major modification may request the 
Administrator in writing no later than the close of the comment period 
under 40 CFR 124.10 to approve a system of innovative control 
technology.
    (2) The Administrator shall, with the consent of the governor(s) of 
the affected state(s), determine that the source or modification may 
employ a system of innovative control technology, if:
    (i) The proposed control system would not cause or contribute to an 
unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation 
or function;
    (ii) The owner or operator agrees to achieve a level of continuous 
emissions reduction equivalent to that which

[[Page 42]]

would have been required under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, by a 
date specified by the Administrator. Such date shall not be later than 4 
years from the time of startup or 7 years from permit issuance;
    (iii) The source or modification would meet the requirements of 
paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section, based on the emissions rate that 
the stationary source employing the system of innovative control 
technology would be required to meet on the date specified by the 
Administrator;
    (iv) The source or modification would not before the date specified 
by the Administrator:
    (a) Cause or contribute to a violation of an applicable national 
ambient air quality standard; or
    (b) Impact any area where an applicable increment is known to be 
violated; and
    (v) All other applicable requirements including those for public 
participation have been met.
    (vi) The provisions of paragraph (p) of this section (relating to 
Class I areas) have been satisfied with respect to all periods during 
the life of the source or modification.
    (3) The Administrator shall withdraw any approval to employ a system 
of innovative control technology made under this section, if:
    (i) The proposed system fails by the specified date to achieve the 
required continuous emissions reduction rate; or
    (ii) The proposed system fails before the specified date so as to 
contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety; 
or
    (iii) The Administrator decides at any time that the proposed system 
is unlikely to achieve the required level of control or to protect the 
public health, welfare, or safety.
    (4) If a source or modification fails to meet the required level of 
continuous emission reduction within the specified time period or the 
approval is withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (v)(3) of this 
section, the Administrator may allow the source or modification up to an 
additional 3 years to meet the requirement for the application of best 
available control technology through use of a demonstrated system of 
control.
    (w) Permit rescission. (1) Any permit issued under this section or a 
prior version of this section shall remain in effect, unless and until 
it expires under paragraph (s) of this section or is rescinded.
    (2) Any owner or operator of a stationary source or modification who 
holds a permit for the source or modification which was issued under 40 
CFR 52.21 as in effect on July 30, 1987, or any earlier version of this 
section, may request that the Administrator rescind the permit or a 
particular portion of the permit.
    (3) The Administrator shall grant an application for rescission if 
the application shows that this section would not apply to the source or 
modification.
    (4) If the Administrator rescinds a permit under this paragraph, the 
public shall be given adequate notice of the rescission. Publication of 
an announcement of rescission in a newspaper of general circulation in 
the affected region within 60 days of the rescission shall be considered 
adequate notice.
    (x)-(z) [Reserved]
    (aa) Actuals PALs. The provisions in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) 
of this section govern actuals PALs.
    (1) Applicability. (i) The Administrator may approve the use of an 
actuals PAL for any existing major stationary source if the PAL meets 
the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section. The 
term ``PAL'' shall mean ``actuals PAL'' throughout paragraph (aa) of 
this section.
    (ii) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of 
a major stationary source that maintains its total source-wide emissions 
below the PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(1) 
through (15) of this section, and complies with the PAL permit:
    (a) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant;
    (b) Does not have to be approved through the PSD program; and
    (c) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (r)(4) of this 
section (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that 
the major stationary

[[Page 43]]

source used to avoid applicability of the major NSR program).
    (iii) Except as provided under paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(c) of this 
section, a major stationary source shall continue to comply with all 
applicable Federal or State requirements, emission limitations, and work 
practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date 
of the PAL.
    (2) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the definitions 
in paragraphs (aa)(2)(i) through (xi) of this section apply. When a term 
is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in 
paragraph (b) of this section or in the Act.
    (i) Actuals PAL for a major stationary source means a PAL based on 
the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(48) of this 
section) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this 
section) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL 
pollutant.
    (ii) Allowable emissions means ``allowable emissions'' as defined in 
paragraph (b)(16) of this section, except as this definition is modified 
according to paragraphs (aa)(2)(ii)(a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) The allowable emissions for any emissions unit shall be 
calculated considering any emission limitations that are enforceable as 
a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit.
    (b) An emissions unit's potential to emit shall be determined using 
the definition in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, except that the 
words ``or enforceable as a practical matter'' should be added after 
``federally enforceable.''
    (iii) Small emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits or has 
the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the 
significant level for that PAL pollutant, as defined in paragraph 
(b)(23) of this section or in the Act, whichever is lower.
    (iv) Major emissions unit means:
    (a) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit 100 
tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainment area; or
    (b) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the 
PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the major 
source threshold for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Act for 
nonattainment areas. For example, in accordance with the definition of 
major stationary source in section 182(c) of the Act, an emissions unit 
would be a major emissions unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located 
in a serious ozone nonattainment area and it emits or has the potential 
to emit 50 or more tons of VOC per year.
    (v) Plantwide applicability limitation (PAL) means an emission 
limitation expressed in tons per year, for a pollutant at a major 
stationary source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and 
established source-wide in accordance with paragraphs (aa)(1) through 
(15) of this section.
    (vi) PAL effective date generally means the date of issuance of the 
PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the 
date any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification 
becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant.
    (vii) PAL effective period means the period beginning with the PAL 
effective date and ending 10 years later.
    (viii) PAL major modification means, notwithstanding paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section (the definitions for major 
modification and net emissions increase), any physical change in or 
change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to 
emit the PAL pollutant at a level equal to or greater than the PAL.
    (ix) PAL permit means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or 
the State operating permit under a program that is approved into the 
State Implementation Plan, or the title V permit issued by the 
Administrator that establishes a PAL for a major stationary source.
    (x) PAL pollutant means the pollutant for which a PAL is established 
at a major stationary source.
    (xi) Significant emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits 
or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal 
to or greater than the significant level (as defined in paragraph 
(b)(23) of this section or in the Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL 
pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as

[[Page 44]]

a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iv) of this 
section.
    (3) Permit application requirements. As part of a permit application 
requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source 
shall submit the following information to the Administrator for 
approval:
    (i) A list of all emissions units at the source designated as small, 
significant or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the 
owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, Federal or 
State applicable requirements, emission limitations, or work practices 
apply to each unit.
    (ii) Calculations of the baseline actual emissions (with supporting 
documentation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions 
associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions 
associated with startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
    (iii) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source 
owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data 
to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a 12-month rolling 
total for each month as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) of this 
section.
    (4) General requirements for establishing PALs. (i) The 
Administrator is allowed to establish a PAL at a major stationary 
source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs 
(aa)(4)(i)(a) through (g) of this section are met.
    (a) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation in tons per 
year, that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major 
stationary source. For each month during the PAL effective period after 
the first 12 months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source 
owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from 
each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous 12 consecutive months 
is less than the PAL (a 12-month average, rolled monthly). For each 
month during the first 11 months from the PAL effective date, the major 
stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the 
preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each 
emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL.
    (b) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the 
public participation requirements in paragraph (aa)(5) of this section.
    (c) The PAL permit shall contain all the requirements of paragraph 
(aa)(7) of this section.
    (d) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent 
quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential 
to emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source, regardless of 
whether the emissions unit or major stationary source belongs to one of 
the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (e) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant.
    (f) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of 10 years.
    (g) The owner or operator of the major stationary source with a PAL 
shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements provided in paragraphs (aa)(12) through (14) of this 
section for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective 
period.
    (ii) At no time (during or after the PAL effective period) are 
emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant that occur during the PAL 
effective period creditable as decreases for purposes of offsets under 
Sec. 51.165(a)(3)(ii) of this chapter unless the level of the PAL is 
reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions 
would be creditable in the absence of the PAL.
    (5) Public participation requirements for PALs. PALs for existing 
major stationary sources shall be established, renewed, or increased 
through a procedure that is consistent with Sec. Sec. 51.160 and 51.161 
of this chapter. This includes the requirement that the Administrator 
provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit 
and at least a 30-day period for submittal of public comment. The 
Administrator must address all material comments before taking final 
action on the permit.
    (6) Setting the 10-year actuals PAL level. (i) Except as provided in 
paragraph (aa)(6)(ii) of this section, the plan shall provide that the 
actuals PAL level for a major stationary

[[Page 45]]

source shall be established as the sum of the baseline actual emissions 
(as defined in paragraph (b)(48) of this section) of the PAL pollutant 
for each emissions unit at the source; plus an amount equal to the 
applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragraph 
(b)(23) of this section or under the Act, whichever is lower. When 
establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one 
consecutive 24-month period must be used to determine the baseline 
actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different 
consecutive 24-month period may be used for each different PAL 
pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut 
down after this 24-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. 
The reviewing authority shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tons/
yr) in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance 
date(s) of any applicable Federal or State regulatory requirement(s) 
that the reviewing authority is aware of prior to issuance of the PAL 
permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be required 
to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline 
emissions of 60 ppm NO<INF>X</INF> to a new rule limit of 30 ppm, then 
the permit shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to 
the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions 
of such unit(s).
    (ii) For newly constructed units (which do not include modifications 
to existing units) on which actual construction began after the 24-month 
period, in lieu of adding the baseline actual emissions as specified in 
paragraph (aa)(6)(i) of this section, the emissions must be added to the 
PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the units.
    (7) Contents of the PAL permit. The PAL permit must contain, at a 
minimum, the information in paragraphs (aa)(7)(i) through (x) of this 
section.
    (i) The PAL pollutant and the applicable source-wide emission 
limitation in tons per year.
    (ii) The PAL permit effective date and the expiration date of the 
PAL (PAL effective period).
    (iii) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary 
source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with 
paragraph (aa)(10) of this section before the end of the PAL effective 
period, then the PAL shall not expire at the end of the PAL effective 
period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued 
by a reviewing authority.
    (iv) A requirement that emission calculations for compliance 
purposes must include emissions from startups, shutdowns, and 
malfunctions.
    (v) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary 
source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (aa)(9) of this 
section.
    (vi) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source 
owner or operator shall use to convert the monitoring system data to 
monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a 12-month rolling total 
as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) of this section.
    (vii) A requirement that the major stationary source owner or 
operator monitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions 
under paragraph (aa)(12) of this section.
    (viii) A requirement to retain the records required under paragraph 
(aa)(13) of this section on site. Such records may be retained in an 
electronic format.
    (ix) A requirement to submit the reports required under paragraph 
(aa)(14) of this section by the required deadlines.
    (x) Any other requirements that the Administrator deems necessary to 
implement and enforce the PAL.
    (8) PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit. The 
requirements in paragraphs (aa)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to 
actuals PALs.
    (i) PAL effective period. The Administrator shall specify a PAL 
effective period of 10 years.
    (ii) Reopening of the PAL permit. (a) During the PAL effective 
period, the Administrator must reopen the PAL permit to:
    (1) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL 
or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish 
the PAL;
    (2) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary

[[Page 46]]

source creates creditable emissions reductions for use as offsets under 
Sec. 51.165(a)(3)(ii) of this chapter; and
    (3) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided 
under paragraph (aa)(11) of this section.
    (b) The Administrator shall have discretion to reopen the PAL permit 
for the following:
    (1) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicable Federal requirements 
(for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date;
    (2) Reduce the PAL consistent with any other requirement, that is 
enforceable as a practical matter, and that the State may impose on the 
major stationary source under the State Implementation Plan; and
    (3) Reduce the PAL if the reviewing authority determines that a 
reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a NAAQS or 
PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality 
related value that has been identified for a Federal Class I area by a 
Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the 
general public.
    (c) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (aa)(8)(ii)(a)(1) 
of this section for the correction of typographical/calculation errors 
that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be 
carried out in accordance with the public participation requirements of 
paragraph (aa)(5) of this section.
    (9) Expiration of a PAL. Any PAL that is not renewed in accordance 
with the procedures in paragraph (aa)(10) of this section shall expire 
at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in 
paragraphs (aa)(9)(i) through (v) of this section shall apply.
    (i) Each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units) that 
existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation 
under a revised permit established according to the procedures in 
paragraphs (aa)(9)(i)(a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals in paragraph 
(aa)(10)(ii) of this section, the major stationary source shall submit a 
proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each 
group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropriate as 
decided by the Administrator) by distributing the PAL allowable 
emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions 
units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted 
for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL 
effective period, as required under paragraph (aa)(10)(v) of this 
section, such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been 
adjusted.
    (b) The Administrator shall decide whether and how the PAL allowable 
emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating 
allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions 
units, as the Administrator determines is appropriate.
    (ii) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission 
limitation on a 12-month rolling basis. The Administrator may approve 
the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) 
other than CEMS, CERMS, PEMS, or CPMS to demonstrate compliance with the 
allowable emission limitation.
    (iii) Until the Administrator issues the revised permit 
incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of 
emissions units, as required under paragraph (aa)(9)(i)(b) of this 
section, the source shall continue to comply with a source-wide, multi-
unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission 
limitation.
    (iv) Any physical change or change in the method of operation at the 
major stationary source will be subject to major NSR requirements if 
such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (v) The major stationary source owner or operator shall continue to 
comply with any State or Federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, 
NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period 
or prior to the PAL effective period except for those emission 
limitations that had been established pursuant to paragraph (r)(4) of 
this section, but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the 
provisions in paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(c) of this section.

[[Page 47]]

    (10) Renewal of a PAL. (i) The Administrator shall follow the 
procedures specified in paragraph (aa)(5) of this section in approving 
any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source, and shall 
provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the 
proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During such 
public review, any person may propose a PAL level for the source for 
consideration by the Administrator.
    (ii) Application deadline. A major stationary source owner or 
operator shall submit a timely application to the Administrator to 
request renewal of a PAL. A timely application is one that is submitted 
at least 6 months prior to, but not earlier than 18 months from, the 
date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to 
ensure that the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If 
the owner or operator of a major stationary source submits a complete 
application to renew the PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall 
continue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL 
is issued.
    (iii) Application requirements. The application to renew a PAL 
permit shall contain the information required in paragraphs 
(aa)(10)(iii)(a) through (d) of this section.
    (a) The information required in paragraphs (aa)(3)(i) through (iii) 
of this section.
    (b) A proposed PAL level.
    (c) The sum of the potential to emit of all emissions units under 
the PAL (with supporting documentation).
    (d) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the 
Administrator to consider in determining the appropriate level for 
renewing the PAL.
    (iv) PAL adjustment. In determining whether and how to adjust the 
PAL, the Administrator shall consider the options outlined in paragraphs 
(aa)(10)(iv)(a) and (b) of this section. However, in no case may any 
such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(c) of this 
section.
    (a) If the emissions level calculated in accordance with paragraph 
(aa)(6) of this section is equal to or greater than 80 percent of the 
PAL level, the Administrator may renew the PAL at the same level without 
considering the factors set forth in paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(b) of this 
section; or
    (b) The Administrator may set the PAL at a level that he or she 
determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual 
emissions, or that he or she determines to be more appropriate 
considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, 
anticipated economic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage 
the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factors as 
specifically identified by the Administrator in his or her written 
rationale.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (aa)(10)(iv)(a) and (b) of this 
section:
    (1) If the potential to emit of the major stationary source is less 
than the PAL, the Administrator shall adjust the PAL to a level no 
greater than the potential to emit of the source; and
    (2) The Administrator shall not approve a renewed PAL level higher 
than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source has complied 
with the provisions of paragraph (aa)(11) of this section (increasing a 
PAL).
    (v) If the compliance date for a State or Federal requirement that 
applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if 
the Administrator has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL 
shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renewal or title V permit 
renewal, whichever occurs first.
    (11) Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period. (i) The 
Administrator may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major 
stationary source complies with the provisions in paragraphs 
(aa)(11)(i)(a) through (d) of this section.
    (a) The owner or operator of the major stationary source shall 
submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit 
for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the 
emissions unit(s) contributing to the increase in emissions so as to 
cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or exceed its 
PAL.
    (b) As part of this application, the major stationary source owner 
or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual 
emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of

[[Page 48]]

the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions 
units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of 
the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds 
the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivalent 
controls on each significant or major emissions unit shall be determined 
by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is 
submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply 
with a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the 
preceding 10 years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that 
emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which 
that emissions unit must currently comply.
    (c) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all 
emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(a) of this 
section, regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting 
from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissions 
unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the 
major NSR process (for example, BACT), even though they have also become 
subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL.
    (d) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall 
be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major 
modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant.
    (ii) The Administrator shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the 
allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the 
sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major 
emissions units (assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as 
determined in accordance with paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(b)), plus the sum of 
the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units.
    (iii) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL 
level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (aa)(5) of 
this section.
    (12) Monitoring requirements for PALs. (i) General requirements. (a) 
Each PAL permit must contain enforceable requirements for the monitoring 
system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL 
pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time. Any monitoring system 
authorized for use in the PAL permit must be based on sound science and 
meet generally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and 
manipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system 
must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial 
proceeding to enforce the PAL permit.
    (b) The PAL monitoring system must employ one or more of the four 
general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set forth 
in paragraphs (aa)(12)(ii)(a) through (d) of this section and must be 
approved by the Administrator.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(b) of this section, you 
may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that meets paragraph 
(aa)(12)(i)(a) of this section if approved by the Administrator.
    (d) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements 
of this section renders the PAL invalid.
    (ii) Minimum performance requirements for approved monitoring 
approaches. The following are acceptable general monitoring approaches 
when conducted in accordance with the minimum requirements in paragraphs 
(aa)(12)(iii) through (ix) of this section:
    (a) Mass balance calculations for activities using coatings or 
solvents;
    (b) CEMS;
    (c) CPMS or PEMS; and
    (d) Emission factors.
    (iii) Mass balance calculations. An owner or operator using mass 
balance calculations to monitor PAL pollutant emissions from activities 
using coating or solvents shall meet the following requirements:
    (a) Provide a demonstrated means of validating the published content 
of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by all materials 
used in or at the emissions unit;
    (b) Assume that the emissions unit emits all of the PAL pollutant 
that is contained in or created by any raw material or fuel used in or 
at the emissions unit, if it cannot otherwise be accounted for in the 
process; and

[[Page 49]]

    (c) Where the vendor of a material or fuel, which is used in or at 
the emissions unit, publishes a range of pollutant content from such 
material, the owner or operator must use the highest value of the range 
to calculate the PAL pollutant emissions unless the Administrator 
determines there is site-specific data or a site-specific monitoring 
program to support another content within the range.
    (iv) CEMS. An owner or operator using CEMS to monitor PAL pollutant 
emissions shall meet the following requirements:
    (a) CEMS must comply with applicable Performance Specifications 
found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B; and
    (b) CEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every 15 
minutes while the emissions unit is operating.
    (v) CPMS or PEMS. An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor 
PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements:
    (a) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site-specific data 
demonstrating a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the 
PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions 
unit; and
    (b) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at least 
every 15 minutes, or at another less frequent interval approved by the 
Administrator, while the emissions unit is operating.
    (vi) Emission factors. An owner or operator using emission factors 
to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following 
requirements:
    (a) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to 
account for the degree of uncertainty or limitations in the factors' 
development;
    (b) The emissions unit shall operate within the designated range of 
use for the emission factor, if applicable; and
    (c) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a 
significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to 
calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation testing to 
determine a site-specific emission factor within 6 months of PAL permit 
issuance, unless the Administrator determines that testing is not 
required.
    (vii) A source owner or operator must record and report maximum 
potential emissions without considering enforceable emission limitations 
or operational restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of 
time that there is no monitoring data, unless another method for 
determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL 
permit.
    (viii) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii) 
through (vii) of this section, where an owner or operator of an 
emissions unit cannot demonstrate a correlation between the monitored 
parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions rate at all operating 
points of the emissions unit, the Administrator shall, at the time of 
permit issuance:
    (a) Establish default value(s) for determining compliance with the 
PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at 
such operating point(s); or
    (b) Determine that operation of the emissions unit during operating 
conditions when there is no correlation between monitored parameter(s) 
and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL.
    (ix) Re-validation. All data used to establish the PAL pollutant 
must be re-validated through performance testing or other scientifically 
valid means approved by the Administrator. Such testing must occur at 
least once every 5 years after issuance of the PAL.
    (13) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) The PAL permit shall require an 
owner or operator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine 
compliance with any requirement of paragraph (aa) of this section and of 
the PAL, including a determination of each emissions unit's 12-month 
rolling total emissions, for 5 years from the date of such record.
    (ii) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a 
copy of the following records for the duration of the PAL effective 
period plus 5 years:
    (a) A copy of the PAL permit application and any applications for 
revisions to the PAL; and
    (b) Each annual certification of compliance pursuant to title V and 
the

[[Page 50]]

data relied on in certifying the compliance.
    (14) Reporting and notification requirements. The owner or operator 
shall submit semi-annual monitoring reports and prompt deviation reports 
to the Administrator in accordance with the applicable title V operating 
permit program. The reports shall meet the requirements in paragraphs 
(aa)(14)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Semi-annual report. The semi-annual report shall be submitted to 
the Administrator within 30 days of the end of each reporting period. 
This report shall contain the information required in paragraphs 
(aa)(14)(i)(a) through (g) of this section.
    (a) The identification of owner and operator and the permit number.
    (b) Total annual emissions (tons/year) based on a 12-month rolling 
total for each month in the reporting period recorded pursuant to 
paragraph (aa)(13)(i) of this section.
    (c) All data relied upon, including, but not limited to, any Quality 
Assurance or Quality Control data, in calculating the monthly and annual 
PAL pollutant emissions.
    (d) A list of any emissions units modified or added to the major 
stationary source during the preceding 6-month period.
    (e) The number, duration, and cause of any deviations or monitoring 
malfunctions (other than the time associated with zero and span 
calibration checks), and any corrective action taken.
    (f) A notification of a shutdown of any monitoring system, whether 
the shutdown was permanent or temporary, the reason for the shutdown, 
the anticipated date that the monitoring system will be fully 
operational or replaced with another monitoring system, and whether the 
emissions unit monitored by the monitoring system continued to operate, 
and the calculation of the emissions of the pollutant or the number 
determined by method included in the permit, as provided by 
(aa)(12)(vii).
    (g) A signed statement by the responsible official (as defined by 
the applicable title V operating permit program) certifying the truth, 
accuracy, and completeness of the information provided in the report.
    (ii) Deviation report. The major stationary source owner or operator 
shall promptly submit reports of any deviations or exceedance of the PAL 
requirements, including periods where no monitoring is available. A 
report submitted pursuant to Sec. 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) of this chapter 
shall satisfy this reporting requirement. The deviation reports shall be 
submitted within the time limits prescribed by the applicable program 
implementing Sec. 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) of this chapter. The reports shall 
contain the following information:
    (a) The identification of owner and operator and the permit number;
    (b) The PAL requirement that experienced the deviation or that was 
exceeded;
    (c) Emissions resulting from the deviation or the exceedance; and
    (d) A signed statement by the responsible official (as defined by 
the applicable title V operating permit program) certifying the truth, 
accuracy, and completeness of the information provided in the report.
    (iii) Re-validation results. The owner or operator shall submit to 
the Administrator the results of any re-validation test or method within 
3 months after completion of such test or method.
    (15) Transition requirements. (i) The Administrator may not issue a 
PAL that does not comply with the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(1) 
through (15) of this section after March 3, 2003.
    (ii) The Administrator may supersede any PAL that was established 
prior to March 3, 2003 with a PAL that complies with the requirements of 
paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section.
    (bb) If any provision of this section, or the application of such 
provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder 
of this section, or the application of such provision to persons or 
circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not 
be affected thereby.
    (cc) Without regard to other considerations, routine maintenance, 
repair and replacement includes, but is not limited to, the replacement 
of any component of a process unit with an identical or functionally 
equivalent

[[Page 51]]

component(s), and maintenance and repair activities that are part of the 
replacement activity, provided that all of the requirements in 
paragraphs (cc)(1) through (3) of this section are met.
    (1) Capital cost threshold for equipment replacement. (i) For an 
electric utility steam generating unit, as defined in Sec. 
52.21(b)(31), the fixed capital cost of the replacement component(s) 
plus the cost of any associated maintenance and repair activities that 
are part of the replacement shall not exceed 20 percent of the 
replacement value of the process unit, at the time the equipment is 
replaced. For a process unit that is not an electric utility steam 
generating unit the fixed capital cost of the replacement component(s) 
plus the cost of any associated maintenance and repair activities that 
are part of the replacement shall not exceed 20 percent of the 
replacement value of the process unit, at the time the equipment is 
replaced.
    (ii) In determining the replacement value of the process unit; and, 
except as otherwise allowed under paragraph (cc)(1)(iii) of this 
section, the owner or operator shall determine the replacement value of 
the process unit on an estimate of the fixed capital cost of 
constructing a new process unit, or on the current appraised value of 
the process unit.
    (iii) As an alternative to paragraph (cc)(1)(ii) of this section for 
determining the replacement value of a process unit, an owner or 
operator may choose to use insurance value (where the insurance value 
covers only complete replacement), investment value adjusted for 
inflation, or another accounting procedure if such procedure is based on 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, provided that the owner or 
operator sends a notice to the reviewing authority. The first time that 
an owner or operator submits such a notice for a particular process 
unit, the notice may be submitted at any time, but any subsequent notice 
for that process unit may be submitted only at the beginning of the 
process unit's fiscal year. Unless the owner or operator submits a 
notice to the reviewing authority, then paragraph (cc)(1)(ii) of this 
section will be used to establish the replacement value of the process 
unit. Once the owner or operator submits a notice to use an alternative 
accounting procedure, the owner or operator must continue to use that 
procedure for the entire fiscal year for that process unit. In 
subsequent fiscal years, the owner or operator must continue to use this 
selected procedure unless and until the owner or operator sends another 
notice to the reviewing authority selecting another procedure consistent 
with this paragraph or paragraph (cc)(1)(ii) of this section at the 
beginning of such fiscal year.
    (2) Basic design parameters. The replacement does not change the 
basic design parameter(s) of the process unit to which the activity 
pertains.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (cc)(2)(iii) of this section, 
for a process unit at a steam electric generating facility, the owner or 
operator may select as its basic design parameters either maximum hourly 
heat input and maximum hourly fuel consumption rate or maximum hourly 
electric output rate and maximum steam flow rate. When establishing fuel 
consumption specifications in terms of weight or volume, the minimum 
fuel quality based on British Thermal Units content shall be used for 
determining the basic design parameter(s) for a coal-fired electric 
utility steam generating unit.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (cc)(2)(iii) of this section, 
the basic design parameter(s) for any process unit that is not at a 
steam electric generating facility are maximum rate of fuel or heat 
input, maximum rate of material input, or maximum rate of product 
output. Combustion process units will typically use maximum rate of fuel 
input. For sources having multiple end products and raw materials, the 
owner or operator should consider the primary product or primary raw 
material when selecting a basic design parameter.
    (iii) If the owner or operator believes the basic design 
parameter(s) in paragraphs (cc)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section is not 
appropriate for a specific industry or type of process unit, the owner 
or operator may propose to the reviewing authority an alternative basic 
design parameter(s) for the source's process unit(s). If the reviewing 
authority

[[Page 52]]

approves of the use of an alternative basic design parameter(s), the 
reviewing authority shall issue a permit that is legally enforceable 
that records such basic design parameter(s) and requires the owner or 
operator to comply with such parameter(s).
    (iv) The owner or operator shall use credible information, such as 
results of historic maximum capability tests, design information from 
the manufacturer, or engineering calculations, in establishing the 
magnitude of the basic design parameter(s) specified in paragraphs 
(cc)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (v) If design information is not available for a process unit, then 
the owner or operator shall determine the process unit's basic design 
parameter(s) using the maximum value achieved by the process unit in the 
five-year period immediately preceding the planned activity.
    (vi) Efficiency of a process unit is not a basic design parameter.
    (3) The replacement activity shall not cause the process unit to 
exceed any emission limitation, or operational limitation that has the 
effect of constraining emissions, that applies to the process unit and 
that is legally enforceable.

    Note to paragraph (cc): By a court order on December 24, 2003, this 
paragraph (cc) is stayed indefinitely. The stayed provisions will become 
effective immediately if the court terminates the stay. At that time, 
EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register advising the public 
of the termination of the stay.

Sec. 52.21  Prevention of significant deterioration of air quality.

                                * * * * *

    (b) * * *
    (49) Subject to regulation means, for any air pollutant, that the 
pollutant is subject to either a provision in the Clean Air Act, or a 
nationally-applicable regulation codified by the Administrator in 
subchapter C of this chapter, that requires actual control of the 
quantity of emissions of that pollutant, and that such a control 
requirement has taken effect and is operative to control, limit or 
restrict the quantity of emissions of that pollutant released from the 
regulated activity. Except that:
    (i) Greenhouse gases (GHGs), the air pollutant defined in Sec. 
86.1818-12(a) of this chapter as the aggregate group of six greenhouse 
gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, 
perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride, shall not be subject to 
regulation except as provided in paragraphs (b)(49)(iv) through (v) of 
this section.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(49)(iii) through (v) of this 
section, the term tpy CO<INF>2</INF> equivalent emissions 
(CO<INF>2</INF>e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall 
be computed as follows:
    (a) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the 
six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated 
global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of part 98 
of this chapter--Global Warming Potentials.
    (b) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(49)(ii)(a) of this 
section for each gas to compute a tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e.
    (iii) The term emissions increase as used in paragraphs (b)(49)(iv) 
through (v) of this section shall mean that both a significant emissions 
increase (as calculated using the procedures in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of 
this section) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in 
paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(23) of this section) occur. For the pollutant 
GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e, and 
shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR 
pollutant, and ``significant'' is defined as 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e 
instead of applying the value in paragraph (b)(23)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to 
regulation if:
    (a) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a 
regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will 
have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; or
    (b) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for 
a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will

[[Page 53]]

have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an 
emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or more; and,
    (v) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in 
paragraph (b)(49)(iv) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be 
subject to regulation
    (a) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential 
to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e; or
    (b) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential 
to emit 100,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e, when such stationary source 
undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that 
will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e or 
more.
    (50) * * *
    (iv) Any pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the 
Act as defined in paragraph (b)(49) of this section.
    (v) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(50)(i) through (iv) of this 
section, the term regulated NSR pollutant shall not include any or all 
hazardous air pollutants either listed in section 112 of the Act, or 
added to the list pursuant to section 112(b)(2) of the Act, and which 
have not been delisted pursuant to section 112(b)(3) of the Act, unless 
the listed hazardous air pollutant is also regulated as a constituent or 
precursor of a general pollutant listed under section 108 of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 52.22  Enforceable commitments for further actions addressing the pollutant greenhouse gases (GHGs).

    (a) Definitions. (1) Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) means the air pollutant 
as defined in Sec. 86.1818-12(a) of this chapter as the aggregate group 
of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
    (2) All other terms used in this section shall have the meaning 
given in Sec. 52.21.
    (b) Further action to regulate GHGs under the PSD program.
    (1) Near term action on GHGs. The Administrator shall solicit 
comment, under section 307(b) of the Act, on promulgating lower GHGs 
thresholds for PSD applicability. Such action shall be finalized by July 
1, 2012 and become effective July 1, 2013.
    (2) Further study and action on GHGs.
    (i) No later than April 30, 2015 the Administrator shall complete a 
study projecting the administrative burdens that remain with respect to 
stationary sources for which GHGs do not constitute a regulated NSR 
pollutant. Such study shall account, among other things, for permitting 
authorities ability to secure resources, hire and train staff; 
experiences associated with GHG permitting for new types of sources and 
technologies; and, the success of streamlining measures developed by EPA 
(and adopted by the states) for reducing the permitting burden 
associated with such stationary sources.
    (ii) Based on the results of the study described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section, the Administrator shall propose a rule 
addressing the permitting obligations of such stationary sources under 
Sec. 52.21 and Sec. 51.166 of this chapter. The Administrator shall 
take final action on such a rule no later than April 30, 2016.
    (iii) Before completing the rule described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section, the Administrator shall take no action to make the 
pollutant GHGs subject to regulation at stationary sources that emit or 
have the potential to emit less than 50,000 tpy CO<INF>2</INF>e, or for 
physical changes or changes in the method of operations at stationary 
sources that result in an emissions increase of less than 50,000 tpy 
CO<INF>2</INF>e (as determined using the methodology described in Sec. 
52.21(b)(49)(ii).)

<R05>
Sec. 52.23  Violation and enforcement.

    Failure to comply with any provisions of this part, or with any 
approved regulatory provision of a State implementation plan, or with 
any permit condition or permit denial issued pursuant to approved or 
promulgated regulations for the review of new or modified stationary or 
indirect sources, or with any permit limitation or condition contained 
within an operating permit issued under an EPA-approved program that is 
incorporated into the State implementation plan, shall render the person 
or governmental entity so failing to comply in violation of a 
requirement of an applicable implementation plan and subject to 
enforcement action under section 113 of the

[[Page 54]]

Clean Air Act. With regard to compliance schedules, a person or 
Governmental entity will be considered to have failed to comply with the 
requirements of this part if it fails to timely submit any required 
compliance schedule, if the compliance schedule when submitted does not 
contain each of the elements it is required to contain, or if the person 
or Governmental entity fails to comply with such schedule.

<R05>
Sec. 52.24  Statutory restriction on new sources.

    (a) Any area designated nonattainment pursuant to section 107(d) of 
the Act to which, immediately prior to the enactment of the Amendments 
to the Act of 1990 (November 15, 1990), a prohibition of construction or 
modification of major stationary sources was applied, shall retain that 
prohibition if such prohibition was applied by virtue of a finding of 
the Administrator that the State containing such an area:
    (1) Failed to submit an implementation plan meeting the requirements 
of an approvable new source review permitting program; or
    (2) Failed to submit an implementation plan that provided for timely 
attainment of the national ambient air quality standard for sulfur 
dioxide by December 31, 1982. This prohibition shall apply until the 
Administrator approves a plan for such area as meeting the applicable 
requirements of part D of title I of the Act as amended (NSR permitting 
requirements) or subpart 5 of part D of title I of the Act as amended 
(relating to attainment of the national ambient air quality standards 
for sulfur dioxide), as applicable.
    (b) Permits to construct and operate as required by permit programs 
under section 172(c)(5) of the Act may not be issued for new or modified 
major stationary sources proposing to locate in nonattainment areas or 
areas in a transport region where the Administrator has determined that 
the applicable implementation plan is not being adequately implemented 
for the nonattainment area or transport region in which the proposed 
source is to be constructed or modified in accordance with the 
requirements of part D of title I of the Act.
    (c) Whenever, on the basis of any information, the Administrator 
finds that a State is not in compliance with any requirement or 
prohibition of the Act relating to the construction of new sources or 
the modification of existing sources, the Administrator may issue an 
order under section 113(a)(5) of the Act prohibiting the construction or 
modification of any major stationary source in any area to which such 
requirement applies.
    (d) The restrictions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply 
only to major stationary sources of emissions that cause or contribute 
to concentrations of the pollutant (or precursors, as applicable) for 
which the transport region or nonattainment area was designated such, 
and for which the applicable implementation plan is not being carried 
out in accordance with, or does not meet, the requirements of part D of 
title I of the Act.
    (e) For any transport region or any area designated as nonattainment 
for any national ambient air quality standard, the restrictions in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall apply to any major 
stationary source or major modification that would be major for the 
pollutant (or precursors, where applicable) for which the area is 
designated nonattainment or a transport region, if the stationary source 
or major modification would be constructed anywhere in the designated 
nonattainment area or transport region.
    (f) The provisions in Sec. 51.165 of this chapter shall apply in 
interpreting the terms under this section.
    (g) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a 
major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a 
relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after 
August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise

Sec. 52.27  Protection of visibility from sources in attainment areas.

    (a) Plan disapproval. The provisions of this section are applicable 
to any State implementation plan which has been disapproved with respect 
to protection of visibility, in mandatory Class I Federal areas, from 
sources emitting pollutants in any portion of any State where the 
existing air quality is better than the national ambient air quality 
standards for such pollutants, and where a State PSD program has been 
approved as part of the applicable SIP pursuant to 40 CFR 51.24. 
Specific disapprovals are listed where applicable in Subparts B through 
DDD of this part. The provisions of this section have been incorporated 
by reference into the applicable implementation plans for various 
States, as provided in Subparts B through DDD of this part.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, all terms shall have 
the meaning ascribed to them in the Clean Air Act, in the prevention of 
significant deterioration (PSD) program approved as part of the 
applicable SIP pursuant to 40 CFR 51.24 for the State, or in the 
protection of visibility program (40 CFR 51.301), all as in effect on 
July 12, 1985.
    (c) Federal visibility analysis. Any person shall have the right, in 
connection with any application for a permit to construct a major 
stationary source or major modification, to request that the 
administrator take responsibility from the State for conducting the 
required review of a proposed source's impact on visibility in any 
Federal Class I area. If requested, the Administrator shall take such 
responsibility and conduct such review pursuant to paragraphs (e), (f) 
and (g) of this section in any case where the State fails to provide all 
of the procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this section. A 
request pursuant to this paragraph must be made within 60 days of the 
notice soliciting public comment on a permit, unless such notice is not 
properly given. The Administrator will not entertain requests 
challenging the substance of any State action concerning visibility 
where the State has provided all of the procedural steps listed in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Procedural steps in visibility review. (1) The reviewing 
authority must provide written notification to all affected Federal land 
managers of any permit application for any proposed new major stationary 
source or major modification that may affect visibility in any Federal 
Class I area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information 
relevant to the permit application and shall be given within 30 days of 
receipt and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on the 
application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall include 
the proposed source's anticipated impacts on visibility in any Federal 
Class I area as provided by the applicant. Notification must also be 
given to all affected Federal land managers within 30 days of receipt of 
any advance notification of any such permit application.
    (2) The reviewing authority must consider any analysis performed by 
the Federal land managers, provided within 30 days of the notification 
required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, that

[[Page 57]]

shows that such proposed new major stationary source or major 
modification may have:
    (i) An adverse impact on visibility in any Federal Class I area, or
    (ii) An adverse impact on visibility in an integral vista codified 
in part 81 of this title.
    (3) Where the reviewing authority finds that such an analysis does 
not demonstrate that the effect in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this 
section will occur, either an explanation of its decision or 
notification as to where the explanation can be obtained must be 
included in the notice of public hearing.
    (4) Where the reviewing authority finds that such an analysis does 
demonstrate that the effect in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section will 
occur, the permit shall not be issued.
    (5) Where the reviewing authority finds that such an analysis does 
demonstrate that the effect in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section will 
occur, the reviewing authority may issue a permit if the emissions from 
the source or modification will be consistent with reasonable progress 
toward the national goal. In making this decision, the reviewing 
authority may take into account the costs of compliance, the time 
necessary for compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental 
impacts of compliance, and the useful life of the source.
    (e) Federal land manager notification. The Administrator shall 
provide all of the procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this 
section in conducting reviews pursuant to this section.
    (f) Monitoring. The Administrator may require monitoring of 
visibility in any Federal Class I area near the proposed new stationary 
source or major modification for such purposes and by such means as the 
Administrator deems necessary and appropriate.
    (g) Public participation. The Administrator shall follow the 
applicable procedures at 40 CFR part 124 in conducting reviews under 
this section. The Administrator shall follow the procedures at 40 CFR 
52.21(q) as in effect on August 7, 1980, to the extent that the 
procedures of 40 CFR part 124 do not apply.
    (h) Federal permit. In any case where the Administrator has made a 
finding that a State consistently fails or is unable to provide the 
procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
Administrator shall require all prospective permit applicants in such 
State to apply directly to the Administrator, and the Administrator 
shall conduct a visibility review pursuant to this section for all 
permit applications.

1980, is being regulated under section 111 or 112 of the Act; or
    (iii) The source is a portable stationary source which has 
previously received a permit under this section, and
    (A) The owner or operator proposes to relocate the source and 
emissions of the source at the new location would be temporary; and
    (B) The emissions from the source would not exceed its allowable 
emissions; and
    (C) The emissions from the source would impact no Class I area and 
no area where an applicable increment is known to be violated; and
    (D) Reasonable notice is given to the Administrator, prior to the 
relocation, identifying the proposed new location and the probable 
duration of operation at the new location. Such notice shall be given to 
the Administrator not less than 10 days in advance of the proposed 
relocation, unless a different time duration is previously approved by 
the Administrator.
    (5) The requirements of this section shall not apply to a major 
stationary source or major modification with respect to a particular 
pollutant if the owner or operator demonstrates that, as to that 
pollutant, the source or modification is located in an area designated

    (6) The requirements of this section shall not apply to a major 
stationary

[[Page 59]]

source or major modification with respect to a particular pollutant, if 
the allowable emissions of that pollutant from the source, or the net 
emissions increase of that pollutant from the modification:
    (i) Would impact no Class I area and no area where an applicable 
increment is known to be violated, and
    (ii) Would be temporary.
    (d) Visibility Impact Analyses. The owner or operator of a source 
shall provide an analysis of the impairment to visibility that would 
occur as a result of the source or modification and general commercial, 
residential, industrial and other growth associated with the source or 
modification.
    (e) Federal land manager notification. (1) The Federal land manager 
and the Federal official charged with direct responsibility for 
management of Federal Class I areas have an affirmative responsibility 
to protect the air quality related values (including visibility) of such 
lands and to consider, in consultation with the Administrator, whether a 
proposed source or modification will have an adverse impact on such 
values.
    (2) The Administrator shall provide written notification to all 
affected Federal land managers of any permit application for any 
proposed new major stationary source or major modification that may 
affect visibility in any visibility protection area. The Administrator 
shall also provide for such notification to the Federal official charged 
with direct responsibility for management of any lands within any such 
area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information relevant 
to the permit application and shall be given within 30 days of receipt 
and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on the application for 
a permit to construct. Such notification shall include an analysis of 
the proposed source's anticipated impacts on visibility in any 
visibility protection area. The Administrator shall also notify all 
affected FLM's within 30 days of receipt of any advance notification of 
any such permit application.
    (3) The Administrator shall consider any analysis performed by the 
Federal land manager, provided within 30 days of the notification 
required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section, that such proposed new 
major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact 
on visibility in any visibility protection area. Where the Administrator 
finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Administrator that an adverse impact on visibility will result in 
the visibility protection area, the Administrator must, in the notice of 
public hearing, either explain his decision or give notice as to where 
the explanation can be obtained.
    (f) Public participation. The Administrator shall follow the 
applicable procedures of 40 CFR part 124 in processing applications 
under this section. The Administrator shall follow the procedures at 40 
CFR 52.21(q) as in effect on August 7, 1980, to the extent that the 
procedures of 40 CFR part 124 do not apply.
    (g) National visibility goal. The Administrator shall only issue 
permits to those sources whose emissions will be consistent with making 
reasonable progress toward the national goal of preventing any future, 
and remedying any existing, impairment of visibility in visibility 
protection areas which impairment results from man-made air pollution. 
In making the decision to issue a permit, the Administrator may take 
into account the costs of compliance, the time necessary for compliance, 
the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, and 
the useful life of the source.
    (h) Monitoring. The Administrator may require monitoring of 
visibility in any visibility protection area near the proposed new 
stationary source or major modification for such purposes and by such 
means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate.
    (i) Delegation of authority. (1) The Administrator shall have the 
authority to delegate the responsibility for conducting source review 
pursuant to this section to any agency in accordance with paragraphs 
(i)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (2) Where the Administrator delegates the responsibility for 
conducting source review under this section to any agency other than a 
Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the following 
provisions shall apply:

[[Page 60]]

    (i) Where the delegate agency is not an air pollution control agency 
it shall consult with the appropriate State and local air pollution 
control agency prior to making any determination under this section. 
Similarly, where the delegate agency does not have continuing 
responsibility for managing land use, it shall consult with the 
appropriate State and local agency primarily responsible for managing 
land use prior to making any determination under this section.
    (ii) The delegate agency shall submit a copy of any public comment 
notice required under paragraph (f) of this section to the Administrator 
through the appropriate Regional Office.
    (3) The Administrator's authority for reviewing a source or 
modification located on an Indian Reservation shall not be redelegated 
other than to a Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, 
except where the State has assumed jurisdiction over such land under 
other laws. Where the State has assumed such jurisdiction, the 
Administrator may delegate his authority to the States in accordance 
with paragraph (i)(2) of this section.

performed by the local political subdivision, or the responsibility for 
performing the required activity has been delegated to the political 
subdivision.
    (3) The State has provided adequate funding or authority to obtain 
funding (when funding is necessary to carry out the required activity) 
to the political subdivision to perform the required activity.
    (4) The political subdivision has agreed to perform (and has not 
revoked that agreement), or is required by State law to accept 
responsibility for performing, the required activity.
    (5) The political subdivision has failed to perform the required 
activity.
    (d) Imposition of sanctions. (1) If all of the criteria in paragraph 
(c) of this section have been met through the action or inaction of one 
political subdivision, EPA will not impose sanctions on a statewide 
basis.
    (2) If not all of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section have 
been met through the action or inaction of one political subdivision, 
EPA will determine the area for which it is reasonable and appropriate 
to apply sanctions.

volatile organic compounds (VOC).
    (8) Part D means part D of title I of the Act.
    (9) Part D SIP or SIP revision or plan means a State implementation 
plan or plan revision that States are required to submit or revise 
pursuant to part D.
    (10) Precursor means pollutant which is transformed in the 
atmosphere (later in time and space from point of emission) to form (or 
contribute to the formation of) a criteria pollutant.
    (c) Applicability. This section shall apply to any State in which an 
affected area is located and for which the Administrator has made one of 
the following findings, with respect to any part D SIP or SIP revision 
required under the Act:
    (1) A finding that a State has failed, for an area designated 
nonattainment under 42 U.S.C. 7407(d), to submit a plan, or to submit 
one or more of the elements (as determined by the Administrator) 
required by the provisions of the Act applicable to such an area, or has 
failed to make a submission for such an area that satisfies the minimum 
criteria established in relation to any such element under 42 U.S.C. 
7410(k);
    (2) A disapproval of a submission under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k), for an 
area designated nonattainment under 42 U.S.C. 7407(d), based on the 
submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the 
provisions of the Act applicable to such an area;
    (3)(i) A determination that a State has failed to make any 
submission required under the Act, other than one described under 
paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, including an adequate 
maintenance plan, or has failed to make any submission, required under 
the Act, other than one described under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of 
this section, that satisfies the minimum criteria established in 
relation to such submission under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(1)(A); or
    (ii) A disapproval in whole or in part of a submission described 
under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section; or
    (4) A finding that any requirement of an approved plan (or approved 
part of a plan) is not being implemented.
    (d) Sanction application sequencing. (1) To implement 42 U.S.C. 
7509(a), the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
shall apply in an affected area 18 months from the date when the 
Administrator makes a finding under paragraph (c) of this section unless 
the Administrator affirmatively determines that the deficiency forming 
the basis of the finding has been corrected. To further implement 42 
U.S.C. 7509(a), the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall apply in an affected area 6 months from the date the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless 
the Administrator affirmatively determines that the deficiency forming 
the basis of the finding has been corrected. For the findings under 
paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3)(ii), and (c)(4) of this section, the date of 
the finding shall be the effective date as defined in the final action 
triggering the sanctions clock.

[[Page 63]]

    (2)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and the 
Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to 
fully or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an 
interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the 
deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and 
until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove 
the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator issues such a 
proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the 
later of the date the Administrator issues such a proposed or final 
disapproval, or 18 months following the finding that started the 
sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless 
the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of 
the finding has been corrected.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 
18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed 
to fully or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an 
interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the 
deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application 
of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be 
deferred unless and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final 
action to disapprove the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator 
issues such a proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset 
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the 
affected area on the date the Administrator issues such a proposed or 
final disapproval. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from 
the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator determines 
that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, 
or immediately if the proposed or final disapproval occurs more than 6 
months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and more 
than 24 months after the finding the Administrator has proposed to fully 
or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim 
final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency 
prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and application of the highway sanction 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until 
the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the 
plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or 
final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator issues 
such proposed or final disapproval.
    (3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and the 
Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has conditionally-
approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination 
that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, 
application of the offset sanction under paragraph

[[Page 64]]

(e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the 
conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the Administrator 
proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the 
revised SIP the State submits to fulfill the commitment in the 
conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a 
disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final 
disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the approval 
becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or 
final disapproval, whichever is applicable, or 18 months following the 
finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 
months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section applies, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency 
forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 
18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has 
conditionally approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final 
determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting 
the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and 
until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the 
Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole 
or in part the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill the commitment 
in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so 
becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or 
final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the approval 
becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or 
final disapproval, whichever is applicable. The highway sanction under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the 
later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the 
Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the 
finding has been corrected, or immediately if the conditional approval 
becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or 
final disapproval, whichever is applicable, more than 6 months after 
initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a 
revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 
24 months from the finding the Administrator has conditionally approved 
the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the 
revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application 
of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and 
application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall be stayed unless and until the conditional approval 
converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes 
final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State 
submits to fulfill its commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If 
the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator 
issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on 
the date the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the 
Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is 
applicable.
    (4)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section, if the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the 
finding, has proposed to find that the State is implementing

[[Page 65]]

the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the 
deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred 
unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, 
through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing 
the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the 
deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines 
that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area 
on the later of the date the Administrator proposes to take action or 
takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not 
been corrected, or 18 months following the finding that started the 
sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the 
offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applies, 
unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the 
deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section, if after 18 months but before 24 months from the 
finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is 
implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final 
determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been 
corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and 
until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a 
proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the 
approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the 
deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines 
that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected 
area on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes 
final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been 
corrected. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date 
the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied 
in the affected area, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally 
determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been 
corrected, or immediately if EPA's proposed or final action finding the 
deficiency has not been corrected occurs more than 6 months after 
initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further 
implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section, if after 24 months from the finding the Administrator 
has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan 
and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency 
prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset 
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until 
the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a 
proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the 
approved plan, and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the 
deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines 
that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on 
the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action 
to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected.
    (5) Any sanction clock started by a finding under paragraph (c) of 
this section will be permanently stopped and sanctions applied, stayed 
or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the 
deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For a 
sanctions clock and

[[Page 66]]

applied sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(c)(3)(i) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been 
corrected will occur by letter from the Administrator to the State 
governor. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions 
based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this 
section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur 
through a final notice in the Federal Register fully approving the 
revised SIP. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred 
sanctions based on a finding under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a 
finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a 
final notice in the Federal Register finding that the State is 
implementing the approved SIP.
    (6) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, nothing in 
this section will prohibit the Administrator from determining through 
notice-and-comment rulemaking that in specific circumstances the highway 
sanction, rather than the offset sanction, shall apply 18 months after 
the Administrator makes one of the findings under paragraph (c) of this 
section, and that the offset sanction, rather than the highway sanction, 
shall apply 6 months from the date the highway sanction applies.
    (e) Available sanctions and method for implementation--(1) Offset 
sanction. (i) As further set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)-(e)(1)(vi) 
of this section, the State shall apply the emissions offset requirement 
in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those 
affected areas subject under paragraph (d) of this section to the offset 
sanction. The State shall apply the emission offset requirements in 
accordance with 42 U.S.C. 7503 and 7509(b)(2), at a ratio of at least 
two units of emission reductions for each unit of increased emissions of 
the pollutant(s) and its (their) precursors for which the finding(s) 
under paragraph (c) of this section is (are) made. If the deficiency 
prompting the finding under paragraph (c) of this section is not 
specific to one or more particular pollutants and their precursors, the 
2-to-1 ratio shall apply to all pollutants (and their precursors) for 
which an affected area within the State listed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of 
this section is required to meet the offset requirements of 42 U.S.C. 
7503.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a 
finding is made with respect to a requirement for the criteria pollutant 
ozone or when the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not 
apply the emissions offset requirements at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 
for emission reductions to increased emissions for nitrogen oxides 
where, under 42 U.S.C. 7511a(f), the Administrator has approved an 
NO<INF>X</INF> exemption for the affected area from the Act's new source 
review requirements under 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515 for NO<INF>X</INF> or 
where the affected area is not otherwise subject to the Act's new source 
review requirements for emission offsets under 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515 for 
NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a 
finding under paragraph (c) of this section is made with respect to PM-
10, or the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply 
the emissions offset requirements, at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for 
emission reductions to increased emissions to PM-10 precursors if the 
Administrator has determined under 42 U.S.C. 7513a(e) that major 
stationary sources of PM-10 precursors do not contribute significantly 
to PM-10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the affected area.
    (iv) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set 
forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, at the 2-to-1 ratio required under this 
section, the State shall comply with the provisions of a State-adopted 
new source review (NSR) program that EPA has approved under 42 U.S.C. 
7410(k)(3) as meeting the nonattainment area NSR requirements of 42 
U.S.C. 7501-7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or, if no plan has 
been so approved, the State shall comply directly with the nonattainment 
area NSR requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515, as amended by 
the 1990 Amendments, or cease issuing permits to construct and operate 
major new or modified sources as defined in those requirements. For 
purposes of applying the offset requirement under 42 U.S.C. 7503 where 
EPA has not fully approved

[[Page 67]]

a State's NSR program as meeting the requirements of part D, the 
specifications of those provisions shall supersede any State requirement 
that is less stringent or inconsistent.
    (v) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set 
forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, any permit required pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7503 
and issued on or after the date the offset sanction applies under 
paragraph (d) of this section shall be subject to the enhanced 2-to-1 
ratio under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) Highway funding sanction. The highway sanction shall apply, as 
provided in 42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(1), in the timeframe prescribed under 
paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject under 
paragraph (d) of this section to the highway sanction, but shall apply 
only to those portions of affected areas that are designated 
nonattainment under 40 CFR part 81.

    (a) For the purpose of submitting compliance certifications, nothing 
in this part or in a plan promulgated by the Administrator shall 
preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence 
or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in 
compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance 
or compliance test had been performed.
    (b) For all federal implementation plans, paragraph (a) of this 
section is incorporated into the plan.

    (b) Purpose and applicability. Paragraphs (c), (e)(1) and (e)(2), 
(g), and (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section set forth the Administrator's 
findings with respect to the 1-hour national ambient air quality 
standard (NAAQS) for ozone that certain new and existing sources of 
emissions of nitrogen oxides (``NO<INF>X</INF>'') in certain States emit 
or would emit NO<INF>X</INF> in violation of the prohibition in section 
110(a)(2)(D)(i) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) on emissions in amounts that 
contribute significantly to nonattainment in certain States that 
submitted petitions in 1997-1998 addressing such NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions under section 126 of the CAA. Paragraphs (d), (e)(3) and 
(e)(4), (f), and (h)(3) and (h)(4) of this section set forth the 
Administrator's affirmative technical determinations with respect to the 
8-hour NAAQS for ozone that certain new and existing sources of 
emissions of NO<INF>X</INF> in certain States emit or would emit 
NO<INF>X</INF> in violation of the prohibition in section 
110(a)(2)(D)(i) of the CAA on emissions in amounts that contribute 
significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, 
certain States that submitted petitions in 1997-1998 addressing such 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions under section 126 of the CAA. (As used in this 
section, the term new source includes modified sources, as well.) 
Paragraph (i) of this section explains the circumstances under which the 
findings for sources in a specific State would be withdrawn. Paragraph 
(j) of this section sets forth the control requirements that apply to 
the sources of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions affected by the findings. 
Paragraph (k) of this section indefinitely stays the effectiveness of 
the affirmative technical determinations with respect to the 8-hour 
ozone standard.
    (1) The States that submitted such petitions are Connecticut, Maine, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and 
Vermont (each of which, hereinafter in this section, may be referred to 
also as a ``petitioning State'').
    (2) The new and existing sources of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions covered 
by the petitions that emit or would emit NO<INF>X</INF> emissions in 
amounts that make such significant contributions are large electric 
generating units (EGUs) and large non-EGUs.
    (c) Section 126(b) findings relating to impacts on ozone levels in 
Connecticut--(1) Section 126(b) findings with respect to the 1-hour 
ozone standard in Connecticut. The Administrator finds that any existing 
or new major source or group of stationary sources emits or would emit 
NO<INF>X</INF> in violation of the Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(d)(i) 
prohibition with respect to the 1-hour ozone standard in the State of 
Connecticut if it is or will be:
    (i) In a category of large EGUs or large non-EGUs;
    (ii) Located in one of the States (or portions thereof) listed in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and

of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions covered by the petition of the State of 
Connecticut.
    (2) States or portions of States that contain sources for which the 
Administrator is making section 126(b) findings with respect to the 1-
hour ozone standard in

[[Page 69]]

Connecticut. The States, or portions of States, that contain sources of 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions for which the Administrator is making section 
126(b) findings under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are:

Sec. 52.35  What are the requirements of the Federal Implementation

Plans (FIPs) for the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) relating to emissions of nitrogen 
          oxides?

    (a)(1) The Federal CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program 
provisions of part 97 of this chapter constitute the Clean Air 
Interstate Rule Federal Implementation Plan provisions that relate to 
annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>). Each State that is 
described in Sec. 51.123(c)(1) and (2) of this chapter received a 
finding by the Administrator that the State failed to submit a State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) to satisfy the requirements of section 
110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of the Clean Air Act for the PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. 
The provisions of subparts AA through II of part 97 of this chapter, 
regarding the CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Annual Trading Program, apply to the 
sources in each of these States that has not promulgated a SIP approved 
by the Administrator as correcting that deficiency. Following 
promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a State's SIP as 
meeting the requirements of CAIR for PM<INF>2.5</INF> relating to 
NO<INF>X</INF> under Sec. 51.123 of this chapter, these provisions of 
part 97 of this chapter will no longer apply to the sources in that 
State, except to the extent the Administrator's approval of the SIP is 
partial or conditional or unless such approval is under Sec. 51.123(p) 
of this chapter.
    (2) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, if, at the time of such approval of the State's SIP, the 
Administrator has already allocated any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances 
to sources in the State for any years, the provisions of part 97 of this 
chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation of CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for those years shall continue to apply, 
unless the Administrator approves a SIP that provides for the allocation 
of the remaining CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> allowances for those years.
    (b)(1) The Federal CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program 
provisions of part 97 of this chapter constitute the Clean Air 
Interstate Rule Federal Implementation Plan provisions that relate to 
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) during the ozone season, 
as defined in Sec. 97.302 of this chapter. Each State that is described 
in Sec. 51.123(c)(1) and (3) of this chapter received a finding by the 
Administrator that the State failed to submit a State Implementation 
Plan (SIP) to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of 
the Clean Air Act for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS. The provisions of subparts 
AAAA through IIII of part 97 of this chapter, regarding the CAIR 
NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Trading Program, apply to sources in each of 
these States that has not promulgated a SIP revision approved by the 
Administrator as correcting that deficiency. Following promulgation of 
an approval by the Administrator of a State's SIP as meeting the 
requirements of CAIR for ozone relating to NO<INF>X</INF> under Sec. 
51.123 of this chapter, these provisions of part 97 of this chapter will 
no longer apply to sources in that State, except to the extent the 
Administrator's approval of the SIP is partial or conditional or unless 
such approval is under Sec. 51.123(ee) of this chapter.
    (2) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, if, at the time of such approval of the State's SIP, the 
Administrator has already allocated any CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season 
allowances to sources in the State for any years, the provisions of part 
97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the 
allocation of CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season allowances for those 
years shall continue to apply, unless the Administrator approves a SIP 
that provides for the allocation of the remaining CAIR NO<INF>X</INF> 
Ozone Season allowances for those years.
    (c) The provisions of this section do not invalidate or otherwise 
affect the obligations of States, emissions sources, or other 
responsible entities with respect to all portions of plans approved or 
promulgated under this part or the obligations of States under the

[[Page 73]]

requirements of Sec. Sec. 51.123 and 51.125 of this chapter.
    (d)(1) The States with SIPs approved by the Administrator as meeting 
the requirements of CAIR for PM<INF>2.5</INF> relating to NO<INF>X</INF> 
under Sec. 51.123(o) of this chapter are: Ohio.
    (2) The States with SIPs approved by the Administrator as meeting 
the requirements of CAIR for ozone relating to NO<INF>X</INF> under 
Sec. 51.123(aa) of this chapter, are: Ohio.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, such 
paragraphs are not applicable as they relate to sources in the State of 
Minnesota as of December 3, 2009, except as provided in Sec. 
52.1240(b).

promulgated a SIP revision approved by the Administrator as correcting 
that deficiency. Following promulgation of an approval by the 
Administrator of a State's SIP as meeting the requirements of CAIR for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> relating to SO<INF>2</INF> under Sec. 51.124 of this 
chapter, these provisions of part 97 of this chapter will no longer 
apply to sources in that State, except to the extent the Administrator's 
approval of the SIP is partial or conditional or unless such approval is 
under Sec. 51.124(r) of this chapter.
    (b) The provisions of this section do not invalidate or otherwise 
affect the obligations of States, emissions sources, or other 
responsible entities with respect to all portions of plans approved or 
promulgated under this part or the obligations of States under the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 51.124 and 51.125 of this chapter.
    (c) The States with SIPs approved by the Administrator as meeting

Sec. 52.53  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Alabama's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements of Part D, 
Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977. In addition, continued 
satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the 
SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 
1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and 
January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of 
additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the 
previous January.

<R05>
Sec. Sec. 52.54-52.55  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.56  Review of new sources and modifications.

    Part D conditional approval. The plan's provisions for review of new 
sources and modifications in nonattainment areas are approved on 
condition that the State submit any necessary corrections by March 9, 
1984 and, during the interim, implement these regulations in a manner 
consistent with EPA requirements.

[48 FR 9860, Mar. 9, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 52.57  Control strategy: Sulfur oxides.

    (a) The requirements of Subpart G of this chapter are not met since 
the Alabama plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards for sulfur oxides in the vicinity of the Widows Creek 
Power Plant in Jackson County, Alabama. Therefore, Part 5.1, Fuel 
Combustion, of Chapter 5, Control of Sulfur Compound Emissions, of the 
rules and regulations of the State of Alabama, as adopted by the Alabama 
Air Pollution Control Commission on May 29, 1973, and amended on March 
25, 1975, which is part of the revised sulfur oxide control strategy, is 
disapproved as it applies to the Widows Creek Plant. Part 5.1 of the 
Alabama rules and regulations as adopted on January 18, 1972, remains 
the implementation plan regulation applicable to that source.
    (b) [Reserved]

[41 FR 42674, Sept. 28, 1976, as amended at 51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 52.58  Control strategy: Lead.

    The lead plan submitted by the State on March 24, 1982, is 
disapproved because it fails to provide for the attainment of the lead 
standard throughout Alabama. The lead plan submitted by the State on 
October 7, 1985, and November 13, 1986, for Jefferson County is 
conditionally approved on the condition that the State by October 1, 
1987, determine what additional control measures may be necessary, if 
any, to assure attainment and maintenance as expeditiously as 
practicable but no later than the applicable attainment deadline and 
submit those measures to EPA for approval, together with an appropriate 
demonstration of attainment. The provisions in the regulation submitted 
on October 7, 1985, that give the Jefferson County Health Officer 
discretion to vary the requirements of the regulation are approved as 
limits on that discretion, but any variances that may result from those 
provisions are not approved in advance and hence change the applicable 
implementation plan only when approved by EPA on a case-by-case basis.

<R05>
Sec. 52.61  Visibility protection.

    (a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not 
met because the plan does not include approvable procedures for 
protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.
    (b) Long-term strategy. The provisions of Sec. 52.29 are hereby 
incorporated into the applicable plan for the State of Alabama.

Sec. 52.72  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Alaska's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards. The State included in the plan a regulation 
prohibiting idling of unattended motor vehicles. However, the plan 
stated that this regulation was included for informational purposes 
only, and was not to be considered part of the control strategy to 
implement the national standards for carbon monoxide. Accordingly, this 
regulation is not considered a part of the applicable plan.

Sec. 52.125  Control strategy and regulations: Sulfur oxides.

    (a)(1) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met 
since the control strategy does not analyze the impact of smelter 
fugitive emissions on ambient air quality (except at Hayden, Arizona) in 
the Central Arizona Intrastate, the Pima Intrastate, and the Southeast 
Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions. Arizona must 
submit these smelter fugitive emissions control strategies to EPA by 
August 1, 1984. In addition, the

[[Page 129]]

requirements of Sec. 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the plan 
does not require permanent control of fugitive smelter emissions 
necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for sulfur 
oxides. The control strategy for Hayden shows that these controls are 
required to attain and maintain the national standards, and the fugitive 
control strategy analyses required above may show that they are required 
for some or all of the other smelter towns in Arizona. Arizona must 
submit all fugitive emissions control regulations necessary to attain 
and maintain the national standards for sulfur oxides to EPA by August 
1, 1984. Therefore, the control strategies and regulations for the six 
smelter areas in the Central Arizona Intrastate, the Pima Intrastate and 
the Southeast Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions 
are incomplete due to Arizona's failure to address the fugitive 
emissions problems at copper smelters.
    (2) Regulation 7-1-4.1 (copper smelters) of the Arizona Rules and 
Regulations for Air Pollution Control, as it pertains to existing copper 
smelters, is disapproved for the Central Arizona Intrastate, Pima 
Intrastate and Southeast Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee 
counties) Regions.
    (b) The requirements of subpart G and Sec. 51.281 of this chapter 
are not met since the plan does not provide the degree of control 
necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for sulfur 
oxides in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region. Therefore, Regulation 
7-1-4.2(C) (fuel burning installations) of the Arizona Rules and 
Regulations for Air Pollution Control, as it pertains to existing 
sources, is disapproved in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region for 
steam power generating installations having a total rated capacity equal 
to or greater than 6,500 million B.t.u. per hour.
    (c) Replacement regulation for Regulation 7-1-4.2(C) (Fossil fuel-
fired steam generators in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region). (1) 
This paragraph is applicable to the fossil fuel-fired steam generating 
equipment designated as Units 1, 2, and 3 at the Navajo Power Plant in 
the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region (Sec. 81.270 of this chapter).
    (2) No owner or operator of the fossil fuel-fired steam generating 
equipment to which this paragraph is applicable shall discharge or cause 
the discharge of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere in excess of the 
amount prescribed by the following equations:

E = 12,245 S or e = 1,540 S

Where:

E = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (lb./hr.) from all affected units.
e = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (gm./sec.) from all affected 
units.
S = Sulfur content, in percent by weight, prior to any pretreatment of 
the fuel being burned.

    (3) For the purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) E shall not exceed 21,270 lb./hr. (2,680 gm./sec.).
    (ii) If the sum of sulfur oxides emissions from Units 1, 2, and 3 
would be less than 3,780 lb./hr. (475 gm./sec.) without the use of 
emission control equipment, the requirements of paragraphs (2), (4)(i) 
and (5) of this paragraph (c), shall not apply for the period of time 
that the emissions remain below this level.
    (iii) The applicability of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section may 
be determined through a sulfur balance utilizing the analyzed sulfur 
content of the fuel being burned and the total rate of fuel consumption 
in all affected units.
    (4)(i) No owner or operator of the fossil fuel-fired steam 
generating equipment subject to this paragraph shall discharge or cause 
the discharge of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere from any affected 
unit in excess of the amount prescribed by the following equations, 
except as provided in paragraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph (c).

E<INF>1</INF> = 0.333 E or e<INF>1</INF> = 0.333 e

Where:

E = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (lb./hr.) from all affected units 
as determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this paragraph.
e = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (gm./sec.) from all affected units 
as determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this paragraph (c).
E<INF>1</INF> = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (lb./hr.) from each 
affected unit.
e<INF>1</INF> = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (gm./sec.) from each 
affected unit.


[[Page 130]]


    (ii) The owner or operator of the fossil fuel-fired steam generating 
equipment to which this paragraph is applicable may submit a request to 
redesignate the allowable emissions specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of 
this section. Such a request shall be submitted no later than December 
2, 1974, and shall demonstrate that sulfur oxides emissions on a total 
plant basis will not exceed those specified in paragraphs (2) and (3)(i) 
of this paragraph (c). Upon receipt and evaluation of such request, the 
Administrator shall consider such and if appropriate, redesignate the 
allowable emissions specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) All sulfur oxides control equipment at the fossil fuel-fired 
steam generating equipment to which this paragraph is applicable shall 
be operated at the maximum practicable efficiency at all times, without 
regard to the allowable sulfur oxides emissions, determined according to 
paragraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph (c), except as provided in 
paragraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph (c).
    (6) Compliance with this paragraph shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 52.134(a).
    (7) The test methods and procedures used to determine compliance 
with this paragraph shall be those prescribed in Sec. 60.46(c)(2) and 
(c)(4) of this chapter. The test methods for determining the sulfur 
content of fuel shall be those specified in Sec. 60.45(c) and (d) of 
this chapter.
    (d)-(e) [Reserved]
    (f)(1) Paragraphs B through E of regulation 7-1-4.2 (R9-3-402) 
(Sulfur Emissions: Fuel Burning Installations) of the Arizona Air 
Pollution Control Regulations are disapproved because they could allow 
existing oil fired facilities to use dispersion dependent techniques 
alone as a means of attaining and maintaining the national ambient air 
quality standards. The regulation does not assure the attainment and 
maintenance of the national standards in a manner which is consistent 
with the intent of sections 110(a)(2)(B) and 123(a)(2) of the Clean Air 
Act.
    (2) The approval of paragraphs A and F of regulation 7-1-4.2 as to 
coal fired facilities does not apply to the Salt River Project 
Agricultural Improvement and Power District-Navajo Generating Station.
    (3) Paragraphs B through E of regulation 8-1-4.2 (Sulfur Emissions--
Fuel Burning Installations) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control 
Regulations are disapproved because they could allow existing facilities 
to use dispersion dependent techniques alone as a means of attaining and 
maintaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This regulation 
does not assure the attainment and maintenance of the national standards 
in a manner which is consistent with the intent of sections 
110(a)(2)(B)and 123(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act.
    (g) Section 3, Regulation 3 (Sulfur from Primary Copper Smelters) of 
the Mohave County Health Department Air Pollution Control Regulations 
and Regulation 7-3-2.1 (Copper Smelters) of the Pinal-Gila Counties Air 
Quality Control District are disapproved since Section 36-1706 of the 
Arizona Revised Statutes grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Arizona 
Department of Health Services and the State Hearing Board over all 
existing copper smelters.
    (1) The requirements of Sec. 51.13 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not demonstrate that the emission limitations 
applicable to existing fuel burning equipment producing electrical 
energy will provide for the attainment and maintenance of the national 
standards in the Pima Intrastate Region (Sec. 81.269 of this chapter).
    (2) Regulation II: Rule 7A--paragraphs 2 through 5, Emission 
Limitations Fuel Burning Equipment--Sulfur Dioxide, of the Rules and 
Regulations of the Pima County Air Pollution Control District are 
disapproved because they could allow existing facilities to use 
dispersion dependent techniques along as a means of attaining and 
maintaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The regulation 
does not assure the attainment and maintenance of the national standards 
in a manner which is consistent with the intent of section 110(a)(2)(B) 
of the Clean Air Act.

Sec. 52.126  Control strategy and regulations: Particulate matter.

    (a) The requirements of subpart G and Sec. 51.281 of this chapter 
are not met since the plan does not provide the degree of control 
necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for particulate 
matter in Gila, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, and Santa Cruz Counties. 
Therefore, Regulation 7-1-3.6 (process industries) of the Arizona Rules 
and Regulations for Air Pollution Control is disapproved for Gila, 
Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, and Santa Cruz Counties.
    (b) Replacement regulation for Regulation 7-1-3.6 of the Arizona 
Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control (Gila, Maricopa, Pima, 
Pinal, and Santa Cruz Counties). (1) No owner or operator of any 
stationary process source in Gila, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, or Santa Cruz 
County shall discharge or cause the discharge of particulate matter into

    (2) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to 
incinerators, fuel burning installations, or Portland cement plants 
having a process weight rate in excess of 250,000 lb/h.
    (3) No owner or operator of a Portland cement plant in Gila, 
Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, or Santa Cruz County with a process weight rate 
in excess of 250,000 lb/hr shall discharge or cause the discharge of 
particulate matter into the atmosphere in excess of the amount specified 
in Sec. 60.62 of this chapter.
    (4) Compliance with this paragraph shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 52.134(a).
    (5) The test methods and procedures used to determine compliance 
with this paragraph are set forth below. The methods referenced are 
contained in the appendix to part 60 of this chapter. Equivalent methods 
and procedures may be used if approved by the Administrator.
    (i) For each sampling repetition, the average concentration of 
particulate matter shall be determined by using method 5. Traversing 
during sampling by method 5 shall be according to method 1. The minimum 
sampling time shall be 2 hours and the minimum sampling volume shall be 
60 ft\3\ (1.70 m\3\), corrected to standard conditions on a dry basis.
    (ii) The volumetric flow rate of the total effluent shall be 
determined by using method 2 and traversing according to method 1. Gas 
analysis shall be performed using the integrated sample technique of 
method 3, and moisture content shall be determined by the condenser 
technique of method 4.
    (iii) All tests shall be conducted while the source is operating at 
the maximum production or combustion rate at which such source will be 
operated. During the tests, the source shall burn fuels or combinations 
of fuels, use raw materials, and maintain process conditions 
representative of normal operation, and shall operate under such other 
relevant conditions as the Administrator shall specify.
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 51.281 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not contain regulations for Mohave and Yuma Counties 
in the Mohave-Yuma Intrastate Region or Pinal-Gila Counties in the 
Central Arizona Intrastate Region which provide enforceable and 
reproducible test procedures for the determination of compliance with 
the emission standards. Therefore paragraph C of section 3, regulation 2 
(Particulates: Other Sources) of the Mohave County Air Pollution Control 
Regulations, paragraph B of regulation 8-1-3.6 (Particulates--Process 
Industries) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control Regulations, and 
paragraph C of regulation 7-3-1.4 (Particulate Emissions--Incineration) 
and paragraph F of regulation 7-3-1.7 (Particulate Emissions--Fuel 
Burning

Appendix A to Sec. 52.128--Test Methods To Determine Whether A Surface 
                              Is Stabilized

                I. Unpaved Roads and Unpaved Parking Lots

                         A. Opacity Observations

    Conduct opacity observations in accordance with Reference Method 9 
(40 CFR Part 60, appendix A) and Methods 203A and 203C of this appendix, 
with opacity readings taken at five second observation intervals and two 
consecutive readings per plume beginning with the first reading at zero 
seconds, in accordance with Method 203C, sections 2.3.2. and 2.4.2 of 
this appendix. Conduct visible opacity tests only on dry unpaved 
surfaces (i.e. when the surface is not damp to the touch) and on days 
when average wind speeds do not exceed 15 miles per hour (mph).

   (i) Method 203A--Visual Determination of Opacity of Emissions From 
            Stationary Sources for Time-Arranged Regulations

    Method 203A is virtually identical to EPA's Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60 
Appendix A) except for the data-reduction procedures, which provide for 
averaging times other than 6 minutes. That is, using Method 203A with a 
6-minute averaging time would be the same as

[[Page 136]]

following EPA Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A). Additionally, 
Method 203A provides procedures for fugitive dust applications. The 
certification procedures provided in section 3 are virtually identical 
to Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A) and are provided here, in full, 
for clarity and convenience.

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of the opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions for time-
averaged regulations. A time-averaged regulation is any regulation that 
requires averaging visible emission data to determine the opacity of 
visible emissions over a specific time period.
    1.2 Principle. The opacity of emissions from sources of visible 
emissions is determined visually by an observer qualified according to 
the procedures of section 3.

                              2. Procedures

    An observer qualified in accordance with section 3 of this method 
shall use the following procedures for visually determining the opacity 
of emissions.
    2.1 Procedures for Emissions from Stationary Sources. These 
procedures are not applicable to this section.
    2.2 Procedures for Fugitive Process Dust Emissions. These procedures 
are applicable for the determination of the opacity of fugitive 
emissions by a qualified observer. The qualified field observer should 
do the following:
    2.2.1 Position. Stand at a position at least 5 meters from the 
fugitive dust source in order to provide a clear view of the emissions 
with the sun oriented in the 140-degree sector to the back. Consistent 
as much as possible with maintaining the above requirements, make 
opacity observations from a position such that the line of vision is 
approximately perpendicular to the plume and wind direction. As much as 
possible, if multiple plumes are involved, do not include more than one 
plume in the line of sight at one time.
    2.2.2 Field Records. Record the name of the plant or site, fugitive 
source location, source type [pile, stack industrial process unit, 
incinerator, open burning operation activity, material handling 
(transfer, loading, sorting, etc.)], method of control used, if any, 
observer's name, certification data and affiliation, and a sketch of the 
observer's position relative to the fugitive source. Also, record the 
time, estimated distance to the fugitive source location, approximate 
wind direction, estimated wind speed, description of the sky condition 
(presence and color of clouds), observer's position relative to the 
fugitive source, and color of the plume and type of background on the 
visible emission observation form when opacity readings are initiated 
and completed.
    2.2.3 Observations. Make opacity observations, to the extent 
possible, using a contrasting background that is perpendicular to the 
line of vision. For roads, storage piles, and parking lots, make opacity 
observations approximately 1 meter above the surface from which the 
plume is generated. For other fugitive sources, make opacity 
observations at the point of greatest opacity in that portion of the 
plume where condensed water vapor is not present. For intermittent 
sources, the initial observation should begin immediately after a plume 
has been created above the surface involved. Do not look continuously at 
the plume but, instead, observe the plume momentarily at 15-second 
intervals.
    2.3 Recording Observations. Record the opacity observations to the 
nearest 5 percent every 15 seconds on an observational record sheet. 
Each momentary observation recorded represents the average opacity of 
emissions for a 15-second period.
    2.4 Data Reduction for Time-Averaged Regulations. A set of 
observations is composed of an appropriate number of consecutive 
observations determined by the averaging time specified. Divide the 
recorded observations into sets of appropriate time lengths for the 
specified averaging time. Sets must consist of consecutive observations; 
however, observations immediately preceding and following interrupted 
observations shall be deemed consecutive. Sets need not be consecutive 
in time and in no case shall two sets overlap, resulting in multiple 
violations. For each set of observations, calculate the appropriate 
average opacity.

                      3. Qualification and Testing

    3.1 Certification Requirements. To receive certification as a 
qualified observer, a candidate must be tested and demonstrate the 
ability to assign opacity readings in 5 percent increments to 25 
different black plumes and 25 different white plumes, with an error not 
to exceed 15 percent opacity on any one reading and an average error not 
to exceed 7.5 percent opacity in each category. Candidates shall be 
tested according to the procedures described in paragraph 3.2. Any smoke 
generator used pursuant to paragraph 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke 
meter which meets the requirements of paragraph 3.3. Certification tests 
that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 are not 
valid.
    The certification shall be valid for a period of 6 months, and after 
each 6-month period, the qualification procedures must be repeated by an 
observer in order to retain certification.
    3.2 Certification Procedure. The certification test consists of 
showing the candidate a complete run of 50 plumes, 25 black plumes

[[Page 137]]

and 25 white plumes, generated by a smoke generator. Plumes shall be 
presented in random order within each set of 25 black and 25 white 
plumes. The candidate assigns an opacity value to each plume and records 
the observation on a suitable form. At the completion of each run of 50 
readings, the score of the candidate is determined. If a candidate fails 
to qualify, the complete run of 50 readings must be repeated in any 
retest. The smoke test may be administered as part of a smoke school or 
training program, and may be preceded by training or familiarization 
runs of the smoke generator during which candidates are shown black and 
white plumes of known opacity.
    3.3 Smoke Generator Specifications. Any smoke generator used for the 
purpose of paragraph 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke meter installed 
to measure opacity across the diameter of the smoke generator stack. The 
smoke meter output shall display in-stack opacity, based upon a path 
length equal to the stack exit diameter on a full 0 to 100 percent chart 
recorder scale. The smoke meter optical design and performance shall 
meet the specifications shown in Table A. The smoke meter shall be 
calibrated as prescribed in paragraph 3.3.1 prior to conducting each 
smoke reading test. At the completion of each test, the zero and span 
drift, shall be checked, and if the drift exceeds <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent opacity, the condition shall be corrected 
prior to conducting any subsequent test runs. The smoke meter shall be 
demonstrated at the time of installation to meet the specifications 
listed in Table A. This demonstration shall be repeated following any 
subsequent repair or replacement of the photocell or associated 
electronic circuitry including the chart recorder or output meter, or 
every 6 months, whichever occurs first.
    3.3.1 Calibration. The smoke meter is calibrated after allowing a 
minimum of 30 minutes warm-up by alternately producing simulated opacity 
of 0 percent and 100 percent. When stable response at 0 percent or 100 
percent is noted, the smoke meter is adjusted to produce an output of 0 
percent or 100 percent, as appropriate. This calibration shall be 
repeated until stable 0 percent and 100 percent readings are produced 
without adjustment. Simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values 
may be produced by alternately switching the power to the light source 
on and off while the smoke generator is not producing smoke.
    3.3.2 Smoke Meter Evaluation. The smoke meter design and performance 
are to be evaluated as follows:
    3.3.2.1 Light Source. Verify from manufacturer's data and from 
voltage measurements made at the lamp, as installed, that the lamp is 
operated within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent of the nominal rated 
voltage.
    3.3.2.2 Spectral Response of Photocell. Verify from manufacturer's 
data that the photocell has a photopic response; i.e., the spectral 
sensitivity of the cell shall closely approximate the standard spectral-
luminosity curve for photopic vision which is referenced in (b) of Table 
A.
    3.3.2.3 Angle of View. Check construction geometry to ensure that 
the total angle of view of the smoke plume, as seen by the photocell, 
does not exceed 15 degrees. Calculate the total angle of view as 
follows:

[phis]<INF>v</INF> = 2 tan<SUP>-1</SUP> d/2L

Where:

[phis]<INF>v</INF> = total angle of view;
d = the photocell diameter + the diameter of the limiting aperture; and
L = distance from the photocell to the limiting aperture.

    The limiting aperture is the point in the path between the photocell 
and the smoke plume where the angle of view is most restricted. In smoke 
generator smoke meters, this is normally an orifice plate.
    3.3.2.4 Angle of Projection. Check construction geometry to ensure 
that the total angle of projection of the lamp on the smoke plume does 
not exceed 15 degrees. Calculate the total angle of projection as 
follows:

[phis]<INF>p</INF> = 2 tan<SUP>-1</SUP> d/2L

Where:

[phis]<INF>p</INF> = total angle of projection;
d = the sum of the length of the lamp filament + the diameter of the 
limiting aperture; and
L = the distance from the lamp to the limiting aperture.

    3.3.2.5 Calibration Error. Using neutral-density filters of known 
opacity, check the error between the actual response and the theoretical 
linear response of the smoke meter. This check is accomplished by first 
calibrating the smoke meter according to 3.3.1 and then inserting a 
series of three neutral-density filters of nominal opacity of 20, 50, 
and 75 percent in the smoke meter path length. Use filters calibrated 
within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent. Care should be taken when 
inserting the filters to prevent stray light from affecting the meter. 
Make a total of five nonconsecutive readings for each filter. The 
maximum opacity error on any one reading shall be <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent.
    3.3.2.6 Zero and Span Drift. Determine the zero and span drift by 
calibrating and operating the smoke generator in a normal manner over a 
1-hour period. The drift is measured by checking the zero and span at 
the end of this period.
    3.3.2.7 Response Time. Determine the response time by producing the 
series of five simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values and 
observing the time required to reach stable response. Opacity values of 
0

[[Page 138]]

percent and 100 percent may be simulated by alternately switching the 
power to the light source off and on while the smoke generator is not 
operating.

  (ii) Method 203C--Visual Determination of Opacity of Emissions From 
       Stationary Sources for Instantaneous Limitation Regulations

    Method 203C is virtually identical to EPA's Method 9 (40 CFR Part 
60, Appendix A), except for the data-reduction procedures which have 
been modified for application to instantaneous limitation regulations. 
Additionally, Method 203C provides procedures for fugitive dust 
applications which were unavailable when Method 9 was promulgated. The 
certification procedures in section 3 are identical to Method 9. These 
certification procedures are provided in Method 203A as well, and, 
therefore, have not been repeated in this method.

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination 
of the opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions for 
instantaneous limitations. An instantaneous limitation regulation is an 
opacity limit which is never to be exceeded.
    1.2 Principle. The opacity of emissions from sources of visible 
emissions is determined visually by a qualified observer.

                              2. Procedures

    The observer qualified in accordance with section 3 of this method 
shall use the following procedures for visually determining the opacity 
of emissions.
    2.1 Procedures for Emissions From Stationary Sources. Same as 2.1, 
Method 203A.
    2.1.1 Position. Same as 2.1.1, Method 203A.
    2.1.2 Field Records. Same as 2.1.2, Method 203A.
    2.1.3 Observations. Make opacity observations at the point of 
greatest opacity in that portion of the plume where condensed water 
vapor is not present.
    Do not look continuously at the plume. Instead, observe the plume 
momentarily at the interval specified in the subject regulation. Unless 
otherwise specified, a 15-second observation interval is assumed.
    2.1.3.1 Attached Steam Plumes. Same as 2.1.3.1, Method 203A.
    2.1.3.2 Detached Steam Plumes. Same as 2.1.3.2, Method 203A.
    2.2 Procedures for Fugitive Process Dust Emissions.
    2.2.1 Position. Same as section 2.2.1, Method 203A.
    2.2.2 Field Records. Same as section 2.2.2, Method 203A.
    2.2.3 Observations.
    2.2.3.1 Observations for a 15-second Observation Interval 
Regulations. Same as section 2.2.3, Method 203A.
    2.2.3.2 Observations for a 5-second Observation Interval 
Regulations. Same as section 2.2.3, Method 203A, except, observe the 
plume momentarily at 5-second intervals.
    2.3 Recording Observations. Record opacity observations to the 
nearest 5 percent at the prescribed interval on an observational record 
sheet. Each momentary observation recorded represents the average of 
emissions for the prescribed period. If a 5-second observation period is 
not specified in the applicable regulation, a 15-second interval is 
assumed. The overall time for which recordings are made shall be of a 
length appropriate to the regulation for which opacity is being 
measured.
    2.3.1 Recording Observations for 15-second Observation Interval 
Regulations. Record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at 15-
second intervals on an observational record sheet. Each momentary 
observation recorded represents the average of emissions for a 15-second 
period.
    2.3.2 Recording Observations for 5-second Observation Interval 
Regulations. Record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at 5-
second intervals on an observational record sheet. Each momentary 
observation

[[Page 139]]

recorded represents the average of emissions for 5-second period.
    2.4 Data Reduction for Instantaneous Limitation Regulations. For an 
instantaneous limitation regulation, a 1-minute averaging time will be 
used. Divide the observations recorded on the record sheet into sets of 
consecutive observations. A set is composed of the consecutive 
observations made in 1 minute. Sets need not be consecutive in time, and 
in no case shall two sets overlap. Reduce opacity observations by 
dividing the sum of all observations recorded in a set by the number of 
observations recorded in each set.
    2.4.1 Data Reduction for 15-second Observation Intervals. Reduce 
opacity observations by averaging four consecutive observations recorded 
at 15-second intervals. Divide the observations recorded on the record 
sheet into sets of four consecutive observations. For each set of four 
observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of the four 
observations and dividing this sum by four.
    2.4.2 Data Reduction for 5-second Observation Intervals. Reduce 
opacity observations by averaging 12 consecutive observations recorded 
at 5-second intervals. Divide the observations recorded on the record 
sheet into sets of 12 consecutive observations. For each set of 12 
observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of the 12 
observations and dividing this sum by 12.

                        3. Qualification and Test

    Same as section 3, Method 203A.

                             B. Silt Content

    Conduct the following test method to determine the silt loading and 
silt content of unpaved road and unpaved parking lot surfaces.
    (i) Collect a sample of loose surface material from an area 30 cm by 
30 cm (1 foot by 1 foot) in size to a depth of approximately 1 cm or 
until a hard subsurface is reached, whichever occurs first. Use a brush 
and dustpan or other similar device. Collect the sample from a 
routinely-traveled portion of the surface which receives a preponderance 
of vehicle traffic, i.e. as commonly evidenced by tire tracks. Conduct 
sweeping slowly so that fine surface material is not released into the 
air. Only collect samples from surfaces that are not wet or damp due to 
precipitation or dew.
    (ii) Obtain a shallow, lightweight container and a scale with 
readings in half ounce increments or less. Place the scale on a level 
surface and zero it with the weight of the empty container. Transfer the 
entire sample collected to the container, minimizing escape of particles 
into the air. Weigh the sample and record its weight.
    (iii) Obtain and stack a set of sieves with the following openings: 
4 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm. Place the sieves in order 
according to size openings beginning with the largest size opening at 
the top. Place a collector pan underneath the bottom (0.25 mm) sieve. 
Pour the entire sample into the top sieve, minimizing escape of 
particles into the air by positioning the sieve/collector pan unit in an 
enclosed or wind barricaded area. Cover the sieve/collector pan unit 
with a lid. Shake the covered sieve/collector pan unit vigorously for a 
period of at least one (1) minute in both the horizontal and vertical 
planes. Remove the lid from the sieve/collector pan unit and disassemble 
each sieve separately beginning with the largest sieve. As each sieve is 
removed, examine it for a complete separation of material in order to 
ensure that all material has been sifted to the finest sieve through 
which it can pass. If not, reassemble and cover the sieve/collector pan 
unit and shake it for period of at least one (1) minute. After 
disassembling the sieve/collector pan unit, transfer the material which 
is captured in the collector pan into the lightweight container 
originally used to collect and weigh the sample. Minimize escape of 
particles into the air when transferring the material into the 
container. Weigh the container with the material from the collector pan 
and record its weight. Multiply the resulting weight by 0.38 if the 
source is an unpaved road or by 0.55 if the source is an unpaved parking 
lot to estimate silt loading. Divide by the total sample weight and 
multiply by 100 to arrive at the percent silt content.

    (iv) As an alternative to conducting the procedure described above 
in section I.B.(ii) and section I.B.(iii) of this appendix, the sample 
(collected according to section I.B.(i) of this appendix) may be taken 
to an independent testing laboratory or engineering facility for silt 
loading (e.g. net weight < 200 mesh) and silt content analysis according 
to the following test method from ``Procedures For Laboratory Analysis 
Of Surface/Bulk Dust Loading Samples'', (Fifth Edition, Volume I, 
Appendix C.2.3 ``Silt Analysis'', 1995), AP-42, Office of Air Quality 
Planning & Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research 
Triangle Park, North Carolina.
    1. Objective--Several open dust emission factors have been found to 
be correlated with the silt content(< 200 mesh) of the material being 
disturbed. The basic procedure for silt content determination is 
mechanical, dry sieving. For sources other than paved roads, the same 
sample which was oven-dried to determine moisture content is then 
mechanically sieved.
    2.1 Procedure--Select the appropriate 20-cm (8-in.) diameter, 5-cm 
(2-in.) deep sieve sizes.
    Recommended U. S. Standard Series sizes are 3/8 in., No. 4, No. 40, 
No. 100, No. 140, No. 200, and a pan. Comparable Tyler Series sizes can 
also be used. The No. 20 and the No. 200 are mandatory. The others can 
be varied if the recommended sieves are not available, or if buildup on 
1 particulate sieve during sieving indicates that an intermediate sieve 
should be inserted.
    2.2 Obtain a mechanical sieving device, such as a vibratory shaker 
or a Roto-Tap <SUP>[delta]</SUP> \1\ without the tapping function.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ CFR part 60, App. A, Meth. 5, 2.1.2, footnote 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.3 Clean the sieves with compressed air and/or a soft brush. Any 
material lodged in the sieve openings or adhering to the sides of the 
sieve should be removed, without handling the screen roughly, if 
possible.
    2.4 Obtain a scale (capacity of at least 1600 grams [g] or 3.5 lb) 
and record make, capacity, smallest division, date of last calibration, 
and accuracy. (See Figure A)
    2.5 Weigh the sieves and pan to determine tare weights. Check the 
zero before every weighing. Record the weights.
    2.6 After nesting the sieves in decreasing order of size, and with 
pan at the bottom, dump dried laboratory sample (preferably immediately 
after moisture analysis) into the top sieve. The sample should weigh 
between [cent] 400 and 1600 g ([cent] 0.9 and 3.5 lb). This amount will 
vary for finely textured materials, and 100 to 300 g may be sufficient 
when 90% of the sample passes a No. 8 (2.36 mm) sieve. Brush any fine 
material adhering to the sides of the container into the top sieve and 
cover the top sieve with a special lid normally purchased with the pan.
    2.7 Place nested sieves into the mechanical sieving device and sieve 
for 10 minutes (min). Remove pan containing minus No. 200 and weigh. 
Repeat the sieving at 10-min intervals until the difference between 2 
successive pan sample weighings (with the pan tare weight subtracted) is 
less than 3.0%. Do not sieve longer than 40 min.
    2.8 Weigh each sieve and its contents and record the weight. Check 
the zero before every weighing.
    2.9 Collect the laboratory sample. Place the sample in a separate 
container if further analysis is expected.
    2.10 Calculate the percent of mass less than the 200 mesh screen (75 
micrometers [[micro]m]). This is the silt content.

    (v) The silt loading and percent silt content for any given unpaved 
road surface or unpaved parking lot surface shall be based on the 
average of at least three (3) samples that are representative of 
routinely-traveled portions of the road or parking lot surface. In order 
to simplify the sieve test procedures in section I.B.(ii) and section 
I.B.(iii) of this appendix, the three samples may be combined as long as 
all material is sifted to the finest sieve through which it can pass, 
each sample weighs within 1 ounce of the other two samples, and the 
combined weight of the samples and unit area from which they were 
collected is calculated and recorded accurately.

                             II. Vacant Lots

    The following test methods shall be used for determining whether a 
vacant lot, or portion thereof, has a stabilized surface.
    Should a disturbed vacant lot contain more than one type of 
disturbance, soil, vegetation or other characteristics which are visibly 
distinguishable, test each representative surface for stability 
separately in random areas according to the test methods in section II. 
of this appendix and include or eliminate it from the total size 
assessment of disturbed surface area(s) depending upon test method 
results. A vacant lot surface shall be considered stabilized if any of 
the test methods in section II. of this appendix indicate that the 
surface is stabilized such that the conditions defined in paragraph 
(b)(16)(ii) of this section are met:

                     1. Visible Crust Determination

    (i) Where a visible crust exists, drop a steel ball with a diameter 
of 15.9 millimeters (0.625 inches) and a mass ranging from 16 to 17 
grams from a distance of 30 centimeters (one foot) directly above (at a 
90 degree angle perpendicular to) the soil surface. If blowsand is 
present, clear the blowsand from the surfaces on which the visible crust 
test method is conducted. Blowsand is defined as thin deposits of loose 
uncombined grains covering less than 50 percent of a vacant lot which 
have not originated from the representative vacant lot surface being 
tested. If material covers a visible crust which is not blowsand, apply 
the test method in section II.2 of this appendix to the loose material 
to determine whether the surface is stabilized.
    (ii) A sufficient crust is defined under the following conditions: 
once a ball has been dropped according to section II.1.(i) of this 
appendix, the ball does not sink into the surface so that it is 
partially or fully surrounded by loose grains and, upon removing the 
ball, the surface upon which it fell has not been pulverized so that 
loose grains are visible.
    (iii) Conduct three tests, dropping the ball once per test, within a 
survey area the size of one foot by one foot. The survey area shall be 
considered sufficiently crusted if at least two out of three tests meet 
the definition in section II.1.(ii) of this appendix. Select at least 
two other survey areas that represent the disturbed surface area and 
repeat this procedure. Whether a sufficient crust covers the disturbed 
surface area shall be based on a determination that all of the survey 
areas tested are sufficiently crusted.
    (iv) At any given site, the existence of a sufficient crust covering 
one portion of a disturbed surface may not represent the existence or 
protectiveness of a crust on another disturbed surface(s). Repeat the 
visible crust test as often as necessary on each representative 
disturbed surface area for an accurate assessment of all disturbed 
surfaces at a given site.

          2. Determination of Threshold Friction Velocity (TFV)

    For disturbed surface areas that are not crusted or vegetated, 
determine threshold friction velocity (TFV) according to the following 
sieving field procedure (based on a 1952 laboratory procedure published 
by W. S. Chepil).
    (i) Obtain and stack a set of sieves with the following openings: 4 
millimeters (mm), 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm. Place the sieves in 
order according to size openings beginning with the largest size opening 
at the top. Place a collector pan underneath the bottom (0.25 mm) sieve. 
Collect a sample of loose surface material from an area at least 30 cm 
by 30 cm in size to a depth of approximately 1 cm using a brush and 
dustpan or other similar device. Only collect soil samples from dry 
surfaces (i.e. when the surface is not damp to the touch). Remove any 
rocks larger than 1 cm in diameter from the sample. Pour the sample into 
the top sieve (4 mm opening) and cover the sieve/collector pan unit with 
a lid. Minimize escape of particles into the air when transferring 
surface soil into the sieve/collector pan unit. Move the covered sieve/
collector pan unit by hand using a broad, circular arm motion in the 
horizontal plane. Complete twenty circular

[[Page 142]]

arm movements, ten clockwise and ten counterclockwise, at a speed just 
necessary to achieve some relative horizontal motion between the sieves 
and the particles. Remove the lid from the sieve/collector pan unit and 
disassemble each sieve separately beginning with the largest sieve. As 
each sieve is removed, examine it for loose particles. If loose 
particles have not been sifted to the finest sieve through which they 
can pass, reassemble and cover the sieve/collector pan unit and gently 
rotate it an additional ten times. After disassembling the sieve/
collector pan unit, slightly tilt and gently tap each sieve and the 
collector pan so that material aligns along one side. In doing so, 
minimize escape of particles into the air. Line up the sieves and 
collector pan in a row and visibly inspect the relative quantities of 
catch in order to determine which sieve (or whether the collector pan) 
contains the greatest volume of material. If a visual determination of 
relative volumes of catch among sieves is difficult, use a graduated 
cylinder to measure the volume. Estimate TFV for the sieve catch with 
the greatest volume using Table 1, which provides a correlation between 
sieve opening size and TFV.

    Collect at least three (3) soil samples which are representative of 
the disturbed surface area, repeat the above TFV test method for each 
sample and average the resulting TFVs together to determine the TFV 
uncorrected for non-erodible elements.
    (ii) Non-erodible elements are distinct elements on the disturbed 
surface area that are larger than one (1) cm in diameter, remain firmly 
in place during a wind episode and inhibit soil loss by consuming part 
of the shear stress of the wind. Non-erodible elements include stones 
and bulk surface material but do not include flat or standing 
vegetation. For surfaces with non-erodible elements, determine 
corrections to the TFV by identifying the fraction of the survey area, 
as viewed from directly overhead, that is occupied by non-erodible 
elements using the following procedure. Select a survey area of one (1) 
meter by 1 meter. Where many non-erodible elements lie on the disturbed 
surface area, separate them into groups according to size. For each 
group, calculate the overhead area for the non-erodible elements 
according to the following equations:

(Average length) x (Average width) = Average Dimensions Eq. 1
(Average Dimensions) x (Number of Elements) = Overhead Area Eq. 2
Overhead Area of Group 1 + Overhead Area of Group 2 (etc.) = Total 
Overhead Area Eq. 3
Total Overhead Area/2 = Total Frontal Area Eq. 4
(Total Frontal Area/Survey Area) x 100 = Percent Cover of Non-erodible 
Elements Eq. 5
(Ensure consistent units of measurement, e.g. square meters or square 
inches when calculating percent cover.)

    Repeat this procedure on an additional two (2) distinct survey areas 
representing a disturbed surface and average the results. Use Table 2 to 
identify the correction factor for the percent cover of non-erodible 
elements. Multiply the TFV by the corresponding correction factor to 
calculate the TFV corrected for non-erodible elements.

                3. Determination of Flat Vegetation Cover

    Flat vegetation includes attached (rooted) vegetation or unattached 
vegetative debris lying on the surface with a predominant horizontal 
orientation that is not subject to movement by wind. Flat vegetation 
which is dead but firmly attached shall be considered equally protective 
as live vegetation. Stones or other aggregate larger than one centimeter 
in diameter shall be considered protective cover in the course of 
conducting the line transect method. Where flat vegetation exists, 
conduct the following line transect method.
    (i) Stretch a one-hundred (100) foot measuring tape across a 
disturbed surface area. Firmly anchor both ends of the measuring tape 
into the surface using a tool such as a screwdriver with the tape 
stretched taut and close to the soil surface. If vegetation exists in 
regular rows, place the tape diagonally (at approximately a 45 degree 
angle) away from a parallel or perpendicular position to the vegetated 
rows. Pinpoint an area the size of a \3/32\ inch diameter brazing rod or 
wooden dowel centered above each one-foot interval mark along one edge 
of the tape. Count the number of times that flat vegetation lies 
directly underneath the pinpointed area at one-foot intervals. 
Consistently observe the underlying surface from a 90 degree angle 
directly above each pinpoint on one side of the

[[Page 143]]

tape. Do not count the underlying surface as vegetated if any portion of 
the pinpoint extends beyond the edge of the vegetation underneath in any 
direction. If clumps of vegetation or vegetative debris lie underneath 
the pinpointed area, count the surface as vegetated unless bare soil is 
visible directly below the pinpointed area. When 100 observations have 
been made, add together the number of times a surface was counted as 
vegetated. This total represents the percent of flat vegetation cover 
(e.g. if 35 positive counts were made, then vegetation cover is 35 
percent). If the disturbed surface area is too small for 100 
observations, make as many observations as possible. Then multiply the 
count of vegetated surface areas by the appropriate conversion factor to 
obtain percent cover. For example, if vegetation was counted 20 times 
within a total of 50 observations, divide 20 by 50 and multiply by 100 
to obtain a flat vegetation cover of 40 percent.
    (ii) Conduct the above line transect test method an additional two 
(2) times on areas representative of the disturbed surface and average 
results.

              4. Determination of Standing Vegetation Cover

    Standing vegetation includes vegetation that is attached (rooted) 
with a predominant vertical orientation. Standing vegetation which is 
dead but firmly rooted shall be considered equally protective as live 
vegetation. Conduct the following standing vegetation test method to 
determine if 30 percent cover or more exists. If the resulting percent 
cover is less than 30 percent but equal to or greater than 10 percent, 
then conduct the Threshold Friction Velocity test in section II.2 of 
this appendix in order to determine whether the disturbed surface area 
is stabilized according to paragraph (b)(16)(ii)(E) of this section.
    (i) For standing vegetation that consists of large, separate 
vegetative structures (for example, shrubs and sagebrush), select a 
survey area representing the disturbed surface that is the shape of a 
square with sides equal to at least ten (10) times the average height of 
the vegetative structures. For smaller standing vegetation, select a 
survey area of three (3) feet by 3 feet.
    (ii) Count the number of standing vegetative structures within the 
survey area. Count vegetation which grows in clumps as a single unit. 
Where different types of vegetation exists and/or vegetation of 
different height and width exists, separate the vegetative structures 
with similar dimensions into groups. Count the number of vegetative 
structures in each group within the survey area. Select an individual 
structure within each group that represents the average height and width 
of the vegetation in the group. If the structure is dense (i.e. when 
looking at it vertically from base to top there is little or zero open 
air space within its perimeter), calculate and record its frontal 
silhouette area according to Equation 6 of this appendix. Also use 
Equation 6 if the survey area is larger than nine square feet, 
estimating the average height and width of the vegetation. Otherwise, 
use the procedure in section II.4.(iii) of this appendix to calculate 
the Frontal Silhouette Area. Then calculate the percent cover of 
standing vegetation according to Equations 7, 8 and 9 of this appendix. 
(Ensure consistent units of measurement, e.g. square feet or square 
inches when calculating percent cover.)
    (iii) Vegetative Density Factor. Cut a single, representative piece 
of vegetation (or consolidated vegetative structure) to within 1 cm of 
surface soil. Using a white paper grid or transparent grid over white 
paper, lay the vegetation flat on top of the grid (but do not apply 
pressure to flatten the structure). Grid boxes of one inch or one half 
inch squares are sufficient for most vegetation when conducting this 
procedure. Using a marker or pencil, outline the shape of the vegetation 
along its outer perimeter according to Figure B, C or D of this 
appendix, as appropriate. (Note: Figure C differs from Figure D 
primarily in that the width of vegetation in Figure C is narrow at its 
base and gradually broadens to its tallest height. In Figure D, the 
width of the vegetation generally becomes narrower from its midpoint to 
its tallest height.) Remove the vegetation and count and record the 
total number of gridline intersections within the outlined area, but do 
not count gridline intersections that connect with the outlined shape. 
There must be at least 10 gridline intersections within the outlined 
area and preferably more than 20, otherwise, use smaller grid boxes. 
Draw small circles (no greater than a \3/32\ inch diameter) at each 
gridline intersection counted within the outlined area. Replace the 
vegetation on the grid within its outlined shape. From a distance of 
approximately two feet directly above the grid, observe each circled 
gridline intersection. Count and record the number of circled gridline 
intersections that are not covered by any piece of the vegetation. To 
calculate percent vegetative density, use Equations 10 and 11 of this 
appendix. If percent vegetative density is equal to or greater than 30, 
use the equation (Eq. 14, 15 or 16) that matches the outline used to 
trace the vegetation (Figure B, C or D) to calculate its Frontal 
Silhouette Area. If percent vegetative density is less than 30, use 
Equations 12 and 13 of this appendix to calculate the Frontal Silhouette 
Area.
    (iv) Within a disturbed surface area that contains multiple types of 
vegetation with each vegetation type uniformly distributed, results of 
the percent cover associated with the individual vegetation types may be 
added together.
    (v) Repeat this procedure on an additional two (2) distinct survey 
areas representing

[[Page 144]]

the disturbed surface and average the results.

Height x Width = Frontal Silhouette Area Eq. 6
(Frontal Silhouette Area of Individual Vegetative Structure) x Number of 
Vegetation Structures Per Group = Group Frontal Silhouette Area of Group 
Eq. 7
Frontal Silhouette Area of Group 1 + Frontal Silhouette Area of Group 2 
(etc.) = Total Frontal Silhouette Area Eq. 8
(Total Frontal Silhouette Area/Survey Area) x 100 = Percent Cover of 
Standing Vegetation Eq. 9
[(Number of circled gridlines within the outlined area counted that are 
not covered by vegetation / Total number of gridline intersections 
within the outlined area) x 100] = Percent Open Space Eq. 10
100 = Percent Open Space = Percent Vegetative Density Eq. 11
Percent Vegetative Density/100 = Vegetative Density Eq. 12

Sec. 52.130  Source surveillance.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.211 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not contain legally enforceable procedures for 
requiring sources in the Northern Arizona, Mohave-Yuma, Central Arizona, 
and Southeast Arizona Intrastate Regions to maintain records of and 
periodically report on the nature and amounts of emissions.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.213 of this chapter are not met 
because the plan does not provide procedures for obtaining and 
maintaining data on actual emission reductions achieved as a result of 
implementing transportation control measures.
    (c) Regulation for source recordkeeping and reporting. (1) The owner 
or operator of any stationary source in the Northern Arizona, Mohave-
Yuma, Central Arizona, or Southeast Arizona Intrastate Region 
(Sec. Sec. 81.270, 81.268, 81.271, and 81.272 of this chapter) shall, 
upon notification from the Administrator, maintain records of the nature 
and amounts of emissions from such source or any other information as 
may be deemed necessary by the Administrator to determine whether such 
source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other 
control measures.
    (2) The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the 
Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of 
the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and 
July 1 to December 31, except that the initial reporting period shall 
commence on the date the Administrator issues notification of the 
recordkeeping requirements.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of the 
summarizing reports submitted to the Administrator shall be retained by 
the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent 
report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures. All such emission data will be available during 
normal business hours at the regional office (region IX). The 
Administrator will designate one or more places in Arizona where such 
emission data and correlations will be available for public inspection.
    (d) The requirements of Sec. 51.214 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not contain legally enforceable procedures for 
requiring certain stationary sources subject to emission standards to 
install, calibrate, operate, and maintain equipment for continuously 
monitoring and recording emissions, and to provide other information as 
specified in Appendix P of part 51 of this chapter.
    (e) The requirements of Sec. 51.214 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide sufficient regulations to meet the 
minimum specifications of Appendix P in the Maricopa Intrastate Region. 
Additionally, Maricopa County Air Pollution Control Regulation IV, rule 
41, paragraph B, sections 6.0-6.4 (Special Consideration) is disapproved 
since it does not contain the specific criteria for determining those 
physical limitations or extreme economic situations where alternative 
monitoring requirements would be applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 52.133  Rules and regulations.

    (a) Regulation 7-1-1.4(A) (Exceptions) of the Arizona Rules and 
Regulations for Air Pollution Control, regulations 12-3-2 (Emission 
Standards) of the Coconino County Rules and Regulations for Air 
Pollution Control, section 3, regulation 5 (Exceptions) of the Mohave 
County Air Pollution Control Regulations, regulation 8-1-1.6 
(Exceptions) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control Regulations, and 
regulation 7-1-2.8 (Exceptions) of the Rules and Regulations for Pinal-
Gila Counties Air Quality Control District all provide for an exemption 
from enforcement action if the violation is attributable to certain 
events. These events are too broad in scope and the source can obtain 
the exemption merely by reporting the occurrence. Therefore, the above 
regulations are disapproved

[[Page 151]]

since these regulations make all approved emission limiting regulations 
potentially unenforceable.
    (b) Paragraph E of regulation 7-1-1.3 (R9-3-103) (Air Pollution 
Prohibited) prohibits any person from causing ground level 
concentrations to exceed ambient standards outside the boundaries of 
this operation. This regulation could allow violations of ambient air 
quality standards to occur in areas to which the public has access, 
contrary to the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. 
Therefore, paragraph E of regulation 7-1-1.3 (R9-3-103) of the Arizona 
Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control is disapproved.
    (c) The requirements of subpart G and Sec. 51.281 of this chapter 
are not met since the plan does not provide any enforceable regulations 
and a demonstration that such regulations will cause the attainment and 
maintenance of national ambient air quality standards in Graham and 
Greenlee Counties.
    (d) Section 3, regulation 4 (Ground Level Concentrations) of the 
Mohave County Air Pollution Control Regulations, paragraph E of 
regulation 8-1-1.3 (Air Pollution Prohibited) of the Yuma County Air 
Pollution Control Regulations, and paragraph C of regulation 7-1-1.3 
(Air Pollution Prohibited) of the Rules and Regulations for Pinal-Gila 
Counties Air Quality Control District prohibits any person from causing 
ground level concentrations to exceed ambient standards outside the 
boundaries of his operation. These regulations could allow violations of 
ambient air quality standards to occur in areas to which the general 
public has access, contrary to the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of 
the Clean Air Act. Therefore, these regulations are disapproved.
    (e) Rule R18-2-702 of the Arizona Department of Environmental 
Quality Rules and Regulations sets an opacity standard for emissions 
from stationary sources of PM-10. The standard does not fulfill the 
RACM/RACT requirements of section 189(a) of the CAA. The rule also does 
not comply with enforceability requirements of section 110(a) and SIP 
relaxation requirements of sections 110(l) and 193. Therefore, Rule R18-
2-702 submitted on July 15, 1998 is disapproved.
    (f) Rules 1-3-130 and 3-1-020 submitted on November 27, 1995 of the 
Pinal County Air Quality Control District regulations have limited 
enforceability because they reference rules not contained in the Arizona 
State Implementation Plan. Therefore, these rules are removed from the 
Arizona State Implementation Plan.
    (g) Rules 1-2-110, 1-3-130, 3-1-020, and 4-1-010 submitted on 
October 7, 1998 of the Pinal County Air Quality Control District 
regulations have limited enforceability because they reference rules not 
contained in the Arizona State Implementation Plan. Therefore, these 
rules are disapproved.

described in 40 CFR 81.303 or the Maricopa County carbon monoxide 
nonattainment area as described in 40 CFR 81.303 (i.e., the MAG urban 
planning area).
    (7) Transportation control measure (TCM) means any measure in an 
applicable implementation plan which is intended to reduce emissions 
from transportation sources.
    (8) Transportation improvement program (TIP) means the staged 
multiyear program of transportation improvements including an annual (or 
biennial) element which is required in 23 CFR part 450.
    (9) Unified planning work program or UPWP means the program required 
by 23 CFR 450.108(c) and endorsed by the metropolitan planning 
organization which describes urban transportation and transportation-
related planning activities anticipated in the area during the next 1- 
to 2-year period including the planning work to be performed with 
federal planning assistance and with funds available under the Urban 
Mass Transportation Act (49 U.S.C.) section 9 or 9A. UPWPs are also 
known as overallwork programs or OWPs.
    (c) Applicability. These procedures shall apply only to the Maricopa 
Association of Governments in its role as the designated metropolitan 
planning organization for Maricopa County, Arizona, and the Pima 
Association of Governments in its role as the designated metropolitan 
planning organization for Pima County, Arizona.
    (d) Procedures--(1) Transportation Plans and Transportation 
Improvement Programs--(i) Documentation. The MPO shall prepare for each 
transportation plan and program (except for the unified planning work 
program), as part of the plan or program, a report documenting for each 
plan and program the following information:
    (A) the disaggregated population projections and employment which 
were assumed in:
    (1) the applicable plan, and
    (2) the transportation plan/program;
    (B) the levels of vehicle trips, vehicle miles traveled, and 
congestion that were:
    (1) assumed in the applicable plan, and
    (2) expected to result from the implementation of the plan/program 
over the period covered by the applicable plan considering any growth 
likely to result from the implementation of the plan/program;
    (C) for each major transportation control measure in the applicable 
implementation plan;
    (1) the TCM's implementation schedule and, if determined in the 
applicable plan, expected effectiveness in reducing CO emissions,
    (2) the TCM's current implementation status and, if feasible, its 
current effectiveness in reducing CO emissions, and
    (3) actions in the plan/program which may beneficially or adversely 
affect the implementation and/or effectiveness of the TCM;
    (D) the CO emission levels resulting from the implementation of the 
plan/program over the period covered by the applicable plan considering 
any growth likely to result from the implementation of the plan/program; 
and
    (E) the ambient CO concentration levels, micro-scale and regional, 
resulting from the implementation of the plan/program over the period 
covered by the applicable plan considering any growth likely to result 
from the implementation of the plan or program.
    (ii) Findings. Prior to approving a transportation plan/program, the 
MPO shall determine if the plan/program conforms to the applicable 
implementation plan. In making this determination, the MPO shall make 
and support each of the following findings for each transportation plan 
and program using

[[Page 154]]

the information documented in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section:
    (A) that implementation of the transportation plan/program will 
provide for the implementation of TCMs in the applicable plan on the 
schedule set forth in the applicable plan;
    (B) that CO emission levels, microscale and regional, resulting from 
the implementation of the plan/program will not delay attainment or 
achievement of any interim emission reductions needed for attainment 
and/or interfere with maintenance of the CONAAQS throughout the 
nonattainment area during the period covered by the applicable plan; and
    (C) that implementation of the plan/program would not cause or 
contribute to a violation of the CO NAAQS anywhere within the 
nonattainment area during the period covered by the applicable plan.
    (2) Amendments to a Transportation Plan or Transportation 
Implementation Program. Prior to approving any amendment to a 
transportation plan or program, the MPO shall first determine that the 
amendment does not substantially change the information provided under 
paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and does not change the findings in 
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to the original plan 
or program.
    (3) Transportation Projects. As part of any individual 
transportation project approval made by the MPO, the MPO shall determine 
whether the project conforms to the applicable implementation plan using 
the following procedure:
    (i) For projects from a plan and TIP that has been found to conform 
under procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section within the last 
three years or from a Plan or TIP amendment that has been found to 
conform under procedures in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in the past 
three years, the MPO shall document as part of the approval document:
    (A) the TIP project number;
    (B) whether the project is an exempt project as defined in paragraph 
(e) of this section; and
    (C) whether the design and scope of the project has changed 
significantly from the design and scope of the project as described in 
the conforming TIP:
    (1) If the design and scope of the project has not changed 
significantly, the MPO may find the project conforming; or
    (2) If the design and scope of the project has changed significantly 
or the design and scope of the project could not be determined from the 
TIP, the MPO shall use the procedures in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section to determine if the project conforms to the applicable 
implementation plan.
    (ii) For projects not exempted under paragraph (e) of this section 
and not in a plan or a TIP that has been found to conform under 
procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section within the last three 
years:
    (A) Documentation. The MPO shall document as part of the approval 
document for each such project:
    (1) the disaggregated population and employment projections, to the 
extent they are used in
    (i) the applicable plan, and
    (ii) designing and scoping the project;
    (2) the levels of vehicle trips, vehicle miles traveled, and 
congestion that are
    (i) assumed in the applicable plan, and
    (ii) expected to result over the period covered by the applicable 
plan from the construction of the project considering any growth likely 
to result from the project;
    (3) for each transportation control measure in the applicable plan 
likely to be affected by the project:
    (i) its implementation schedule and expected emission reduction 
effectiveness from the applicable plan,
    (ii) its current implementation status and, if feasible, its current 
effectiveness, and
    (iii) any actions as part of the project which may beneficially or 
adversely affect the implementation and/or effectiveness of the TCM;
    (4) CO emission levels which will result from the project over the 
period covered by the applicable plan considering any growth likely to 
result from the project; and
    (5) ambient CO concentration levels which will result from the 
project over the period covered by the applicable

[[Page 155]]

plan considering any growth likely to result from the project.
    (B) Findings. Prior to approving any transportation project, the MPO 
shall determine if the project conforms to the applicable implementation 
plan. In making this determination, the MPO shall make and support the 
following findings for each project using the information documented in 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:
    (1) that the project will provide for the implementation of TCMs 
affected by the project on the schedule set forth in the applicable 
plan;
    (2) that CO emission levels, microscale and regional, resulting from 
the implementation of the project during the period covered by the 
applicable plan will not delay attainment or any required interim 
emission reductions and/or interfere with maintenance of the CO NAAQS in 
an area substantially affected by the project;
    (3) that the project will not cause or contribute to a violation of 
the CO NAAQS during the period covered by the applicable plan near the 
project; and
    (4) that the projected emissions from the project, when considered 
together with emissions projected for the conforming plan and program 
within the nonattainment area, do not cause the plan and program to 
exceed the emission reduction projections and schedules assigned to such 
plans and programs in the applicable implementation plan.
    (e) Exempt Projects. An individual project is exempt from the 
requirements of paragraph (d) of this section if it is:
    (1) located completely outside the nonattainment area;
    (2) a safety project which is included in the statewide safety 
improvement program, will not alter the functional traffic capacity or 
capability of the facility being improved, and does not adversely affect 
the TCMs in the applicable plan;
    (3) a transportation control measure from the approved applicable 
plan; or
    (4) a mass transit project funded under the Urban Mass 
Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C.

    (d) This paragraph is applicable to the fossil fuel-fired, steam-
generating equipment designated as Units 1, 2, and 3 at the Navajo 
Generating Station in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Air Quality 
Control Region (Sec. 81.270 of this chapter).
    (1) Definitions.
    Administrator means the Administrator of EPA or his/her designee.
    Affected Unit(s) means the steam-generating unit(s) at the Navajo 
Generating Station, all of which are subject to the emission limitation 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, that has accumulated at least 365 
boiler operating days since the passage of the date defined in paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section applicable to it.
    Boiler Operating Day for each of the boiler units at the Navajo 
Generating Station is defined as a 24-hour calendar day (the period of 
time between 12:01 a.m. and 12:00 midnight in Page, Arizona) during 
which coal is combusted in that unit for the entire 24 hours.
    Owner or Operator means the owner, participant in, or operator of 
the Navajo Generating Station to which this paragraph is applicable.
    Unit-Week of Maintenance means a period of 7 days during which a 
fossil fuel-fired steam-generating unit is under repair, and no coal is 
combusted in the unit.

[[Page 157]]

    (2) Emission limitation. No owner or operator shall discharge or 
cause the discharge of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere in excess of 42 
ng/J [0.10 pound per million British thermal units (lb/MMBtu)] heat 
input.
    (3) Compliance determination. Until at least one unit qualifies as 
an affected unit, no compliance determination is appropriate. As each 
unit qualifies for treatment as an affected unit, it shall be included 
in the compliance determination. Compliance with this emission limit 
shall be determined daily on a plant-wide rolling annual basis as 
follows:
    (i) For each boiler operating day at each steam generating unit 
subject to the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, 
the owner or operator shall record the unit's hourly SO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions using the data from the continuous emission monitoring 
systems, [required in paragraph (d)(4) of this section] and the daily 
electric energy generated by the unit (in megawatt-hours) as measured by 
the megawatt-hour meter for the unit.
    (ii) Compute the average daily SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate in ng/J 
(lb/MMBtu) following the procedures set out in method 19, appendix A, 40 
CFR part 60 in effect on October 3, 1991.
    (iii) For each boiler operating day for each affected unit, 
calculate the product of the daily SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate 
(computed according to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) and the 
daily electric energy generated (recorded according to paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section) for each unit.
    (iv) For each affected unit, identify the previous 365 boiler 
operating days to be used in the compliance determination. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (d)(9) and (d)(10) of this section, all of the 
immediately preceding 365 boiler operating days will be used for 
compliance determinations.
    (v) Sum, for all affected units, the products of the daily 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate-electric energy generated (as calculated 
according to paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) for the boiler 
operating days identified in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section.
    (vi) Sum, for all affected units, the daily electric energy 
generated (recorded according to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section) 
for the boiler operating days identified in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this 
section.
    (vii) Calculate the weighted plant-wide annual average 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate by dividing the sum of the products 
determined according to paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section by the sum 
of the electric energy generated determined according to paragraph 
(d)(3)(vi) of this section.
    (viii) The weighted plant-wide annual average SO<INF>2</INF> 
emission rate shall be used to determine compliance with the emission 
limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (4) Continuous emission monitoring. The owner or operator shall 
install, maintain, and operate continuous emission monitoring systems to 
determine compliance with the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section as calculated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. This 
equipment shall meet the specifications in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60 
in effect on October 3, 1991. The owner or operator shall comply with 
the quality assurance procedures for continuous emission monitoring 
systems found in appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 in effect on October 3, 
1991.
    (5) Reporting requirements. For each steam generating unit subject 
to the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the 
owner or operator:
    (i) Shall furnish the Administrator written notification of the 
SO<INF>2</INF>, oxygen, and carbon dioxide emissions according to the 
procedures found in 40 CFR Sec. 60.7 in effect on October 3, 1991.
    (ii) Shall furnish the Administrator written notification of the 
daily electric energy generated in megawatt-hours.
    (iii) Shall maintain records according to the procedures in 40 CFR 
60.7 in effect on October 3, 1991.
    (iv) Shall notify the Administrator by telephone or in writing 
within one business day of any outage of the control system needed for 
compliance with the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section and shall submit a follow-up written report within 30 days of 
the repairs stating how the repairs were accomplished and justifying the 
amount of time taken for the repairs.

[[Page 158]]

    (6) Compliance dates. The requirements of this paragraph shall be 
applicable to one unit at the Navajo Generating Station beginning 
November 19, 1997, to two units beginning November 19, 1998, and to all 
units beginning on August 19, 1999.
    (7) Schedule of compliance. The owner or operator shall take the 
following actions by the dates specified:
    (i) By June 1, 1992, award binding contracts to an architectural and 
engineering firm to design and procure the control system needed for 
compliance with the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (ii) By January 1, 1995, initiate on-site construction or 
installation of a control system for the first unit.
    (iii) By May 1, 1997, initiate start-up testing of the control 
system for the first unit.
    (iv) By May 1, 1998, initiate start-up testing of the control system 
for the second unit.
    (v) By February 1, 1999, initiate start-up testing of the control 
system for the third unit.

The interim deadlines will be extended if the owner or operators can 
demonstrate to the Administrator that compliance with the deadlines in 
paragraph (d)(6) of this section will not be affected.
    (8) Reporting on compliance schedule. Within 30 days after the 
specified date for each deadline in the schedule of compliance 
(paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the owner or operator shall notify 
the Administrator in writing whether the deadline was met. If it was not 
met the notice shall include an explanation why it was not met and the 
steps which shall be taken to ensure future deadlines will be met.
    (9) Exclusion for equipment failure during initial operation. For 
each unit, in determining compliance for the first year that such unit 
is required to meet the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, periods during which one of the following conditions are met 
shall be excluded:
    (i) Equipment or systems do not meet designer's or manufacturer's 
performance expectations.
    (ii) Field installation including engineering or construction 
precludes equipment or systems from performing as designed.

The periods to be excluded shall be determined by the Administrator 
based on the periodic reports of compliance with the emission limitation 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section which shall identify the times 
proposed for exclusion and provide the reasons for the exclusion, 
including the reasons for the control system outage. The report also 
shall describe the actions taken to avoid the outage, to minimize its 
duration, and to reduce SO<INF>2</INF> emissions at the plant to the 
extent practicable while the control system was not fully operational. 
Whenever the time to be excluded exceeds a cumulative total of 30 days 
for any control system for any affected unit, the owner or operators 
shall submit a report within 15 days addressing the history of and 
prognosis for the performance of the control system.
    (10) Exclusion for catastrophic failure. In addition to the 
exclusion of periods allowed in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, any 
periods of emissions from an affected unit for which the Administrator 
finds that the control equipment or system for such unit is out of 
service because of catastrophic failure of the control system which 
occurred for reasons beyond the control of the owner or operators and 
could not have been prevented by good engineering practices will be 
excluded from the compliance determination. Events which are the 
consequence of lack of appropriate maintenance or of intentional or 
negligent conduct or omissions of the owner or operators or the control 
system design, construction, or operating contractors do not constitute 
catastrophic failure.
    (11) Equipment operation. The owner or operator shall optimally 
operate all equipment or systems needed to comply with the requirements 
of this paragraph consistent with good engineering practices to keep 
emissions at or below the emission limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section, and following outages of any control equipment or systems 
the control equipment or system will be returned to full operation as 
expeditiously as practicable.
    (12) Maintenance scheduling. On March 16 of each year starting in 
1993,

[[Page 159]]

the owner or operator shall prepare and submit to the Administrator a 
long-term maintenance plan for the Navajo Generating Station which 
accommodates the maintenance requirements for the other generating 
facilities on the Navajo Generating Station grid covering the period 
from March 16 to March 15 of the next year and showing at least 6 unit-
weeks of maintenance for the Navajo Generating Station during the 
November 1 to March 15 period, except as provided in paragraph (d)(13) 
of this section. This plan shall be developed consistent with the 
criteria established by the Western States Coordinating Council of the 
North American Electric Reliability Council to ensure an adequate 
reserve margin of electric generating capacity. At the time that a plan 
is transmitted to the Administrator, the owner or operator shall notify 
the Administrator in writing if less than the full scheduled unit-weeks 
of maintenance were conducted for the period covered by the previous 
plan and shall furnish a written report stating how that year qualified 
for one of the exceptions identified in paragraph (d)(13) of this 
section.
    (13) Exceptions for maintenance scheduling. The owner or operator 
shall conduct a full 6 unit-weeks of maintenance in accordance with the 
plan required in paragraph (d)(12) of this section unless the owner or 
operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a 
full 6 unit-weeks of maintenance during the November 1 to March 15 
period should not be required because of the following:
    (i) There is no need for 6 unit-weeks of scheduled periodic 
maintenance in the year covered by the plan;
    (ii) The reserve margin on any electrical system served by the 
Navajo Generating Station would fall to an inadequate level, as defined 
by the criteria referred to in paragraph (d)(12) of this section.
    (iii) The cost of compliance with this requirement would be 
excessive. The cost of compliance would be excessive when the economic 
savings to the owner or operator of moving maintenance out of the 
November 1 to March 15 period exceeds $50,000 per unit-day of 
maintenance moved.
    (iv) A major forced outage at a unit occurs outside of the November 
1 to March 15 period, and necessary periodic maintenance occurs during 
the period of forced outage.

If the Administrator determines that a full 6 unit-weeks of maintenance 
during the November 1 to March 15 period should not be required, the 
owner or operator shall nevertheless conduct that amount of scheduled 
maintenance that is not precluded by the Administrator. Generally, the 
owner or operator shall make best efforts to conduct as much scheduled 
maintenance as practicable during the November 1 to March 15 period.

Sec. 52.219  Identification of plan--conditional approval.

    The plan revision commitments listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section were submitted on the date specified.
    (a) On November 13, 1992, California submitted a commitment to 
prepare a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) for 
the California ozone nonattainment areas to address the requirement in 
section 182(c)(4)(B) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that requires 
the States to develop a SIP revision for all ozone nonattainment areas 
classified as serious and above to opt-out of the Clean-Fuel Fleet 
Program by submitting for EPA approval a substitute program(s) resulting 
in as much or greater long-term reductions in ozone-producing and toxic 
air emissions. The State submittal contained an interim milestone to 
supply more accurate emission reduction data demonstrating equivalence 
no later than one year after the publication date of the Federal 
Register notice approving the State's committal SIP revision. California 
is required to submit the final SIP revision by May 15, 1994. The State 
held a public meeting on this committal SIP on March 17, 1992. The 
California SIP revisions are met automatically when the SIP revision 
concerns a regulation previously adopted by the Board.

Sec. 52.235  Control strategy for ozone: Oxides of nitrogen.

    EPA is approving an exemption request submitted by the Monterey Bay 
Unified Air Pollution Control District on April 26, 1994 for the 
Monterey Bay ozone nonattainment area from the NO<INF>X</INF> RACT 
requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This 
approval exempts the area from implementing the oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) requirements for reasonably available control 
technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), the related requirements of 
general and transportation conformity regulations, and applicable 
inspection and maintenance (I/M). The exemption is based on ambient air 
monitoring data and lasts for only as long as the area's monitoring 
efforts continue to demonstrate attainment without NO<INF>X</INF> 
reductions from major stationary sources.

permit violations of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under 
some circumstances. Therefore, the following regulations are

Sec. 52.282  Control strategy and regulations: Ozone.

    (a) Attainment determination. EPA has determined that the Ventura 
County severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1-hour ozone 
NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2005. EPA also 
has determined that the Ventura County severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment 
area is not subject to the requirements of section 185 of the Clean Air 
Act (CAA) for the 1-hour standard and that the State is not required to 
submit a SIP under Section 182(d)(3) of the CAA to implement a section 
185 program for the 1-hour standard in this area. In addition, the 
requirements of section 172(c)(9) (contingency measures) for the 1-hour 
standard do not apply to the area.
    (b) Approval. On December 19, 2007, the California Air Resources 
Board submitted a maintenance plan for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for 
the Monterey Bay Area as required by section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air 
Act, as amended in 1990, and 40 CFR 51.905(a)(4). Elements of the 
section 110(a)(1) maintenance plan for ozone include a base year (2002) 
attainment emissions inventory for ozone, a demonstration of maintenance 
of the ozone NAAQS with projected emissions inventories through the year 
2014 for ozone, a plan to verify continued attainment, and a contingency 
plan. The maintenance plan meets the Federal requirements of Clean Air 
Act section 110(a)(1) and 40 CFR 51.905(a)(4) and is approved as a 
revision to the California State Implementation Plan for the above 
mentioned area.
    (c) Determination of attainment. Effective January 4, 2010, EPA is 
determining that the Imperial County, California 8-hour ozone 
nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under 
the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), 
this determination suspends the reasonable further progress

[[Page 320]]

and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and 
related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as 
long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone 
standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the

carbon monoxide attainment area for the remainder of the individual 
area's initial ten-year maintenance plan. As part of the maintenance 
plan request, CT DEP also requested approval of a second follow-on ten-
year carbon monoxide maintenance plan for the Hartford-New Britain-
Middletown carbon monoxide attainment area (period 2006 to 2015), for 
the New Haven-Meriden-Waterbury carbon monoxide attainment area (period 
2009 to 2018), and for the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern 
New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide attainment area (period 2011 to 
2020). The State of Connecticut has committed to: maintain a continuous 
carbon monoxide monitoring network in each carbon monoxide maintenance 
area; implement contingency measures in the event of an exceedance of 
the carbon monoxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in any 
of the three maintenance areas; coordinate with EPA in the event the 
carbon monoxide design value(s) in any maintenance area(s) exceed 7.65 
ppm, to verify the validity of the data and, if warranted based on the

[[Page 368]]

data review, develop a full maintenance plan(s) for the affected 
maintenance area(s); and, ensure that project-level carbon monoxide 
evaluations of transportation projects in each area are carried out as 
part of environmental reviews or Connecticut's indirect source 
permitting program. The limited maintenance plans satisfy all applicable 
requirements of section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Approval of a Limited 
Maintenance Plan is conditioned on maintaining levels of ambient carbon 
monoxide levels below the required limited maintenance plan 8-hour 
carbon monoxide design value criterion of 7.65 parts per million. If the 
Limited Maintenance Plan criterion is no longer satisfied, Connecticut 
must develop a full maintenance plan to meet Clean Air Act requirements.

Sec. 52.378  Control strategy: PM[bdi1][bdi0]

    (a) Approval--On June 23, 2005, the Connecticut Department of 
Environmental Protection submitted a request to redesignate the City of 
New Haven PM<INF>10</INF> nonattainment area to attainment for 
PM<INF>10</INF>. The redesignation request and the initial ten-year 
maintenance plan (2006-2015) meet the redesignation requirements in 
sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, 
respectively.
    (b) Approval--On June 23, 2005, the Connecticut Department of 
Environmental Protection (CT DEP) submitted a request to establish a 
Limited Maintenance Plan (LMP) for the City of New Haven PM<INF>10</INF> 
attainment area for the area's initial ten-year maintenance plan (2006-
2015). The State of Connecticut has committed to: maintain a 
PM<INF>10</INF> monitoring network in the New Haven PM<INF>10</INF> 
maintenance area; implement contingency measures in the event of an 
exceedance of the PM<INF>10</INF> National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(NAAQS) in the maintenance area; coordinate with EPA in the event the 
PM<INF>10</INF> design value in the maintenance area exceeds 98 
[micro]gm/m\3\ for the 24-hour PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS or 40 [micro]gm/
m\3\ for the annual PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS; and to verify the validity of 
the data and, if warranted based on the data review, develop a full 
maintenance plan for the maintenance area. The LMP satisfies all 
applicable requirements of section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Approval 
of the LMP is conditioned on maintaining levels of ambient 
PM<INF>10</INF> below a PM<INF>10</INF> design value criteria of 98 
[micro]gm/m\3\ for the 24-hour PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS and 40 [micro]gm/
m\3\ for the annual PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS. For the Criscuolo Park site, 
Connecticut still qualifies for the LMP option if, based on five years 
of site data, the average design values (ADVs) of the continuous 
PM<INF>10</INF> monitor are less than the site-specific critical design 
value (CDV). If the LMP criteria are no longer satisfied, Connecticut 
must develop a full maintenance plan to meet Clean Air Act requirements.

Sec. 52.387  Interstate Transport for the 1997 8-hour ozone and PM[bdi2]<INF>.</INF>[bdi5] NAAQS.

    On March 13, 2007, the State of Connecticut submitted a State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) revision addressing the Section 
110(a)(2)(D)(i) interstate transport requirements of the Clean Air Act 
for the 1997 8-hour ozone and PM<INF>2.5</INF> National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards (NAAQS). There are four distinct elements related to 
the impact of interstate transport of air pollutants. These include 
prohibiting significant contribution to downwind nonattainment of the 
NAAQS, interference with maintenance of the NAAQS, interference with 
plans in another state to prevent significant deterioration of air 
quality, and interference with efforts of other states to protect 
visibility. EPA has found that Connecticut's March 13, 2007 submittal 
adequately addresses these four distinct elements and has approved the 
submittal as meeting the requirements of Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 
1997 8-hour ozone and PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.

Sec. 52.472  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves the District of Columbia's plan for the attainment and 
maintenance of the national standards.
    (b) With respect to the transportation control strategies submitted 
on April 19, July 9, and July 16, 1973, the Administrator approves the 
measures for parking surcharge, car pool locator, vehicle inspection, 
express bus lanes, increased bus fleet and service, elimination of free 
parking by private employers, with exceptions set forth in Sec. Sec. 
52.476, 52.483, 52.486, and 52.479.
    (c) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves the District of Columbia's plan for the attainment and 
maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air 
Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all 
requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1977.
    (d) Section 710 of title 20 of the District of Columbia Regulations 
is approved with the following condition: Any alternative controls or 
exemptions under section 710.8 approved or granted by the District of 
Columbia are subject to a public notice and public hearing requirements 
and must be submitted to EPA as SIP revisions. Such alternatives or 
exemptions are not effective

Implementation Plan, District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) 
Title 20, Sections 200, 201, 202, 204 and 299, pertaining to permitting 
of sources, and associated definitions in Section 199 submitted on June 
21, 1985 and October 22, 1993 by the Mayor of the District of Columbia 
(1985 submittal) and by the Administrator of the District of Columbia 
Environmental Regulation Administration (1993 submittal). The 
disapproved regulations include those applicable to major new and major 
modified sources wishing to locate in the District. A new source review 
program for such major sources is required under sections 182 and 184 of 
the Clean Air Act. There are many deficiencies in the DCMR permitting 
regulations. Some of these deficiencies are the lack of public notice 
and comment procedures for new and modified sources applying for 
construction permits, the existence of a provision that allows the Mayor 
to grant indefinite 1-month temporary permits to those sources whose 
permits he/she determines have been delayed because of his/her office, 
the inclusion of a major source operating permit program, the inclusion 
of a minor source operating permit program that does not meet Part D 
requirements of the Act, the exemption of certain fuel burning (nitrogen 
oxide emitting) sources, incorrect citations of the Clean Air Act, a 
provision that allows circumvention of the offset requirement, and the 
lack of the de minimis special modification provisions required in 
serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas (section 182(c)(6) of the 
Clean Air Act).

the Metropolitan Washington area, which includes the 1996-1999 portion 
of the rate-of-progress plan submitted on November 3, 1997, and May 25, 
1999 and the transportation control measures in Appendix H of the May 
25, 1999 submittal, and the severe ozone attainment demonstration 
submitted on April 24, 1998, October 27, 1998, February 16, 2000 and 
section 9.1.1.2 of the March 22, 2000 submittal, is conditionally 
approved contingent on the District submitting a revised SIP by April 
17, 2004 that satisfies certain conditions. This conditional approval 
also establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2005 of 101.8 tons 
per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 161.8 tons per day of 
nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) to be used in transportation conformity 
in the Metropolitan Washington, DC serious ozone nonattainment area 
until revised budgets based upon the MOBILE6 model are submitted and 
found adequate. The District must submit a revised SIP by April 17, 2004 
that satisfies the following conditions.
    (1) Revises the 1996-1999 portion of the severe area ROP plan to 
include a contingency plan containing those adopted measures that 
qualify as contingency measures to be implemented should EPA determine 
that the Washington area failed to achieve the required 9 percent rate-
of-progress reductions by November 15, 1999.
    (2) Revises the 1999-2005 portion of the severe area rate-of-
progress plan to provide MOBILE6-based mobile source emission budgets 
and adopted measures sufficient to achieve emission reductions of ozone 
precursors of at least 3 percent per year from November 15, 1999 to the 
November 15, 2005 severe ozone attainment date.
    (3) Revises the severe area ROP plan to include a contingency plan 
containing those adopted measures that qualify as contingency measures 
to be implemented should EPA determine that the Washington area failed 
to achieve the ROP reductions required for the post-1999 period.
    (4) Revises the Washington area severe attainment demonstration to 
include a contingency plan containing those adopted measures that 
qualify as contingency measures to be implemented for the failure of the 
Washington area to attain the one-hour ozone standard for serious areas 
by November 15, 1999.

[[Page 416]]

    (5) Revises the Washington area severe attainment demonstration to 
reflect revised MOBILE6-based motor vehicle emissions budgets, including 
revisions to the attainment modeling/weight of evidence demonstration 
and adopted control measures, as necessary, to show that the SIP 
continues to demonstrate attainment by November 15, 2005.
    (6) Revises the Washington area severe attainment demonstration to 
include a contingency plan containing those measures to be implemented 
if the Washington area does not attain the one-hour ozone standard by 
November 15, 2005.
    (7) Revises the Washington area severe attainment demonstration to 
include a revised RACM analysis and any revisions to the attainment 
demonstration including adopted control measures, as necessitated by 
such analysis.
    (8) Revises the major stationary source threshold to 25 tons per 
year.
    (9) Revises Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules to 
include the lower major source applicability threshold.
    (10) Revises new source review offset requirement to require an 
offset ratio of at least 1.3 to 1.
    (11) Includes a fee requirement for major sources of volatile 
organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) should the 
area fail to attain by November 15, 2005.
    (12) Includes a revision that identifies and adopts specific 
enforceable transportation control strategies and transportation control 
measures to offset any growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles 
traveled or number of vehicle trips and to attain reductions in motor 
vehicle emissions as necessary, in combination with other emission 
reduction requirements in the Washington area, to comply with the rate-
of-progress requirements for severe areas. Measures specified in section 
108(f) of the Clean Air Act will be considered and implemented as 
necessary to demonstrate attainment.

<R05>
Sec. 52.519  Identification of plan-conditional approval.

    EPA is conditionally approving a revision to the Florida State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) consisting of revisions to Florida 
Administrative Code Chapters 62-210 and 62-212. Based upon a commitment 
from the State, Florida must (1) revise the definition of ``new 
emissions unit'' to be consistent with the federal definition or revise 
the definition to define what is meant by ``beginning normal operation'' 
and provide an equivalency demonstration supporting the revised 
definition; (2) revise the definition of ``significant emissions rate'' 
to include ozone depleting substances; (3) withdraw the request that EPA 
include a significant emissions rate for mercury in the Florida SIP, 
specifically F.A.C. 62-210.200(243)(a)2; and (4) revise the 
recordkeeping requirements at F.A.C. 62-212.300 to be consistent with 
federal requirements. If the State fails to meet its commitment by June 
29, 2009, the approval is treated as a disapproval.

Sec. 52.525  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission 
data is inadequate.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other

Sec. 52.526  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, 
since section 403.111 of the Florida Statutes could, in some 
circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the public. 
Therefore, section 403.111 is disapproved.

Sec. 52.527  Control strategy: General.

    (a) Since the testing and research rule (FAC 17-1.585) submitted by 
the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation on April 7, 1980, as 
a revision of the plan does not meet the requirements of Section 110 of 
the Clean Air Act and the requirements of section 51.8 of this chapter, 
it is disapproved, and is not part of the plan.
    (b) [Reserved]

Sec. 52.528  Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.

    (a) In a letter dated October 10, 1986, the Florida Department of 
Environmental Regulation certified that no emission limits in the 
State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's 
stack height rules.
    (b) The variance granted to the Turkey Point and Port Everglades 
plants of Florida Power and Light Company from the particulate emission 
limits of the plan is disapproved because the relaxed limits would cause 
violation of the Class I increment for sulfur dioxide in the Everglades 
National Park. These plants must meet the 0.1<greek-i>/MMBTU particulate 
limit of the plan.

Sec. 52.623  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Hawaii's plan for attainment and maintenance of the national 
standards. The State included various provisions in its plan to provide 
for the attainment of State ambient air quality standards. As described 
in the Governor's letters of January 28, May 8, and May 22, 1972, these 
provisions were included for information purposes only and were not to 
be considered a part of the plan to implement national standards. 
Accordingly, these additional provisions are not considered a part of 
the applicable plan.

Sec. 52.624  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission 
data is inadequate.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

Sec. 52.625  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, 
since sections 322-64(5) and 322-66 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes 
could, in some circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data 
to the public. Therefore, sections 322-64(5) and 322-66 are disapproved.

\1\ EPA does not have the authority to remove these source-specific requirements in the absence of a
  demonstration that their removal would not interfere with attainment or maintenance of the NAAQS, violate any
  prevention of significant deterioration increment or result in visibility impairment. Idaho Department of
  Environmental Quality may request removal by submitting such a demonstration to EPA as a SIP revision.
\2\ Only a small portion of this facility is located on State lands. The vast majority of the facility is
  located in Indian Country. It is EPA's position that unless EPA has explicitly approved a program as applying
  in Indian country, State or local regulations or permits are not effective within the boundaries of that
  Indian country land for purposes of complying with the CAA. 68 FR 2217, 2220 (January 16, 2003).

<R05>
Sec. 52.673  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Idaho's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national 
standards.


<R05>
Sec. 52.674  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.675  Control strategy: Sulfur oxides--Eastern Idaho Intrastate Air Quality Control Region.

    (a)(1) Regulation R of the Rules and Regulations for the Control of 
Air Pollution in Idaho, which is part of the sulfur dioxide 
(SO<INF>2</INF>) control strategy, is disapproved since it is 
inconsistent with the purposes and provisions of subpart G of this 
chapter. These requirements are not met by Regulation R in that the 
SO<INF>2</INF> control strategy contained therein is not adequate for 
the attainment and maintenance of SO<INF>2</INF> national ambient air 
quality standards (NAAQS).
    (2) Rules 1-1801 through 1-1804 (Rules for Control of Sulfur Oxide 
Emissions from Sulfuric Acid Plants) of the ``Rules and Regulations for 
the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho'' are inadequate to ensure 
attainment and maintenance of Sulfur Dioxide National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards in the Eastern Idaho Intrastate Air Quality Control 
Region. Special limits have previously been established for certain 
existing acid plants in this Air Quality Control Region (Sec. Sec. 
52.670(c)(15) and 52.675(b)). Therefore, Rules 1-1801 through 1-1804 are 
approved except as they apply to existing acid plants with approved or 
promulgated emission limits that are more stringent than the limit found 
in 1-1802.
    (b) Regulation for control of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) 
emissions: Sulfuric Acid Plants. (1) The provisions of this paragraph 
shall apply to the owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot 
Company's Minerals and Chemical Division, located in Power County, 
Idaho, in the Eastern Idaho Intrastate Air Quality Control Region.
    (2) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company 
facility shall utilize best engineering techniques in the operation of 
their plant to prevent fugitive SO losses. Such techniques shall include 
but are not limited to:
    (i) Operating and maintaining all conducts, flues, and stacks in a 
leakfree condition.
    (ii) Operating and maintaining all process equipment and gas 
collection systems in such a fashion that leakage of SO<INF>2</INF> 
gases will be prevented to the maximum extent possible.
    (3) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company 
facility shall limit SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from their sulfuric acid 
plants per the following:
    (i) The combined SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the designated 100 
and 200 sulfric acid plants shall not exceed 2 kilograms (kg) per metric 
ton (4 pounds per ton) of 100 percent sulfuric acid produced.
    (ii) The SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from the designated 300 sulfuric 
acid plant and stack shall not exceed 994 kg per hour (2190 pounds per 
hour).
    (4) (i) The owner(s) and operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company 
shall achieve compliance with the requirements specified in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section in accordance with the following 
schedule:
    (A) Advise EPA as to status of contract(s) and construction 
schedules for pollution abatement projects within 30 days of the 
effective date of this regulation.
    (B) Attain final compliance by July 31, 1976.
    (ii) A performance test of the 300 acid plant shall be necessary to 
determine whether compliance has been achieved with the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Such test must be completed within 15 
days of the final compliance date specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of 
this section. Notice must be given to the Administrator at least 10 days 
prior to such a test to afford him an opportunity to have an observer 
present.
    (iii) Within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at 
which the 100 and 200 acid plant will be operated, but not later than 
180 days after initial start-up of these plants and at such other times 
as may be required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Clean 
Air Act, the owner(s) and operator(s) of the facility shall conduct 
performance test(s) in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.8.
    (iv) If the owner(s) and operator(s) of the J. R. Simplot Company 
facility are

[[Page 473]]

presently in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section or in compliance with a portion of these 
requirements, such compliance shall be certified to the Administrator 
within 15 days following the date of the publication of these 
requirements as a final regulation in the Federal Register. If the 
owner(s) or operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company achieve compliance 
prior to July 31, 1976, such compliance shall be certified to the 
Administrator within 15 days of the date of achieving compliance. The 
Administrator may request whatever supporting information he considers 
necessary to determine the validity of the certification.
    (5) (i) By no later than September 30, 1976, the owner(s) and 
operator(s) of The J. R. Simplot Company facility shall install, 
calibrate, maintain and operate measurement system(s) for:

    (104) [Reserved]
    (105) On February 7, 1994, the State submitted revisions intended to 
create a permit program for small sources. The purpose of these 
revisions is to lessen the permitting burden on small sources and the 
permitting authority by reducing the frequency and/or the requirement of 
operating permit renewal for sources emitting a total of less than 25 
tons per year of regulated air pollutants. A permit obtained through 
these procedures is intended to continue as a legally binding State 
document until the source modifies its operations, withdraws its permit 
or becomes subject to a new applicable requirement. At that time, the 
State will determine whether the small source procedures continue to be 
appropriate and issue a revised small source permit or direct the source 
in following the correct permit procedures. Since small source permits 
are not subject to a public comment period or review by USEPA, they are 
not federally enforceable and cannot be used to limit sources' potential 
to emit and thereby exempt them from the requirements of the title v 
operating permit program.
    (i) Incorporation by reference. Illinois Administrative Code, Title 
35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle B: Air Pollution, Chapter I: 
Pollution Control Board.

ozone season emissions of nitrogen oxides. These rules provide a 
methodology for allocating allowances to subject sources and require 
these sources to hold sufficient allowances to accommodate their 
emissions and to meet various monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements. EPA is approving the submitted provisions of Subparts A, 
C, D, and E of Part 225 of Title 35 of Illinois Administrative Code; EPA 
is deferring action on Subpart F.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.

    (179) On October 31, 2003, the Illinois Environmental Protection 
Agency submitted rules and related materials to address site-specific 
requirements for Cromwell-Phoenix, Incorporated, located in Alsip, 
Illinois. These rules establish an adjusted standard for the corrosion 
inhibiting packaging production facility of Cromwell-Phoenix, 
Incorporated located at this source site. These rules provide a site-
specific adjusted standard for this source facility for volume 35 of the 
Illinois Administrative Code subpart F section 218.204(c). The adjusted 
standard gives the corrosion inhibiting paper coating lines at the Alsip 
facility an adjusted volatile organic material (volatile organic 
compounds) content limit for paper coatings, and places an annual limit 
on the volatile organic material emissions from the Alsip facility as a 
whole. The adjusted standard also establishes source administration and 
reporting requirements for Cromwell-Phoenix, Incorporated Alsip 
facility. EPA is approving this site-specific adjusted standard as a 
revision of the Illinois state implementation plan.

for the Emission Reduction Market System. These revisions assure that 
sources in the Chicago area with potential emissions of VOC between 25 
and 100 tons per year will remain subject to the program, irrespective 
of changes in the area's ozone nonattainment classification or 
designation and any associated changes in whether such sources are 
defined to be major sources. EPA is again deferring action on section

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approved Illinois' plan for the attainment and maintenance of the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards under section 110 of the Clean 
Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plan satisfies all 
requirements of part D, title I of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, 
except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the 
requirements of part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the 
adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980, for the 
sources covered by CTGs between January 1978 and January 1979 and 
adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT 
requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) The Administrator finds that the transportation control plans 
for the East St. Louis and Chicago areas submitted on December 3, 1982, 
satisfy the related requirements of part D, title I

[[Page 518]]

of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977.
    (c) The Administrator finds that the carbon monoxide control 
strategy submitted on May 4, 1983, satisfies all requirements of part D, 
title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, except for section 
172(b)(6).

Sec. 52.724  Control strategy: Sulfur dioxide.

    (a) Part D--Conditional Approval--The Illinois plan is approved 
provided that the following condition is satisfied:
    (1) The plan includes a reanalysis of the Pekin, Illinois area, a 
submittal of the analysis results to USEPA, the proposal of any 
additional regulations to the Illinois Pollution Control Board necessary 
to insure attainment and maintenance of the sulfur dioxide standard, and 
the promulgation of any necessary regulations. The State must complete 
the reanalysis, submit the results to USEPA and submit any necessary, 
additional regulations to the Illinois Pollution Control Board by 
September 30, 1980. Any necessary regulation must be finally promulgated 
by the State and submitted to USEPA by September 30, 1981.
    (2) Extension of Condition--USEPA approves the date of July 1, 1984 
for submitting the draft sulfur dioxide rule revisions and supporting 
documentation as required in (a)(1) for Peoria, Hollis and Groveland 
Townships in Illinois. The State must complete final rule adoption as 
expeditiously as possible but no later than December 31, 1985.
    (b) Part D--Disapproval--USEPA disapproves Rules 204(c)(1)(B), Rule 
204(c)(1)(C), Rule 204(e)(1) and Rule 204(e)(2) for those sources for 
which these rules represent a relaxation of the federally enforceable 
State Implementation Plan. Rule 204(c)(1)(B), Rule 204(c)(1)(C), Rule 
204(e)(1) and Rule 204(e)(2) are approved as not representing 
relaxations of the State Implementation Plan for the following sources:

This disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth 
restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(1).
    (c) Disapproval--USEPA disapproves Rule 204(e)(4) as not being 
adequate to protect the NAAQS. This disapproval does not in and of 
itself result in the growth restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(I).
    (d) Disapproval--USEPA disapproves Rule 204(f)(1)(D) as completely 
deregulating SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from existing processes without 
providing an assessment of the ambient air quality impact or a showing 
that increasing the allowable emissions from these sources will not 
cause or contribute to violations of the NAAQS or PSD increments. This 
disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions 
of section 110(a)(2)(I).
    (e) Disapproval--USEPA disapproves Rule 204(h) for those sources for 
which USEPA has disapproved rules 204(c) and 204(e). This disapproval 
does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 
110(a)(2)(I).
    (f) Approval--USEPA approves rule 204(e)(3) for those sources able 
to show that the proposed emission rate will not cause or contribute to 
a violation of the NAAQS. The State must submit these emission 
limitations, along with the technical support to USEPA for approval.
    (g) Part D--Approval--The State plan for Alton Township, Madison 
County, which consists of a federally Enforceable State Operating Permit 
controlling sulfur dioxide emissions from the boilers and reheat 
furnaces at Laclede Steel, which was submitted on November 18, 1993, is 
approved.
    (h) Approval--On November 10, 1994, the Illinois Environmental 
Protection Agency submitted a sulfur dioxide redesignation request and 
maintenance plan for Peoria and Hollis Townships in Peoria County and 
Groveland Township in Tazewell County to redesignate the townships to 
attainment for sulfur dioxide. The redesignation request and maintenance 
plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(d) of the 
Clean Air Act (Act) as amended in 1990.

Sec. 52.725  Control strategy: Particulates.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Part D--Disapproval. (1) U.S. EPA disapproves the provisions of 
Rule 203(f) which allow the use of an equivalent method without review 
and approval of that method. Any source subject to Rule 203(f) which 
chooses to use an equivalent method must have that equivalent method 
submitted to U.S. EPA and approved as a SIP revision.
    (2) U.S. EPA disapproves the following portions of Rule 203(d)(5) 
which regulate the control of particulate matter from specific sources 
within the iron and steel industry: Rule 205(d)(5)(B)(ii), Rule 
205(d)(5)(B)(iii), Rule 205(d)(5)(D), and Rule 205(d)(5)(K).
    (3) USEPA disapproves a proposed SIP revision submitted by the State 
on May 12, 1982, in the form of a May 18, 1981 Consent Decree (Civil 
Action 81-3009) to which USEPA, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency 
and National Steel Corporation are parties and a draft Alternative 
Control Strategy Permit. This submission was modified by the State, 
September 30, 1982, with the submission of a separate document embodying 
the elements of the Alternative Control Strategy. This separate document 
was intended to become an enforceable part of the SIP.
    (c) Approval--On September 28, 1988, the State of Illinois submitted 
a committal SIP for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 
equal to or less than 10 micrometers (PM<INF>10</INF>) for the Illinois 
Group II areas of concern in DuPage, Will, Rock Island, Macon, Randolph, 
and St. Clair Counties. The committal SIP contains all the requirements 
identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the SIP requirements for 
PM<INF>10</INF> at 52 FR 24681.
    (d) Approval--On June 2, 1995, and January 9, 1996, the State of 
Illinois submitted a maintenance plan for the particulate matter 
nonattainment portion of LaSalle County, and requested that it be 
redesignated to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard 
for particulate matter. The redesignation request and maintenance plan 
satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
    (e) Approval--On March 19, 1996, and October 15, 1996, Illinois 
submitted requests to redesignate the Granite City

[[Page 520]]

Particulate Matter (PM) nonattainment area to attainment status for the 
PM National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), as well as a 
maintenance plan for the Granite City area to ensure continued 
attainment of the NAAQS. The redesignation request and maintenance plan 
satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
    (f) On November 14, 1995, May 9, 1996, and June 14, 1996, the State 
of Illinois submitted State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision requests 
to meet commitments related to the conditional approval of Illinois' May 
15, 1992, SIP submittal for the Lake Calumet (SE Chicago), McCook, and 
Granite City, Illinois, Particulate Matter (PM) nonattainment areas. The 
EPA is approving the SIP revision request as it applies to the McCook PM 
nonattainment area. For the McCook PM nonattainment area, all of the 
deficiencies of the May 15, 1992, submittal have been corrected.
    (g) Approval--On May 5, 1992, November 14, 1995, May 9, 1996, June 
14, 1996, February 3, 1997, October 16, 1997, October 21, 1997, February 
1, 1999, and May 19, 1999, Illinois submitted SIP revision requests to 
meet the Part D particulate matter (PM) nonattainment plan requirements 
for the Lake Calumet, Granite City and McCook moderate PM nonattainment 
areas. The submittals include federally enforceable construction permit, 
application number 93040047, issued on January 11, 1999, to Acme Steel 
Company. The part D plans for these areas are approved.
    (h) Approval--On August 2, 2005, the State of Illinois submitted a 
request to redesignate the Lyons Township (McCook), Cook County 
particulate matter nonattainment area to attainment of the NAAQS for 
particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a 
nominal 10 micrometers (PM-10). In its submittal, the State also 
requested that EPA approve the maintenance plan for the area into the 
Illinois PM SIP. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the 
redesignation requirements of the Clean Air Act.
    (i) Approval--On August 2, 2005, and as supplemented on September 8, 
2005, the State of Illinois submitted a request to redesignate the Lake 
Calumet (Southeast Chicago), Cook County particulate matter 
nonattainment area to attainment of the NAAQS for particulate matter 
with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 
micrometers (PM-10). In its submittal, the State also requested that EPA 
approve the maintenance plan for the area into the Illinois PM SIP. The 
redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation 
requirements of the Clean Air Act.
    (j) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined, as of November 
27, 2009, that the Chicago-Gary-Lake County, IL-IN PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
nonattainment area has attained the 1997 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. This 
determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the 
requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, 
associated reasonably available control measures, reasonable further 
progress, contingency measures, and other plan elements related to 
attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet 
the 1997 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.

<R05>
Sec. 52.726  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) Part D--Conditional Approval--The Illinois plan is approved 
provided that the following conditions are satisfied:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) The State conducts a study to demonstrate that the 75 percent 
overall control efficiency requirement in Rule 205(n) represents RACT, 
submits the results of the study to USEPA, and submits any necessary 
regulations representing RACT to the Illinois Pollution Control Board. 
The State must comply with these conditions by February 28, 1981. Any 
necessary regulations must be finally promulgated by the State and 
submitted to USEPA by February 28, 1982.
    (3) Extension of Condition--USEPA approves the date of July 31, 1984 
for the State of Illinois to satisfy the condition of approval to the 
ozone State

[[Page 521]]

Implementation Plan listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Disapproval--USEPA disapproves the compliance schedule in Rule 
205(j) as it applies to loading rack controls for all emission sources 
subject to Rule 205(b)(1), as approved by USEPA on May 31, 1972 which 
were required to be in compliance by December 31, 1973. This disapproval 
does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 
110(a)(2)(I).
    (c) Negative Declarations--Stationary Source Categories. The State 
of Illinois has certified to the satisfaction of USEPA that no sources 
are located in the nonattainment areas of the State which are covered by 
the following Control Technique Guidelines:
    (1) High density polyethylene and polypropylene manufacturers.
    (2) Vegetable oil processing sources with volatile organic compound 
emissions equal to or greater than 100 tons per year.
    (d) Part D Disapproval--The Administrator finds that Illinois' ozone 
plan for Cook, Lake, DuPage and Kane Counties, which was required to be 
submitted by July 1, 1982, does not satisfy all the requirements of Part 
D, Title I of the Clean Air Act and, thus, is disapproved. No major new 
stationary source, of major modification of a stationary source, or 
volatile organic compounds may be constructed in Cook, Lake, DuPage or 
Kane Counties, unless the construction permit application is complete on 
or before November 16, 1988. This disapproval does not affect USEPA's 
approval (or conditional approval) of individual parts of Illinois' 
ozone plan, and they remain approved.
    (e) Disapproval--The Administrator finds that the following State 
rules have not been demonstrated to be consistent with the reasonably 
available control technology requirements of section 172 of the Clean 
Air Act, as amended in 1977, and thus, are disapproved: subpart F, 
section 215.204(c); subpart F, section 215.206(b); subpart F, section 
215.204(j)(4); subpart I; subpart AA; subpart PP; subpart QQ; subpart 
RR; subpart A, section 215.102; subpart T; subpart H, section 215.245; 
subpart F, section 215.207; and subpart A, section 215.107, all of title 
35; Environmental Protection; subtitle B: Air Pollution; Chapter 1: 
Pollution Control Board of the Illinois Administrative Code (June 1989).
    (f) On September 30, 1992, the State submitted rules regulating 
volatile organic compound emissions from gasoline dispensing facilities' 
motor vehicle fuel operations (Stage II vapor recovery rules) in the 
Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The Illinois Environmental Protection 
Agency Bureau of Air must as part of the program conduct inspections of 
facilities subject to this rule to ensure compliance with the applicable 
rules. These inspections will be conducted on an annual basis or an 
alternative schedule as approved in the USEPA Fiscal Year Inspection 
Program Plan.
    (g) Approval--The Administrator approves the incorporation of the 
photochemical assessment ambient monitoring system submitted by Illinois 
on November 4, 1993, into the Illinois State Implementation Plan. This 
submittal satisfies 40 CFR 58.20(f) which requires the State to provide 
for the establishment and maintenance of photochemical assessment 
monitoring stations (PAMS) by November 12, 1993.
    (h) Approval--On November 12, 1993, the Illinois Environmental 
Protection Agency submitted an ozone redesignation request and 
maintenance plan for Jersey County ozone nonattainment area and 
requested that Jersey County be redesignated to attainment for ozone. 
The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation 
requirements in section 107(d)(3)(d) of the Act. The redesignation meets 
the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a 
revision to the Illinois ozone State Implementation Plan for Jersey 
County.
    (i) The base year (1990) ozone emission inventory requirement of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been 
satisfied for the following Illinois ozone nonattainment areas: the 
Chicago nonattainment area--Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Will and McHenry 
Counties, Aux Sable and Gooselake Townships in Grundy County, and Oswego 
Township in Kendall County; the Metro-East St. Louis nonattainment 
area--Madison, Monroe,

[[Page 522]]

and St. Clair Counties; and Jersey County.
    (j) Approval--On July 14, 1994, Illinois submitted two of three 
elements required by section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Amendments of 
1990 to be incorporated as part of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) 
State Implementation Plan intended to offset any growth in emissions 
from a growth in vehicle miles traveled. These elements are the 
offsetting of growth in emissions attributable to growth in VMT which 
was due November 15, 1992, and, transportation control measures (TCMs) 
required as part of Illinois' 15 percent reasonable further progress 
(RFP) plan which was due November 15, 1993. Illinois satisfied the first 
requirement by projecting emissions from mobile sources and 
demonstrating that no increase in emissions would take place. Illinois 
satisfied the second requirement by submitting the TCMs listed in Table 
1 which are now approved into the Illinois SIP.

    (k) Approval--EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new 
source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general 
conformity exemptions for the Illinois portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake 
County severe ozone nonattainment area as requested by the States of 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. 
This approval does not cover the exemption of NO<INF>X</INF> 
transportation conformity requirements of section 176(c) for this area. 
Approval of these exemptions is contingent on the results of the final 
ozone attainment demonstration expected to be submitted in mid-1997. The 
approval will be modified if the final attainment demonstration 
demonstrates that NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls are needed in the 
nonattainment area to attain the ozone standard in the Lake Michigan 
Ozone Study modeling domain.
    (l) Approval--The United States Environmental Protection Agency is 
approving under section 182(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act the exemption of 
the Chicago severe, ozone nonattainment area from the build/no-build and 
less than-1990 interim transportation conformity oxides of nitrogen 
requirements as requested by the State of Illinois in a June 20, 1995 
submittal. In light of the modeling completed thus far and considering 
the importance of the OTAG process and attainment plan modeling efforts, 
USEPA grants this NO<INF>X</INF> waiver on a contingent basis. As the 
OTAG modeling results and control recommendations are completed in 1996, 
this information will be incorporated into attainment plans being 
developed by the LADCO States. When these attainment plans are submitted 
to USEPA in mid-1997, these new modeling analyses will be reviewed to 
determine if the NO<INF>X</INF> waiver should be continued, altered, or 
removed. USEPA's rulemaking action to reconsider the initial 
NO<INF>X</INF> waiver may occur simultaneously with rulemaking action on 
the attainment plans. The USEPA also reserves the right to require 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls for transportation sources under 
section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act if future ozone modeling demonstrates 
that such controls are needed to achieve the ozone standard in downwind 
areas. The Chicago severe ozone nonattainment area includes the Counties 
of Cook, DuPage, Grundy (Aux Sable and Gooselake Townships), Kane, 
Kendall (Oswego Township), Lake, McHenry, and Will.
    (m) [Reserved]
    (n) Negative declaration--Shipbuilding and ship repair industry. On 
October 11, 1996, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction of 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources 
categorized as part of the shipbuilding and ship repair industry are 
located in the Chicago, Illinois ozone nonattainment area which is 
comprised of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will Counties and Aux 
Sable and Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County and Oswego Township in 
Kendall County or the Metro-East, Illinois ozone nonattainment area 
which is comprised of Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair Counties.
    (o) Negative declaration--Aerospace manufacturing and rework 
industry. On October 11, 1996, the State of Illinois certified to the 
satisfaction of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that 
no major sources categorized as part of the Aerospace Manufacturing and 
Rework Industry are located in the Chicago, Illinois ozone

[[Page 525]]

nonattainment area which is comprised of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, 
McHenry, Will Counties and Aux Sable and Goose Lake Townships in Grundy 
County and Oswego Township in Kendall County or the Metro-East, Illinois 
ozone nonattainment area which is comprised of Madison, Monroe, and St. 
Clair Counties.
    (p) Approval--On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted 15 percent 
rate-of-progress and 3 percent contingency plans for the Chicago ozone 
nonattainment area as a requested revision to the Illinois State 
Implementation Plan. These plans satisfy sections 182(b)(1), 172(c)(9), 
and 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990.
    (q) Approval--On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted 15 percent 
rate-of-progress and 3 percent contingency plans for the Metro-East St. 
Louis ozone nonattainment area as a requested revision to the Illinois 
State Implementation Plan. These plans satisfy sections 182(b)(1) and 
172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990.
    (r) Approval--On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted the following 
transportation control measures as part of the 15 percent rate-of-
progress and 3 percent contingency plans for the Metro-East ozone 
nonattainment area: Work trip reductions; transit improvements; and 
traffic flow improvements.
    (s) On October 10, 1997, Illinois submitted a site-specific revision 
to the State Implementation Plan, in the form of a letter from Bharat 
Mathur, Chief, Bureau of Air, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. 
This October 10, 1997, letter requests a change in regulatory status for 
Riverside Laboratories, Inc.'s Kane County facility, to reflect that the 
Federal site-specific rule for Riverside (40 CFR 52.741(e)(10)) has been 
superseded by the State of Illinois regulations, including the emission 
limits in 35 Illinois Administrative Code 218.204(c) and the associated 
control requirements, test methods and recordkeeping requirements in 
Part 218 and the associated definitions in part 211. These State 
regulations shall become the federally approved regulations applicable 
to Riverside on August 31, 1998. The site-specific rule, applicable to 
Riverside, promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency on August 
21, 1995 (40 CFR 52.741(e)(10)), remains in effect and is enforceable 
after August 31, 1998 for the period before August 31, 1998.
    (t) The Illinois volatile organic compound (VOC) rules that apply to 
the Stepan Company Millsdale Plant for volatile organic liquid storage 
(35 Ill. Admin. Code Part 218, Subpart B), batch processing (35 Ill. 
Admin. Code Parts 218 and 219, Subpart V) and continuous reactor and 
distillation processes (35 Ill. Admin. Code Part 218, Subpart Q) were 
approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) on 
August 8, 1996, April 2, 1996, and June 17, 1997, respectively. Because 
these rules have been approved into the State Implementation Plan and 
represent reasonably available control technology for VOC, USEPA revokes 
the June 29, 1990 Federal Implementation Plan as it applies to Stepan 
and replaces it with Illinois' volatile organic liquid storage, batch 
process, and continuous reactor and distillation process rules.
    (u) Negative declaration--Industrial wastewater category. On October 
2, 1998, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction of the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources 
categorized as part of the Industrial wastewater category are located in 
the Metro-East ozone nonattainment area (Metro-East). The Metro-East 
area is comprised of Madison, Monroe and St. Clair Counties which are 
located in southwest Illinois, adjacent to St. Louis, Missouri.
    (v) Negative declaration--Industrial cleaning solvents category. On 
October 2, 1998, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction of 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources 
categorized as part of the Industrial cleaning solvents category are 
located in the Metro-East ozone nonattainment area (Metro-East). The 
Metro-East area is comprised of Madison, Monroe and St. Clair Counties 
which are located in southwest Illinois, adjacent to St. Louis, 
Missouri.
    (w) Approval--On December 18, 1997, December 17, 1999, January 14, 
2000, and January 21, 2000, Illinois submitted a post-1996 Rate Of 
Progress Plan for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area as a

[[Page 526]]

requested revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan. This plan 
reduces ozone precursor emissions by 9 percent from 1990 baseline 
emissions by November 15, 1999. This plan also supports a mobile source 
emissions budget of 279.3 tons/day of volatile organic compounds for 
transportation conformity purposes.
    (x) Approval--On December 18, 1997, Illinois submitted a contingency 
measure plan as part of the Chicago Area post-1996 Rate of Progress 
Plan. This plan reduces volatile organic compound emissions in the 
Chicago ozone nonattainment area by 3 percent from 1990 baseline 
emissions by November 15, 1999.
    (y) Approval--On December 18, 1997, Illinois submitted 
Transportation Control Measures (TCMs) as part of the post-1996 Rate Of 
Progress Plan for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The TCMs being 
approved are listed in the following documents published by the Chicago 
Area Transportation Study: ``Transportation Control Measures 
Contribution to the Post-1996 Rate-Of-Progress State Implementation 
Plan,'' March 22, 1996; ``Transportation Control Measures Contribution 
to the 9 percent Control Strategy State Implementation Plan,'' June 11, 
1998; and ``1999 Transportation Control Measures Contribution to the 9 
percent Rate of Progress Control Strategy State Implementation Plan,'' 
December 9, 1999.
    (z) Negative declaration--Industrial cleaning solvents category. On 
December 23, 1999, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction 
of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major 
sources categorized as part of the industrial cleaning solvents category 
are located in the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The Chicago ozone 
nonattainment area includes Cook County, DuPage County, Aux Sable and 
Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County, Kane County, Oswego Township in 
Kendall County, Lake County, McHenry County and Will County.
    (aa) Negative declaration--Industrial wastewater category. On 
December 23, 1999, the State of Illinois certified to the satisfaction 
of the United States Environmental Protection Agency that no major 
sources categorized as part of the Industrial Wastewater Category are 
located in the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. The Chicago ozone 
nonattainment area includes Cook County, DuPage County, Aux Sable and 
Goose Lake Townships in Grundy County, Kane County, Oswego Township in 
Kendall County, Lake County, McHenry County and Will County.
    (bb) Approval--Revisions to the SIP submitted by Illinois on 
November 15, 1999; February 10, 2000; April 13, 2001; and April 30, 
2001. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the attainment 
demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Act for the 
Metro-East St. Louis area. The revision establishes an attainment date 
of November 15, 2004, for the St. Louis moderate ozone nonattainment 
area. This revision establishes MVEBs for 2004 of 26.62 TPD of VOC and 
35.52 TPD of NO<INF>X</INF> to be used in transportation conformity in 
the Metro-East St. Louis area until revised budgets pursuant to MOBILE6 
are submitted and found adequate. In the revision, Illinois commits to 
revise its VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> transportation conformity budgets 
within two years of the release of MOBILE6. No conformity determinations 
will be made during the second year following the release of MOBILE6 
unless and until the MVEBs have been recalculated using MOBILE6 and 
found adequate by EPA. EPA is granting a waiver for the Metro East St. 
Louis area to the state of Illinois from the NO<INF>X</INF> RACT 
requirements of the Act and disapproving the request for a waiver from 
the NO<INF>X</INF> NSR and NO<INF>X</INF> general conformity 
requirements. EPA is finding that the Contingency Measures identified by 
Illinois are adequate to meet the requirements of the Act. EPA finds 
that the Illinois SIP meets the requirements pertaining to RACM under 
the Act for the Metro-East St. Louis area.
    (cc) Approval--Illinois has adopted and USEPA has approved 
sufficient NO<INF>X</INF> emission regulations to assure that it will 
achieve the level of NO<INF>X</INF> emissions budgeted for the State by 
USEPA. USEPA has made two minor budget revisions requested by Illinois, 
adding a boiler owned by LTV Steel

[[Page 527]]

and deleting a boiler owned by the University of Illinois from the 
inventory of large NO<INF>X</INF> sources.
    (dd) Chicago Ozone Attainment Demonstration Approval--On December 
26, 2000, Illinois submitted a one-hour ozone attainment demonstration 
plan as a requested revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan. 
This plan includes: A modeled demonstration of attainment and associated 
attainment year conformity emission budgets; a plan to reduce ozone 
precursor emissions by 3 percent per year from 2000 to 2007 (a post-1999 
rate-of-progress plan), and associated conformity emission budgets; a 
contingency measures plan for both the ozone attainment demonstration 
and the post-1999 rate-of-progress plan; a commitment to conduct a Mid-
Course Review of the ozone attainment demonstration by the end of 2004; 
a demonstration that Illinois has implemented all reasonably available 
control measures; and a commitment to revise motor vehicle emission 
budgets within two years after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
officially releases the MOBILE6 emission factor model.
    (ee) Approval of the Maintenance Plan for the Illinois Portion of 
the St. Louis Area--On December 30, 2002 Illinois submitted Maintenance 
Plan for the Illinois portion of the St. Louis Nonattainment Area. The 
plan includes 2014 On-Road Motor Vehicle Emission Budget of 10.13 tons 
per ozone season weekday of VOCs and 18.72 tons per ozone season weekday 
NO<INF>X</INF> to be used in transportation conformity.
    (ff) Approval--On April 11, 2003, Illinois submitted a revision to 
the ozone attainment plan for the Chicago severe 1-hour ozone 
nonattainment area. This plan revised the 2005 and 2007 Motor Vehicle 
Emissions Budgets (MVEB) recalculated using the emissions factor model 
MOBILE6. The approved motor vehicle emissions budgets are 151.11 tons 
per day VOC for 2005 and 127.42 tons per day VOC and 280.4 tons per day 
NO<INF>X</INF> for 2007.
    (gg) Approval--On January 30, 2007, the Illinois Environmental 
Protection Agency (IEPA) requested that EPA find that the Illinois 
portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County, Illinois-Indiana (IL-IN) 
nonattainment area, attained the revoked 1-hour ozone National Ambient 
Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). After review of this submission, EPA 
approves this finding.

    (iii) Capture system efficiency test protocols--(A) Applicability. 
The requirements of paragraphs (a)(4)(iii)(B) of this section shall 
apply to all VOM emitting processes employing capture equipment (e.g., 
hoods, ducts), except those cases noted below.
    (1) If a source installs a permanent total enclosure (PTE) that 
meets USEPA specifications, and which directs all VOM to a control 
device, then the source is exempted from the requirements described in 
paragraph (B). The USEPA specifications to determine whether a structure 
is considered a PTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of this 
section. In this instance, the capture efficiency is assumed to be 100 
percent and the source is still required to measure control efficiency 
using appropriate test methods as specified in (a)(4)(iv) of this 
section.
    (2) If a source uses a control device designed to collect and 
recover VOM (e.g., carbon adsorber), an explicit measurement of capture 
efficiency is not necessary provided that the conditions given below are 
met. The overall control of the system can be determined by directly 
comparing the input liquid VOM to the recovered liquid VOM. The general 
procedure for use in this situation is given in 40 CFR 60.433, with the 
following additional restrictions:
    (i) The source must be able to equate solvent usage with solvent 
recovery on a 24-hour (daily) basis, rather than a 30-day weighted 
average, within 72 hours following the 24-hour period. In addition, one 
of the following two criteria must be met:
    (ii) The solvent recovery system (i.e., capture and control system) 
must be dedicated to a single process line (e.g., one process line 
venting to a carbon adsorber system), or
    (iii) If the solvent recovery system controls multiple process 
lines, then the source must be able to demonstrate that the overall 
control (i.e., the total recovered solvent VOM divided by the sum of 
liquid VOM input to all process lines venting to the control system) 
meets or exceeds the most stringent standard applicable for any process 
line venting to the control system.
    (B) Specific requirements. The capture efficiency of a process line 
shall be measured using one of the four protocols given below. Any error 
margin associated with a test protocol may not be incorporated into the 
results of a capture efficiency test. If these techniques are not 
suitable for a particular process, then the source must present an 
alternative capture efficiency protocol and obtain approval for it by 
the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revisions.
    (1) Gas/gas method using temporary total enclosure (TTE). The USEPA 
specifications to determine whether a temporary enclosure is considered 
a TTE are given in Procedure T of appendix B of this section. The 
capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is:

CE = Gw / (GW + Fw)

Where:

CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
Gw=mass of VOM captured and delivered to control device using a TTE.
Fw=mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from a TTE.


Procedure G.2 contained in appendix B of this section is used to obtain 
Gw. Procedure F.1 in appendix B of this section is used to obtain Fw.
    (2) Liquid/gas method using TTE. The USEPA specifications to 
determine whether a temporary enclosure is considered a TTE are given in 
Procedure T

[[Page 547]]

of appendix B of this section. The capture efficiency equation to be 
used for this protocol is:

CE = (L - F) / L

Where:

CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
L=mass of liquid VOM input to process.
Fw=mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from a TTE.


Procedure L contained in appendix B of this section is used to obtain L. 
Procedure F.1 in appendix B of this section is used to obtain Fw.
    (3) Gas/gas method using the building or room (building or room 
enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and 
in which ``F'' and ``G'' are measured while operating only the affected 
facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated 
as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation 
to be used for this protocol is:

CE = G / (G + F<INF>B</INF>)

Where:

CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
G=mass of VOM captured and delivered to control device.
F<INF>B</INF>=mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from building enclosure.


Procedure G.2 contained in appendix B of this section is used to obtain 
G. Procedure F.2 in appendix B of this section is used to obtain 
F<INF>B</INF>.
    (4) Liquid/gas method using the building or room (building or room 
enclosure) in which the affected source is located as the enclosure and 
in which ``F'' and ``L'' are measured while operating only the affected 
facility. All fans and blowers in the building or room must be operated 
as they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation 
to be used for this protocol is:

CE = (L - F<INF>B</INF>) / L

Where:

CE=capture efficiency, decimal fraction.
L=mass of liquid VOM input to process.
F<INF>B</INF>=mass of fugitive VOM that escapes from building enclosure.


Procedure L contained in appendix B of this section is used to obtain L. 
Procedure F.2 in appendix B of this section is used to obtain 
F<INF>B</INF>.
    (C) Recordkeeping and reporting. (1) All affected facilities must 
maintain a copy of the capture efficiency protocol submitted to USEPA on 
file. All results of the appropriate test methods and capture efficiency 
protocols must be reported to USEPA within sixty (60) days of the test 
date. A copy of the results must be kept on file with the source for a 
period of three (3) years.
    (2) If any changes are made to capture or control equipment, then 
the source is required to notify USEPA of these changes and a new test 
may be required by USEPA.
    (3) The source must notify the Administrator 30 days prior to 
performing any capture efficiency or control test. At that time, the 
source must notify the Administrator which capture efficiency protocol 
and control device test methods will be used.
    (4) Sources utilizing a PTE must demonstrate that this enclosure 
meets the requirement given in Procedure T (in appendix B of this 
section) for a PTE during any testing of their control device.
    (5) Sources utilizing a TTE must demonstrate that their TTE meets 
the requirements given in Procedure T (in appendix B of this section) 
for a TTE during testing of their control device. The source must also 
provide documentation that the quality assurance criteria for a TTE have 
been achieved.
    (iv) Control device efficiency testing and monitoring. (A) The 
control device efficiency shall be determined by simultaneously 
measuring the inlet and outlet gas phase VOM concentrations and gas 
volumetric flow rates in accordance with the gas phase test methods 
specified in paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of this section.
    (B) Any owner or operator that uses an afterburner or carbon 
adsorber to comply with any paragraph of Sec. 52.741 shall use USEPA 
approved continuous monitoring equipment which is installed, calibrated, 
maintained, and operated according to vendor specifications at all times 
the afterburner or carbon adsorber is in use. The continuous monitoring 
equipment must monitor the following parameters:
    (1) Combustion chamber temperature of each afterburner.

[[Page 548]]

    (2) Temperature rise across each catalytic afterburner bed or VOM 
concentration of exhaust.
    (3) The VOM concentration of each carbon adsorption bed exhaust.
    (v) Overall efficiency. (A) The overall efficiency of the emission 
control system shall be determined as the product of the capture system 
efficiency and the control device efficiency or by the liquid/liquid 
test protocol as specified in 40 CFR 60.433 (and revised by paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii)(A)(2) of this section for each solvent recovery system. In 
those cases in which the overall efficiency is being determined for an 
entire line, the capture efficiency used to calculate the product of the 
capture and control efficiency is the total capture efficiency over the 
entire line.
    (B) For coating lines which are both chosen by the owner or operator 
to comply with paragraphs (e)(2)(ii), (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(iv), 
(e)(2)(v), or (e)(2)(vi) of this section by the alternative in paragraph 
(e)(2)(i)(B) of this section and meet the criteria allowing them to 
comply with paragraph (e)(2) of this section instead of paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section, the overall efficiency of the capture system and 
control device, as determined by the test methods and procedures 
specified in paragraphs (a)(4) (iii), (iv) and (v)(A) of this section, 
shall be no less than the equivalent overall efficiency which shall be 
calculated by the following equation:

E = ([VOM<INF>a</INF> - VOM<INF>1</INF>]/VOM<INF>a</INF>) x 100

Where:

E = Equivalent overall efficiency of the capture system and control 
device as a percentage,
VOM<INF>a</INF> = Actual VOM content of a coating, or the daily-weighted 
average VOM content of two or more coatings (if more than one coating is 
used), as applied to the subject coating line as determined by the 
applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) 
of this section in units of kg VOM/l (lb VOM/gal) of coating solids as 
applied,
VOM<INF>1</INF> = The VOM emission limit specified in paragraph (e)(2) 
(i) or (ii) of this section in units of kg VOM/l (lb VOM/gal) of coating 
solids as applied.

    (vi) Volatile organic material gas phase source test methods. The 
methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, delineated below shall be used to 
determine control device efficiencies.
    (A) 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 18, 25 or 25A, as appropriate 
to the conditions at the site, shall be used to determine VOM 
concentration. Method selection shall be based on consideration of the 
diversity of organic species present and their total concentration and 
on consideration of the potential presence of interfering gases. Except 
as indicated in paragraphs (a)(4)(vi)(A)(1) and (2) of this section, the 
test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 60 
min, unless the Administrator determines that process variables dictate 
shorter sampling times.
    (1) When the method is to be used to determine the efficiency of a 
carbon adsoption system with a common exhaust stack for all the 
individual adsorber vessels, the test shall consist of three separate 
runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the 
adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels.
    (2) When the method is to be used to determine the efficiency of a 
carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each 
adsorber vessel, each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The 
test for each adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each 
run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.

acceptance, provided that the operation of the source is not an integral 
part of the production process, the emissions of VOM from the source do 
not exceed 363 kg (800 lbs) in any calendar month, and the exemption had 
been approved in writing by the Illinois Environmental Protection 
Agency.
    (3) Test methods. The following test methods shall be used to 
demonstrate compliance with subpart E (sections 215.182-215.184) of 35 
Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR

plants. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, no 
owner or operator of a coating line shall apply at any time any coating 
in which the VOM content exceeds the following emission limitations for 
the specified coating. The following emission limitations are expressed 
in units of VOM per volume of coating (minus water and any compounds 
which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) as applied 
at each coating applicator, except where noted. Compounds which are 
specifically exempted from the definition of VOM should be treated as 
water for the purpose of calculating the ``less water'' part of the 
coating composition. Compliance with this paragraph must be demonstrated 
through the applicable coating analysis test methods and procedures 
specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this

[[Page 552]]

section. As an alternative to compliance with this paragraph, the owner 
or operator of a coating line may meet the requirements of paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) or paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The equation presented 
in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section shall be used to calculate 
emission limitations for determining compliance by add-on controls, 
credits for transfer efficiency, emissions trades and cross-line 
averaging.

(iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii) of this section (depending upon the 
source category) through the applicable coating analysis and capture 
system and control device efficiency test methods and procedures 
specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this 
section; and the control device is equipped with the applicable 
monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section 
and the monitoring equipment is installed, calibrated, operated and 
maintained according to vendor specifications at all times the control 
device is in use. The use of a capture system and control device, which 
does not demonstrate compliance with paragraph (e)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), 
(v), (vi), or (vii), may only be used as an alternative to compliance 
with paragraph (e)(1) of this section if approved as a FIP revision.
    (i) Alternative add-on control methodologies. (A) The coating line 
is equipped with a capture system and control device that provides 81 
percent reduction in the overall emissions of VOM from the coating line 
and the control device has a 90 percent efficiency, or
    (B) The system used to control VOM from the coating line is 
demonstrated to have an overall efficiency sufficient to limit VOM 
emissions to no more than what is allowed under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section. Use of any control system other than an afterburner, carbon 
absorption, condensation, or absorption scrubber system can only be 
allowed if approved by the Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. 
Transfer efficiency credits can only be allowed if approved by the 
Administrator as a SIP or FIP revision. Baseline transfer efficiencies 
and transfer efficiency test methods must be approved by the 
Administrator.
    Such overall efficiency is to be determined as follows:
    (1) Obtain the emission limitation from the appropriate paragraph in 
(e)(1) of this section,
    (2) Calculate ``S'' according to the equation in paragraph 
(e)(1)(iii) of this section,
    (3) Calculate the overall efficiency required according to paragraph 
(a)(4)(v) of this section. For the purposes of calculating this value,

coating line in Cook County which applies one or more coatings during 
the same day, all of which are subject to the same numerical emission 
limitation within paragraph (e)(1)(i)(M) of this section (e.g., all 
coatings used on the line are subject to 0.42 kg/l [3.5 lbs/gals]), and 
which is equipped with a capture system and control device shall operate 
the subject coating line unless the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i) 
(A) or (B) of this section are met.

This is the overall efficiency of the capture system and control device.

    (B) The coating line is equipped with a capture system and control 
device

[[Page 557]]

that provide 75 percent reduction in the overall emissions of VOM from 
the coating line and the control device has a 90 percent efficiency.
    (3) Exemptions from emission limitations--(i) Exemptions for all 
source categories except wood furniture coating. The limitations of 
paragraph (e) of this section shall not apply to coating lines within a 
facility, that otherwise would be subject to the same subparagraph of 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section (because they belong to the same 
source category, e.g. can coating), provided that combined actual 
emissions of VOM from all lines at the facility subject to that 
subparagraph never exceed 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application 
of capture systems and control devices. (For example, can coating lines 
within a plant would not be subject to the limitations of subparagraph 
(e)(1)(i)(B) of this section if the combined actual emissions of VOM 
from the can coating lines never exceed 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before 
the application of capture systems and control devices.) Volatile 
organic material emissions from heavy off-highway vehicle products 
coating lines must be combined with VOM emissions from miscellaneous 
metal parts and products coating lines to determine applicability. Any 
owner or operator of a coating facility shall comply with the applicable 
coating analysis test methods and procedures specified in paragraph 
(a)(4)(i) of this section and the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements specified in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section if total 
VOM emissions from the subject coating lines are always less than or 
equal to 6.8 kg/day (15 lbs/day) before the application of capture 
systems and control devices and, therefore, are not subject to the 
limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Once a category of 
coating lines at a facility is subject to the limitations in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, the coating lines are always subject to the 
limitations in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Applicability for wood furniture coating. (A) The limitations 
of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply to a plant's wood furniture 
coating lines if the plant contains process emission sources, not 
regulated by paragraphs (d), (e) (excluding paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L)), (h) 
(excluding paragraph (h)(5)), (i), (j), or (q)(1), or subparts B, Q 
(excluding sections 215.432 and 215.436), R (excluding sections 215.447, 
215.450, and 215.452), S, V, X, Y (sections 215.582-215.584), or Z of 35 
Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as specified in 40 CFR 
52.742), which as a group both:
    (1) Have maximum theoretical emissions of 91 Mg (100 tons) or more 
per calendar year of VOM if no air pollution control equipment were 
used, and
    (2) Are not limited to less than 91 Mg (100 tons) of VOM per 
calendar year if no air pollution control equipment were used, through 
production or capacity limitations contained in a federally enforceable 
construction permit or SIP or FIP version.
    (B) If a plant ceases to fulfill the criteria of paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) 
of this section shall continue to apply to any wood furniture coating 
line which was ever subject to the limitations of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(L) 
of this section.
    (C) For the purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, an 
emission source shall be considered regulated by a subpart (of the 
Illinois rules), section, or paragraph if it is subject to the 
limitations of that subpart (of the Illinois rules), section, or 
paragraph. An emission source is not considered regulated by a subpart 
(of the Illinois rules), section, or paragraph if its emissions are 
below the applicability cutoff level or if the source is covered by an 
exemption.
    (D) Any owner or operator of a wood furniture coating line to which 
the limitations of paragraph (e) of this section are not applicable due 
to the criteria in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section shall, upon 
request by the Administrator, submit records to the Administrator within 
30 calendar days from the date of the request that document that the 
coating line is exempt from the limitations of paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (4) Exemption from general rule on use of organic material. No owner 
or operator of a coating line subject to the limitations of paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section is required to meet the limitations of subpart K 
(section 215.301 or

[[Page 558]]

215.302) of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 215 (incorporated by reference as 
specified in 40 CFR 52.742), after the date by which the coating line is 
required to meet paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

with, and continues to comply with, paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section. 
Wood furniture coating lines are not subject to paragraph (e)(6)(i) of 
this section.
    (ii) No owner or operator of a coating line complying by means of 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section shall operate said coating line on

\a\ Tank not in use.

    (B) The throughput shall be calculated as follows:
    (1) Compute the monthly throughput for each tank by the 15th day of 
the following month.
    (2) By the 15th day of each month, add the monthly throughputs for 
the 12 previous months to obtain the yearly throughput.
    (ii) Recordkeeping. (A) On and after October 1, 1992, the owner and 
operator of the Nalco Chemical Company facility in Bedford Park, 
Illinois, shall keep the following records for all storage tanks. These 
records shall be compiled on a monthly basis, be retained at the 
facility for a period of 3 years, and be made available to the 
Administrator upon request.
    (1) The molecular weight of vapor in each storage tank 
(M<INF>v</INF>), the true vapor pressure at bulk liquid conditions for 
each tank (P), the paint factor (F<INF>p</INF>), and their product. 
F<INF>p</INF> shall be determined from Table 4.3-1 of ``Compilation of 
Air Pollutant Emission Factors, Volume I: Stationary Point and Area 
Sources,'' AP-42, September 1985.
    (2) The monthly throughput.
    (3) The total throughput per year for the 12 previous months.
    (B) [Reserved]

X<INF>b</INF>=Mole fraction of pure component b in the liquid; and
P<INF>t</INF>=P<INF>a</INF> X<INF>2=</INF> P<INF>b</INF> X<INF>b</INF>.

    (11) The control requirements in this paragraph apply to the 
fugitive emission sources listed in paragraph (x)(11)(i)(A) of this 
section at the Nalco Chemical Company facility in Bedfore Park, 
Illinois, instead of the control requirements in paragraph (x)(3) of 
this section.
    (i) Production and Operation Restrictions.
    (A) On and after October 1, 1992, all components (e.g., pumps, 
valves, flanges, pressure relief valves (PRV's), and open end lines) at 
the specified locations (e.g., Building 32--Tube Reactor System, etc.), 
and in the specified type of service (e.g., heavy liquid stratified, 
light liquid stratified, etc.) shall be limited by the maximum monthly 
hours in the following table:
    (ii) Recordkeeping.
    (A) On and after October 1, 1992, the owner and operator of the 
Nalco Chemical Company facility in Bedford Park, Illinois, shall keep 
the following records for all fugitive emission sources. These records 
shall be compiled on a monthly basis, be retained at the facility for a 
period of 3 years, and be made available to the Administrator upon 
request.
    (1) The total number of hours of organic service for each component 
at each location specified in paragraphs (x)(11)(i)(A) (1) through (10) 
of this section.
    (2) The vapor pressure of each organic compound in each component at 
each location specified in paragraphs (x)(11)(i)(A) (1) through (10) of 
this section.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (12) The control and recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as 
well as the test methods in this paragraph, apply to the gravure and 
screen press operations at the Meyercord Corporation (Meyercord) in 
Carol Stream, Illinois, instead of the requirements in paragraphs (x)(1) 
through (x)(5) of this section.
    (i) After July 1, 1991, no materials which contain volatile organic 
material (VOM), including coatings, inks, and cleaning material, may be 
used at any gravure or screen press unless the total VOM emissions 
remain below 100 tons of VOM for every consecutive 365-day period, or 
fraction thereof, starting on July 1, 1991. A new 365-day period starts 
on each day. The VOM emissions, which are to be calculated on a daily 
basis, are to be added to the VOM emissions for the prior 364 days (but 
not including any day prior to July 1, 1991). VOM emissions are based 
upon the VOM content of the material and the volume of material used. 
The effect of add-on control equipment is not considered in calculating 
VOM emissions; that is, the VOM emissions are to be determined as if the 
press(es) do(es) not have add-on control equipment. The applicable test 
methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section are 
to be used in determining daily VOM emissions.
    (ii) The VOM content of each coating, ink, and cleaning solution 
shall be determined by the applicable test methods and procedures 
specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to establish the records 
required under paragraph (x)(12)(ii) of this section. Beginning on July 
1, 1991, the owner or operator of the subject presses shall collect and 
record all of the following information

[[Page 596]]

each day and maintain the information at the facility for 3 years:
    (A) The name and identification number of each coating, ink, and 
cleaning solution as applied on any press.
    (B) The pounds (lbs) of VOM per gallon of each coating, ink, and 
cleaning solution (minus water and any compounds which are specifically 
exempted from the definition of VOM) as applied on any press.
    (C) The total gallons of each coating, ink, and cleaning solution 
(minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the 
definition of VOM) used per day.
    (D) The total lbs of VOM contained in the volume of each coating, 
ink, and cleaning solution used per day on any press. The lbs of VOM per 
day is to be calculated by multiplying the lbs of VOM per gallon (minus 
water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the 
definition of VOM) times the gallons (minus water and any compounds 
which are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) used per 
day.
    (E) The total lbs of VOM per day from all coatings, inks, and 
cleaning solutions used on all presses. The total lbs of VOM per day is 
to be obtained by adding the lbs of VOM per day contained in all 
coatings, inks, and cleaning solutions.
    (F) Within 7 days after each 365-day period, the VOM emissions (as 
calculated in paragraph (x)(12)(ii)(E)) of this section before add-on 
control, from the 365-day period, are to be determined.
    Starting on July 7, 1992, VOM emissions are to be determined for the 
365 days ending 7 days earlier. Each day concludes a new 365-day period. 
However, no VOM emissions are to be included for any days prior to July 
1, 1991. For example, on July 17, 1991, the emissions from July 1, 
through July 10, 1991, are to be included, whereas on January 7, 1994, 
the emissions from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993, are to be 
included.
    (13) The control and recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as 
well as the test methods in this paragraph, apply to the sheet fed cold 
set presses and web heatset presses at the Wallace Computer Services, 
Inc. (Wallace) printing and binding plant in Hillside, Illinois, instead 
of the requirements in 40 CFR 52.741(h) and 40 CFR 52.741(x)(1) through 
40 CFR 52.741(x)(5).
    (i) After July 1, 1991, no inks shall at any time be applied, at the 
presses indicated below, which exceed the pounds (lbs) volatile organic 
material (VOM) per gallon of ink (minus water and any compounds which 
are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) limit established 
for each press. After July 1, 1991, the yearly volume of ink used at 
each press, in gallons of ink (minus water and any compounds which are 
specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) per year, shall not 
exceed the gallons per year limit established below for each press. The 
yearly volume of ink used per press is to be calculated according to the 
procedure in paragraph (x)(13)(iii) of this section.

    (ii) After July 1, 1991, no materials (other than those inks subject 
to the limits in paragraph (x)(13)(i)) of this section, shall at any 
time be applied or used, at the presses indicated below, which exceed 
the lbs VOM per gallon of material (minus water and any compounds which 
are specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) limit established 
for each press. After July 1, 1991, the yearly volume of material 
(excluding ink and water) used at each press, in gallons of material 
(minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the 
definition of VOM) per year, shall not exceed the gallons per year limit 
established for each press. The yearly volume of material (excluding ink 
and water) used per press is to be calculated according to the procedure 
in paragraph (x)(13)(iii) of this section.

    (iii) The yearly volume of ink/material used is to be calculated as 
follows:
    (A) Compute the volume of ink/material used each month per press by 
the 15th of the following month.
    (B) By the 15th of each month, add the monthly ink/material usage 
per press for the 12 previous months (to obtain the yearly volume of ink 
used).
    (iv) Beginning on July 1, 1991, the owner and operator of Wallace's 
plant in Hillside, Illinois, shall keep the following records for each 
press for each month. All records shall be retained by Wallace for 3 
years and shall be made available to the Administrator on request:
    (A) The name and identification number of each ink, fountain 
solution, fountain solution additive, cleaning solvent, and other VOM 
containing material as applied or used.
    (B) The weight of VOM per volume of each ink, fountain solution, 
fountain solution additive, cleaning solvent, and each other VOM 
containing material (minus water and any compounds which are 
specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) as applied or used 
each month.
    (C) The volume of ink (minus water and any compounds which are 
specifically exempted from the definition of VOM) as applied each month.
    (D) The total volume of miscellaneous VOM containing materials 
(minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the 
definition of VOM), other than inks, that are used each month.
    (v) Any record showing a violation of paragraph (x)(13)(i) or 
(x)(13)(ii) of this section shall be reported by sending a copy of such 
record to the Administrator within 30 days of the violation.
    (vi) To determine compliance with paragraphs (x)(13)(i) and 
(x)(13)(ii) of this section and to establish the records required under 
paragraph (x)(13)(iv) of this section the VOM content of each ink and 
miscellaneous VOM containing material shall be determined by the 
applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section.
    (14) The control and recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as 
well as the test methods in this paragraph, apply to the power-operated 
silk screen presses, the hand screen presses, the screen adhesive 
printing lines, the Andreotti rotogravure press, the Halley Rotogravure 
press, and the Viking press at the American Decal and Manufacturing 
Company's plant in Chicago, Illinois, instead of the requirements in 
paragraphs (h) and (x)(1) through (x)(5) of this section. The emissions 
from the sources listed above (in paragraph (x)(14) of this section) are 
to be included in the calculation of ``maximum theoretical emissions'' 
for determining applicability for any other sources (for which 
applicability is based on the quantity of maximum theoretical emissions) 
at American Decal and Manufacturing Company's Chicago plant not included 
in paragraph (x)(14) of this section.
    (i) After July 24, 1992, no inks, coatings, thinner, clean-up 
material or other VOC-containing material shall at any time be applied, 
at the presses/printing lines listed above (in paragraph (x)(14) of this 
section), which exceed the VOC content (in percent by weight VOC) limit 
established below. After July 24, 1992, the yearly usage (in weight of 
material applied) of ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other 
VOC-containing material, shall not exceed the applicable pounds per year 
limit established below. The yearly weight of ink, coating, thinner, 
clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material is to be calculated 
according to the procedure in paragraph (x)(14)(ii) of this section.

    (ii) The yearly weight of material used is to be calculated as 
follows:
    (A) Compute the weight of each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up 
material, and other VOC-containing material used each month by the 15th 
of the following month.
    (B) By the 15th of each month, add the monthly usage (in pounds) for 
each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing 
material for the twelve previous months (to obtain the yearly weight of 
each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up material used). A comparison of 
these yearly usage levels (in pounds) with purchase records must be made 
to ensure the accuracy of the monthly usage levels (in pounds) obtained 
to satisfy paragraph (x)(14)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (iii) Beginning on August 1, 1992, the owner and operator of the

records shall be kept by the American Decal and Manufacturing Company 
for 3 years and shall be made available to the Administrator on request:
    (A) The name and identification number of each ink, coating, 
thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material as applied 
or used.
    (B) The weight percent VOC of each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up 
material, and each other VOC-containing material as applied or used each 
month.
    (C) The as applied weight of each ink, coating, thinner, clean-up 
material, and other VOC-containing material used each month.
    (iv) Any record showing a violation of paragraph (x)(14)(i) of this 
section after October 20, 1995 shall be reported by sending a copy of 
such record to the Administrator within 30 days of the violation.
    (v) To determine compliance with paragraph (x)(14)(i) of this 
section and to establish the records required under paragraph 
(x)(14)(iii) of this section, the weight percent VOC of each ink, 
coating, thinner, clean-up material, and other VOC-containing material 
shall be determined by the applicable test methods and procedures 
specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Any material reported to 
be 100 percent VOC does not have to be tested for weight percent VOC.
    (y) Recordkeeping and reporting for non-CTG sources--(1) Exempt 
emission sources. Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or 
operator of an emission source which is exempt from the requirements of

requirements of paragraphs (u) or (x) of this section and complying by 
means of the daily-weighted average VOM content limitation shall comply 
with the following:
    (A) By July 1, 1991, or upon initial start-up of a coating line 
subject to paragraph (u) or (x) of this section; the owner or operator 
of the subject coating line shall certify to the Administrator that the 
coating line will be in compliance on and after July 1, 1991, or on and 
after the initial start-up date. Such certification shall include:
    (1) The name and identification number of each coating line which 
will comply by means of the daily-weighted average VOM content 
limitation.
    (2) The name and identification number of each coating as applied on 
each coating line.
    (3) The weight of VOM per volume and the volume of each coating 
(minus water and any compounds which are specifically exempted from the 
definition of VOM) as applied each day on each coating line.

   Appendix B to Sec. 52.741--VOM Measurement Techniques for Capture 
                               Efficiency

                  Procedure G.1--Captured VOC Emissions

                             1. Introduction

    1.1 Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
volatile organic compounds (VOC) content of captured gas streams. It is 
intended to be used as a segment in the development of liquid/gas or 
gas/gas protocols for determining VOC capture efficiency (CE) for 
surface coating and printing operations. The procedure may not be 
acceptable in certain site-specific situations, e.g., when: (1) Direct 
fired heaters or other circumstances affect the quantity of VOC at the 
control device inlet; and (2) particulate organic aerosols are formed in 
the process and are present in the captured emissions.
    1.2 Principle. The amount of VOC captured (G) is calculated as the 
sum of the products of the VOC content (C<INF>Gj</INF>), the flow rate 
(Q<INF>Gj</INF>), and the sample time (T<INF>C</INF>) from each captured 
emissions point.
    1.3 Estimated measurement uncertainty. The measurement uncertainties 
are estimated for each captured or fugitive emissions point as follows: 
Q<INF>Gj</INF>=<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.5 percent and 
C<INF>Gj</INF>=<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.0 percent. Based on these 
numbers, the probable uncertainty for G is estimated at about <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>7.4 percent.
    1.4 Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5 Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly 
explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing 
appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of 
trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas 
concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

                        2. Apparatus and Reagents

    2.1 Gas VOC concentration. A schematic of the measurement system is 
shown in Figure 1. The main components are described below:
    2.1.1 Sample probe. Stainless steel, or equivalent. The probe shall 
be heated to prevent VOC condensation.
    2.1.2 Calibration valve assembly. Three-way valve assembly at the 
outlet of sample probe to direct the zero and calibration gases to the 
analyzer. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route 
calibration gases to the outlet of the sample probe are acceptable.
    2.1.3 Sample line. Stainless steel or Teflon tubing to transport the 
sample gas to the analyzer. The sample line must be heated to prevent 
condensation.
    2.1.4 Sample pump. A lead-free pump, to pull the sample gas through 
the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of 
the measurement system. The components of the pump that contact the gas 
stream shall be constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. The sample 
pump must be heated to prevent condensation.
    2.1.5 Sample flow rate control. A sample flow rate control valve and 
rotameter, or equivalent, to maintain a constant sampling rate within 10 
percent. The flow rate control valve and rotameter must be heated to 
prevent condensation. A control valve may also be located on the sample 
pump bypass loop to assist in controlling the sample pressure and flow 
rate.
    2.1.6 Sample gas manifold. Capable of diverting a portion of the 
sample gas stream to the flame ionization analyzer (FIA), and the 
remainder to the bypass discharge vent. The manifold components shall be 
constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. If captured or fugitive 
emissions are to be measured at multiple locations, the measurement 
system shall be designed to use separate sampling probes, lines, and 
pumps for each measurement location and a common sample gas manifold and 
FIA. The sample gas manifold and connecting lines to the FIA must be 
heated to prevent condensation.
    2.1.7 Organic concentration analyzer. An FIA with a span value of 
1.5 times the expected concentration as propane; however, other span 
values may be used if it can be demonstrated that they would provide 
more accurate measurements.
    The system shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the following 
specifications:
    2.1.7.1 Zero drift. Less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.0 percent of 
the span value.
    2.1.7.2 Calibration drift. Less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.0 
percent of the span value.
    2.1.7.3 Calibration error. Less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.0 
percent of the calibration gas value.
    2.1.7.4 Response time. Less than 30 seconds.
    2.1.8 Integrator/data acquisition system. An analog or digital 
device or computerized

[[Page 604]]

data acquisition system used to integrate the FIA response or compute 
the average response and record measurement data. The minimum data 
sampling frequency for computing average or integrated values is one 
measurement value every 5 seconds. The device shall be capable of 
recording average values at least once per minute.
    2.1.9 Calibration and other gases. Gases used for calibration, fuel, 
and combustion air (if required) are contained in compressed gas 
cylinders. All calibration gases shall be traceable to NIST standards 
and shall be certified by the manufacturer to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 
percent of the tag value. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder 
should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas 
cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent from the certified value. For calibration gas 
values not generally available, alternative methods for preparing 
calibration gas mixtures, such as dilution systems, may be used with 
prior approval.
    2.1.9.1 Fuel. A 40 percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent He or 40 percent 
H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent N<INF>2</INF> gas mixture is recommended to 
avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs when oxygen 
concentration varies significantly from a mean value.
    2.1.9.2 Carrier gas. High purity air with less than 1 ppm of organic 
material (as propane or carbon equivalent) or less than 0.1 percent of 
the span value, whichever is greater.
    2.1.9.3 FIA Linearity calibration gases. Low-, mid-, and high-range 
gas mixture standards with nominal propane concentrations of 20-30, 45-
55, and 70-80 percent of the span value in air, respectively. Other 
calibration values and other span values may be used if it can be shown 
that more accurate measurements would be achieved.
    2.1.10 Particulate filter. An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass 
fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is 
significant. An out-of-stack filter must be heated to prevent any 
condensation unless it can be demonstrated that no condensation occurs.
    2.2 Captured emissions volumetric flow rate.
    2.2.1 Method 2 or 2A apparatus. For determining volumetric flow 
rate.
    2.2.2 Method 3 apparatus and reagents. For determining molecular 
weight of the gas stream. An estimate of the molecular weight of the gas 
stream may be used if it can be justified.
    2.2.3 Method 4 apparatus and reagents. For determining moisture 
content, if necessary.

     3. Determinations of Volumetric Flow Rate of Captured Emissions

    3.1 Locate all points where emissions are captured from the affected 
facility. Using Method 1, determine the sampling points. Be sure to 
check each site for cyclonic or swirling flow.
    3.2 Measure the velocity at each sampling site at least once every 
hour during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A.

         4. Determinations of VOC Content of Captured Emissions

    4.1 Analysis duration. Measure the VOC responses at each captured 
emissions point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the 
process is operating. If there are multiple captured emission locations, 
design a sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to determine 
the VOC responses at all sampling locations.
    4.2 Gas VOC concentration.
    4.2.1 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the 
FIA according to the procedure in section 5.1.
    4.2.2 Conduct a system check according to the procedure in section 
5.3.
    4.2.3 Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally 
located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack 
port connection.
    4.2.4 Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Allow the 
measurement system response to reach zero. Measure the system response 
time as the time required for the system to reach the effluent 
concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to the 
effluent sampling position.
    4.2.5 Conduct a system check before and a system check after each 
sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. If the 
drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, the run 
is not valid. The tester may elect to perform system drift checks during 
the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.
    4.2.6 Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures 
are 120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]C.
    4.2.7 Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue to 
sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times and 
any required process information as appropriate. If multiple captured 
emission locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at each 
location for the same amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) and continue to 
switch from one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure 
that total sampling time at each location is the same at the end of the 
test run. Collect at least 4 separate measurements from each sample 
point during each hour of testing. Disregard the measurements at each 
sampling location until two times the response time of the measurement 
system has elapsed. Continue sampling for at least 1 minute and record 
the concentration measurements.
    4.3 Background concentration.
    4.3.1 Locate all NDO's of the TTE. A sampling point shall be 
centrally located outside of the TTE at 4 equivalent diameters from

[[Page 605]]

each NDO, if possible. If there are more than 6 NDO's, choose 6 sampling 
points evenly spaced among the NDO's.
    4.3.2 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 2. Calibrate the 
FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 
5.1 and 5.3.

    Note: This sample train shall be a separate sampling train from the 
one to measure the captured emissions.

    4.3.3 Position the probe at the sampling location.
    4.3.4 Determine the response time, conduct the system check and 
sample according to the procedures described in sections 4.2.4 to 4.2.7.
    4.4 Alternative procedure. The direct interface sampling and 
analysis procedure described in section 7.2 of Method 18 may be used to 
determine the gas VOC concentration. The system must be designed to 
collect and analyze at least one sample every 10 minutes.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1 FIA calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the 
back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates 
specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range 
calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the 
proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the 
responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of 
the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 
5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system 
is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity 
check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the 
analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.
    5.2 Systems drift checks. Select the calibration gas that most 
closely approximates the concentration of the captured emissions for 
conducting the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas at 
the calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas flow 
rate and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement system 
responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of the 
system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check 
measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent 
of the span value. Conduct the system drift checks at the end of each 
run.
    5.3 System check. Inject the high range calibration gas at the inlet 
to the sampling probe while the dilution air is turned off. Record the 
response. The performance of the system is acceptable if the measurement 
system response is within 5 percent of the value obtained in section 5.1 
for the high range calibration gas. Conduct a system check before and 
after each test run.
    5.4 Analysis audit. Immediately before each test analyze an audit 
cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with 
the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

       Procedure G.2--Captured VOC Emissions (Dilution Technique)

                             1. Introduction

    1.1 Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
volatile organic compounds (VOC) content of captured gas streams. It is 
intended to be used as a segment in the development of a gas/gas 
protocol in which fugitive emissions are measured for determining VOC 
capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations. A 
dilution system is used to reduce the VOC concentration of the captured 
emission to about the same concentration as the fugitive emission. The 
procedure may not be acceptable in certain site-specific situations, 
e.g., when: (1) Direct fired heaters or other circumstances affect the 
quantity of VOC at the control device inlet; and (2) particulate organic 
aerosols are formed in the process and are present in the captured 
emissions.
    1.2 Principle. The amount of VOC captured (G) is calculated as the 
sum of the products of the VOC content (C<INF>Gj</INF>), the flow rate 
(Q<INF>Gj</INF>), and the sampling time (T<INF>C</INF>) from each 
captured emissions point.
    1.3 Estimated measurement uncertainty. The measurement uncertainties 
are estimated for each captured or fugitive emissions point as follows: 
O<INF>Gj</INF>=<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.5 percent and 
C<INF>Gj</INF>=<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent. Based on these numbers, 
the probable uncertainty for G is estimated at about <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>7.4 percent.
    1.4 Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5 Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly 
explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing 
appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of 
trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas 
concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

emissions are to be measured at multiple locations, the measurement 
system shall be designed to use separate sampling probes, lines, and 
pumps for each measurement location and a common sample gas manifold and 
FIA. The sample gas manifold and connecting lines to the FIA must be

and shall be certified by the manufacturer to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 
percent of the tag value. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder 
should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas 
cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent from the certified value. For calibration gas 
values not generally available, alternative methods for preparing 
calibration gas mixtures, such as dilution system, may be used with 
prior approval.
    2.1.9.1 Fuel. A 40 percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent He or 40 percent 
H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent N<INF>2</INF> gas mixture is recommended to 
avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs when oxygen 
concentration varies signficantly from a mean value.
    2.1.9.2. Carrier gas and dilution air supply. High purity air with 
less than 1 ppm of organic material (as propane or carbon equivalent) or 
less than 0.1 percent of the span value, whichever is greater.
    2.1.9.3 FIA linearity calibration gases. Low-, mid-, and high-range 
gas mixture standards with nominal propane concentrations of 20-30, 45-
55, and 70-80 percent of the span value in air, respectively. Other 
calibration values and other span values may be used if it can be shown 
that more accurate measurements would be achieved.
    2.1.9.4 Dilution check gas. Gas mixture standard containing propane 
in air, approximately half the span value after dilution.
    2.1.10 Particulate filter. An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass 
fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is 
significant. An out-of-stack filter must be heated to prevent any 
condensation unless it can be demonstrated that no condensation occurs.
    2.2 Captured emissions volumetric flow rate.
    2.2.1 Method 2 or 2A apparatus. For determining volumetric flow 
rate.
    2.2.2 Method 3 apparatus and reagents. For determining molecular 
weight of the gas stream. An estimate of the molecular weight of the gas 
stream may be used if it can be justified.
    2.2.3 Method 4 apparatus and reagents. For determining moisture 
content, if necessary.

     3. Determination of Volumetric Flow Rate of Captured Emissions

    3.1 Locate all points where emissions are captured from the affected 
facility. Using Method 1, determine the sampling points. Be sure to 
check each site for cyclonic or swirling flow.
    3.2 Measure the velocity at each sampling site at least once every 
hour during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A.

          4. Determination of VOC Content of Captured Emissions

    4.1 Analysis duration. Measure the VOC responses at each captured 
emissions point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the 
process is operating. If there are multiple captured emissions 
locations, design a sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to 
determine the VOC responses at all sampling locations.
    4.2 Gas VOC concentration.
    4.2.1 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the 
FIA according to the procedure in section 5.1.
    4.2.2 Set the dilution ratio and determine the dilution factor 
according to the procedure in section 5.3.
    4.2.3 Conduct a system check according to the procedure in section 
5.4.
    4.2.4 Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally 
located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack 
port connection.
    4.2.5 Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Measure the 
system response time as the time required for the system to reach the 
effluent concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to 
the effluent sampling position.
    4.2.6 Conduct a system check before and a system drift check after 
each sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.4. 
If the drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, 
the run is not valid. The tester may elect to perform system drift 
checks during the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.
    4.2.7 Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures 
are 120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]C.
    4.2.8 Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue to 
sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times and 
any required process information as appropriate. If multiple captured 
emission locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at each 
location for the same amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) and continue to 
switch from one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure 
that total sampling time at each location is the same at the end of the 
test run. Collect at least 4 separate measurements from each sample 
point during each hour of testing. Disregard the measurements at each 
sampling location until two times the response time of the measurement 
system has elapsed. Continue sampling for at least 1 minute and record 
the concentration measurements.
    4.3 Background concentration.

[[Page 608]]

    4.3.1 Locate all NDO's of the TTE. A sampling point shall be 
centrally located outside of the TTE at 4 equivalent diameters from each 
NDO, if possible. If there are more than 6 NDO's, choose 6 sampling 
points evenly spaced among the NDO's.
    4.3.2 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 2. Calibrate the 
FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 
5.1 and 5.4.
    4.3.3 Position the probe at the sampling location.
    4.3.4 Determine the response time, conduct the system check and 
sample according to the procedures described in sections 4.2.4 to 4.2.8.
    4.4 Alternative procedure. The direct interface sampling and 
analysis procedure described in section 7.2 of Method 18 may be used to 
determine the gas VOC concentration. The system must be designed to 
collect and analyze at least one sample every 10 minutes.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1 FIA Calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system after the dilution 
system and adjust the back-pressure regulator to the value required to 
achieve the flow rates specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- 
and the high-range calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration 
to provide the proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and 
record the responses of the measurement system. The calibration and 
linearity of the system are acceptable if the responses for all four 
gases are within 5 percent of the respective gas values. If the 
performance of the system is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system 
and repeat the linearity check. Conduct a calibration and linearity 
check after assembling the analysis system and after a major change is 
made to the system.
    5.2 Systems drift checks. Select the calibration gas that most 
closely approximates the concentration of the diluted captured emissions 
for conducting the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas 
at the calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas 
flow rate and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement 
system responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of 
the system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check 
measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent 
of the span value. Conduct the system drift check at the end of each 
run.
    5.3 Determination of dilution factor. Inject the dilution check gas 
into the measurement system before the dilution system and record the 
response. Calculate the dilution factor using Equation 3.
    5.4 System check. Inject the high range calibration gas at the inlet 
to the sampling probe while the dilution air is turned off. Record the 
response. The performance of the system is acceptable if the measurement 
system response is within 5 percent of the value obtained in section 5.1 
for the high range calibration gas. Conduct a system check before and 
after each test run.
    5.5 Analysis audit. Immediately before each test analyze an audit 
cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with 
the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

     Procedure F.2--Fugitive VOC Emissions from Building Enclosures

                             1. Introduction

    1.1 Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
fugitive volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions from a building 
enclosure (BE). It is intended to be used as a segment in the 
development of liquid/gas or gas/gas protocols for determining VOC 
capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations.
    1.2 Principle. The total amount of fugitive VOC emissions 
(F<INF>B</INF>) from the BE is calculated as the sum of the products of 
the

[[Page 612]]

VOC content (C<INF>Fj</INF>) of each fugitive emissions point, its flow 
rate (Q<INF>Fj</INF>), and time (T<INF>F</INF>).
    1.3 Measurement uncertainty. The measurement uncertainties are 
estimated for each fugitive emissions point as follows: 
Q<INF>Fj</INF>=<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.0 percent and 
C<INF>Fj</INF>=<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.0 percent. Based on these 
numbers, the probable uncertainty for F<INF>B</INF> is estimated at 
about <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>11.2 percent.
    1.4 Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5 Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly 
explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing 
appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of 
trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas 
concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

                        2. Apparatus and Reagents

    2.1 Gas VOC concentration. A schematic of the measurement system is 
shown in Figure 1. The main components are described below:
    2.1.1 Sample probe. Stainless steel, or equivalent. The probe shall 
be heated to prevent VOC condensation.
    2.1.2 Calibration valve assembly. Three-way valve assembly at the 
outlet of sample probe to direct the zero and calibration gases to the 
analyzer. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route 
calibration gases to the outlet of the sample probe are acceptable.
    2.1.3 Sample line. Stainless steel or Teflon tubing to transport the 
sample gas to the analyzer. The sample line must be heated to prevent 
condensation.
    2.1.4 Sample pump. A leak-free pump, to pull the sample gas through 
the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of 
the measurement system. The components of the pump that contact the gas 
stream shall be constructed of staimust be heated to prevent 
condensation.
    2.1.5 Sample flow rate control. A sample flow rate control valve and 
rotameter, or equivalent, to maintain a constant sampling rate within 10 
percent. The flow rate control valve and rotameter must be heated to 
prevent condensation. A control valve may also be located on the sample 
pump bypass loop to assist in controlling the sample pressure and flow 
rate.
    2.1.6 Sample gas manifold. Capable of diverting a portion of the 
sample gas stream to the flame ionization analyzer (FIA), and the 
remainder to the bypass discharge vent. The manifold components shall be 
constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. If emissions are to be 
measured at multiple locations, the measurement system shall be designed 
to use separate sampling probes, lines, and pumps for each measurement 
location and a common sample gas manifold and FIA. The sample gas 
manifold must be heated to prevent condensation.
    2.1.7 Organic Concentration Analyzer. An FIA with a span value of 
1.5 times the expected concentration as propane; however, other span 
values may be used if it can be demonstrated that they would provide 
more accurate measurements. The system shall be capable or exceeding the 
following specifications:
    2.1.7.1 Zero drift. Less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.0 percent of 
the span value.
    2.1.7.2 Calibration drift. Less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.0 
percent of the span value.
    2.1.7.3 Calibration error. Less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.0 
percent of the calibration gas value.
    2.1.7.4 Response time. Less than 30 seconds.
    2.1.8 Integrator/data acquisition system. An analog or digital 
device or computerized data acquisition system used to integrate the FIA 
response or compute the average response and record measurement data. 
The minimum data sampling frequency for computing average or integrated 
values is one measurement value every 5 seconds. The device shall be 
capable of recording average values at least once per minute.
    2.1.9 Calibration and other gases. Gases used for calibration, fuel, 
and combustion air (if required) are contained in compressed gas 
cylinders. All calibration gases shall be traceable to NIST standards 
and shall be certified by the manufacturer to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 
percent of the tag value. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder 
should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas 
cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent from the certified value. For calibration gas 
values not generally available, alternative methods for preparing 
calibration gas mixtures, such as dilution systems, may be used with 
prior approval.
    2.1.9.1 Fuel. A 40 percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent He or 40 percent 
H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent N<INF>2</INF> gas mixture is recommended to 
avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs when oxygen 
concentration varies significantly from a mean value.
    2.1.9.2 Carrier gas. High purity air with less than 1 ppm of organic 
material (propane or carbon equivalent) or less than 0.1 percent of the 
span value, whichever is greater.
    2.1.9.3 FIA linearity calibration gases. Low-, mid-, and high-range 
gas mixture standards with nominal propane concentrations of 20-30, 45-
55, and 70-80 percent of the span value in air, respectively. Other 
calibration values and other span values may be used if it can be shown 
that more accurate measurements would be achieved.
    2.1.10 Particulate filter. An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass 
fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is 
significant. An out-of-stack filter must be heated to prevent any 
condensation unless it

[[Page 613]]

can be demonstrated that no condensation occurs.
    2.2 Fugitive emissions volumetric flow rate.
    2.2.1 Flow direction indicators. Any means of indicating inward or 
outward flow, such as light plastic film or paper streamers, smoke 
tubes, filaments, and sensory perception.
    2.2.2 Method 2 or 2A apparatus. For determining volumetric flow 
rate. Anemometers or similar devices calibrated according to the 
manufacturer's instructions may be used when low velocities are present. 
Vane anemometers (Young-maximum response propeller), specialized pitots 
with electronic manometers (e.g., Shortridge Instruments Inc., Airdata 
Multimeter 860) are commercially available with measurement thresholds 
of 15 and 8 mpm (50 and 25 fpm), respectively.
    2.2.3 Method 3 apparatus and reagents. For determining molecular 
weight of the gas stream. An estimate of the molecular weight of the gas 
stream may be used if it can be justified.
    2.2.4 Method 4 apparatus and reagents. For determining moisture 
content, if necessary.

     3. Determination of Volumetric Flow Rate of Fugitive Emissions

    3.1 Preliminary determinations. The purpose of this exercise is to 
determine which exhaust points should be measured for volumetric flow 
rates and VOC concentrations.
    3.1.1 Forced draft openings. Identify all forced draft openings. 
Determine the volumetric flow rate according to Method 2.
    3.1.2 NDO's exhaust points. The NDO's in the roof of a facility are 
considered to be exhaust points. Determine volumetric flow rate from 
these NDO's. Divide the cross-sectional area according to Method 1 using 
12 equal areas. Use the appropriate velocity measurement devices, e.g., 
propeller anemometers.
    3.1.3 Other NDO's.
    3.1.3.1 This step is optional. Determine the exhaust flow rate, 
including that of the control device, from the enclosure and the intake 
air flow rate. If the exhaust flow rate divided by the intake air flow 
rate is greater than 1.1, then all other NDO's are not considered to be 
significant exhaust points.
    3.1.3.2 If the option above is not taken, identify all other NDO's 
and other potential points through which fugitive emissions may escape 
the enclosure. Then use the following criteria to determine whether flow 
rates and VOC concentrations need to be measured:
    3.1.3.2.1 Using the appropriate flow direction indicator, determine 
the flow direction. An NDO with zero or inward flow is not an exhaust 
point.
    3.1.3.2.2 Measure the outward volumetric flow rate from the 
remainder of the NDO's. If the collective flow rate is 2 percent, or 
less, of the flow rate from sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, then these NDO's, 
except those within two equivalent diameters (based on NDO opening) from 
VOC sources, may be considered to be non-exhaust points.
    3.1.3.2.3 If the percentage calculated in section 3.1.3.2.2 is 
greater than 2 percent, those NDO's (except those within two equivalent 
diameters from VOC sources) whose volumetric flow rate totals 2 percent 
of the flow rate from sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 may be considered as non-
exhaust points. All remaining NDO's shall be measured for volumetric 
flow rate and VOC concentrations during the CE test.
    3.1.3.2.4 The tester may choose to measure VOC concentrations at the 
forced exhaust points and the NDO's. If the total VOC emissions from the 
NDO's are less than 2 percent of the emissions from the forced draft and 
roof NDO's, then these NDO's may be eliminated from further 
consideration.
    3.2 Determination of flow rates.
    3.2.1 Measure the volumetric flow rate at all locations identified 
as exhaust points in section 3.1. Divide each exhaust opening into 9 
equal areas for rectangular openings and 8 for circular openings.
    3.2.2 Measure the velocity at each site at least once every hour 
during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A, if applicable, or using 
the low velocity instruments in section 2.2.2.

          4. Determination of VOC Content of Fugitive Emissions

    4.1 Analysis duration. Measure the VOC responses at each fugitive 
emission point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the 
process is operating. If there are multiple emissions locations, design 
a sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to determine the VOC 
responses at all sampling locations.
    4.2 Gas VOC concentration.
    4.2.1 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the 
FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 
5.1 and 5.3, respectively.
    4.2.2 Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally 
located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack 
port connection.
    4.2.3 Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Allow the 
measurement system response to reach zero. Measure the system response 
time as the time required for the system to reach the effluent 
concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to the 
effluent sampling position.
    4.2.4 Conduct a system check before and a system drift check after 
each sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. 
If the drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, 
the run is not valid. The tester may elect to perform drift checks 
during the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.

[[Page 614]]

    4.2.5 Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures 
are 120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]C.
    4.2.6 Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue to 
sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times and 
any required process information as appropriate. If multiple emission 
locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at each location for 
the same amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) and continue to switch from 
one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure that total 
sampling time at each location is the same at the end of the test run. 
Collect at least 4 separate measurements from each sample point during 
each hour of testing. Disregard the response measurements at each 
sampling location until two times the response time of the measurement 
system has elapsed. Continue sampling for at least 1 minute and record 
the concentration measurements.
    4.3 Alternative procedure. The direct interface sampling and 
analysis procedure described in section 7.2 of Method 18 may be used to 
determine the gas VOC concentration. The system must be designed to 
collect and analyze at least one sample every 10 minutes.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1 FIA calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the 
back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates 
specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range 
calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the 
proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the 
responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of 
the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 
5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system 
is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity 
check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the 
analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.
    5.2 Systems drift checks. Select the calibration gas that most 
closely approximates the concentration of the captured emissions for 
conducting the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas at 
the calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas flow 
rate and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement system 
responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of the 
system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check 
measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent 
of the span value. Conduct a system drift check at the end of each run.
    5.3 System check. Inject the high range calibration gas at the inlet 
of the sampling probe and record the response. The performance of the 
system is acceptable if the measurement system response is within 5 
percent of the value obtained in section 5.1 for the high range 
calibration gas. Conduct a system check before each test run.
    5.4 Analysis audit. Immediately before each test analyze an audit 
cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with 
the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

     Procedure F.1--Fugitive VOC Emissions From Temporary Enclosures

                             1. Introduction

    1.1 Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
fugitive volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions from a temporary 
total enclosure (TTE). It is intended to be used as a segment in the 
development of liquid/gas or gas/gas protocols for determining VOC 
capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations.
    1.2 Principle. The amount of fugitive VOC emissions (F) from the TTE 
is calculated as the sum of the products of the VOC content

[[Page 616]]

(C<INF>Fj</INF>), the flow rate (Q<INF>Fj</INF>), and the sampling time 
(T<INF>F</INF>) from each fugitive emissions point.
    1.3 Estimated measurement uncertainty. The measurement uncertainties 
are estimated for each fugitive emission point as follows: Q=<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5.5 percent and C<INF>Fj</INF>=<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.0 
percent. Based on these numbers, the probable uncertainty for F is 
estimated at about <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>7.4 percent.
    1.4 Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5 Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly 
explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing 
appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of 
trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas 
concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

    2.1 Gas VOC concentration. A schematic of the measurement system is 
shown in Figure 1. The main components are described below:
    2.1.1 Sample probe. Stainless steel, or equivalent. The probe shall 
be heated to prevent VOC condensation.
    2.1.2 Calibration valve assembly. Three-way valve assembly at the 
outlet of sample probe to direct the zero and calibration gases to the 
analyzer. Other methods, such as quick-connect lines, to route 
calibration gases to the outlet of the sample probe are acceptable.
    2.1.3 Sample line. Stainless steel or Teflon tubing to transport the 
sample gas to the analyzer. The sample line must be heated to prevent 
condensation.
    2.1.4 Sample pump. A leak-free pump, to pull the sample gas through 
the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of 
the measurement system. The components of the pump that contact the gas 
stream shall be constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. The sample 
pump must be heated to prevent condensation.
    2.1.5 Sample flow rate control. A sample flow rate control valve and 
rotameter, or equivalent, to maintain a constant sampling rate within 10 
percent. The flow control valve and rotameter must be heated to prevent 
condensation. A control valve may also be located on the sample pump 
bypass loop to assist in controlling the sample pressure and flow rate.
    2.1.6 Sample gas manifold. Capable of diverting a portion of the 
sample gas stream to the flame ionization analyzer (FIA), and the 
remainder to the bypass discharge vent. The manifold components shall be 
constructed of stainless steel or Teflon. If emissions are to be 
measured at multiple locations, the measurement system shall be designed 
to use separate sampling probes, lines, and pumps for each measurement 
location and a common sample gas manifold and FIA. The sample gas 
manifold and connecting lines to the FIA must be heated to prevent 
condensation.
    2.1.7 Organic concentration analzyer. An FIA with a span value of 
1.5 times the expected concentration as propane; however, other span 
values may be used if it can be demonstrated that they would provide 
more accurate measurements. The system shall be capable of meeting or 
exceeding the following specifications:
    2.1.7.1 Zero drift. Less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.0 percent of 
the span value.
    2.1.7.2 Calibration drift. Less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3.0 
percent of the span value.
    2.1.7.3 Calibration error. Less than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5.0 
percent of the calibration gas value.
    2.1.7.4 Response time. Less than 30 seconds.
    2.1.8 Integrator/data acquisition system. An analog or digital 
device or computerized data acquisition system used to integrate the FIA 
response or compute the average response and record measurement data. 
The minimum data sampling frequency for computing average or integrated 
values is one measurement value every 5 seconds. The device shall be 
capable of recording average values at least once per minute.
    2.1.9 Calibration and other gases. Gases used for calibration, fuel, 
and combustion air (if required) are contained in compressed gas 
cylinders. All calibration gases shall be traceable to NIST standards 
and shall be certified by the manufacturer to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 
percent of the tag value. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder 
should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas 
cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent from the certified value. For calibration gas 
values not generally available, alternative methods for preparing 
calibration gas mixtures, such as dilution systems, may be used with 
prior approval.
    2.1.9.1 Fuel. A 40 percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent He or 40 percent 
H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent N<INF>2</INF> gas mixture is recommended to 
avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs when oxygen 
concentration varies significantly from a mean value.
    2.1.9.2 Carrier gas. High purity air with less than 1 ppm of organic 
material (as propane or carbon equivalent) or less than 0.1 percent of 
the span value, whichever is greater.
    2.1.9.3 FIA linearity calibration gases. Low-, mid-, and high-range 
gas mixture standards with nominal propane concentrations of 20-30, 45-
55, and 70-80 percent of the span value in air, respectively. Other 
calibration values and other span values may be used if it can be shown 
that more accurate measurements would be achieved.
    2.1.10 Particulate filter. An in-stack or an out-of-stack glass 
fiber filter is recommended if exhaust gas particulate loading is 
significant. An out-of-stack filter must be

[[Page 617]]

heated to prevent any condensation unless it can be demonstrated that no 
condensation occurs.
    2.2 Fugitive emissions volumetric flow rate.
    2.2.1 Method 2 or 2A apparatus. For determining volumetric flow 
rate.
    2.2.2 Method 3 apparatus and reagents. For determining molecular 
weight of the gas stream. An estimate of the molecular weight of the gas 
stream may be used if it can be justified.
    2.2.3 Method 4 apparatus and reagents. For determining moisture 
content, if necessary.
    2.3 Temporary total enclosure. The criteria for designing a TTE are 
discussed in Procedure T.

     3. Determination of Volumetric Flow Rate of Fugitive Emissions

    3.1 Locate all points where emissions are exhausted from the TTE. 
Using Method 1, determine the sampling points. Be sure to check each 
site for cyclonic or swirling flow.
    3.2 Measure the velocity at each sampling site at least once every 
hour during each sampling run using Method 2 or 2A.

          4. Determination of VOC Content of Fugitive Emissions

    4.1 Analysis duration. Measure the VOC responses at each fugitive 
emission point during the entire test run or, if applicable, while the 
process is operating. If there are multiple emission locations, design a 
sampling system to allow a single FIA to be used to determine the VOC 
responses at all sampling locations.
    4.2 Gas VOC concentration.
    4.2.1 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 1. Calibrate the 
FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in sections 
5.1 and 5.3, respectively.
    4.2.2 Install the sample probe so that the probe is centrally 
located in the stack, pipe, or duct, and is sealed tightly at the stack 
port connection.
    4.2.3 Inject zero gas at the calibration valve assembly. Allow the 
measurement system response to reach zero. Measure the system response 
time as the time required for the system to reach the effluent 
concentration after the calibration valve has been returned to the 
effluent sampling position.
    4.2.4 Conduct a system check before and a system drift check after 
each sampling run according to the procedures in sections 5.2 and 5.3. 
If the drift check following a run indicates unacceptable performance, 
the run is not valid. The tester may elect to perform system drift 
checks during the run not to exceed one drift check per hour.
    4.2.5 Verify that the sample lines, filter, and pump temperatures 
are 120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]C.
    4.2.6 Begin sampling at the start of the test period and continue to 
sample during the entire run. Record the starting and ending times and 
any required process information as appropriate. If multiple emission 
locations are sampled using a single FIA, sample at each location for 
the same amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) and continue to switch from 
one location to another for the entire test run. Be sure that total 
sampling time at each location is the same at the end of the test run. 
Collect at least 4 separate measurements from each sample point during 
each hour of testing. Disregard the response measurements at each 
sampling location until two times the response time of the measurement 
system has elapsed. Continue sampling for at least 1 minute and record 
the concentration measurements.
    4.3 Background concentration.
    4.3.1 Determination of VOC background concentration.
    4.3.1.1 Locate all NDO's of the TTE. A sampling point shall be 
centrally located outside of the TTE at 4 equivalent diameters from each 
NDO, if possible. If there are more than 6 NDO's, choose 6 sampling 
points evenly spaced among the NDO's.
    4.3.1.2 Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 2. Calibrate 
the FIA and conduct a system check according to the procedures in 
sections 5.1 and 5.3.
    4.3.1.3 Position the probe at the sampling location.
    4.3.1.4 Determine the response time, conduct the system check and 
sample according to the procedures described in sections 4.2.3 to 4.2.6.
    4.4 Alternative procedure. The direct interface sampling and 
analysis procedure described in section 7.2 of Method 18 may be used to 
determine the gas VOC concentration. The system must be designed to 
collect and analyze at least one sample every 10 minutes.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1 FIA calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the 
back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates 
specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range 
calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the 
proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the 
responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of 
the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 
5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system 
is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity 
check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the 
analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.

[[Page 618]]

    5.2 Systems drift checks. Select the calibration gas concentration 
that most closely approximates that of the fugitive gas emissions to 
conduct the drift checks. Introduce the zero and calibration gas at the 
calibration valve assembly and verify that the appropriate gas flow rate 
and pressure are present at the FIA. Record the measurement system 
responses to the zero and calibration gases. The performance of the 
system is acceptable if the difference between the drift check 
measurement and the value obtained in section 5.1 is less than 3 percent 
of the span value. Conduct a system drift check at the end of each run.
    5.3 System check. Inject the high range calibration gas at the inlet 
of the sampling probe and record the response. The performance of the 
system is acceptable if the measurement system response is within 5 
percent of the value obtained in section 5.1 for the high range 
calibration gas. Conduct a system check before each test run.
    5.4 Analysis audit. Immediately before each test analyze an audit 
cylinder as described in section 5.2. The analysis audit must agree with 
the audit cylinder concentration within 10 percent.

                         Procedure L--VOC Input

                             1. Introduction

    1.1 Applicability. This procedure is applicable for determining the 
input of volatile organic compounds (VOC). It is intended to be used as 
a segment in the development of liquid/gas protocols for determining VOC 
capture efficiency (CE) for surface coating and printing operations.
    1.2 Principle. The amount of VOC introduced to the process (L) is 
the sum of the products of the weight (W) of each VOC containing liquid 
(ink, paint, solvent, etc.) used and its VOC content (V). A sample of 
each

[[Page 621]]

VOC containing liquid is analyzed with a flame ionization analyzer (FIA) 
to determine V.
    1.3 Estimated measurement uncertainty. The measurement uncertainties 
are estimated for each VOC containing liquid as follows: W=<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2.0 percent and V=<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>12.0 percent. 
Based on these numbers, the probable uncertainty for L is estimated at 
about <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>12.2 percent for each VOC containing liquid.
    1.4 Sampling requirements. A capture efficiency test shall consist 
of at least three sampling runs. The sampling time for each run should 
be at least 8 hours, unless otherwise approved.
    1.5 Notes. Because this procedure is often applied in highly 
explosive areas, caution and care should be exercised in choosing 
appropriate equipment and installing and using the equipment. Mention of 
trade names or company products does not constitute endorsement. All gas 
concentrations (percent, ppm) are by volume, unless otherwise noted.

flow meters, density measurement equipment, etc., as needed to achieve 
same accuracy as direct weight measurements.
    2.2 VOC content (flame ionization analyzer technique). The liquid 
sample analysis system is shown in Figures 1 and 2. The following 
equipment is required:
    2.2.1 Sample collection can. An appropriately sized metal can to be 
used to collect VOC containing materials. The can must be constructed in 
such a way that it can be grounded to the coating container.

needed for each sample.
    2.2.13 Rubber stopper. Two-hole stopper to accommodate 3.2-mm (\1/
8\-in.) Teflon tubing, appropriately sized to fit the opening of the 
sample vessel. The rubber stopper should be wrapped in Teflon tape to 
provide a tighter seal and to prevent any reaction of the sample with 
the rubber stopper. Alternatively, any leak-free closure fabricated of 
non-reactive materials and accommodating the necessary tubing fittings 
may be used.
    2.2.14 Critical orifices. Calibrated critical orifices capable of 
providing constant flow rates from 50 to 250 ml/min at known pressure 
drops. Sapphire orifice assemblies (available from O'Keefe Controls 
Company) and glass capillary tubing have been found to be adequate for

at the sample vessel to create critical flow through the calibrated 
orifice when sufficient air pressure is present at the aspirator inlet. 
The aspirator must also provide sufficient sample pressure to operate 
the FIA. The sample is also mixed with the dilution gas within the 
aspirator.

is recommended to provide a continuous analog display of the measurement 
results during the liquid sample analysis.

combustion air (if required) contained in compressed gas cylinders. All 
calibration gases shall be traceable to NIST standards and shall be 
certified by the manufacturer to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of the 
tag value. Additionally, the manufacturer of the cylinder should provide 
a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over which 
the concentration does not change more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
percent from the certified value. For calibration gas values not 
generally available, alternative methods for preparing calibration gas 
mixtures, such as dilution systems, may be used with prior approval.
    2.2.22.1 Fuel. A 40 percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent He or 40 
percent H<INF>2</INF>/60 percent N<INF>2</INF> gas mixture is 
recommended to avoid an oxygen synergism effect that reportedly occurs 
when oxygen concentration varies significantly from a mean value.

organic material (as propane) or less than 0.1 percent of the span 
value, whichever is greater.
    2.2.22.3 FIA linearity calibration gases. Low-, mid-, and high-range 
gas mixture standards with nominal propane concentrations of 20-30, 45-
55, and 70-80 percent of the span value in air, respectively. Other 
calibration values and other span values may be used if it can be shown 
that more accurate measurements would be achieved.
    2.2.22.4 System calibration gas. Gas mixture standard containing 
propane in air, approximately the undiluted VOC concentration expected 
for the liquid samples.

                 3. Determination of Liquid Input Weight

    3.1 Weight difference. Determine the amount of material introduced 
to the process as the weight difference of the feed material before and 
after each sampling run. In determining the total VOC containing liquid 
usage, account for: (a) The initial (beginning) VOC containing liquid 
mixture; (b) any solvent added during the test run; (c) any coating 
added during the test run; and (d) any residual VOC containing liquid 
mixture remaining at the end of the sample run.
    3.1.1 Identify all points where VOC containing liquids are 
introduced to the process. To obtain an accurate measurement of VOC 
containing liquids, start with an empty fountain (if applicable). After 
completing the run, drain the liquid in the fountain back into the 
liquid drum (if possible), and weigh the drum again. Weigh the VOC 
containing liquids to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent of the total 
weight (full) or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.1 percent of the total weight 
of VOC containing liquid used during the sample run, whichever is less. 
If the residual liquid cannot be returned to the drum, drain the 
fountain into a preweighted empty drum to determine the final weight of 
the liquid.
    3.1.2 If it is not possible to measure a single representative 
mixture, than weigh the various components separately (e.g., if solvent 
is added during the sampling run, weigh the solvent before it is added 
to the mixture). If a fress drum of VOC containing liquid is needed 
during the run, then weigh both the empty drum and fresh drum.
    3.2 Volume measurement (alternative). If direct weight measurements 
are not feasible, the tester may use volume meters and flow rate meters 
(and density measurements) to determine the weight of liquids used if it 
can be demonstrated that the technique produces results equivalent to 
the direct weight measurements. If a single representative mixture 
cannot be measured, measure the components separately.

            4. Determination of VOC Content in Input Liquids

    4.1 Collection of liquid samples.
    4.1.1 Collect a 100-ml or larger sample of the VOC containing liquid 
mixture at each application location at the beginning and end of each 
test run. A separate sample should be taken of each VOC containing 
liquid added to the application mixture during the test run. If a fresh 
drum is needed during the sampling run, then obtain a sample from the 
fresh drum.
    4.1.2 When collecting the sample, ground the sample container to the 
coating drum. Fill the sample container as close to the rim as possible 
to minimize the amount of headspace.
    4.1.3 After the sample is collected, seal the container so the 
sample cannot leak out or evaporate.
    4.1.4 Label the container to identify clearly the contents.
    4.2 Liquid sample VOC content.
    4.2.1 Assemble the liquid VOC content analysis system as shown in 
Figure 1.
    4.2.2 Permanently identify all of the critical orifices that may be 
used. Calibrate each critical orifice under the expected operating 
conditions (i.e., sample vacuum and temperature) against a volume meter 
as described in section 5.3.
    4.2.3 Label and tare the sample vessels (including the stoppers and 
caps) and the syringes.
    4.2.4 Install an empty sample vessel and perform a leak test of the 
system. Close the carrier gas valve and atmospheric vent and evacuate 
the sample vessel to 250 mm (10 in.) Hg absolute or less using the 
aspirator. Close

[[Page 623]]

the toggle valve at the inlet to the aspirator and observe the vacuum 
for at least one minute. If there is any change in the sample pressure, 
release the vacuum, adjust or repair the apparatus as necessary and 
repeat the leak test.
    4.2.5 Perform the analyzer calibration and linearity checks 
according to the procedure in section 5.1. Record the responses to each 
of the calibration gases and the back-pressure setting of the FIA.
    4.2.6 Establish the appropriate dilution ratio by adjusting the 
aspirator air supply or substituting critical orifices. Operate the 
aspirator at a vacuum of at least 25 mm (1 in.) Hg greater than the 
vacuum necessary to achieve critical flow. Select the dilution ratio so 
that the maximum response of the FIA to the sample does not exceed the 
high-range calibration gas.
    4.2.7 Perform system calibration checks at two levels by introducing 
compressed gases at the inlet to the sample vessel while the aspirator 
and dilution devices are operating. Perform these checks using the 
carrier gas (zero concentration) and the system calibration gas. If the 
response to the carrier gas exceeds <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent of 
span, clean or repair the apparatus and repeat the check. Adjust the 
dilution ratio as necessary to achieve the correct response to the 
upscale check, but do not adjust the analyzer calibration. Record the 
identification of the orifice, aspirator air supply pressure, FIA back-
pressure, and the responses of the FIA to the carrier and system 
calibration gases.
    4.2.8 After completing the above checks, inject the system 
calibration gas for approximately 10 minutes. Time the exact duration of 
the gas injection using a stopwatch. Determine the area under the FIA 
response curve and calculate the system response factor based on the 
sample gas flow rate, gas concentration, and the duration of the 
injection as compared to the integrated response using Equations 2 and 
3.
    4.2.9 Verify that the sample oven and sample line temperatures are 
120 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]C and that the water bath temperature 
is 100 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]C.
    4.2.10 Fill a tared syringe with approximately 1 g of the VOC 
containing liquid and weigh it. Transfer the liquid to a tared sample 
vessel. Plug the sample vessel to minimize sample loss. Weigh the sample 
vessel containing the liquid to determine the amount of sample actually 
received. Also, as a quality control check, weigh the empty syringe to 
determine the amount of material delivered. The two coating sample 
weights should agree within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.02 g. If not, repeat 
the procedure until an acceptable sample is obtained.
    4.2.11 Connect the vessel to the analysis system. Adjust the 
aspirator supply pressure to the correct value. Open the valve on the 
carrier gas supply to the sample vessel and adjust it to provide a 
slight excess flow to the atmospheric vent. As soon as the initial 
response of the FIA begins to decrease, immerse the sample vessel in the 
water bath. (Applying heat to the sample vessel too soon may cause the 
FID response to exceed the calibrated range of the instrument, and thus 
invalidate the analysis.)
    4.2.12 Continuously measure and record the response of the FIA until 
all of the volatile material has been evaporated from the sample and the 
instrument response has returned to the baseline (i.e., response less 
than 0.5 percent of the span value). Observe the aspirator supply 
pressure, FIA back-pressure, atmospheric vent, and other system 
operating parameters during the run; repeat the analysis procedure if 
any of these parameters deviate from the values established during the 
system calibration checks in Section 4.2.7. After each sample perform 
the drift check described in Section 5.2. If the drift check results are 
acceptable, calculate the VOC content of the sample using the equations 
in Section 7. Integrate the area under the FIA response curve, or 
determine the average concentration response and the duration of sample 
analysis.

                  5. Calibration and Quality Assurance

    5.1 FIA calibration and linearity check. Make necessary adjustments 
to the air and fuel supplies for the FIA and ignite the burner. Allow 
the FIA to warm up for the period recommended by the manufacturer. 
Inject a calibration gas into the measurement system and adjust the 
back-pressure regulator to the value required to achieve the flow rates 
specified by the manufacturer. Inject the zero- and the high-range 
calibration gases and adjust the analyzer calibration to provide the 
proper responses. Inject the low- and mid-range gases and record the 
responses of the measurement system. The calibration and linearity of 
the system are acceptable if the responses for all four gases are within 
5 percent of the respective gas values. If the performance of the system 
is not acceptable, repair or adjust the system and repeat the linearity 
check. Conduct a calibration and linearity check after assembling the 
analysis system and after a major change is made to the system.
    5.2 Systems drift checks. After each sample, repeat the system 
calibration checks in Section 4.2.7 before any adjustments to the FIA or 
measurement system are made. If the zero or calibration drift exceeds 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent of the span value, discard the result 
and repeat the analysis.
    5.3 Critical orifice calibration.
    5.3.1 Each critical orifice must be calibrated at the specific 
operating conditions that it will be used. Therefore, assemble all 
components of the liquid sample analysis system as shown in Figure 3. A 
stopwatch is also required.

[[Page 624]]

    5.3.2 Turn on the sample oven, sample line, and water bath heaters 
and allow the system to reach the proper operating temperature. Adjust 
the aspirator to a vacuum of 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. Measure the time 
required for one soap bubble to move a known distance and record 
barometric pressure.
    5.3.3 Repeat the calibration procedure at a vacuum of 406 mm (16 
in.) Hg and at 25-mm (1-in.) Hg intervals until three consecutive 
determinations provide the same flow rate. Calculate the critical flow 
rate for the orifice in ml/min at standard conditions. Record the vacuum 
necessary to achieve critical flow.

 Procedure T--Criteria for and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary 
                             Total Enclosure

                             1. Introduction

    1.1 Applicability. This procedure is used to determine whether a 
permanent or temporary enclosure meets the criteria of a total 
enclosure.
    1.2 Principle. An enclosure is evaluated against a set of criteria. 
If the criteria are met and if all the exhaust gases are ducted to a 
control device, then the volatile organic compounds (VOC) capture 
efficiency (CE) is assumed to be 100 percent and CE need not be 
measured. However, if part of the exhaust gas stream is not ducted to a 
control device, CE must be determined.

                             2. Definitions

    2.1 Natural Draft Opening (NDO)--Any permanent opening in the 
enclosure that remains open during operation of the facility and is not 
connected to a duct in which a fan is installed.
    2.2 Permanent Total Enclosure (PTE)--A permanently installed 
enclosure that completely surrounds a source of emissions such that all 
VOC emissions are captured and contained for discharge through a control 
device.
    2.3 Temporary Total Enclosure (TTE)--A temporarily installed 
enclosure that completely surrounds a source of emissions such that all 
VOC emissions are captured and contained for discharge through ducts 
that allow for the accurate measurement of VOC rates.

               3. Criteria of a Temporary Total Enclosure

    3.1 Any NDO shall be at least 4 equivalent opening diameters from 
each VOC emitting point.
    3.2 Any exhaust point from the enclosure shall be at least 4 
equivalent duct or hood diameters from each NDO.
    3.3 The total area of all NDO's shall not exceed 5 percent of the 
surface area of the enclosure's four walls, floor, and ceiling.
    3.4 The average facial velocity (FV) of air through all NDO's shall 
be at least 3,600 m/hr (200 fpm). The direction of air through all NDO's 
shall be into the enclosure.
    3.5 All access doors and windows whose areas are not included in 
section 3.3 and are not included in the calculation in section 3.4 shall 
be closed during routine operation of the process.

               4. Criteria of a Permanent Total Enclosure

    4.1 Same as sections 3.1 and 3.3-3.5.
    4.2 All VOC emissions must be captured and contained for discharge 
through a control device.

                              5. Procedure

    5.1 Determine the equivalent diameters of the NDO's and determine 
the distances from each VOC emitting point to all NDO's. Determine the 
equivalent diameter of each exhaust duct or hood and its distance to all 
NDO's. Calculate the distances in terms of equivalent diameters. The 
number of equivalent diameters shall be at least 4.
    5.2 Measure the total area (A<INF>t</INF>) of the enclosure and the 
total area (A<INF>N</INF>) of all NDO's of the enclosure. Calculate the 
NDO to enclosure area ratio (NEAR) as follows:

NEAR=A<INF>N</INF>/A<INF>t</INF>
    The NEAR must be <=0.05.
    5.3 Measure the volumetric flow rate, corrected to standard 
conditions, of each gas stream exiting the enclosure through an exhaust 
duct or hood using EPA Method 2. In some cases (e.g., when the building 
is the enclosure), it may be necessary to measure the volumetric flow 
rate, corrected to standard conditions, of each gas stream entering the 
enclosure through a forced makeup air duct using Method 2. Calculate FV 
using the following equation:

FV=[Q<INF>O</INF>-Q<INF>I</INF>]/A<INF>N</INF>

Where:

Q<INF>O</INF>=the sum of the volumetric flow from all gas streams 
exiting the enclosure through an exhaust duct or hood.
Q<INF>I</INF>=the sum of the volumetric flow from all gas streams into 
the enclosure through a forced makeup air duct; zero, if there is no 
forced makeup air into the enclosure.
A<INF>N</INF>=total area of all NDO's in enclosure.

    The FV shall be at least 3,600 m/hr (200 fpm).
    5.4 Verify that the direction of air flow through all NDO's is 
inward. Use streamers, smoke tubes, tracer gases, etc. Strips of plastic 
wrapping film have been found to be effective. Monitor the direction of 
air flow at intervals of at least 10 minutes for at least 1 hour.

                          6. Quality Assurance

    6.1 The success of this protocol lies in designing the TTE to 
simulate the conditions that exist without the TTE, i.e., the effect of 
the TTE on the normal flow patterns around the affected facility or the 
amount of fugitive VOC emissions should be minimal. The TTE must enclose 
the application stations, coating reservoirs, and all areas from the 
application station to the oven. The oven does not have to be enclosed 
if it is under negative pressure. The NDO's of the temporary enclosure 
and a fugitive exhaust fan must be properly sized and placed.
    6.2 Estimate the ventilation rate of the TTE that best simulates the 
conditions that exist without the TTE, i.e., the effect of the TTE on 
the normal flow patterns around the affected facility or the amount of 
fugitive

[[Page 629]]

VOC emissions should be minimal. Figure 1 may be used as an aid. Measure 
the concentration (C<INF>G</INF>) and flow rate (Q<INF>G</INF>) of the 
captured gas stream, specify a safe concentration (C<INF>F</INF>) for 
the fugitive gas stream, estimate the CE, and then use the plot in 
Figure 1 to determine the volumetric flowrate of the fugitive gas stream 
(Q<INF>F</INF>). A fugitive VOC emission exhaust fan that has a variable 
flow control is desirable.
    6.2.1 Monitor the concentration of VOC into the capture device 
without the TTE. To minimize the effect of temporal variation on the 
captured emissions, the baseline measurement should be made over as long 
a time period as practical. However, the process conditions must be the 
same for the measurement in section 6.2.3 as they are for this baseline 
measurement. This may require short measuring times for this quality 
control check before and after the construction of the TTE.
    6.2.2 After the TTE is constructed, monitor the VOC concentration 
inside the TTE. This concentration shall continue to increase and must 
not exceed the safe level according to OSHA requirements for permissible 
exposure limits. An increase in VOC concentration indicates poor TTE 
design or poor capture efficiency.
    6.2.3 Monitor the concentration of VOC into the capture device with 
the TTE. To limit the effect of the TTE on the process, the VOC 
concentration with and without the TTE must be within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent. If the measurements do not agree, adjust the 
ventilation rate from the TTE until they agree within 10 percent.

Sec. 52.743  Continuous monitoring.

    (a) Alternative monitoring requirements established under Section 
201.402 of Title 35, IAC must be either: Incorporated into a federally 
enforceable operating permit or construction permit or submitted to 
USEPA for approval as

[[Page 632]]

a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP). Illinois 
shall set forth alternative emissions monitoring and reporting 
requirements to satisfy the intent of 40 CFR part 51, appendix P 
whenever Illinois exempts any source subject to Section 201.401 from 
installing continuous emission monitoring systems. Illinois may exempt a 
source if the source cannot install a continuous emission monitoring 
system because of physical plant limitations or extreme economic 
reasons, according to the criteria of Section 201.402.
    (b) As codified at 40 CFR 52.737 (USEPA's approval of the Illinois 
operating permit program for the purpose of issuing federally 
enforceable construction and operating permits), USEPA reserves the 
right to deem an operating permit not federally enforceable. Such a 
determination will be made according to appropriate procedures including 
operating permit requirements promulgated at 54 FR 27274 (June 28, 1989) 
and will be based upon either; the permit, permit approval procedures or 
state or local permit requirements which do not conform with the 
operating permit program requirements or the requirements of USEPA's 
underlying regulations. Among other things, underlying requirements 
include 40 CFR 51.214 and part 51, appendix P and Illinois' approved 
SIP, 40 CFR part 52. Should USEPA deem an operating or construction 
permit containing alternative monitoring requirements not federally 
enforceable, the underlying continuous monitoring requirements at 
Section 201.401 of the State rule would be the Federal requirements 
contained in the SIP to which the source would be subject. This 
interpretation of the impact of an operating permit deemed not federally 
enforceable by USEPA on a source to which it was issued was acknowledged 
by the State in a March 3, 1993, letter from Bharat Mathur, Chief, 
Bureau of Air, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, to Stephen 
Rothblatt, Chief, Regulation Development Branch, Region 5, USEPA.

    (i) Incorporation by reference. (A) 325 IAC 6-2.1, revised 
regulation establishing Particulate Emission Limitations for Sources of 
Indirect Heating.
    (ii) Additional material. (A) December 21, 1983, submittal of 
Finding of Facts and Recommendations of Hearing Officer R. W. James on 
325 IAC 6-2.1.
    (B) March 27, 1985, commitment letter from the State concerning the 
procedures the State will use in processing ``bubbles'' under 325 IAC 6-
2.1-2(B) and 3(b). See Sec. 52.776(i).
    (51) On February 7, 1983, Indiana submitted revised opacity limits 
for existing boilers at Olin Corporation, located in Covington, Indiana. 
These ``equivalent visible emission limits'' (EVEL) are approved for as 
long as the SIP mass emission limit determined from 325 IAC 6-2 (October 
6, 1980 submittal) for this source remains in the SIP. See Sec. 
52.770(c) (6) and (35) and Sec. 52.776(h)(2).
    (i) Incorporation by reference. (A) EVELs for Olin Corporation 
contained in Operating Permits issued by IAPCB, dated October 6, 1981.
    (ii) Additional material. (A) September 1, 1983, transmittal by 
IAPCD's A. Sunderland of Olin's Mass Emission Tests, dated August 26, 
1983.
    (B) April 5, 1984, letter from IAPCD's E. Stresino transmitting 
original petition, including Method 9 opacity data.
    (52) On February 23, 1984, the Indiana Air Pollution Control Board 
submitted a revision to Indiana's SO<INF>2</INF> SIP waiving the self-
monitoring requirement for Public Service Indiana's Edwardsport 
Generating Station, as set forth in section 4(a) of Rule 325 IAC 7-1. 
See (c)(19). This revision becomes effective once the Edwardsport 
Station achieves an annual operating capacity of no greater than 10%.
    (53) On October 6, 1980, Indiana submitted revised opacity 
regulation 325 IAC 5-1. It replaces 1972 APC 3 for process sources, 
approved at paragraph (b), and SIP 1974 APC 3 for combustion sources, 
approved in part at subparagraph (c)(14). Indiana does not intend 325 
IAC 5-1 to regulate the emission points in Lake County listed in Table 2 
of 325 IAC 6-1-110.2 (subparagraph (c)(57)). USEPA is disapproving 325 
IAC 5-1 for these sources. Indiana does not intend 325 IAC 5-1 to 
regulate certain coke battery emission sources listed in 325 IAC 11-3 
(subparagraph (c)(42)). USEPA is disapproving 325 IAC 5-1 as it applies 
to the provisions of 325 IAC 11-3 which USEPA disapproved at (c)(42), 
i.e., pushing and quenching sources throughout the State and coke oven 
doors in Lake and Marion Counties. Additionally, Indiana has modified 
325 IAC 5-1 as it applies to the stack emission points in Porter County 
listed at 325 IAC 6-6-4. USEPA disapproved 325 IAC 5-1 as it applies to 
these Porter County sources on February 5, 1987 (52 FR 3640). For those 
source categories where USEPA is disapproving 325 IAC 5-1, they remain 
regulated by the previously approved opacity SIP which consists of SIP 
1974 APC 3 for combustion sources and 1972 APC 3 for process sources. 
Additionally, as long as the Bethlehem Steel Corporation No. 2 Coke Oven 
Battery Underfire Stack EVEL (subparagraph (c)(49)) remains approved, it 
replaces 325 IAC 5-1.
    (i) Incorporation by reference. (A) A letter dated October 6, 1980 
from the State of Indiana Air Pollution Control Board and 325 IAC 5-1, 
Visible Emission Limitations, State promulgated on August 26, 1980.

Technical Secretary of the Air Pollution Control Board committing the 
State to make certain technical changes to 325 IAC 5-1.
    (54) On March 28, 1984, Indiana submitted a revised TSP emission 
limitation for Richmond State Hospital, Wayne County, Indiana. This 
limitation replaces the one in 325 IAC 6-1-14 which was previously 
approved at (c)(34).
    (i) Incorporation by reference. (A) On January 13, 1984, Indiana 
issued to Richmond State Hospital an amendment to operating permit, 89-
04-85-0153, which revised its TSP emission limitations for the four 
boilers to 0.60 lbs/MMBTU with an annual total limit of 452 tons/yr.
    (55) On January 30, 1985, Indiana submitted revised VOC regulations 
325 IAC 8-1.1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4 and 8-5 to satisfy certain conditions of 
USEPA's approval. Those regulations amended those approved at (c)(33) 
and (c)(34). In addition, the applicability of the regulations was 
extended to cover St. Joseph

[[Page 637]]

and Elkhart Counties. USEPA is taking no action on changes to 325 IAC 8-
1.1-2(f), Methods of Compliance, and the repeal of 325 IAC 8-5-6, 
Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning, because these exempt the compound 
perchloroethylene from control without the State justifying that such 
exemption is consistent with the Part D reasonably available control 
technology (RACT) requirements.

    Note: If Indiana allows use of a non-USEPA test method in the 
future, its use must be submitted to USEPA as a SIP revision.

    (i) Incorporation by reference. (A) Indiana's Volatile Organic

    (60) On January 18, 1984, Indiana submitted as a revision to the TSP 
SIP certain operating conditions and limits for three coke oven 
batteries at Citizens Gas and Coke Utility in Marion County. The 
operating permits included conditions and limits for Batteries E, H and 
Number One with respect to visible emissions from coke oven doors and 
pushing operations and allowable content of total dissolved solids in 
quench makeup water. EPA disapproves the limit on coke oven

[[Page 638]]

door visible emissions and total dissolved solids content for quench 
makeup water on Battery Number One, because the limits are inconsistent 
with that battery's Part C Prevention of Significant Deterioration 
requirements and Part D Lowest Achievable Emission Rate requirements. 
See subparagraphs (c)(34) and (c)(42) for further background on actions 
concerning coke oven batteries.
    (i) Incorporation by reference. (A) Certificates of Operation

    (C) A June 9, 1987, letter from Timothy Method, Acting Assistant 
Commissioner, submitting a general strategy and additional increments of 
progress required of Hammond Lead.
    (66) On October 21, 1987, the State of Indiana submitted 325 IAC 7-
1-3.1, Reporting Requirements and Methods to Determine Compliance, as a 
revision to its SO<INF>2</INF> plan. At paragraph (c)(19) of this 
section, USEPA approved/conditionally approved Indiana's SO<INF>2</INF> 
plan, 325 IAC 7-1, for most areas of the State. However, the emission 
limits in this plan were set aside by the Court of Appeals for the 
Seventh Circuit because USEPA took no action on the State's 30-day 
averaging compliance method in 325 IAC 7-1-3. New compliance method 325 
IAC 7-1-3.1 replaces former 325 IAC 7-1-3. Therefore, with EPA's 
approval of 325 IAC 7-1-3.1, USEPA is reinstating its March 12, 1982, 
approval of Indiana's October 6, 1980, SO<INF>2</INF> rule, 325 IAC 7-1-
1,7-1-2 (except for any emission limits in the below named counties), 7-
1-4, 7-1-5, 7-1-6, and 7-1-7. Other than these general provisions and 
325 IAC 7-1-3.1, USEPA is not acting on or approving today Indiana's 
SO<INF>2</INF> plan for Dearborn, Floyd, Gibson, Jefferson, Lake, 
LaPorte, Marion, Morgan, Porter, Sullivan, Vermillion, Vigo, Warrick, 
and Wayne Counties. Indiana recodified 325 IAC 7-1-1 through 7-1-7 to 
326 IAC 7-1-1 through 7-1-7 and submitted the recodified rules on 
November 16, 1988.

<R05>
Sec. 52.776  Control strategy: Particulate matter.

    (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since 
the plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the 
secondary standards for particulate matter in the Metropolitan 
Indianapolis Intrastate Region.
    (b) APC 4-R of Indiana's ``Air Pollution Control Regulations'' 
(emission limitation for particulate matter from fuel combustion 
sources), which is part of the control strategy for the secondary 
standards for particulate matter, is disapproved for the Metropolitan 
Indianapolis Intrastate Region since it does not provide the degree of 
control needed to attain and maintain the secondary standards for 
particulate matter. APC 4-R is approved for attainment and maintenance 
of the primary standards for particulate matter in the

[[Page 671]]

Metropolitan Indianapolis Intrastate Region.
    (c) APC-3 of Indiana's Air Pollution Control Regulations (visible 
emission limitation) is disapproved insofar as the phrase ``for more 
than a cumulative total of 15 minutes in a 24-hour period'' will 
interfere with attainment and maintenance of particulate standards.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Part D--Conditional Approval--The complete Indiana plan for 
Clark, Dearborn, Dubois, Marion (except for coke batteries), St. Joseph, 
Vanderburgh, and Vigo Counties is approved provided that the following 
condition is satisfied:
    (1) The Part D Plan must contain Industrial Fugitive Dust 
Regulations. The State must submit these by July 31, 1982.
    (f) 325 IAC 11-3-2(f), (as amended on August 27, 1981) is not 
approved as it applies to Lake and Marion Counties, insofar as it does 
not meet the requirements of section 172(b)(3) of the Clean Air Act.
    (g) 325 IAC 11-3-2(g) and 11-3-2(h) (as amended on August 27, 1981) 
are disapproved insofar as they do not meet the requirements of section 
110(a)(2)(D) of the Clean Air Act.
    (h) Equivalent Visible Emission Limits (EVEL). (1) A 20% 2-hour 
opacity limit for the underfire stack at Bethlehem Steel Corporation's 
Coke Battery No. 2 in Porter County is approved as an EVEL to determine 
compliance with the 325 IAC 6-2 SIP limit of 0.33 lbs/MMBTU. This EVEL 
is approved for as long as the SIP mass emission limit for this source 
remains the same as determined by 325 IAC 6-2 (October 6, 1980, 
submittal). See Sec. 52.770(c)(6), (35), and (42).
    (2) Revised opacity limits for the boilers at Olin Corporation in 
Warren County are approved at Sec. 52.770(c)(51) as an EVEL to 
determine compliance with the 325 IAC 6-2 SIP limit of 0.80 lbs/MMBTU. 
This EVEL is approved for as long as the SIP mass emission limit for 
this source remains the same as determined by 325 IAC 6-2 (October 6, 
1980 submittal). See Sec. 52.770(c)(6) and (35).
    (i) 325 IAC 6-2.1 is approved with the State's March 27, 1985, 
commitment that any ``bubble'' approved by the State under 325 IAC 6-
2.1-2(b) and 3(b) will also be subject to the State's general ``bubble'' 
regulation, 325 IAC 2-4. The State additionally committed that until 
such time as 325 IAC 2-4 is approved as a part of the SIP, all such 
limits approved under the bubbling provisions of 325 IAC 6-2.1-2(b) and 
3(b) will be submitted as site specific revisions to the SIP. Unless and 
until these emission point specific limits are approved as a portion of 
the SIP, the SIP limit for each individual emission point will remain 
the general limit calculated by means of the formulae in 325 IAC 6-2.1-
2(a) and 3(a), even though a revised emission point specific limit has 
been adopted by Indiana under 325 IAC 6-2.1-2(b) and 3(b). See 
52.770(c)(50).
    (j) [Reserved]
    (k) On January 18, 1984, Indiana submitted a visible emission limit 
on coke oven battery doors and a limit on total dissolved solids content 
of coke quench makeup water for Battery Number One at Citizens Gas and 
Coke Utility in Marion County. These limits are disapproved because they 
are impermissible relaxations of requirements for each new major 
stationary sources, as provided at Sec. 52.21(j)(2) and section 173 of 
the Clean Air Act. See Sec. 52.770(c)(60).
    (l) The revised Porter County TSP plan, as submitted by Indiana on 
October 15, 1984, is disapproved, because the State did not demonstrate 
that it assures the attainment and maintenance of the primary TSP NAAQS 
in Porter County, Indiana. See Sec. 52.770(c)(61).
    (m) The Indiana Part D TSP plan is disapproved insofar as it does 
not contain RACT level opacity limits for certain process fugitive 
sources in TSP nonattainment areas and, therefore, does not meet the 
requirements of section 172 of the Clean Air Act.
    (n) Approval--On June 23, 1988, and July 17, 1989, the State of 
Indiana submitted committal SIPs for particulate matter with an 
aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 micrometers 
(PM<INF>10</INF>) for the Group II areas within Marion and Vigo Counties 
and all of Porter County, respectively. The committal SIPs meet all the 
requirements identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the SIP 
requirements for PM<INF>10</INF> at 52 FR 24681.

[[Page 672]]

    (o) Approval--On November 16, 1988 and September 10, 1992, Indiana 
submitted the following list of control measures for particulate matter 
(PM) already in its State Implementation Plan as a Group III Plan: 326 
IAC 1-3-2, its air monitoring network, its list of possible additional 
sites for PM, its Prevention of Significant Deterioration rules and the 
following control measures which are part of 325 IAC: 2, Permit Review 
Rules; 5-1, Opacity Limitations; 6-1-1 to 6-1-6, Nonattainment Area 
Limitations; 6-1-8, Dearborn County; 6-1-9, Dubois County; 6-1-12, 
Marion County; 6-1-13, Vigo County; 6-1-14, Wayne County; 6-1-15, Howard 
County; 6-1-16, Vandenburgh County; 6-1-17, Clark County; 6-1-18, St. 
Joseph County; 6-2, Particulate Emissions Limitations for Sources of 
Indirect Heating; 6-3, Process Operations; 6-4, Fugitive Dust Emissions; 
11-1, Existing Foundries; 11-4, Fiberglass Insulation Manufacturing; 11-
5, Fluoride Emission Limitations for Existing Primary Aluminum Plants.
    (p) Approval--On January 13, 1993, the State of Indiana submitted a 
particulate matter State Implementation Plan revision for the Vermillion 
County nonattainment area. Additional information was submitted on 
February 22, 1993, and April 8, 1993. These materials demonstrate that 
the plan will provide for attainment of the National ambient air quality 
standards for particulate matter by December 31, 1994, in accordance 
with section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act.
    (q) Approval--On April 8, 1993, and supplemented on June 17, 1997, 
the State of Indiana submitted a maintenance plan and a request that 
sections 15, 16, 21, 22, 27, 28, 33 and 34 of Clinton Township in 
Vermillion County be redesignated to attainment of the National Ambient 
Air Quality Standard for particulate matter. The redesignation request 
and maintenance plan satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean 
Air Act.
    (r) Approval--EPA is approving the PM<INF>10</INF> maintenance plan 
for Lake County that Indiana submitted on September 25, 2002.
    (s) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined, as of November 
27, 2009, that the Chicago-Gary-Lake County, IL-IN PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
nonattainment area, which includes Lake and Porter counties in IN, and 
the Evansville nonattainment area have attained the 1997 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. These determinations, in accordance with 40 CFR 
51.1004(c), suspend the requirements for these areas to submit an 
attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control 
measures, reasonable further progress, contingency measures, and other 
plan elements related to attainment of the standard for as long as the 
area(s) continue to meet the 1997 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.

<R05>
Sec. 52.777  Control strategy: photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons).

    (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met 
because the plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards for photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons) in the 
Metropolitan Indianapolis Intrastate Region by May 31, 1975.
    (b) The requirements of subpart G are not met by Revised APC-15 
(November 8, 1974 submission) because it does not provide for attainment 
and maintenance of the photochemical oxidant (hydrocarbon) standards 
throughout Indiana.
    (c) Part D--Conditional approval--The 1979 Indiana plan for Clark, 
Floyd, Elkhart, Lake, Marion, Porter, and St. Joseph Counties is 
approved provided the following conditions are satisfied:
    (1) The plan for stationary source volatile organic compound control 
must contain the following:
    (i)-(iv) [Reserved]
    (v) For regulation 325 IAC 8-5, Section 6, Perchloroethylene Dry 
Cleaning, the State must conduct a study to demonstrate that the 1,500 
gallons exemption meets RACT requirements and submit the results to EPA 
within 6 months of the effective date of final rulemaking on 325 IAC 8 
for VOC from Group II CTG source categories. If the demonstrated 
emissions resulting from

[[Page 673]]

the State's exemption are not essentially equivalent to those resulting 
from the RACT requirements, then the State must submit to EPA by July 1, 
1983, a rule which requires control of emissions from dry cleaning 
sources using less than 1,500 gallons of perchloroethylene per year.
    (2) The stationary source volatile organic control measures 
submitted by the State on October 23, 1990, and August 19, 1991, are 
approved as described in 40 CFR 52.770(c)(87) with the exception of 326 
IAC 8-5-4 Pneumatic Rubber Tire Manufacturing, on which USEPA has taken 
no action. It should be noted that although the State's control measures 
provide that equivalent test methods, alternative emission controls, and 
revisions in rule applicability must be submitted to the USEPA as 
proposed revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP), such proposed 
SIP revisions are not part of the SIP unless and until they are approved 
as such by the USEPA.
    (d) Part D--Disapproval. The 1982 Indiana plan for Lake and Porter 
County is disapproved because it does not assure the attainment and 
maintenance of the NAAQS there. See Sec. Sec. 52.770(c)(69) and 
52.773(i). The disapproval does not affect USEPA's approval (or 
conditional approval) of individual parts of Indiana's ozone plan and 
they remain approved.
    (e) Approval--The Administrator approves the incorporation of the 
photochemical assessment ambient monitoring system submitted by Indiana 
on November 15, 1993, into the Indiana State Implementation Plan. This 
submittal satisfies 40 CFR 58.20(f), which requires the State to provide 
for the establishment and maintenance of photochemical assessment 
monitoring stations (PAMS) by November 12, 1993.
    (f) Approval. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management 
submitted two ozone redesignation requests and maintenance plans 
requesting the ozone nonattainment areas to be redesignated to 
attainment for ozone: South Bend/Elkhart (St. Joseph and Elkhart 
Counties), submitted on September 22, 1993; Indianapolis (Marion 
County), submitted on November 12, 1993. The redesignation requests and 
maintenance plans meet the redesignation requirements in section 
107(d)(3)(d) of the Act as amended in 1990. The redesignations meet the 
Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a 
revision to the Indiana Ozone State Implementation Plan for the above 
mentioned counties.
    (g) The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been 
satisfied for the following areas: Vanderburgh County in the Evansville 
Metropolitan Area; Marion County in the Indianapolis Metropolitan Area; 
and St. Joseph and Elkhart Counties in the South Bend Metropolitan Area.
    (h) On November 17, 1993, Indiana submitted two of three elements 
required by section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 to 
be incorporated as part of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) State 
Implementation Plan intended to offset any growth in emissions from a 
growth in vehicle miles traveled. These elements are the offsetting of 
growth in emissions attributable to growth in VMT which was due November 
15, 1992, and, any transportation control measures (TCMs) required as 
part of Indiana's 15 percent reasonable further progress (RFP) plan 
which was due November 15, 1993. Indiana satisfied the first requirement 
by projecting emissions from mobile sources and demonstrating that no 
increase in emissions would take place. Indiana satisfied the second 
requirement by determining that no TCMs were required as part of 
Indiana's 15 percent RFP plan.
    (i) Approval--EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new 
source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general 
conformity exemptions for the Indiana portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake 
County severe ozone nonattainment area as requested by the States of 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. 
This approval does not cover the exemption of NO<INF>X</INF> 
transportation conformity requirements of section 176(c) for this area. 
Approval of these exemptions is contingent on the results of the final 
ozone attainment

[[Page 674]]

demonstration expected to be submitted in mid-1997. The approval will be 
modified if the final attainment demonstration demonstrates that 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission controls are needed in the nonattainment area to 
attain the ozone standard in the Lake Michigan Ozone Study modeling 
domain.
    (j) The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been 
satisfied for Lake and Porter Counties, Indiana.
    (k) On June 26, 1995, and June 13, 1997, Indiana submitted a 15 
percent rate-of-progress plan for the Lake and Porter Counties portion 
of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County ozone nonattainment area. This plan 
satisfies the counties' requirements under section 182(b)(1) of the 
Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990.
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) On July 12, 1995, Indiana submitted a 15 percent rate-of-
progress plan for the Clark and Floyd Counties portion of the Louisville 
ozone nonattainment area. This plan satisfies Clark and Floyd Counties' 
requirements under section 182(b) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 
1990.
    (n) On July 12, 1995, Indiana submitted corrections to the 1990 base 
year emissions inventory for Clark and Floyd Counties. The July 12, 
1995, corrections are recognized revisions to Indiana's emissions 
inventory.
    (o) On July 12, 1995, Indiana submitted as a revision to the Indiana 
State Implementation Plan a ridesharing transportation control measure 
which affects commuters in Clark and Floyd Counties.
    (p) On August 26, 1996, Indiana submitted a rule for the purpose of 
meeting oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control 
technology (RACT) requirements under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act 
(Act) for the Clark and Floyd Counties moderate ozone nonattainment 
area. The rule's NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements meets RACT for 
major sources of portland cement kilns, electric utility boilers, and 
industrial, commercial, or institutional boilers. In addition, on April 
30, 1997, Indiana certified to the satisfaction of the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency that, to the best of the State's 
knowledge, there are no remaining major sources of NO<INF>X</INF> in 
Clark and Floyd Counties which need RACT rules. Indiana, therefore, has 
satisfied the NO<INF>X</INF> RACT requirements under section 182(f) of 
the Act for the Clark and Floyd Counties ozone nonattainment area.
    (q) Approval--On February 5, 1997, Indiana submitted a 
transportation control measure under section 108(f)(1)(A) of the Clean 
Air Amendments of 1990 for Vanderburgh County, Indiana to aid in 
reducing emissions of precursors of ozone. The transportation control 
measure being approved as a revision to the ozone state implementation 
plan is the conversion of at least 40 vehicles from gasoline as a fuel 
to compressed natural gas.
    (r) Indiana's November 15, 1996, request for a 1-year attainment 
date extension for the Indiana portion of the Louisville moderate ozone 
nonattainment area which consists of Clark and Floyd Counties is 
approved. The date for attaining the ozone standard in these counties is 
November 15, 1997.
    (s) Approval--On November 4, 1993, the State of Indiana submitted a 
maintenance plan and a request that Vanderburgh County be redesignated 
to attainment of the 1-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard for 
ozone. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the 
redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Clean Air Act 
as amended in 1990. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of 
section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Indiana 
ozone State Implementation Plan.
    (t) Approval--On May 24, 1996, the Indiana Department of 
Environmental Management submitted a revision to the ozone State 
Implementation Plan for Lake and Porter Counties. The submittal 
pertained to a plan for the implementation of the Federal transportation 
conformity requirements in accordance with 40 CFR part 51 subpart T--

Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 
23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act.
    (u) On December 17, 1997, and January 22, 1998, Indiana submitted 
the Post-1996 rate-of-progress plan for the

[[Page 675]]

Lake and Porter Counties portion of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County ozone 
nonattainment area. This plan satisfies the counties' requirements under 
section 182(c)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. The plan 
contains a 1999 mobile source vehicle emission budget for volatile 
organic compounds of 40,897 pounds per average summer day.
    (v) Negative declarations--Aerospace coating operations, industrial 
clean up solvents, industrial wastewater processes, offset lithography 
operations, business plastics, automotive plastics, and synthetic 
organic chemical manufacturing industries (SOCMI) batch processes, 
reactors and distillation units categories. On November 8, 1999, the 
State of Indiana certified to the satisfaction of the Environmental 
Protection Agency that no major sources categorized as part of the nine 
categories listed above and have a potential to emit 100 tons or more of 
volatile organic compounds annually are located in Clark or Floyd 
Counties in southeast Indiana, adjacent to Louisville, Kentucky.
    (w) Negative declarations--Aerospace coating operations, industrial 
clean up solvents, industrial wastewater processes, offset lithography 
operations, business plastics, automotive plastics, and synthetic 
organic chemical manufacturing industries (SOCMI) batch processes, 
reactors and distillation units categories. On November 8, 1999, and 
January 10, 2000, the State of Indiana certified to the satisfaction of 
the Environmental Protection Agency that no major sources categorized as 
part of the nine categories listed above and have a potential to emit 25 
tons or more of volatile organic compounds annually are located in Lake 
or Porter Counties in northwest Indiana.
    (x) The request submitted by Indiana on April 11, 2001 and 
supplemented on August 24, 2001, to redesignate the Indiana portion of 
the Louisville moderate interstate ozone nonattainment area from 
nonattainment to attainment was approved on October 23, 2001. The motor 
vehicle emissions budgets for VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> in the Indiana 
portion of the Louisville moderate interstate maintenance plan are 
adequate for conformity purposes and approvable as part of the 
maintenance plan. The 1-hour ozone standard maintenance plan motor 
vehicle emission budgets for the entire interstate Louisville area for 
the purposes of transportation conformity are now 48.17 tons per summer 
day of VOC and 92.93 tons per summer day of NO<INF>X</INF> for the year 
2012.
    (y) Lake and Porter Counties Attainment Demonstration Approval--On 
December 21, 2000, Indiana submitted a 1-hour ozone attainment 
demonstration plan as a requested revision to the Indiana State 
Implementation Plan. This approval includes: A modeled demonstration of 
attainment, a plan to reduce ozone precursor emissions by 3 percent per 
year from 2000 to 2007, and associated conformity budgets for 2002 and 
2005, a revision to the NO<INF>X</INF> waiver, a contingency measures 
plan for both the ozone attainment demonstration and the post-1999 ROP 
plan, the conformity budgets for the 2007 attainment year, until such 
time that revised budgets are submitted and found adequate for 
conformity purposes as called for by the state in its commitment to 
recalculate and apply a revised budget for conformity within two years 
of the formal release of MOBILE6, the RACM analysis, the commitment to 
conduct a mid-course review of the attainment status of the Lake 
Michigan area, and an agreed order between U.S. Steel (currently USX 
Corporation) and the IDEM signed by IDEM on March 22, 1996, which 
requires U.S. Steel to establish a coke plant process water treatment 
plant at its Gary Works. Today's action finalizes approval of Indiana's

    (9) [Reserved]
    (10) Approval to construct or modify shall not relieve any owner or 
operator of the responsibility to comply with all local, State, and 
Federal regulations which are part of the applicable plan.
    (11) Any owner or operator who constructs, modifies, or operates a 
stationary source not in accordance with the application, as approved 
and conditioned by the Administrator, or any owner or operator of a 
stationary source subject to this paragraph who commences construction 
or modification without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, 
shall be subject to enforcement action under section 113 of the Act.
    (e) The requirements of subpart I of this chapter are not met 
because the State failed to submit a plan for review of new or modified 
indirect sources.
    (f) Regulation for review of new or modified indirect sources. The 
provisions of Sec. 52.22(b) are hereby incorporated by reference and 
made a part of the applicable implementation of the plan for the State

    (g) Delegation of authority. (1) The Administrator shall have the 
authority to delegate responsibility for implementing the procedures for 
conducting source review pursuant to this section in accordance with 
paragraphs (f) (2), (3), and (4) of this section.
    (2) Where the Administrator delegates the responsibility for 
implementing the procedures for conducting source review pursuant to 
this section to any Agency, other than a Regional Office of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, a copy of the notice pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section shall be sent to the Administrator 
through the appropriate Regional Office.
    (3) In accordance with Executive Order 11752, the Administrator's 
authority for implementing the procedures for conducting source review 
pursuant to this section shall not be delegated, other than to a 
Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, for new or 
modified sources which are owned or operated by the Federal Government 
or for new or modified sources located on Federal lands; except that, 
with respect to the latter category, where new or modified sources are 
constructed or operated on Federal lands pursuant to leasing or other 
Federal agreements, the Federal Land Manager may at his discretion, to 
the extent permissible under applicable statutes and regulations, 
require the lessee or permittee to be subject to new source review 
requirements which have been delegated to a State or local agency 
pursuant to this paragraph.
    (4) The Administrator's authority for implementing the procedures 
for conducting source review pursuant to this section shall not be 
redelegated, other than to a Regional Office of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, for new or modified sources which are located in 
Indian reservations except where the State has assumed jurisdiction over 
such land under other laws, in which case the Administrator may delegate 
his authority to the States in accordance with paragraphs (g) (2), (3), 
and (4) of this section.
    (h) On March 7, 1994, Indiana requested a revision to the State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) for New Source Review (NSR) to satisfy the 
requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Indiana 326 
IAC regulations do not include a definition of ``federally 
enforceable''. On July 13, 1994, Pamela Carter, Attorney General of the 
State of Indiana, sent a letter to USEPA clarifying Indiana's 
interpretation of the definition of federally enforceable. The letter 
states that federally enforceable, e.g. as used in 326 IAC 2-3-1, should 
be interpreted in accordance with the federal definition at 40 CFR 
51.165(a)(1)(xiv). The USEPA took the opportunity of rulemaking on the 
State's submittal to recodify the permitting SIP to conform to Title 326 
the Indiana Administrative Code.

Sec. 52.785  Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.

    (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met 
because the plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards for carbon monoxide in the Metropolitan Indianapolis 
Intrastate Region by May 31, 1975.
    (b) On December 21, 1999, the Indiana Department of Environmental 
Management submitted carbon monoxide maintenance plans for those 
portions of Lake and Marion Counties which they requested the 
Environmental Protection Agency redesignate to attainment of the carbon 
monoxide national ambient air quality standard.
    (c) Approval--The Indiana Department of Environmental Management 
(IDEM) submitted Carbon Monoxide (CO) Limited Maintenance Plan Updates 
for Lake and Marion Counties on January 12, 2009. The updated Limited 
Maintenance Plans demonstrate attainment of the CO National Ambient Air 
Quality Standard (NAAQS) for Lake and Marion Counties for an additional 
ten years.

of Marion and the Consolidated City of Indianapolis shall jointly submit 
to the Administrator, for his approval, legally adopted legislation and/
or regulations establishing the regulatory scheme for

[[Page 683]]

the inspection/maintenance program required by paragraph (c) of this 
section. The legislation and/or regulations shall include:
    (1) Provisions requiring inspection of all light-duty motor vehicles 
subject to the inspection program required by paragraph (c) of this 
section at periodic intervals no more than 1 year apart by means of an 
idle test. Any class or category of vehicles that are found to be rarely 
used on public streets and highways (such as classic or antique 
vehicles) may be exempted.
    (2) Provisions for regulatory criteria that are consistent with 
achieving an 11 percent reduction of hydrocarbon emissions from light-
duty vehicles.
    (3) Provisions ensuring that failed vehicles receive, within 30 
days, the maintenance necessary to achieve compliance with the 
inspection standards. These provisions shall impose sanctions against 
owners of non-complying vehicles, require retest of failed vehicles 
following maintenance, require a suitable distinctive tag or sticker for 
display on complying vehicles, and include such other measures as are 
necessary or appropriate.
    (4) Provisions establishing a certification program to ensure that 
testing stations performing the required tests have the necessary 
equipment and knowledgeable operators to perform the tests 
satisfactorily, imposing sanctions against non-complying testing 
stations, and containing such other measures as necessary or appropriate 
to a testing program.
    (5) Provisions prohibiting vehicles from being intentionally 
readjusted or modified subsequent to the inspection and/or maintenance 
in such a way as would cause them no longer to comply with the 
inspection standards. These may include authorization of spot checks of 
idle adjustments or of a suitable type of physical seal or tag on 
vehicles. These provisions shall include appropriate penalties for 
violation by any person.
    (6) Designation of agency or agencies responsible for conducting, 
overseeing, and enforcing the inspection/maintenance program. Private 
parties may be designated to conduct parts of the program to certify 
compliance.
    (e) After July 1, 1976, the State of Indiana, County of Marion, the 
Consolidated City of Indianapolis, and other municipalities in Marion 
County shall not allow the operation on streets, roads, or highways 
under their ownership or control of any light duty motor vehicle subject 
to the inspection program established pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section that does not comply with the applicable standards and 
procedures adopted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) After July 1, 1976, no person shall operate or allow the 
operation of any motor vehicle subject to the inspection program 
established pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section that does not 
comply with the applicable standards and procedures adopted in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (g) No later than October 1, 1974, the State of Indiana, County of 
Marion, and the Consolidated City of Indianapolis shall jointly submit 
to the Administrator, for his approval, a detailed compliance schedule 
showing the steps they will take to establish, operate and enforce the 
inspection program required by paragraph (c) of this section including:
    (1) A detailed description of the inspection program required by 
paragraph (c) of this section (including a description of the way in 
which the program will be established, operated, and enforced and the 
respective responsibilities of the State, county, and municipalities for 
such tasks).
    (2) A description of the legal authority for establishing and 
enforcing the inspection/maintenance program, including the text of 
proposed or adopted legislation and regulations.
    (3) Specific dates (day, month, and year) by which various steps to 
implement the inspection/maintenance system will be completed, such 
steps to include, at a minimum, the following: submitting final plans 
and specifications for the system to the Administrator for this approval 
(this date to be no later than February 1, 1975), ordering necessary 
equipment (this date to be no later than April 15, 1975), commencement 
of onsite construction and/or installation, and system operational (this 
date to be no later than April 15,

[[Page 684]]

1975, commencement of onsite construction and/ior installation, and 
system operational (this date to be no later than July 1, 1975).
    (4) An identification of the sources and amounts of funds necessary 
to implement the system together with written assurances from the chief 
executive officers of the State, city, and county that they will seek 
such necessary funding from the appropriate legislative bodies.
    (5) Other provisions necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
program.
    (h) The State's December 2, 1992, commitment to timely adopt and 
implement enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M) rules for Lake and 
Porter Counties is disapproved based on the failure of the State of 
Indiana to meet important milestones pertaining to the development and 
adoption of necessary authority for the I/M program. This disapproval 
initiates the sanction process of section 179(a) of the Act.

Sec. 52.787  Gasoline transfer vapor control.

    (a) Gasoline means any petroleum distillate having a Reid vapor 
pressure of 4 pounds or greater.
    (b) This section is applicable in the County of Marion, Indiana 
(including all cities, towns and municipal corporations therein).
    (c) No person shall transfer or permit the transfer of gasoline from 
any delivery vessel into any stationary source container with a capacity 
greater than 250 gallons unless such container is equipped with a 
submerged fill pipe and unless the displaced vapors from the storage 
container are processed by a control system that prevents release to the 
atmosphere of no less than 90 percent by weight of organic compounds in 
said vapors displaced from the stationary storage container location. 
The control system shall include one or more of the following:
    (1) A vapor-tight return line from the storage container to the 
delivery vessel and a system that will ensure that the vapor return line 
is connected before gasoline can be transferred into the container. If a 
``vapor-balance return'' system is used to meet the requirements of this 
section, the system shall be so constructed as to be readily adapted to 
retrofit with an adsorption system, refrigeration-condensation system or 
equivalent system connected to the stationary storage container.
    (2) Refrigeration-condensation sys- tem or adsorption system 
connected to the stationary storage container.
    (3) An equivalent system, approved by the Administrator or his 
designee, designed to recover or eliminate no less than 90 percent by 
weight of the organic compounds in the displaced vapor.
    (d) No person shall own or operate a delivery vessel containing 
gasoline unless the delivery vessel is so designed and maintained as to 
be vapor-tight at all times. This paragraph (d) shall not apply to 
delivery vessels in transit through Marion County which neither are 
filled nor deliver gasoline therein, nor shall this paragraph (d) be 
construed to prohibit safety-valves on other devices required by 
governmental safety regulations. Delivery vessels which are filled in 
Marion County but do not deliver in Marion County may be controlled only 
for filling.
    (e) No person shall own or operate a facility for the filling of 
delivery vessels with gasoline unless the facility is equipped with a 
control system, which can recover or eliminate at least 90 percent by 
weight of the organic compounds in the vapors displaced from the 
delivery vessel during refilling. Facilities which have a daily 
throughput of 20,000 gallons or less are required to have a vapor 
recovery system in operation no later than May 31, 1977. Delivery 
vessels and storage containers served exclusively by facilities required 
to have a vapor recovery system in operation no later than May 31, 1977, 
also will be required to meet the provisions of this section no later 
than May 31, 1977.
    (f) After March 1, 1976, no person shall intentionally release 
gasoline vapors from a delivery vessel, except to a control system that 
can recover or eliminate at least 90 percent by weight

[[Page 685]]

of organic compounds in the vapors released.
    (g) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply 
to the following:
    (1) Stationary containers having a capacity less than 550 gallons 
used exclusively for the fueling of farming equipment.
    (2) Any stationary container having a capacity less than 2,000 
gallons installed prior to promulgation of this paragraph.
    (3) Transfer made to storage tanks equipped with floating roofs or 
their equivalent.
    (4) Gasoline storage compartments of 1,000 gallons or less in 
gasoline delivery vessels in use on the promulgated date of this 
regulation will not be required to be retrofitted with a vapor return 
system until January 1, 1977.
    (h) The operation of a source, otherwise, subject to paragraph (c), 
(d), or (e) of this section, shall not be a violation of paragraph (c), 
(d), or (e), respectively, if the following acts shall be completed with 
respect to such source before the following dates:
    (1) October 1, 1974. The owner of the source or his designee shall 
submit to the Administrator, a final control plan, which describes at a 
minimum the steps that will be taken by the source to achieve compliance 
with the applicable provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this 
section.
    (2) March 1, 1975. Negotiate and sign all necessary contracts for 
control systems, or issue orders for the purchase of component parts to 
accomplish emission control.
    (3) May 1, 1975. Initiate on-site construction or installation of 
control system equipment.
    (4) February 1, 1976. Complete on-site construction or installation 
of control system equipment.
    (5) March 1, 1976. Achieve final compliance with the applicable 
provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
    (6) Any owner of a source subject to the compliance schedule in this 
paragraph shall certify to the Administrator, within 5 days after the 
deadline for each increment of progress, whether or not the required 
increment of progress has been met.
    (i) As an alternative to compliance with the schedule under 
paragraph (h) of this section:
    (1) The owner of a source which is in compliance with the provisions 
of paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, shall certify such 
compliance to the Administrator by October 1, 1974. The Administrator 
may request whatever supporting information he considers necessary for 
proper certification.
    (2) A source for which a compliance schedule is adopted by the State 
and approved by the Administrator may operate in conformity with such 
compliance schedule.
    (3) The owner of a source may submit to the Administrator, by 
October 1, 1974, a proposed alternative compliance schedule. No such 
schedule may provide for compliance after March 1, 1976. Until 
promulgated by the Administrator, such source shall conform with 
applicable portions of paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (h) of this section. 
Upon promulgation of the compliance schedule by the Administrator, no 
person shall own or operate the source except in conformity with the 
promulgated schedule.
    (j) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Administrator from 
promulgating a separate schedule for any source to which the application 
of the compliance schedule in paragraph (h) of this section fails to 
satisfy the requirements of Sec. 51.15 (b) and (c) of this chapter.
    (k) Any new container, facility, or vessel subject to this 
regulation that is placed in operation after October 1, 1974, shall 
within 30 days of commencing operation submit a compliance schedule in 
conformity with paragraph (i) of this section and shall otherwise comply

Sec. 52.793  Significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air 
Act are not met, since the plan does not include approvable procedures 
for preventing the significant deterioration of air quality.
    (b) Regulations for preventing significant deterioration of air

    (c) 325 IAC 5-1 (October 6, 1980, submittal--Sec. 52.770(c)(53)) is 
disapproved for the Lake County sources specifically listed in Table 2 
of 325 IAC 6-1-10.2 (Sec. 52.770(c)(57)); for pushing and quenching 
sources throughout the State (August 27, 1981, 325 IAC 11-3-2 (g) and 
(h)--Sec. 52.770(c)(42)); and for coke oven doors in Lake and Marion 
Counties (325 IAC 11-3-2(f)--Sec. 52.770(c)(42)). Applicability of this 
regulation to these sources is being disapproved because 325 IAC 5-1 
does not meet the enforceability requirements of Sec. 51.22 as it 
applies to these sources. Opacity limits in 325 IAC 6-1-10.2 and certain 
opacity limits in 325 IAC 11-3 supersede those in 325 IAC 5-1, and USEPA 
has previously disapproved these superseding regulations (Sec. 52.776 
(j), (g), and (f), respectively).

    (a) Revised APC-13 (December 5, 1974 submission) of Indiana's Air 
Pollution Control regulations (sulfur dioxide emission limitation) is 
disapproved insofar as the provisions identified below will interfere 
with the attainment and maintenance of the suffix dioxide ambient air 
quality standards:
    (1) The phrase ``equivalent full load'' in section 1(b)(2).
    (2) The formula ``E<INF>p</INF>=17.0 Q<INF>m</INF>\0.67\ where 
E<INF>p</INF>=E<INF>m</INF>xQ<INF>m</INF>'' in section 2(a).

3(c), 4(b), and 4(c).
    (4) The modification of Q<INF>m</INF> for non-Indiana coal as 
expressed in Section 2(a).
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.281 are not met by Warrick and 
Culley electrical generating stations enforcement orders which would 
revise the sulfur dioxide emission limitations for these two stations.
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 51.110(e) are not met by Wayne, 
Dearborn, Jefferson, Porter, and Warrick Counties.
    (d)-(e) [Reserved]
    (f) Approval--On March 14, 1996, the State of Indiana submitted a 
maintenance plan for Lawrence, Washington, and Warren Townships in 
Marion County and the remainder of the county, and requested that it be 
redesignated to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard 
for sulfur dioxide. The redesignation request and maintenance plan 
satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.
    (g) Approval--On June 17, 1996, the State of Indiana submitted a 
maintenance plan for LaPorte, Vigo, and Wayne Counties and requested 
redesignation to attainment for the National Ambient Air Quality

maintenance plans satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air 
Act.
    (h) Approval--On June 21, 2005, and as supplemented on August 11, 
2005, the State of Indiana submitted a request to redesignate the Lake 
County sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) nonattainment area to attainment 
of the NAAQS. In its submittal, the State also requested that EPA 
approve the maintenance plan for the area into the Indiana 
SO<INF>2</INF> SIP. The redesignation request and maintenance plan 
satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.

they do not meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.214.
    (b)(1) The requirements of 40 CFR 51, Appendix P 3.3 are hereby 
incorporated and made a part of the applicable implementation plan for 
the State of Indiana.
    (2) APC-8 does not apply to any source scheduled for retirement by 
October 6, 1980, or within five years after the promulgation of 
continuous emission monitoring requirements for that source category in 
40 CFR part 51, Appendix P 1.1, provided that adequate evidence and

Sec. 52.797  Control strategy: Lead.(a)-(b) [Reserved]

    (c) On January 12, 1988, Indiana'a Office of Air Management (OAM), 
Indiana Department of Environmental Management, agreed to review all 
relevant hood designs and performance guidance to determine which 
criteria to use in determining ongoing compliance with the capture 
efficiency provisions in 326 IAC 15-1 for Quemetco, Inc., and Refined 
Metals. Because these efficiencies are closely related to equipment 
design, OAM believes that a review of the process and control equipment 
designs and operating paramenters should provide the necessary 
determination of compliance. OAM will work with the Indianapolis local 
agency, the Indianapolis Air Pollution Control Division, on viable 
alternatives and will keep USEPA up to date on its progress. OAM 
anticipates that specific criteria for determining compliance will be 
incorporated into the sources' operation permits (and forwarded to USEPA 
for informational purposes), and, should the opportunity arise, 326 IAC 
15-1 will be revised to similarly incorporate capture efficiency 
criteria.
    (d) On March 2, 2000, Indiana submitted a maintenance plan for 
Marion County as part of its request to redesignate the County to 
attainment of the lead standard.
    (e) On April 1, 2009, Indiana submitted an updated maintenance plan 
under section 175A of the CAA for Marion County for the continued 
attainment of the 1.5 [micro]g/m\3\ lead standard.

Sec. 52.823  PM[bdi1][bdi0] State Implementation Plan Development in Group II Areas.

    The Iowa Department of Natural Resources committed to comply with 
the PM<INF>10</INF> regulations as set forth in 40 CFR part 51. In a 
letter to Morris Kay, EPA, dated October 28, 1988, Mr. Larry J. Wilson, 
Director, Iowa Department of Natural Resources, stated:

    Three groups within the State of Iowa have been classified as Group 
II areas for fine particulate (PM-10) State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
development purposes. This includes portions of the cities of Des 
Moines, Mason City, and Cedar Rapids. The specific boundaries of these 
areas were identified in a letter of October 13, 1987, from Peter R. 
Hamlin to Carl Walter. The remainder of the State was classified as 
Group III.
    In accordance with the SIP development procedures identified in the 
preamble of the PM-10 regulations for Implementing Revised Particulate 
Matter Standards, promulgated July 1, 1987, the State of Iowa commits to 
perform the following activities in these three Group II areas of the 
state:

    (a) Gather ambient PM-10 data, to an extent consistent with minimum 
EPA requirements (note the network description contained in a letter of 
January 26, 1988, from Peter R. Hamlin to John Helvig).
    (b) Analyze and verify the ambient PM-10 data and report exceedances 
of the 24-hour PM-10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to 
the Regional Office within 60 days of each exceedance.
    (c) Immediately notify the Regional Office:
    (1) Upon the availability of an appropriate number of verifiable 24-
hour NAAQS exceedances to indicate a violation (see Section 2.0 of the 
PM-10 SIP development guideline) or
    (2) when an annual arithmetic mean (AAM) above the annual PM-10 
NAAQS becomes available.
    (d) Within thirty (30) days of any notification of the Regional 
Office pursuant to (c) above (or upon collection of thirty-six (36) 
months of PM-10 ambient air quality data acceptable to EPA, whichever 
comes first) determine whether the measures in the existing SIP will 
assure timely attainment and maintenance of the primary PM-10 NAAQS and 
immediately notify the Regional Office of the results of this 
determination.
    (e) Within six (6) months of any notification pursuant to (d) above, 
adopt and submit to EPA a PM-10 control strategy that assures attainment 
as expeditiously as practicable but not later than three (3) years from 
approval of the Committal SIP.

    Because of the uncertainty about when the determination can be made 
pursuant to (d) above, it is difficult to determine if that control 
strategy could provide for the attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS within 
three years from the date EPA approves this Committal SIP. Therefore, I 
reserve the right to request a two-year extension of the attainment date 
as provided in Section 110(e) of the Clean Air Act, if and when the 
State of Iowa

[[Page 697]]

submits a SIP revision for any of these areas of the state.
    The State of Iowa also commits to develop a PM-10 emission inventory 
for the areas submitted as part of any PM-10 SIP pursuant to items (c), 
(d), and (e) above. If the PM-10 NAAQS are not violated, the State of 
Iowa will proceed with this inventory for the three Group II areas in 
accordance with the following schedule:

October 1, 1988--Request special assistance funds from EPA to perform 
the inventory.
October 1, 1989--Initiate inventory.
August 1, 1990--Complete inventory.
October 31, 1990 *--Submit inventory as part of a determination of 
adequacy that the current SIP will attain and maintain the PM-10 NAAQS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Presuming that sufficient ambient data acceptable to EPA are 
collected by July 31, 1990, and available by September 30, 1990.

Sec. 52.872  Operating permits.

    Emission limitations and related provisions which are established in 
Kansas operating permits as Federally enforceable conditions shall be 
enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not 
Federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to 
appropriate procedures and be based upon the permit, permit approval 
procedures, or permit requirements which do not conform with the 
operating permit program requirements or the requirements of EPA 
underlying regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 52.873  Approval status.

    (a) The Kansas portion of the Kansas City metropolitan area was 
designated as nonattainment for ozone in 40 CFR part 81. Therefore, the 
Administrator approves continuation of the 7.8 RVP limit as federally 
enforceable in the Kansas City metropolitan area, even after the area is 
redesignated to attainment, because of its nonattainment designation 
effective January 6, 1992. Also, the requirement for 7.8 psi RVP 
volatility is deemed necessary to ensure attainment and maintenance of 
the ozone standard as demonstrated by the emissions inventory 
projections (based on use of 7.8 psi RVP) in Kansas' ozone maintenance 
plan for the Kansas City metropolitan area.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The Administrator approves Rule K.A.R. 28-19-31 as identified at 
Sec. 52.870(c)(29), with the understanding that any alternative 
compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved by EPA as 
individual SIP revisions.

<R05>
Sec. 52.874  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met 
since authority to make emission data available to the public is 
inadequate. Kansas Statutes Annotated 65-3015 would require confidential 
treatment if the data related to processes or production unique to the 
owner or would tend to affect adversely the competitive position of the 
owner.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.232(b) of this chapter are not met 
since the following deficiencies exist in the local agency legal 
authority:
    (1) Kansas City, Kans.-Wyandotte County Health Department. (i) 
Authority to make emission data available to the

[[Page 712]]

public is inadequate because the Kansas Statutes Annotated 65-3016 
provides a designated local air quality conservation authority with the 
same authority as the State (Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter).
    (2) Topeka-Shawnee County Health Department. (i) Authority to make 
emission data available to the public is inadequate because the Kansas 
Statutes Annotated 65-3016 provides a designated air quality 
conservation authority with the same authority as the State (Sec. 
51.230(f) of this chapter).
    (3) Wichita-Sedgwick County Health Department. (i) Authority to make 
emission data available to the public is inadequate because the Kansas 
Statutes Annotated 65-3016 provides a designated local air quality 
conservation authority with the same authority as the State (Sec. 
51.230(f) of this chapter).
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met 
since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or 
operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or 
combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions 
of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance 
of a national air quality standard is not adequate.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.260 and of Sec. 51.15(a)(2) of 
this chapter as of September 19, 1976 (40 FR 43216), are not met since 
the plan does not contain legally enforceable compliance schedules 
setting forth the dates by which all stationary sources or categories of 
such sources must be in compliance with applicable portions of the 
control strategy. Paragraphs C and D of Kansas Regulation 28-19-9 
specify that all sources not in compliance must submit an acceptable 
compliance schedule within 120 days after receiving notification from 
the State. There are no assurances that all sources will be notified by 
the State in a timely manner, therefore, paragraphs C and D of 
Regulation 28-19-9 are disapproved.
    (b) Federal compliance schedule. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(2) of this paragraph (b), the owner or operator of any stationary 
source subject to any emission regulation which is part of the approved 
plan shall be in compliance on or before January 31, 1974.
    (i) Any owner or operator in compliance with any such applicable 
regulation on the effective date of this paragraph shall certify such 
compliance to the Administrator no later than December 31, 1972.
    (ii) Any owner or operator who achieves compliance with any such 
applicable regulation after the effective date of this paragraph shall 
certify such compliance to the Administrator within 5 days of the date 
compliance is achieved.
    (2) An owner or operator of a stationary source subject to any 
emission regulation approved by the Administrator may no later than 
December 31, 1972, submit to the Administrator for approval a proposed 
compliance schedule that demonstrates compliance with such regulation as 
expeditiously as practicable, but no later than July 31, 1975. The 
compliance schedule shall provide for periodic increments of progress 
toward compliance. The dates for achievement of such increments shall be 
specified. Increments of progress shall include, but not be limited to: 
Letting of necessary contracts for construction or process changes, if 
applicable; initiation of construction; completion and startup of 
control systems; performance tests; and submittal of performance test 
analysis and results.
    (3) Any owner or operator who submits a compliance schedule pursuant 
to this paragraph shall, within 5 days after the deadline for each 
increment of progress, certify to the Administrator whether or not the 
required increment of the approved compliance schedule has been met.
    (4) Any compliance schedule adopted by the State and approved by the 
Administrator shall satisfy the requirements of this paragraph for the 
affected source.
    (c) State compliance schedules. (1) [Reserved]
    (2) The compliance schedules identified below are disapproved as not 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 51.102 or subpart N of this chapter. 
All regulations cited are air pollution control regulations of the 
state, unless otherwise noted.

<R05>
Sec. 52.922  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.923  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Kentucky's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements of Part D, 
Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. 
In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for 
the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of 
RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued 
between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each 
subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered 
by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) New Source review permits issued pursuant to Section 173 of the 
Clean Air Act will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of 
Section V of Appendix S of 40 CFR part 51 are met.

[45 FR 72157, Oct. 31, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 52.924  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met 
since K.R.S. 224.380 of the Air Pollution Control Law of the 
Commonwealth of Kentucky (June 18, 1970) does not provide for the 
release, under certain circumstances, of emission data to the public.
    (b) Delegation of Authority: Pursuant to section 114 of the Act, 
Kentucky requested a delegation of authority to enable it to collect, 
correlate, and release emission data to the public. The Administrator 
has determined that Kentucky is qualified to receive a delegation of the 
authority it requested. Accordingly, the Administrator delegates to 
Kentucky his authority under section 114(a) (1) and (2) and section 
114(c) of the Act, i.e., authority to collect, correlate, and release 
emission data to the public.

<R05>
Sec. 52.925  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission 
data is inadequate.

Sec. 52.927  Compliance schedules.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.262(a) of this chapter are not met 
since compliance schedules with adequate increments of progress have not 
been submitted for every source for which they are required.
    (b) Federal compliance schedules.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the 
owner or operator of any fuel-burning facility subject to the 
requirements of the Kentucky Air Pollution Control Regulations as they 
apply to sulfur dioxide sources, shall notify the Regional 
Administrator, by no later than November 3, 1975, of his intent to 
utilize either low-sulfur fuel or stack gas desulfurization to meet 
these requirements.
    (2) Any owner or operator of a stationary source subject to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section who elects to utilize low-sulfur fuel 
shall be subject to the following compliance schedule:
    (i) December 1, 1975--Submit to the Regional Administrator a 
projection of the amount of fuel, by types, that will be substantially 
adequate to enable compliance with the applicable regulation on July 1, 
1977, and for at least one year thereafter, as well as a statement as to 
whether boiler modifications will be required. If so, final plans for 
such modifications must be submitted simultaneously.
    (ii) December 31, 1975--Sign contracts with fuel suppliers for 
projected fuel requirements as projected above.
    (iii) December 31, 1975--Let contracts for necessary boiler 
modifications, if applicable.

[[Page 729]]

    (iv) January 30, 1976--Initiate onsite modifications, if applicable.
    (v) May 1, 1977--Complete onsite modifications, if applicable.
    (vi) July 1, 1977--Achieve compliance with the applicable 
regulations, and certify such compliance to the Regional Administrator.
    (3) Any owner or operator subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section who elects to utilize stack gas desulfurization shall be subject 
to the following compliance schedule:
    (i) December 1, 1975--Submit to the Regional Administrator a final 
control plan, which describes at a minimum the steps which will be taken 
by the source to achieve compliance with the applicable regulations.
    (ii) December 31, 1975--Negotiate and sign all necessary contracts 
for emission control systems or process modifications, or issue orders 
for the purchase of component parts to accomplish emission control or 
process modifications.
    (iii) January 30, 1976--Initiate onsite construction or installation 
of emission control equipment or process modification.
    (iv) May 1, 1977--Complete onsite construction or installation or 
emission control equipment or process modification.
    (v) July 1, 1977--Complete shakedown operations and performance 
tests for the applicable unit(s); achieve compliance with Kentucky 
Division of Air Pollution Regulation for sulfur dioxide sources and 
certify such compliance to the Regional Administrator. Ten days prior to 
any performance testing, notice must be given to the Regional 
Administrator to afford him the opportunity to have an observer present.
    (4) Five days after the deadline for completing increments in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (b)(2)(v) and (b)(3)(ii) through 
(b)(3)(iv) of this section, certify to the Regional Administrator 
whether the increment has been met.
    (5) (i) None of the above paragraphs shall apply to a source which 
is presently in compliance with applicable regulations. The owner or 
operator of any fuel-burning facility with an aggregate heat input of 
more than 250 million BTU per hour which is presently in compliance, 
shall certify such compliance to the Regional Administrator by November 
3, 1975. The Regional Administrator may request whatever supporting 
information he considers necessary for proper certification.
    (ii) Any compliance schedule adopted by the State and approved by 
the Administrator shall satisfy the requirements of this paragraph for 
the affected source.
    (iii) Any owner or operator subject to a compliance schedule in this 
paragraph may submit to the Regional Administrator no later than 
December 1, 1975, a proposed alternative compliance schedule. No such 
compliance schedule may provide for final compliance after the final 
compliance date in the applicable compliance schedule of this paragraph. 
If approved by the Administrator, such schedule shall satisfy the 
requirements of this paragraph for the affected source.
    (6) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Administrator from 
promulgating a separate schedule for any source to which the application 
of a compliance schedule in this paragraph fails to satisfy the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 51.261 and 51.262(a) of this chapter.

continue to meet all the requirements of Jefferson County Regulation 
6.29.

[[Page 730]]

    (b) Part D--disapproval--(1) Campbell and Kenton Counties 
nonattainment area. The 1979 SIP revisions for these two counties are 
disapproved because the Commonwealth failed to submit evidence of legal 
authority to implement a vehicle inspection and maintenance program as 
required under section 172(b)(11)(B) of the Clean Air Act. No major new 
or modified sources of volatile organic compounds can be built in these 
two counties by virtue of the provisions of section 110(a)(2)(l) of the 
Clean Air Act.
    (2) Northern Kentucky (Boone, Campbell and Kenton Counties) ozone 
nonattainment area. The demonstration of attainment of the ozone 
standards by the end of 1982, submitted as part of Kentucky's ozone SIP 
revision on June 23, 1982, (draft), September 27, 1982, and November 3, 
1982, is disapproved. As a result, the extension of the attainment 
deadline until December 31, 1987, remains in effect, along with the 
related requirement to submit a SIP revision addressing all requirements 
of Part D extension areas.
    (c) The redesignation request submitted by the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, on November 11, 1994, for the Kentucky portion of the 
Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky moderate interstate ozone nonattainment 
area from nonattainment to attainment was disapproved on September 27, 
1996.
    (d) Kentucky's November 15, 1996, request for a 1-year attainment 
date extension for the Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton 
metropolitan moderate ozone nonattainment area which consists of Kenton, 
Boone, and Campbell Counties is approved. The date for attaining the 
ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1997.
    (e) Kentucky's November 15, 1996, request for a 1-year attainment 
date extension for the Kentucky portion of the Louisville moderate ozone 
nonattainment area which consists of Jefferson County and parts of 
Bullitt and Oldham Counties is approved. The date for attaining the 
ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1997.
    (f) Kentucky's January 7, 1998, request for a 1-year attainment date 
extension for the Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton 
metropolitan moderate ozone nonattainment area which consists of Kenton, 
Boone, and Campbell Counties is approved. The date for attaining the 
ozone standard in these counties is November 15, 1998.
    (g) The redesignation request submitted by the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, on October 29, 1999, for the Kentucky portion of the 
Cincinnati-Hamilton moderate interstate ozone nonattainment area from 
nonattainment to attainment was approved on July 5, 2000. The mobile 
source budgets for the Kentucky portion of the area for the purposes of 
transportation conformity are now 5.83 tons per summer day of volatile 
organic compounds and 15.13 tons per summer day of nitrogen oxides for 
the year 2010.
    (h) Determination--EPA is determining that as of July 5, 2000, the 
Kentucky portion of the Cincinnati-Hamilton ozone nonattainment area 
(which includes the Counties of Boone, Kenton, and Campbell) has 
attained the 1-hour ozone standard and that the attainment demonstration 
requirements of section 182(b)(1), 182(j), and 172(c)(1), along with the 
section 172(c)(9) contingency measure requirements, do not apply to the 
area.
    (i) Approval--EPA is approving an exemption from the requirements 
contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts 
Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties in Kentucky from the NO<INF>X</INF> 
related general conformity provisions; nonattainment NSR for new sources 
and modifications that are major for NO<INF>X</INF>; NO<INF>X</INF> 
RACT; and the requirement for a demonstration of compliance with the 
enhanced I/M performance standard for NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (j) [Reserved]
    (k) The redesignation request submitted by the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, on March 30, 2001, and supplemented on July 9, 2001, for the 
Kentucky portion of the Louisville moderate interstate ozone 
nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment was approved on 
October 23, 2001. The motor vehicle emissions budgets for VOC and 
NO<INF>X</INF> in the Kentucky portion of the Louisville moderate 
interstate maintenance plan are adequate for conformity purposes and 
approvable as part of the maintenance plan. The 1-hour ozone standard 
maintenance plan motor vehicle emission budgets for the

[[Page 731]]

entire interstate Louisville area for the purposes of transportation 
conformity are now 48.17 tons per summer day of VOC and 92.93 tons per 
summer day of NO<INF>X</INF> for the year 2012.

Sec. 52.931  Significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a) Regulations for preventing significant deterioration of air 
quality. The provisions of Sec. 52.21 (b) through (w) are hereby 
incorporated and made a part of the applicable state plan for the State 
of Kentucky only as they apply to permits issued pursuant to Sec. 52.21 
prior to final approval of Kentucky's Regulation for Prevention of 
Significant Deterioration (PSD), Visibility Monitoring, and Visibility 
New Source Review in Attainment Areas. The provisions of Sec. 52.21 (b) 
through (w) are rescinded for permits issued after final approval of 
Kentucky's Regulation for Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), 
Visibility Monitoring, and Visibility New Source Review in Attainment 
Areas.
    (b) The Commonwealth of Kentucky has committed to revising the 
state's regulations accordingly when EPA amends the federal vessel 
emissions provisions contained in 40 CFR 51.166. In a letter dated 
October 17, 1986, Kentucky stated:

    As requested, the Division of Air Pollution Control hereby commits 
to changing the definition of ``building, structure, facility, or 
installation,'' and any other applicable definitions, when the issue of 
vessel emissions is resolved at the federal level, and after the federal 
regulation, 40 CFR 51.24, is amended.

    (c) In a letter dated May 3, 1988, EPA informed Kentucky that the 
following caveat must be included in all potentially affected permits 
due to a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit (NRDC v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1224):

    In approving this permit, the Kentucky Division for Air Quality has 
determined that the application complies with the applicable provisions 
of the stack height regulations as revised by the EPA on July 8, 1985 
(50 FR 27892). Portions of the regulations have been remanded by a panel 
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in NRDC v. Thomas, 838 
F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Consequently, this permit may be subject to 
modification if and when the EPA revises the regulation in response to 
the court decision. This may result in revised emission limitations or 
may affect other actions taken by the source owners or operators.

    Kentucky responded with a letter dated May 11, 1988, stating in 
part:

    This is in response to your letter dated May 3, 1988 * * *. As 
requested by your letter, the Kentucky Division for Air Quality agrees 
to include the condition set forth in your letter, in all potentially 
affected permits issued under regulation 401 KAR 51:017 or 401 KAR 
51:052. Therefore, we request that you consider this letter as our 
commitment that the required caveat will be included in all potentially 
affected permits * * *.
    (d) All applications and other information required pursuant to 
Sec. 52.21 of this part from sources located in the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky shall be submitted to the State agency, Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, Energy and Environment Cabinet, Department of Environmental 
Protection, Division for Air Quality, 200 Fair Oaks Lane, 1st Floor, 
Frankfort, Kentucky 40610-1403 or local agency, Louisville Metro Air 
Pollution Control District, 850 Barret Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky 
40204, rather than to EPA's Region 4 office.

    (a) The last sentence of section 3(1) of Kentucky regulation 401 KAR 
3:050, which specifies that a new fossil fuel fired steam electric 
generator's allowable SO<INF>2</INF> emissions may be calculated by 
averaging SO<INF>2</INF> emissions from existing units of this type and 
from new ones, is disapproved since it contravenes subpart D of 40 CFR 
part 60, New Source Performance Standards.
    (b) Section 8(2)(a) of regulation 401 KAR 61:015 is disapproved in 
that it allows the Tennessee Valley Authority's Shawnee power plant 
until October 1, 1981, to achieve compliance with emissions limits which 
are not made more stringent by the 1979 Part D revisions,

[[Page 732]]

and which the source was previously required to meet by July 1, 1977.
    (c) Section 8(2)(d) of regulation 401 KAR 61:015 is disapproved in 
that it allows sources until December 31, 1982, to achieve compliance 
with emission limits which are not made more stringent by the 1979 Part 
D revisions, and which the sources were previously required to meet 
prior to 1979.

Sec. 52.990  Stack height regulations.

    The State of Louisiana has committed to submit to EPA a SIP revision 
whenever a new or revised emission limitation for a specific source 
exceeds the height allowed by Section 921(A) ``Good Engineering Practice 
(GEP) Stack Height 1 or 2'' of the State regulations. A letter from the 
Secretary of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, dated 
September 23, 1986, stated that:

    In specific, the State regulation, Section 17.14.2 [now LAC 33: Part 
III, Section 921(B)], provides that the degree of emission limitation 
required of any source for control of any air pollutant must not be 
affected by so much of any source's stack height that exceeds good 
engineering practice or by any other dispersion technique. In reference 
to this requirement, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality 
or the Administrative Authority will submit to EPA a SIP revision 
whenever the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality adopts a new 
or revised emission limitation for a specific source that is based on a 
stack height that exceeds the height allowed by Section 17.14.1(e)(1) 
[now LAC 33: Part III, Section 921(A) ``Good Engineering Practice (GEP) 
Stack Height 1''] or Section 17.14.1(e)(2) [now LAC 33: Part III,

Sec. 52.992  Area-wide nitrogen oxides exemptions.

    (a) The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality submitted to 
the EPA on August 5, 1994, a petition requesting that the 
nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas in the State of Louisiana be 
exempted from the requirement to meet the NO<INF>X</INF> provisions of 
the Federal transportation conformity rule. The exemption request was 
based on monitoring data which demonstrated that the National Ambient 
Air Quality Standard for ozone had been attained in this area for the 3 
years prior to the petition. The parishes for which the NO<INF>X</INF> 
exemption was requested include: Beauregard, Grant, Lafayette, 
Lafourche, Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, and 
St. Mary. The EPA approved this exemption request on March 2, 1995.

[[Page 762]]

    (b) The LDEQ submitted to the EPA on November 17, 1994, a petition 
requesting that the Baton Rouge serious ozone nonattainment area be 
exempted from the NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements of the CAA. In 
addition, supplemental information was submitted to the EPA by the LDEQ 
on January 26, 1995, June 6, 1995, and June 16, 1995. The Baton Rouge 
nonattainment area consists of East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, 
Pointe Coupee, Livingston, Iberville, and Ascension Parishes. The 
exemption request was based on photochemical grid modeling which shows 
that reductions in NO<INF>X</INF> would not contribute to attainment in 
the nonattainment area. On January 18, 1996, the EPA approved the 
State's request for an areawide exemption from the following 
requirements: NO<INF>X</INF> new source review, NO<INF>X</INF> 
reasonably available control technology, NO<INF>X</INF> general 
conformity, and NO<INF>X</INF> inspection and maintenance requirements.
    (c) The LDEQ submitted to the EPA on July 25, 1995, a revision to 
the SIP, pursuant to section 182(b)(1), requesting that the Baton Rouge 
serious ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the transportation 
conformity NO<INF>X</INF> requirements of the CAA. The Baton Rouge 
nonattainment area consists of East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, 
Pointe Coupee, Livingston, Iberville, and Ascension Parishes. The 
exemption request was based on photochemical grid modeling which shows 
that additional reductions in NO<INF>X</INF> would not contribute to 
attainment in the nonattainment area. On February 12, 1996, the EPA 
approved the State's request for an areawide exemption from the 
transportation conformity NO<INF>X</INF> requirements.
    (d) The LDEQ submitted to the EPA on October 28, 1994, a petition 
requesting that the Lake Charles marginal ozone nonattainment area be 
exempted from the NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements of the Act. The 
Lake Charles nonattainment area consists of Calcasieu Parish. The 
exemption request was based on photochemical grid modeling which shows 
that reductions in NO<INF>X</INF> would not contribute to attainment in 
the nonattainment area. On May 27, 1997, the EPA approved the State's 
request for an area-wide exemption from the following requirements: 
NO<INF>X</INF> new source review, NO<INF>X</INF> general conformity, and 
NO<INF>X</INF> transportation conformity requirements. The waiver was 
granted on the basis of modeling, and ambient air quality data 
demonstrating the area has attained the ozone NAAQS.
    (e) On September 24, 2001, and on December 31, 2001, the LDEQ 
requested that EPA rescind the Baton Rouge section 182(f) and 182(b)(1) 
NO<INF>X</INF> exemptions that were approved by EPA, and published in 
the Federal Register on January 26, 1996 (61 FR 2438), and February 27, 
1996 (61 FR 7218). The State based its request on photochemical grid 
modeling recently performed for the Baton Rouge State Implementation 
Plan (SIP) which indicates that controlling NO<INF>X</INF> sources will 
assist in bringing the Baton Rouge area into attainment with the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. On May 7, 2002, 
EPA proposed approval of the State's request to rescind both 
NO<INF>X</INF> exemptions. Based on our review of the State's request 
and the supporting photochemical grid modeling the NO<INF>X</INF> 
exemptions are rescinded on May 5, 2003.

    (d) On December 15, 1995, the Governor of the State of Louisiana 
submitted a revision to the 1990 base year volatile organic compound 
(VOC) emissions inventory for the Baton Rouge, Louisiana ozone 
nonattainment area. The revised inventory was submitted as part of the 
revised Baton Rouge 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plan. This revision to 
the base year inventory modified the point source VOC emissions. The 
revisions satisfy the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air 
Act, as amended in 1990.
    (e) On January 2, 1997, the Governor of the State of Louisiana 
submitted a revision to the 1990 base year volatile organic compound 
(VOC) emissions inventory for the Baton Rouge, Louisiana ozone 
nonattainment area. The revised inventory was submitted as part of the 
revised Baton Rouge Post-1996 Rate-of-Progress Plan. This revision to 
the base year inventory modified the point, area, non-road mobile, on-
road mobile, and biogenic sources of VOC emissions. The revisions 
satisfy the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as 
amended in 1990.

Sec. 52.996  Disapprovals.

    The State of Louisiana motor vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/
M) program SIP submittal of August 18, 1995, with later editions, is 
disapproved based on the failure of the State Legislature to grant legal 
authority to reauthorize and continuously operate the program until the 
program is no longer necessary. The Baton Rouge serious ozone 
nonattainment area is required to have an enhanced I/M program under 
section 182 of the Clean Air Act (the Act) as amended in 1990. This 
disapproval initiates the sanction process of section 179(a) of the Act.

Declarations. The Governor of Louisiana submitted the negative 
declarations for reasonably available control technology (RACT) for the 
Baton Rouge ozone nonattainment area on December 15, 1996. Section 
172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act requires nonattainment areas to adopt, at 
a minimum, RACT to reduce emissions from existing sources. Pursuant to 
section 182(b)(2) of the Act, for moderate and above ozone nonattainment 
areas, the EPA has identified 13 categories for such sources and 
developed the Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) or Alternate Control 
Techniques (ACTs) documents to implement RACT at those sources. When no 
major volatile organic compound (VOC) sources for a CTG/ACT category 
exist in a nonattainment area, a State may submit a negative declaration 
for that category. Louisiana's submittal included two negative 
declaration letters from Mr. Gustave Von Bodungen to Ms. Karen Alvarez 
dated April 6, 1994, and June 20, 1994, for the following source 
categories: offset lithography, plastic parts-business machines, plastic
