                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2000), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (a) Any individual may request the Commission to inform him or her

writing at the location and to the person specified in the notice 
describing that record system.

requested under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, it shall so 
notify the individual within 15 days after receipt of the request. Such 
acknowledgement may request additional information to assist the 
Commission in locating the record or it may advise the individual that 
no record or document exists about that individual.

[41 FR 43064, Sept. 29, 1976, as amended at 50 FR 50778, Dec. 12, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 1.4  Times, places, and requirements for identification of individuals making requests.

    (a) After being informed by the Commission that a record system 
contains a record pertaining to him or her, an individual may request 
the Commission to disclose that record in the manner described in this 
section. Each request for the disclosure of a record or a copy of it 
shall be made at the Federal Election Commission, 999 E Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20463 and to the system manager identified in the notice 
describing the systems of records, either in writing or in person. 
Requests may be made by specifically authorized agents or by parents or 
guardians of individuals.
    (b) Each individual requesting the disclosure of a record or copy of 
a record shall furnish the following information with his or her 
request:
    (1) The name of the record system containing the record;
    (2) Proof as described in paragraph (c) of this section that he or 
she is the individual to whom the requested record relates;
    (3) Any other information required by the notice describing the 
record system.
    (c) Proof of identity as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section shall be provided as described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of 
this section. Requests made by an agent, parent, or guardian, shall be 
in accordance with the procedures described in Sec. 1.10.
    (1) Requests made in writing shall include a statement, signed by 
the individual and either notarized or witnessed by two persons 
(including witnesses' addresses). If the individual appears before a 
notary, he or she shall submit adequate proof of identification in the 
form of a drivers license, birth certificate, passport or other 
identification acceptable to the notary. If the statement is witnessed, 
it shall include a sentence above the witnesses' signatures that they 
personally know the individual or that the individual has submitted 
proof of his or her identification to their satisfaction. In any case in 
which, because of the extreme sensitivity of the record sought to be 
seen or copied, the Commission determines that the identification is not

    (a) No individual, under the provisions of these regulations, shall 
be entitled to access to materials compiled in its systems of records 
identified as FEC audits and investigations (FEC 2) or FEC compliance 
actions (FEC 3). These exempted systems relate to the Commission's power 
to exercise exclusive civil jurisdiction over the enforcement of the Act 
under 2 U.S.C. 437d (a)(6) and (e); and to defend itself in actions 
filed against it under 2 U.S.C. 437d(a)(6). Further the Commission has a

conduct audits and investigations pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 438(b); 26 U.S.C. 
9007 and 9038; and to refer apparent violations of the Act to the 
Attorney General or other law enforcement authorities under 2 U.S.C. 
437g(a)(5) and 437d(9). Information contained in FEC systems 2

[[Page 9]]

and 3 contain the working papers of the Commission staff and form the 
basis for either civil and/or criminal proceedings pursuant to the 
exercise of the powers and duties of the Commission. These materials 
must be protected until such time as they are subject to public access 
under the provision of 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(4)(B) or 5 U.S.C. 552, or other 
relevant statutes.
    (b)(1) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), records contained in FEC 12, 
Office of Inspector General Investigative Files, are exempt from the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, except subsections (b), (c) (1) and (2), 
(e)(4) (A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11) and (f) , and 
the corresponding provisions of 11 CFR part 1, to the extent this system 
of records relates in any way to the enforcement of criminal laws.
    (2) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), FEC 12, Office of Inspector 
General Investigative Files, is exempt from 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), 
(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f), and the corresponding provisions of 11 
CFR part 1, to the extent the system of records consists of 
investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, except for 
material that falls within the exemption included in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (c) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply 
to the extent that application of the subsection would deny any 
individual any right, privilege or benefit to which he or she would 
otherwise be entitled to receive.

determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official 
Commission business. For the purpose of this section, joint conduct does

members is physically present in one place but not conducting agency 
business as a body (e.g., at a meeting at which one member is giving a 
speech while a number of other members are present in the audience). A 
deliberation conducted through telephone or similar communications 
equipment by means of which all persons participating can hear each 
other will be considered a meeting under this section.
    (2) The term meeting does not include the process of notation voting 
by circulated memorandum for the purpose of expediting consideration of 
routine matters. It also does not include deliberations to schedule a 
meeting, to take action to open or close a meeting, or to

<R05>
Sec. 2.3  General rules.

    (a) Commissioners shall not jointly conduct, determine or dispose of 
Commission business other than in accordance with this part.
    (b) Except as provided in 11 CFR 2.4, every portion of every 
Commission meeting shall be open to public observation.
    (c) No additional right to participate in Commission meetings is 
granted to any person by this part. A meeting is not part of the formal 
or informal record of decision of the matters discussed therein except 
as otherwise required by law. Statements of views or expressions of 
opinions made by Commissioners or FEC employees at meetings are not 
intended to represent final determinations or beliefs.
    (d) Members of the public attending open Commission meetings may use 
small electronic sound recorders to record the meeting, but the use of 
other electronic recording equipment and cameras requires advance notice 
to and coordination with the Commission's Press Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 2.4  Exempted meetings.

    (a) Meetings required by statute to be closed. Meetings concerning 
matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statutes which require 
public withholding in such a manner as to leave no discretion for the 
Commission on the issue, or which establish particular types of matters 
to be withheld, shall be closed to public observation in accordance with 
the procedures of 11 CFR 2.5.
    (1) As required by 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(12), all Commission meetings, or 
portions of meetings, pertaining to any notification or investigation 
that a violation of the Act has occurred, shall be closed to the public.
    (2) For the purpose of this section, any notification or 
investigation that a violation of the Act has occurred includes, but is 
not limited to, determinations pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437g, the issuance 
of subpoenas, discussion of referrals to the Department of Justice, or 
consideration of any other matter related to the Commission's 
enforcement activity, as set forth in 11 CFR part 111.
    (b) Meetings closed by Commission determination. Except as provided 
in 11 CFR 2.4(c), the requirement of open meetings will not apply where 
the Commission finds, in accordance with 11 CFR 2.5, that an open 
meeting or the release of information is likely to result in the 
disclosure of:
    (1) Matters that relate solely to the Commission's internal 
personnel decisions, or internal rules and practices.
    (i) This provision includes, but is not limited to, matters relating 
to Commission policies on working conditions, or materials prepared 
predominantly for internal use, the disclosure of which would risk 
circumvention of Commission regulations; but
    (ii) This provision does not include discussions or materials 
regarding employees' dealings with the public, such as personnel manuals 
or Commission directives setting forth job functions or procedures;
    (2) Financial or commercial information obtained from any person 
which is privileged or confidential;
    (3) Matters which involve the consideration of a proceeding of a 
formal nature by the Commission against a specific person or the formal 
censure of any person;
    (4) Information of a personal nature where disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (5) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or 
information which if written would be contained in such records, but 
only to the extent that the production of such records or information 
would:
    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,
    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication,
    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
    (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source,
    (v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or
    (vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement 
personnel;

[[Page 11]]

    (6) Information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to 
have a considerable adverse effect on the implementation of a proposed 
Commission action, as long as the Commission has not already disclosed 
the content or nature of its proposed action, or is not required by law 
to disclose it prior to final action; or
    (7) Matters that specifically concern the Commission's participation 
in a civil action or proceeding, or an arbitration, or involving a 
determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
    (c) Nothwithstanding the applicability of any exemptions set forth 
in 11 CFR 2.4(b), the Commission may determine that the public interest 
requires a meeting to be open.


<R05>
Sec. 2.5  Procedures for closing meetings.

    (a) General. No meeting or portion of a meeting may be closed to the 
public observation under this section unless a majority of the 
Commissioners (not including ex officio non-voting Commissioners) votes 
to take such action. The closing of one portion of a meeting shall not 
justify closing any other portion of a meeting.
    (b) Certification. Each time the Commission votes to close a 
meeting, the General Counsel shall publicly certify that, in his or her 
opinion, each item on the agenda may properly be closed to public 
observation. The certification shall state each relevant exemption 
provision. The original copy of the certification shall be attached to, 
and preserved with, the statement required by 11 CFR 2.5(d).
    (c) Voting procedures. (1) No meeting need be held to consider 
closing a meeting. The Commission may vote to close a meeting or any 
portion thereof by using its notation vote procedures.
    (i) A separate vote shall be taken with respect to each item on an 
agenda proposed to be closed in whole or in part pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4, 
or with respect to any information proposed to be withheld under 11 CFR 
2.4.
    (ii) A single vote may be taken with respect to a particular matter 
to be discussed in a series of closed meetings, or with respect to any 
information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting 
in the series is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the 
initial meeting.
    (iii) This section shall not affect the Commission's practice of 
setting dates for closed meetings more than 30 days in advance of such 
meetings.
    (2) The Commission Secretary shall record the vote of each 
Commissioner participating in the vote. No proxies, written or 
otherwise, shall be counted.
    (3)(i) A Commissioner may object to a recommendation to close the 
discussion of a particular matter or may assert a claim of exemption for 
a matter scheduled to be discussed in an open meeting. Such objection or 
assertion will be discussed by the Commission at the next scheduled 
closed meeting, to determine whether the matter in question should be 
discussed in a closed meeting.
    (ii) An objection for the record only will not cause the objection 
to be placed on any agenda.
    (d) Public statement of vote. (1) If the Commission votes to close a 
meeting, or any portion thereof, under this section, it shall make 
publicly available within 24 hours a written statement of the vote. The 
written statement shall contain:
    (i) A citation to the provision(s) of 11 CFR 2.4 under which the 
meeting was closed to public observation and an explanation of why the 
specific discussion comes within the cited exemption(s);
    (ii) The vote of each Commissioner participating in the vote;
    (iii) A list of the names of all persons expected to attend the 
closed meeting and their affiliation. For purposes of this section, 
affiliation means title or position, and name of employer, and in the 
case of a representative, the name of the person represented. In the 
case of Commission employees, the statement will reflect, through the 
use of titles rather than individual names, that the Commissioners, 
specified division heads and their staff will attend; and
    (iv) The signature of the Commission Secretary.
    (2) The original copy of the statement shall be maintained by the 
Commission Secretary. A copy shall be posted on a public bulletin board 
located in the Commission's Public Records Office.

[[Page 12]]

    (e) Public request to close a meeting. A person whose interests may 
be directly affected by a portion of a meeting may request that the 
Commission close that portion to the public for any of the reasons 
referred to in 11 CFR 2.4. The following procedures shall apply to such 
requests:
    (1) The request must be made in writing and shall be directed to the 
Chairman of the Commission.
    (2) The request shall identify the provisions of 11 CFR 2.4 under 
which the requestor seeks to close all or a portion of the meeting.
    (3) A recorded vote to close the meeting or a portion thereof shall 
be taken.
    (4) Requests made under this section shall become part of the 
official record of the underlying matter and shall be disclosed in 
accordance with 11 CFR 2.6 on completion of the matter.
    (5) If the Commission decides to approve a request to close, the 
Commission will then follow the procedures for closing a meeting set 
forth in 11 CFR 2.5 (a) through (d).


<R05>
Sec. 2.6  Transcripts and recordings.

    (a) The Commission Secretary shall maintain a complete transcript or 
electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each 
meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to public observation. An 
electronic recording of a meeting shall be coded, or other records shall 
be kept in a manner adequate to identify each speaker.
    (b)(1) In the case of any meeting closed pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4(b), 
as the last item of business, the Commission will determine which, if 
any, portions of the electronic recording or transcript and which if 
any, items of information withheld under 11 CFR 2.5 contain information 
which should be withheld pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4.
    (2) Portions of transcripts or recordings determined to be outside 
the scope of any exemptions under 11 CFR 2.6(b)(1) shall be promptly 
made available to the public through the Commission's Public Records 
Office at a cost sufficient to cover the Commission's actual cost of 
duplication or transcription. Requests for such copies shall be made and 
processed in accordance with the provisions of 11 CFR part 5.
    (3) Portions of transcripts or electronic recordings not made 
available immediately pursuant to 11 CFR 2.6(b)(1), and portions of 
transcripts or recordings withheld pursuant to 11 CFR 2.4(a), will be 
made available on request when the relevant exemptions no longer apply. 
Such materials shall be requested and processed under the provisions of 
11 CFR 2.6(b)(2).
    (c) A complete verbatim copy of the transcript or a complete 
electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to 
the public, shall be maintained by the Commission Secretary in 
confidential files of the Commission, for a minimum of two years 
subsequent to such meeting, or a minimum of one year after the 
conclusion of any agency proceeding with respect to which the meeting, 
or portion of the meeting was held, whichever occurs later.

made when required by 11 CFR 2.7(a) in the case of every Commission 
meeting unless a majority of the Commissioners decide by recorded vote 
that Commission business requires that the meeting be called at an 
earlier date, in which case the Commission shall make at the

[[Page 13]]

earliest practicable time, the announcement required by this section and 
a concurrent submission for publication of that announcement in the 
Federal Register.
    (c) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the

Commission to open or close a meeting, or portions of a meeting, to the

by recorded vote that Commission business so requires and that no 
earlier announcement of the change was possible; and

pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437f(d), 437g(a)(4)(B)(ii), and 438(a).
    (g) Direct costs means those expenditures which the Commission 
actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of 
commercial use requestors, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA 
request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the 
work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that 
rate to cover benefits) and the cost of

[[Page 14]]

operating duplicating equipment. Direct costs do not include overhead 
expenses such as the cost of space and heating or lighting the facility 
in which the records are stored.
    (h) Search means all time spent looking for material that is 
responsive to a FOIA request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents. This includes both manual 
searches and searches conducted with a computer using existing 
programming. Search time does not include review of material in order to 
determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.
    (i) Review means the process of examining a document located in 
response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of 
the document located is exempt from disclosure. Review also refers to 
processing any document for disclosure, i.e., doing all that is 
necessary to excise exempt portions of the document and otherwise 
prepare the document for release. Review does not include time spent by 
the Commission resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the 
application of exemptions.
    (j) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a document 
necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Examples of the form such copies 
can take include, but are not limited to, paper copy, microform, audio-
visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape 
or disk).
    (k) Commercial use means a purpose that furthers the commercial, 
trade, or profit interests of the requestor or the person on whose 
behalf the request is made. The Commission's determination as to whether 
documents are being requested for a commercial use will be based on the 
purpose for which the documents are being requested. Where the 
Commission has reasonable cause to doubt the use for which the requestor 
claims to have made the request or where that use is not clear from the 
request itself, the Commission will seek additional clarification before 
assigning the request to a specific category.
    (l) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher 
education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational 
education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
    (m) Non-commercial scientific institution means an organization that 
is not operated on a commercial basis, as that term is defined in 
paragraph (k) of this section, and which is operated solely for the 
purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not 
intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (n) Representative of the news media means a person actively 
gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish 
or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is 
about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. 
Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, 
television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and 
publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can 
qualify as disseminators of news, as defined in this paragraph) who make 
their products available for purchase or subscription by the general 
public. A freelance journalist may be regarded as working for a news 
organization and therefore considered a representative of the news media 
if that person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication 
by that news organization, even though that person is not actually 
employed by that organization. The best means by which a freelance 
journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by a 
news organization is by having a publication contract with that news 
organization. When no such contract is present, the Commission will look 
to the freelance journalist's past publication record in making this 
determination.

and the need for the Commission to promote free internal policy 
deliberations and to pursue its official activities without undue 
disruption.
    (b) All Commission records shall be available to the public unless 
they are specifically exempt under this part.
    (c) To carry out this policy, the Commission shall designate a

records for inspection and copying.

[44 FR 33368, June 8, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 31291, May 13, 1980]


<R05>

file.
    (4) Letter requests for guidance and responses thereto;
    (5) The minutes of Commission meetings and transcripts made from 
tapes of Commission meetings;

and made available on at least a quarterly basis for public distribution 
unless the Commission determines by Notice in the Federal Register that 
publication would be unnecessary, impracticable, or not feasible due to 
budgetary considerations. Nevertheless, copies of any index or 
supplement shall be made available upon request at a cost not to exceed 
the direct cost of duplication.
    (d) The Freedom of Information Act and the provisions of this part 
apply only to existing records; they do not require the creation of new 
records.

[[Page 16]]

    (e) If documents or files contain both disclosable and 
nondisclosable information, the nondisclosable information will be 
deleted and the disclosable information released unless the disclosable 
portions cannot be reasonably segregated from the other portions in a 
manner which will allow meaningful information to be disclosed.
    (f) All records created in the process of implementing provisions of 
5 U.S.C. 552 will be maintained by the Commission in accordance with the 
authority granted by General Records Schedule 14, approved by the

<R05>
Sec. 4.5  Categories of exemptions.

    (a) No requests under 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be denied release unless 
the record contains, or its disclosure would reveal, matters that are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such 
Executive order;
    (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Commission;
    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that 
such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public 
in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) 
establishes particular criteria for withhholding or refers to particular 
types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from a person which are privileged or confidential. Such information 
includes confidential business information which concerns or relates to 
the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of works, or apparatus, 
or to the production, sales, shipments, purchases, transfers, 
identification of customers, inventories, or amount of source of income, 
profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, 
corporation, or other organization, if the disclosure is likely to have 
the effect of either impairing the Commission's ability to obtain such 
information as is necessary to perform its statutory functions, or 
causing substantial harm to the competitive position of the person, 
firm, partnership, corporation, or other organization from which the 
information was obtained, unless the Commission is required by law to 
disclose such information. These procedures shall be used for submitting 
business information in confidence:
    (i) A request for confidential treatment shall be addressed to the 
FOIA officer, Federal Election Commission, 999 E Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20463, and shall indicate clearly on the envelope that it 
is a request for confidential treatment.
    (ii) With each submission of, or offer to submit, business 
information which a submitter desires to be treated as confidential 
under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the submitter shall provide the 
following, which may be disclosed to the public: (A) A written 
description of the nature of the subject information, and a 
justification for the request for its confidential treatment, and (B) a 
certification in writing under oath that substantially identical 
information is not available to the public.
    (iii) Approval or denial of requests shall be made only by the FOIA 
officer or his or her designees. A denial shall be in writing, shall 
specify the reason therefore, and shall advise the submitter of the 
right to appeal to the Commission.
    (iv) For good cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from a 
denial by the FOIA Officer or his or her designee if the appeal is filed 
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the denial. An appeal shall be 
addressed to the FOIA Officer, Federal Election Commission, 999 E 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463 and shall clearly indicate that it is 
a confidential submission appeal. An appeal will be decided within 
twenty (20) days after its receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and 
legal holidays) unless an extension, stated in writing with the reasons 
therefore, has been provided the person making the appeal.
    (v) Any business information submitted in confidence and determined 
to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be maintained in 
confidence by

[[Page 17]]

the Commission and not disclosed except as required by law. In the event 
that any business information submitted to the Commission is not 
entitled to confidential treatment, the submitter will be permitted to 
withdraw the tender unless it is the subject of a request under the 
Freedom of Information Act or of judicial discovery proceedings.
    (vi) Since enforcement actions under 2 U.S.C. 437g are confidential 
by statute, the procedures outlined in Sec. 4.5(a)(4) (i) thru (v) are 
not applicable.
    (5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party in litigation with the Commission.
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy.
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information:
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal 
investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security 
intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential 
source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.
    (b) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records 
described in 11 CFR 4.5(a)(7): and
    (1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of 
criminal law; and
    (2) There is reason to believe that--
    (i) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of 
its pendency, and
    (ii) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be 
expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;

The agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, 
treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of 
Information Act.
    (c) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided 
to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions 
which are exempt.
    (d) If a requested record is one of another government agency or 
deals with subject matter to which a government agency other than the 
Commission has exclusive or primary responsibility, the request for such 
a record shall be promptly referred by the Commission to that agency for 
disposition or guidance as to disposition.
    (e) Nothing in this part authorizes withholding of information or 
limiting the availability of records to the public, except as 
specifically provided in this part; nor is this part authority to 
withhold information from Congress.

<R05>
Sec. 4.6  Discretionary release of exempt records.

    The Commission may, in its discretion, release requested records 
despite the applicability of the exemptions in Sec. 4.5(a), if it 
determines that it is in the public interest and that the rights of 
third parties would not be prejudiced.


<R05>
Sec. 4.7  Requests for records.

    (a) A request to inspect or copy Commission public records of the 
type referred to in 11 CFR 4.4(b) may be made

[[Page 18]]

in person or by mail. The Public Records Office is open Monday through 
Friday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and is located on the 
first floor, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463.
    (b) Requests for copies of records pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act shall be addressed to FOIA officer, Federal Election 
Commission, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463. The request shall 
reasonably describe the records sought with sufficient specificity with 
respect to names, dates, and subject matter, to permit the records to be 
located. A requester will be promptly advised if the records cannot be 
located on the basis of the description given and that further 
identifying information must be provided before the request can be 
satisfied.
    (c) Records or copies thereof will normally be made available either 
immediately upon receipt of a request or within ten working days 
thereafter, or twenty working days in the case of an appeal, unless in 
unusual circumstances the time is extended or subject to 11 CFR 
4.9(f)(3), which governs advance payments. In the event the time is 
extended, the requestor shall be notified of the reasons for the 
extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be made, 
but in no case shall the extended time exceed ten working days. An 
extension may be made if it is--
    (1) Necessary to locate records or transfer them from physically 
separate facilities; or
    (2) Necessary to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
large quantity of separate and distinct records which are the subject of 
a single request; or
    (3) Necessary for consultation with another agency which has a 
substantial interest in the determination of the request, or with two or 
more components of the Commission which have a substantial subject 
matter interest therein.
    (d) Any person denied access to records by the Commission shall be 
notified immediately giving reasons therefore, and notified of the right 
of such person to appeal such adverse determination to the Commission.
    (e) The date of receipt of a request under this part shall be the 
date on which the FOIA Officer actually receives the request.

[44 FR 33368, June 8, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 31292, May 13, 1980; 50 
FR 50778, Dec. 12, 1985; 52 FR 39213, Oct. 21, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 4.8  Appeal of denial.

    (a) Any person who has been notified pursuant to Sec. 4.6(d) of this 
part that his/her request for inspection of a record or for a copy has 
been denied, or who has received no response within ten working days (or 
within such extended period as is permitted under Sec. 4.7(c) of this 
part) after the request has been received by the Commission, may appeal 
the adverse determination or the failure to respond by requesting the 
Commission to direct that the record be made available.
    (b) The appeal request shall be in writing, shall clearly and 
prominently state on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the 
first page ``FOIA Appeal'', and shall identify the record in the form in 
which it was originally requested.
    (c) The appeal request should be delivered or addressed to the FOIA 
Officer, Federal Election Commission, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20463.
    (d) The requestor may state facts and cite legal or other 
authorities as he/she deems appropriate in support of the appeal 
request.
    (e) For good cause shown, the Commission may disclose a record which 
is subject to one of the exemptions listed in Sec. 4.5 of this part.
    (f) The Commission will make a determination with respect to any 
appeal within twenty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal 
holidays) after receipt of the appeal (or within such extended period as 
is permitted under Sec. 4.7(c) of this part). If on appeal, the denial 
of the request for a record or a copy is in whole or in part upheld, the 
Commission shall advise the requestor of the denial and shall notify 
him/her of the provisions for judicial review of that determination as 
set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).
    (g) Because of the risk of misunderstanding inherent in oral 
communications, the Commission will not entertain any appeal from an 
alleged denial

[[Page 19]]

or failure to comply with an oral request. Any person who has orally 
requested a copy of a record that he/she believes to have been 
improperly denied should resubmit the request in writing as set forth in 
Sec. 4.7.

<R05>
Sec. 4.9  Fees.

    (a) Exceptions to fee charges--(1) General. Except for a commercial 
use requester, the Commission will not charge a fee to any requester for 
the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of 
duplication in response to any FOIA request.
    (2) Free computer search time. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term search time is based on the concept of a manual search. To apply 
this to a search conducted by a computer, the Commission will provide 
the equivalent dollar value of two hours of professional staff time, 
calculated according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, in computer 
search time. Computer search time is determined by adding the cost of 
the computer connect time actually used for the search, calculated at 
the rate of $25.00 per hour, to the cost of the operator's salary for 
the time spent conducting the computer search, calculated at the 
professional staff time rate set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section.
    (3) Definition of pages. For purposes of this paragraph, the word 
pages refers to paper copies of a standard agency size which will 
normally be 8\1/2\<SUP><gr-thn-eq></SUP>  x  11<SUP><gr-thn-eq></SUP> or 
8\1/2\<SUP><gr-thn-eq></SUP>  x  14<SUP><gr-thn-eq>.</SUP> Thus, while a 
requester would not be entitled to 100 free computer disks, for example, 
a requester would be entitled to 100 free pages of a computer printout.
    (4) Minimum charge. The Commission will not charge a fee to any 
requester when the allowable direct cost of that FOIA request is equal 
to or less than the Commission's cost of routinely collecting and 
processing a FOIA request fee.
    (b) Fee reduction or waiver--(1) The Commission will consider 
requests for the reduction or waiver of any fees assessed pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section if it determines, either as a result of 
its own motion or in response to a written submission by the requester, 
that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it 
is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the 
operations or activities of the government and that disclosure of the 
information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the 
requester.
    (2) A request for a reduction or waiver of fees shall be made in 
writing by the FOIA requestor; shall accompany the relevant FOIA request 
so as to be considered timely; and shall include a specific explanation 
as to why the fee for that FOIA request should be reduced or waived, 
applying the standard stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the 
facts of that particular request. In addition, the explanation shall 
include: the requester's (and user's, if the requester and the user are 
different persons or entities) identity, qualifications and expertise in 
the subject area, and ability and intention to disseminate the 
information to the public; and a discussion of any commercial or 
personal benefit that the requestor (and user, if the requestor and user 
are different persons or entities) expects as a result of disclosure, 
including whether the information disclosed would be resold in any form 
at a fee above actual cost.
    (c) Fees to be charged. (1) The FOIA services provided by the 
Commission in response to a FOIA request for which the requestor will be 
charged will depend upon the category of the requestor. The categories 
of FOIA requestors are as follows:
    (i) Commercial use requestors. A requestor of documents for 
commercial use will be assessed reasonable standard charges for the full 
allowable direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release and 
duplicating the records sought, according to the Commission's schedule 
of fees for those services as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section. A commercial use requestor is not entitled to two hours of free 
search time nor 100 free pages of duplication of documents.
    (ii) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution 
requestors. The Commission will provide documents to requestors in this 
category for the cost of duplication of the records provided by

[[Page 20]]

the Commission in response to the request, according to the Commission's 
schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, 
excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication. Requestors in 
this category will not be charged for search time. To be eligible for 
inclusion in this category, requestors must show that the request is 
being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying 
institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, 
but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an 
educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-
commercial scientific institution) research.
    (iii) Requestors who are representatives of the news media. The 
Commission will provide documents to requestors in this category for the 
cost of duplication of the records provided by the Commission in 
response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees 
as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for 
the first 100 pages of duplication. Requestors in this category will not 
be charged for search time. To be eligible for inclusion in this 
category, the requestor must meet the criteria listed at 11 CFR 4.1(n) 
and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. A request 
for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requestor 
shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.
    (iv) All other requestors. The Commission will charge requestors who 
do not fit into any of the categories listed in paragraph (c)(1)(i), 
(ii) or (iii) of this section the full direct costs of searching for and 
duplicating records in response to the request, according to the 
Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section, excluding charges for the first two hours of search time and 
the first 100 pages of duplication. Requests from record subjects for 
records about themselves will continue to be treated under the fee 
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for 
duplication.
    (2) The Commission may assess fees for the full allowable direct 
costs of searching for documents in response to a request even if the 
Commission fails to locate any documents which are responsive to that 
request and, in the case of commercial use requestors, of reviewing 
documents located in response to a request which the Commission 
determines are exempt from disclosure.
    (3) If the Commission estimates that search or duplication charges 
are likely to exceed $25.00, it will notify the requestor of the 
estimated amount of the fee unless the requestor has indicated in 
advance a willingness to pay a fee as high as that estimated by the 
Commission. Through this notification, the Commission will offer the 
requestor the opportunity to confer with Commission staff to reformulate 
the original request in order to meet the requestor's needs at a lower 
cost.
    (4) The following is the schedule of the Commission's standard fees. 
The cost of staff time will be added to all of the following fees, 
generally at the Professional rate listed below, except for the cost of 
Photocopying from photocopying machines which has been calculated to 
include staff time.

                              Photocopying

Photocopying from photocopying machines--$.07 per page
Photocopying from microfilm reader-printer--$.15 per page
Paper copies from microfilm-paper print machine--$.05 per frame page

                           Reels of Microfilm

Daily film (partial or complete roll)--$2.85 per roll
Other film (partial or complete roll)--$5.00 per roll

            Publications: (new or not from available stocks)

Cost of photocopying document--$.07 per page
Cost of binding document--$.30 per inch

                     Publications: (available stock)

If available from stock on hand, cost is based on previously calculated 
cost as stated in the publication (based on actual cost per copy, 
including reproduction and binding). Commission publications for which 
fees will be charged include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Advisory Opinion Index, Report on Financial Activity, Financial Control 
and Compliance Manual, MUR Index, and Guideline for Presentation in Good 
Order.

[[Page 21]]

                             Computer Tapes

Cost to process the request at the rate of $25.00 per hour connect time 
plus the cost of the computer tape ($25.00) and professional staff time 
(see Staff Time).

               Computer Indexes (including Name Searches)

Cost to process the request at the rate of $25.00 per hour connect time 
plus the cost of professional staff time (see Staff Time).

                               Staff Time

Clerical: $4.50 per each half hour (agency average of staff below a GS-
11) for each request.
Professional: $12.40 per each half hour (agency average of staff at GS-
11 and above) for each request.

                              Other Charges

Certification of a Document: $7.35 per quarter hour.
Transcripts of Commission meetings not previously transcribed: $7.50 per 
half hour (equivalent of a GS-11 executive secretary).
The Commission will not charge a fee for ordinary packaging and mailing 
of records requested. When a request for special mailing or delivery 
services is received the Commission will package the records requested. 
The requestor will make all arrangements for pick-up and delivery of the 
requested materials. The requestor shall pay all costs associated with 
special mailing or delivery services directly to the courier or mail 
service.

    (5) Upon receipt of any request for the production of computer tape 
or microfilm, the Commission will advise the requestor of the identity 
of the private contractor who will perform the duplication services. If 
fees are charged for the production of computer tape or microfilm, they 
shall be made payable to that private contractor and shall be forwarded 
to the Commission.
    (d) Interest charges. FOIA requestors should pay fees within 30 days 
following the day on which the invoice for that request was sent to the 
requestor. If the invoice is unpaid on the 31st day following the day on 
which the invoice was sent, the Commission will begin assessing interest 
charges, which will accrue from the date the invoice was mailed. 
Interest will be charged at a rate that is equal to the average 
investment rate for the Treasury tax and loan accounts for the 12-month 
period ending on September 30 of each year, rounded to the nearest whole 
percentage point, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. The accrual of interest 
will be stayed by the Commission's receipt of the fee, even if the fee 
has not yet been processed.
    (e) Aggregating requests. A requestor may not file multiple 
requests, each seeking portions of a document or documents, in order to 
avoid payment of fees. When the Commission reasonably believes that a 
FOIA requestor or group of requestors acting in concert is attempting to 
break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of 
evading the assessment of fees, the Commission will aggregate any such 
requests and charge the appropriate fees. In making this determination, 
the Commission will consider the time period in which the requests have 
occurred, the relationship of the requestors, and the subject matter of 
the requests.
    (f) Advance payments. The Commission will require a requestor to 
make an advance payment, i.e., a payment before work is commenced or 
continued on a request, when:
    (1) The Commission estimates or determines that allowable charges 
that a requestor may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. In 
such a case, the Commission will notify the requestor of the likely cost 
and, where the requestor has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, 
obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment, or in the case of a 
requestor with no FOIA fee payment history, the Commission will require 
an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges; or
    (2) A requestor has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely 
fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing). In such a 
case, the Commission may require that the requestor pay the full amount 
owed plus any applicable interest or demonstrate that the fee has been 
paid and make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee 
before the Commission begins to process a new request or a pending 
request from that requestor.
    (3) If the provisions of paragraph (f) (1) or (2) of this section 
apply, the administrative time limits prescribed in 11 CFR 4.7(c) will 
begin only after the

[[Page 22]]

Commission has received the payments or the requestor has made 
acceptable arrangements to make the payments required by paragraph (f) 
(1) or (2) of this section.

    Similarly, if the records requested require the production of 
microfilm or of computer tapes, the Commission will not instruct its 
contractor to duplicate the records until the requester has submitted 
payment as directed or has made acceptable arrangements to pay the total 
amount due. If any fee is not precisely ascertainable, an estimate will 
be made by the Commission and the requester will be required to forward 
the fee so estimated. In the event any advance payment differs from the 
actual fee, an appropriate adjustment will be made at the time the 
copies are made available by the Commission.
    (d) The Commission may reduce or waive payments of fees hereunder if 
it determines that such waiver or reduction is in the public interest 
because the furnishing of the requested information to the particular 
requester involved can be considered as primarily benefiting the general 
public as opposed to primarily benefiting the person or organization 
requesting the information.

discrimination assured them by section 504 and the provisions of this 
part.

Sec. 6.130  General prohibitions against discrimination.

    (a) No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, 
be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or 
otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity 
conducted by the Commission.
    (b)(1) The Commission, in providing any aid, benefit, or service,

arrangements, on the basis of handicap--
    (i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;

participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;

level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aids, benefits, or services to 
handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons than is

    (v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped 
person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization,

separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or 
different programs or activities.

conducted by the Commission; or
    (ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the 
objectives of a program or activity with respect to handicapped persons.

manner that subjects qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on 
the basis of handicap, nor may the Commission establish requirements for 
the programs or activities of certified entities that subject qualified 
handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, 
the programs or activities of entities that are certified by the 
Commission are not, themselves, covered by this part.
    (c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a 
program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to handicapped

<R05>
Sec. 6.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in 11 CFR 6.150 and 11 CFR 6.151, no 
qualified handicapped person shall be denied the benefits of, be 
excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to 
discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the Commission 
because its facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped 
persons.


<R05>
Sec. 6.150  Program accessibility; Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The Commission will operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does 
not--
    (1) Necessarily require the Commission to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;
    (2) Require the Commission to take any action that it can 
demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a 
program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. 
The Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with 11 CFR 
6.150(a) would result in such alterations or burdens. The decision that 
compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by 
the Commission after considering all agency resources available for use 
in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and 
must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching 
that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the Commission will take any other action that would not result 
in such an alteration or such a burden but would nevertheless ensure 
that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods. The Commission may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The Commission is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section. The Commission, in making 
alterations to existing buildings, will meet accessibility requirements 
to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) and any regulations implementing it. In 
choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this 
section, the Commission will give priority to those methods that offer 
programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The Commission will comply with the 
obligations established under this section within sixty days of the 
effective date of this part except that where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken, such changes will be made within three years 
of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be

[[Page 29]]

undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Commission will 
develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a 
transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such 
changes. The plan will be developed with the assistance of interested 
persons, including handicapped persons and organizations representing 
handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan will be made 
available for public inspection. The plan will, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the Commission's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period;
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan; and
    (5) Identify the persons or groups with whose assistance the plan 
was prepared.


<R05>
Sec. 6.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constucted or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Commission shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, as established in 41 
CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Secs. 6.152-6.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 6.160  Communications.

    (a) The Commission will take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The Commission will furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the Commission.
    (i) In determination what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
Commission will give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The Commission need not provide individually prescribed 
devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a 
personal nature.
    (2) Where the Commission communicates with applicants and 
beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunications devices for deaf persons 
(TDD's), or equally effective telecommunication systems will be used.
    (b) The Commission will ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The Commission will provide signage at a primary entrance to 
each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at 
which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) The Commission will take appropriate steps to provide 
handicapped persons with information regarding their section 504 rights 
under the Commission's programs of activities.
    (e) This section does not require the Commission to take any action 
that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. The Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with 
this section would result in such alterations or burdens. The decision 
that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made 
by the Commission after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the 
Commission will take any other action that would not result in such an 
alteration or such a burden but would nevertheless ensure

[[Page 30]]

that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the 
benefits and services of the program or activity.

building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), are not readily 
accessible and usable to handicapped persons.
    (f)(1) The Commission will accept and investigate a complete

complainant within 30 days of receipt of the incomplete complaint, that 
additional information is needed. If the complainant fails to complete 
the complaint within 30 days of receipt of this notice, the 
Rehabilitation Act Officer will dismiss the complaint without prejudice.
    (3) If the Rehabilitation Act Officer receives a complaint over 
which the Commission does not have jurisdiction, the Commission will 
promptly notify the complainant and will make reasonable efforts to 
refer the complaint to the appropriate governmental entity.

Sec. 7.1  Purpose and applicability.

    (a) The Federal Election Commission is committed to honest, 
independent and impartial monitoring and enforcement of federal election

conduct. This part prescribes standards of ethical conduct for 
Commissioners, employees and special Government employees of the Federal 
Election Commission relating to conflicts of interest arising out of 
outside employment, private business and professional activities, 
political activities, and financial interests. The avoidance of 
misconduct and conflicts of interest on the part of Commission employees 
through informed judgment is indispensable to the maintenance of these 
prescribed ethical standards. Attainment of these goals necessitates 
strict and absolute fairness and impartiality in the administration of 
the law.
    (b) This part applies to all persons included within the terms 
employee and special Commission employees of the Commission as defined 
in 11 CFR 7.2, except to the extent otherwise indicated herein, and is 
consistent with Executive Order 11222 and part 735 of title 5, Code of 
Federal Regulations, relating to employee responsibilities and conduct.

<R05>
Sec. 7.4  Interpretation and advisory service.

    A Commissioner or employee seeking advice and guidance on questions 
of conflict of interest and on other matters covered by this part should

consultation with the employee's supervisor, the employee's division 
head, and the Staff Director or General Counsel, concludes that remedial 
action should be taken, he or she shall refer a statement to the 
Commission containing his or her recommendation for such action. The 
Commission, after consideration of the employee's explanation and the 
results of any investigation, may direct appropriate remedial action as 
it deems necessary.
    (c) Remedial action pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section may 
include, but is not limited to:

    (4) Disciplinary action.


<R04>
  Subpart B--Conduct and Responsibilities of Employees or Commissioners


<R05>
Sec. 7.7  Prohibited conduct--General.

    A Commissioner or employee shall avoid any action whether or not 
specifically prohibited by this subpart which might result in, or create 
the appearance of:
    (a) Using public office for unlawful private gain;
    (b) Giving favorable or unfavorable treatment to any person or 
organization due to any partisan, political, or other consideration;
    (c) Impeding Government efficiency or economy;
    (d) Losing independence or impartiality;
    (e) Making a Government decision outside official channels; or
    (f) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 7.8  Gifts, entertainment, and favors.

    (a) A Commissioner or employee of the Federal Election Commission 
shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, 
favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a 
person who:
    (1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or 
financial relations with the Commission;
    (2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated or examined 
by the Commission; or
    (3) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the 
performance or nonperformance of the Commissioner or employee's official 
duty.
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply:
    (1) Where obvious family or personal relationships govern when the 
circumstances make it clear that it is those relationships rather than 
the business of the persons concerned which are the motivating factors;
    (2) To the acceptance of food, refreshments, and accompanying 
entertainment of nominal value in the ordinary course of a social 
occasion or a luncheon or dinner meeting or other function where a 
Commissioner or an employee is properly in attendance;
    (3) To the acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional 
material or other items of nominal intrinsic value such as pens,

institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities, 
such as home mortgage loans.
    (c) A Commissioner or an employee shall not solicit a contribution 
from another employee for a gift to an official superior, make a 
donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an

[[Page 34]]

paragraph does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or 
donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as 
birthday, holiday, marriage, illness, or retirement.
    (d) A Commissioner or employee shall not accept a gift, present, 
decoration, or other thing from a foreign government unless authorized

employee from receipt of a bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by 
law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is 
compatible with this part for which no Government payment or 
reimbursement is made. However, this section does not allow an employee 
or Commissioner to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on his or her 
behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or 
other personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed 
by a person for travel on official business under agency orders when 
reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller 
General dated March 7, 1967 (46 Comp. Gen. 689).


<R05>
Sec. 7.9  Outside employment or activities.

    (a) A member of the Commission shall not devote a substantial 
portion of his or her time to any other business, vocation, or 
employment. Any individual who is engaging substantially in any other 
business, vocation, or employment at the time such individual begins to 
serve as a member of the Commission shall appropriately limit such 
activity no later than 90 days after beginning to serve as such a 
member.
    (b) An employee shall not engage in outside employment that is not 
compatible with the full discharge of his or her Government employment 
and not in compliance with any labor-management agreement between the 
Federal Election Commission and a labor organization. Incompatible 
outside employment or other activities include but are not limited to:
    (1) Outside employment or other activities which would involve the 
violation of a Federal or State statute, local ordinance, Executive 
Order, or regulation to which the employee is subject;
    (2) Outside employment or other activities which would give rise to 
a real or apparent conflict of interest situation even though no 
violation of a specific statutory provision was involved;
    (3) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or 
any other thing of monetary value in circumstances where acceptance may 
result in, or create the appearance of, a conflict of interest;
    (4) Outside employment or other activities that might bring 
discredit upon the Government or Commission;
    (5) Outside employment or other activities that establish 
relationships or property interests that may result in a conflict 
between the employee's private interests and official duties;
    (6) Outside employment or other activities which would involve any 
contractor or subcontractor connected with any work performed for the 
Commission or would involve any person or organization in a position to 
gain advantage in its dealings with the Government through the 
employee's exercise of his or her official duties;
    (7) Outside employment of other activities that may be construed by 
the public to be the official acts of the Federal Election Commission. 
In any permissible outside employment, care shall be taken to ensure 
that names and titles of employees are not used to give the impression 
that the activity is officially endorsed or approved by the Commission 
or is part of the Commission's activities;
    (8) Outside employment or other activities which would involve use 
by an employee of his or her official duty time; use of official 
facilities, including office space, machines, or supplies, at any time; 
or use of the services of other employees during their official duty 
hours;
    (9) Outside employment or other activities which tend to impair the 
employee's mental or physical capacities to perform Commission duties 
and responsibilities in an acceptable manner; or
    (10) Use of information obtained as a result of Government 
employment which is not freely available to the general public or would 
not be made

[[Page 35]]

available upon request. However, written authorization for the use of 
any such information may be given when the Commission determines that 
such use would be in the public interest.
    (c) An employee shall not receive any salary or anything of monetary 
value from a private source as compensation for his or her services to 
the Government in violation of 18 U.S.C. 209.
    (d) Employees are encouraged to engage in teaching, lecturing, and 
writing that is not prohibited by law, Executive Order 11222, or this 
part. However, an employee shall not, either for or without 
compensation, engage in teaching or writing that is dependent on 
information obtained as a result of his or her Commission employment, 
except when that information has been made available to the general 
public or will be made available on request, or when the Commission 
gives written authorization for the use of nonpublic information on the 
basis that the use is in the public interest.
    (e) This section does not preclude an individual from participation 
in the affairs of or acceptance of an award for meritorious public 
contribution or achievement given by a charitable, religious, 
professional, social, fraternal, nonprofit educational, recreational, 
public service or civic organization.
    (f) An employee of the Office of General Counsel who intends to 
engage in outside employment shall obtain the approval of the General 
Counsel/Ethics Officer. All other employees who intend to engage in 
outside employment shall obtain the approval of the Staff Director prior 
to review and approval by the Ethics Officer. The request shall include 
the name of the person, group, or organization for whom the work is to 
be performed, the nature of the services to be rendered, the proposed 
hours of work, or approximate dates of employment, and the employee's 
certification as to whether the outside employment (including teaching, 
writing or lecturing) will depend in any way on information obtained as 
a result of the employee's official Government position. The employee 
will receive notice of approval or disapproval of any written request in 
accordance with any labor-management agreement between the Commission 
and a labor organization. A record of the approval shall be placed in 
each employee's official personnel folder.


<R05>
Sec. 7.10  Financial interests.

    (a)(1) A Commissioner or employee shall not engage in, directly or 
indirectly, a financial transaction as a result of, or primarily relying 
on, information obtained through his or her Commission employment.
    (2) A Commissioner or employee shall not have a direct or indirect 
financial interest that conflicts substantially, or appears to conflict 
substantially, with his or her Commission duties and responsibilities, 
except in cases where the Commissioner or employee makes full 
disclosure, and the Commissioner or employee disqualifies himself or 
herself from participating in any decisions, approval, disapproval, 
recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise in 
any proceeding of the Commission in which the financial interest is or 
appears to be affected. The filing of public financial disclosure 
reports will constitute full disclosure for all individuals who are 
required to file such reports pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act. 
Until such time as the extent, shape and form of confidential financial 
disclosure reports required of employees by the Ethics in Government Act 
has been determined, full disclosure by an employee will require that 
that employee submit a written statement to the Ethics Officer 
disclosing the particular financial interest which conflicts 
substantially, or appears to conflict substantially, with the employee's 
duties and responsibilities.
    (3) A Commissioner or employee should disqualify himself or herself

political party, or political committee subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Commission. No Commissioner or employee should work for a candidate, 
political party or political committee subject to the jurisdiction of 
the Commission. Commissioners and employees should be aware that

accepted, are subject to the restrictions of this section. A separated 
employee who has received a lump-sum payment for annual leave, however, 
is not subject to the restrictions during the period covered by the 
lump-sum payment or thereafter, provided he or she does not return to 
Federal employment during that period. An employee is not permitted to 
take a leave of absence to work with a political candidate, committee, 
or organization or become a candidate for office despite any 
understanding that he or she will resign his or her position if 
nominated or elected.

involved in the decisional process shall make or entertain any ex parte 
communications.
    (b) The prohibition of this section shall apply from the time a 
complaint is filed with the Commission pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437(a)(1) or

ascertained in the normal course of its supervisory responsibilities 
that it has reason to believe that a violation has occurred or may occur 
pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(2), and shall remain in force until the 
Commission has concluded all action with respect to the enforcement 
matter in question.
    (c) Any written communication prohibited by paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be delivered to the Ethics Officer of the Commission who 
shall place the communication in the file of the case.

the case, involved in handling enforcement actions who receives an oral 
offer or any communication concerning any enforcement action pending 
before the Commission as described in paragraph (a) of this section 
shall decline to listen to such communication. If unsuccessful in

Sec. 100.7  Contribution (2 U.S.C. 431(8)).

    (a) The term contribution includes the following payments, services 
or other things of value:
    (1) A gift, subscription, loan (except for a loan made in accordance 
with 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11)), advance, or deposit of money or anything of 
value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for 
Federal office is a contribution.
    (i) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1), the term loan includes a 
guarantee, endorsement, and any other form of security.
    (A) A loan which exceeds the contribution limitations of 2 U.S.C. 
441a and 11 CFR part 110 shall be unlawful whether or not it is repaid.
    (B) A loan is a contribution at the time it is made and is a 
contribution to the extent that it remains unpaid. The aggregate amount 
loaned to a candidate or committee by a contributor, when added to other 
contributions from that individual to that candidate or committee, shall 
not exceed the contribution limitations set forth at 11 CFR part 110. A 
loan, to the extent it is repaid, is no longer a contribution.
    (C) Except as provided in (D), a loan is a contribution by each 
endorser or guarantor. Each endorser or guarantor shall be deemed to 
have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan for which 
he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement. Any reduction in 
the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount 
endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written 
agreement. In the event that such agreement does not stipulate the 
portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the 
loan shall be considered a loan by each endorser or guarantor in the 
same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor 
bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.
    (D) A candidate may obtain a loan on which his or her spouse's 
signature is required when jointly owned assets are used as collateral 
or security for the loan. The spouse shall not be considered a 
contributor to the candidate's campaign if the value of the candidate's 
share of the property used as collateral equals or exceeds the amount of 
the loan which is used for the candidate's campaign.
    (E) If a political committee makes a loan to any person, such loan 
shall be subject to the limitations of 11 CFR part 110. Repayment of the 
principal amount of such loan to such political committee shall not be a 
contribution by the debtor to the lender committee. Such repayment shall 
be made with funds which are subject to the prohibitions of 11 CFR 
110.4(a) and part 114. The payment of interest to such committee by the 
debtor shall be a contribution only to the extent that the interest paid 
exceeds a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the loan 
is made. All payments of interest shall be made from funds subject to 
the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4(a) and part 114.
    (ii) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1), the term money includes 
currency of the United States or of any foreign nation, checks, money 
orders, or any other negotiable instruments payable on demand.
    (iii) (A) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1), the term anything of 
value includes all in-kind contributions. Unless specifically exempted 
under 11 CFR 100.7(b), the provision of any goods or services without 
charge or at a charge which is less than the usual and normal charge for 
such goods or services is a contribution. Examples of such goods or 
services include, but are

[[Page 51]]

not limited to: Securities, facilities, equipment, supplies, personnel, 
advertising services, membership lists, and mailing lists. If goods or 
services are provided at less than the usual and normal charge, the 
amount of the in-kind contribution is the difference between the usual 
and normal charge for the goods or services at the time of the 
contribution and the amount charged the political committee.
    (B) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1)(iii)(A), usual and normal 
charge for goods means the price of those goods in the market from which 
they ordinarily would have been purchased at the time of the 
contribution; and usual and normal charge for any services, other than 
those provided by an unpaid volunteer, means the hourly or piecework 
charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at 
the time the services were rendered.
    (2) The entire amount paid to attend a fundraiser or other political 
event and the entire amount paid as the purchase price for a fundraising 
item sold by a political committee is a contribution.
    (3) The payment by any person of compensation for the personal 
services of another person if those services are rendered without charge 
to a political committee for any purpose, except for legal and 
accounting services provided under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(13) or (14), is a 
contribution. No compensation is considered paid to any employee under 
any of the following conditions:
    (i) If an employee is paid on an hourly or salaried basis and is 
expected to work a particular number of hours per period, no 
contribution results if the employee engages in political activity 
during what would otherwise be a regular work period, provided that the 
taken or released time is made up or completed by the employee within a 
reasonable time.
    (ii) No contribution results where an employee engages in political 
activity during what would otherwise be normal working hours if the 
employee is paid on a commission or piecework basis, or is paid only for 
work actually performed and the employee's time is considered his or her 
own to use as he or she sees fit.
    (iii) No contribution results where the time used by the employee to 
engage in political activity is bona fide, although compensable, 
vacation time or other earned leave time.
    (4) The extension of credit by any person is a contribution unless 
the credit is extended in the ordinary course of the person's business 
and the terms are substantially similar to extensions of credit to 
nonpolitical debtors that are of similar risk and size of obligation. If 
a creditor fails to make a commercially reasonable attempt to collect 
the debt, a contribution will result. (See 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4.) If a 
debt owed by a political committee is forgiven or settled for less than 
the amount owed, a contribution results unless such debt is settled in 
accordance with the standards set forth at 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4.
    (b) The term contribution does not include the following payments, 
services or other things of value:
    (1)(i) Funds received solely for the purpose of determining whether 
an individual should become a candidate are not contributions. Examples 
of activities permissible under this exemption if they are conducted to 
determine whether an individual should become a candidate include, but 
are not limited to, conducting a poll, telephone calls, and travel. Only 
funds permissible under the Act may be used for such activities. The 
individual shall keep records of all such funds received. See 11 CFR 
101.3. If the individual subsequently becomes a candidate, the funds 
received are contributions subject to the reporting requirements of the 
Act. Such contributions must be reported with the first report filed by 
the principal campaign committee of the candidate, regardless of the 
date the funds were received.
    (ii) This exemption does not apply to funds received for activities 
indicating that an individual has decided to become a candidate for a 
particular office or for activities relevant to conducting a campaign. 
Examples of activities that indicate that an individual has decided to 
become a candidate include, but are not limited to:
    (A) The individual uses general public political advertising to 
publicize his

[[Page 52]]

or her intention to campaign for Federal office.
    (B) The individual raises funds in excess of what could reasonably 
be expected to be used for exploratory activities or undertakes 
activities designed to amass campaign funds that would be spent after he 
or she becomes a candidate.
    (C) The individual makes or authorizes written or oral statements 
that refer to him or her as a candidate for a particular office.
    (D) The individual conducts activities in close proximity to the 
election or over a protracted period of time.
    (E) The individual has taken action to qualify for the ballot under 
State law.
    (2) Any cost incurred in covering or carrying a news story, 
commentary, or editorial by any broadcasting station (including a cable 
television operator, programmer or producer), newspaper, magazine, or 
other periodical publication is not a contribution unless the facility 
is owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or 
candidate, in which case the costs for a news story (i) which represents 
a bona fide news account communicated in a publication of general 
circulation or on a licensed broadcasting facility, and (ii) which is 
part of a general pattern of campaign-related news accounts which give 
reasonably equal coverage to all opposing candidates in the circulation 
or listening area, is not a contribution.
    (3) The value of services provided without compensation by any 
individual who volunteers on behalf of a candidate or political 
committee is not a contribution.
    (4) No contribution results where an individual, in the course of 
volunteering personal services on his or her residential premises to any 
candidate or to any political committee of a political party, provides 
the use of his or her real or personal property to such candidate for 
candidate-related activity or to such political committee of a political 
party for party-related activity. For the purposes of 11 CFR 
100.7(b)(4), an individual's residential premises, shall include a 
recreation room in a residential complex where the individual 
volunteering services resides, provided that the room is available for 
use without regard to political affiliation. A nominal fee paid by such 
individual for the use of such room is not a contribution.
    (5) No contribution results where an individual, in the course of 
volunteering personal services to any candidate or political committee 
of a political party, obtains the use of a church or community room and 
provides such room to any candidate for candidate-related activity or to 
any political committee of a political party for party-related activity, 
provided that the room is used on a regular basis by members of the 
community for noncommercial purposes and the room is available for use 
by members of the community without regard to political affiliation. A 
nominal fee paid by such individual for the use of such room is not a 
contribution.
    (6) The cost of invitations, food and beverages is not a 
contribution where such items are voluntarily provided by an individual 
volunteering personal services on the individual's residential premises 
or in a church or community room as specified at 11 CFR 100.7(b) (4) and 
(5) to a candidate for candidate-related activity or to any political 
committee of a political party for party-related activity, to the extent 
that: The aggregate value of such invitations, food and beverages 
provided by the individual on behalf of the candidate does not exceed 
$1,000 with respect to any single election; and on behalf of all 
political committees of each political party does not exceed $2,000 in 
any calendar year.
    (7) The sale of any food or beverage by a vendor (whether 
incorporated or not) for use in a candidate's campaign, or for use by a 
political committee of a political party, at a charge less than the 
normal or comparable commercial rate, is not a contribution, provided 
that the charge is at least equal to the cost of such food or beverage 
to the vendor, to the extent that: The aggregate value of such discount 
given by the vendor on behalf of any single candidate does not exceed 
$1,000 with respect to any single election; and on behalf of all 
political committees of each political party does not exceed $2,000 in a 
calendar year.

[[Page 53]]

    (8) Any unreimbursed payment for transportation expenses incurred by 
any individual on behalf of any candidate or any political committee of 
a political party is not a contribution to the extent that: The 
aggregate value of the payments made by such individual on behalf of a 
candidate does not exceed $1,000 with respect to a single election; and 
on behalf of all political committees of each political party does not 
exceed $2,000 in a calendar year. Additionally, any unreimbursed payment 
from a volunteer's personal funds for usual and normal subsistence 
expenses incidental to volunteer activity is not a contribution.
    (9) The payment by a State or local committee of a political party 
of the costs of preparation, display, or mailing or other distribution 
incurred by such committee with respect to a printed slate card, sample 
ballot, palm card, or other printed listing(s) of three or more 
candidates for any public office for which an election is held in the 
State in which the committee is organized is not a contribution. The 
payment of the portion of such costs allocable to Federal candidates 
must be made from funds subject to the limitations and prohibitions of 
the Act. If made by a political committee, such payments shall be 
reported by that committee as disbursements, but need not be allocated 
in committee reports to specific candidates. This exemption shall not 
apply to costs incurred by such a committee with respect to the 
preparation and display of listings made on broadcasting stations, or in 
newspapers, magazines, and similar types of general public political 
advertising such as billboards.
    (10) Any payment made or obligation incurred by a corporation or a 
labor organization is not a contribution if under the provisions of 11 
CFR part 114 such payment or obligation would not constitute an 
expenditure by the corporation or labor organization.
    (11) A loan of money by a State bank, a federally chartered 
depository institution (including a national bank) or a depository 
institution whose deposits and accounts are insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corporation, or the National Credit Union Administration is not a 
contribution by the lending institution if such loan is made in 
accordance with applicable banking laws and regulations and is made in 
the ordinary course of business. A loan will be deemed to be made in the 
ordinary course of business if it: Bears the usual and customary 
interest rate of the lending institution for the category of loan 
involved; is made on a basis which assures repayment; is evidenced by a 
written instrument; and is subject to a due date or amortization 
schedule. Such loans shall be reported by the political committee in 
accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(a). Each endorser or guarantor shall be 
deemed to have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan 
for which he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement, except 
that, in the event of a signature by the candidate's spouse, the 
provisions of 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1)(i)(D) shall apply. Any reduction in the 
unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount 
endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written 
agreement. In the event that such agreement does not stipulate the 
portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the 
loan shall be considered a contribution by each endorser or guarantor in 
the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or 
guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors. For 
purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11), an overdraft made on a checking or 
savings account shall be considered a contribution by the bank or 
institution unless: The overdraft is made on an account which is subject 
to automatic overdraft protection; the overdraft is subject to a 
definite interest rate which is usual and customary; and there is a 
definite repayment schedule.
    (i) A loan, including a line of credit, shall be considered made on 
a basis which assures repayment if it is obtained using either of the 
sources of repayment described in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) (A) or (B) of 
this section, or a combination of paragraphs (b)(11)(i) (A) and (B) of 
this section:

[[Page 54]]

    (A)(1) The lending institution making the loan has perfected a 
security interest in collateral owned by the candidate or political 
committee receiving the loan, the fair market value of the collateral is 
equal to or greater than the loan amount and any senior liens as 
determined on the date of the loan, and the candidate or political 
committee provides documentation to show that the lending institution 
has a perfected security interest in the collateral. Sources of 
collateral include, but are not limited to, ownership in real estate, 
personal property, goods, negotiable instruments, certificates of 
deposit, chattel papers, stocks, accounts receivable and cash on 
deposit.
    (2) Amounts guaranteed by secondary sources of repayment, such as 
guarantors and cosigners, shall not exceed the contribution limits of 11 
CFR part 110 or contravene the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4, part 114 
and part 115; or
    (B) The lending institution making the loan has obtained a written 
agreement whereby the candidate or political committee receiving the 
loan has pledged future receipts, such as public financing payments 
under 11 CFR part 9001 et seq. or part 9031 et seq., contributions, or 
interest income, provided that:
    (1) The amount of the loan or loans obtained on the basis of such 
funds does not exceed the amount of pledged funds;
    (2) Loan amounts are based on a reasonable expectation of the 
receipt of pledged funds. To that end, the candidate or political 
committee must furnish the lending institution documentation, i.e., cash 
flow charts or other financial plans, that reasonably establish that 
such future funds will be available;
    (3) A separate depository account is established at the lending 
institution or the lender obtains an assignment from the candidate or 
political committee to access funds in a committee account at another 
depository institution that meets the requirements of 11 CFR 103.2, and 
the committee has notified the other institution of this assignment;
    (4) The loan agreement requires the deposit of the public financing 
payments, contributions and interest income pledged as collateral into 
the separate depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt 
according to the repayment requirements of the loan agreement; and
    (5) In the case of public financing payments, the borrower 
authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to directly deposit the 
payments into the depository account for the purpose of retiring the 
debt.
    (ii) If the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(11)(i) of this 
section are not met, the Commission will consider the totality of the 
circumstances on a case-by-case basis in determining whether a loan was 
made on a basis which assures repayment.
    (12) A gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or 
anything of value made to a national committee or a State committee of a 
political party is not a contribution if it is specifically designated 
to defray any cost incurred for construction or purchase of any office 
facility which is not acquired for the purpose of influencing the 
election of any candidate in any particular election for Federal office. 
If such gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or 
anything of value is made to a committee which is not a political 
committee under 11 CFR 100.5, the amount need not be reported. However, 
if such gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or 
anything of value is made to a political committee, it shall be reported 
in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(g).
    (13) Legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of any 
political committee of a political party are not contributions if the 
person paying for such services is the regular employer of the 
individual rendering the services and such services are not attributable 
to activities which directly further the election of any designated 
candidate for Federal office. For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(b)(13), a 
partnership shall be deemed to be the regular employer of a partner. 
Amounts paid by the regular employer for such services shall be reported 
by the committee receiving such services in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.3(h).
    (14) Legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of an 
authorized committee of a candidate or any other

[[Page 55]]

political committee are not contributions if the person paying for such 
services is the regular employer of the individual rendering the 
services and if such services are solely to ensure compliance with the 
Act or 26 U.S.C. 9001 et seq. and 9031 et seq. For purposes of 11 CFR 
100.7(b)(14), a partnership shall be deemed to be the regular employer 
of a partner. Amounts paid by the regular employer for these services 
shall be reported by the committee receiving such services in accordance 
with 11 CFR 104.3(h).
    (15) The payment by a state or local committee of a political party 
of the costs of campaign materials (such as pins, bumper stickers, 
handbills, brochures, posters, party tabloids or newletters, and yard 
signs) used by such committee in connection with volunteer activities on 
behalf of any nominee(s) of such party is not a contribution, provided 
that the following conditions are met:
    (i) Such payment is not for cost incurred in connection with any 
broadcasting, newspaper, magazine, bill board, direct mail, or similar 
type of general public communication or political advertising. For 
purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(b)(15)(i), the term direct mail means any 
mailing(s) by a commercial vendor or any mailing(s) made from commercial 
lists.
    (ii) The portion of the cost of such materials allocable to Federal 
candidates is paid from contributions subject to the limitations and 
prohibitions of the Act.
    (iii) Such payment is not made from contributions designated by the 
donor to be spent on behalf of a particular candidate or candidates for 
Federal office. For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(b)(15)(iii), a contribution 
shall not be considered a designated contribution if the party committee 
disbursing the funds makes the final decision regarding which 
candidate(s) shall receive the benefit of such disbursement.
    (iv) Such materials are distributed by volunteers and not by 
commercial or for-profit operations. For the purposes of 11 CFR 
100.7(b)(15)(iv), payments by the party organization for travel and 
subsistence or customary token payments to volunteers do not remove such 
individuals from the volunteer category.
    (v) If made by a political committee such payments shall be reported 
by the political committee as disbursements in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.3 but need not be allocated to specific candidates in committee 
reports.
    (vi) Payments by a State candidate or his or her campaign committee 
to a State or local political party committee for the State candidate's 
share of expenses for such campaign materials are not contributions, 
provided the amount paid by the State candidate or his or her committee 
does not exceed his or her proportionate share of the expenses.
    (vii) Campaign materials purchased by the national committee of a 
political party and delivered to a State or local party committee, or 
materials purchased with funds donated by the national committee to such 
State or local committee for the purchase of such materials, shall not 
qualify under this exemption. Rather, the cost of such materials shall 
be subject to the limitations of 2 U.S.C. 441a(d) and 11 CFR 110.7.
    (16) The payment by a candidate for any public office (including 
State or local office), or by such candidate's authorized committee, of 
the costs of that candidate's campaign materials which include 
information on or any reference to a candidate for Federal office and 
which are used in connection with volunteer activities (such as pins, 
bumper stickers, handbills, brochures, posters, and yard signs) is not a 
contribution to such candidate for Federal office, provided that the 
payment is not for the use of broadcasting, newspapers, magazines, 
billboards, direct mail or similar types of general public communication 
or political advertising. The payment of the portion of the cost of such 
materials allocable to Federal candidates shall be made from 
contributions subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act. 
For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(b)(16), the term direct mail means any 
mailing(s) by commercial vendors or mailing(s) made from lists which 
were not developed by the candidate.
    (17) The payment by a State or local committee of a political party 
of the

[[Page 56]]

costs of voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities conducted by 
such committee on behalf of the Presidential and Vice Presidential 
nominee(s) of that party, is not a contribution to such candidate(s) 
provided that the following conditions are met:
    (i) Such payment is not for the costs incurred in connection with 
any broadcasting, newspaper, magazine, billboard, direct mail, or 
similar type of general public communication or political advertising. 
For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(b)(17)(i), the term direct mail means any 
mailing(s) by a commercial vendor or any mailing(s) made from commercial 
lists.
    (ii) The portion of the costs of such activities allocable to 
Federal candidates is paid from contributions subject to the limitations 
and prohibitions of the Act.
    (iii) Such payment is not made from contributions designated to be 
spent on behalf of a particular candidate or candidates for Federal 
office. For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(b)(17)(iii), a contribution shall 
not be considered a designated contribution if the party committee 
disbursing the funds makes the final decision regarding which 
candidate(s) shall receive the benefit of such disbursement.
    (iv) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(b)(17), if such activities include 
references to any candidate(s) for the House or Senate, the costs of 
such activities which are allocable to that candidate(s) shall be a 
contribution to such candidate(s) unless the mention of such 
candidate(s) is merely incidental to the overall activity.
    (v) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7(b)(17), payment of the costs 
incurred in the use of phone banks in connection with voter registration 
and get-out-the-vote activities is not a contribution when such phone 
banks are operated by volunteer workers. The use of paid professionals 
to design the phone bank system, develop calling instructions and train 
supervisors is permissible. The payment of the costs of such 
professional services is not an expenditure but shall be reported as a 
disbursement in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3 if made by a political 
committee.
    (vi) If made by a political committee, such payments for voter 
registration and get-out-the-vote activities shall be reported by that 
committee as disbursements in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3, but such 
payments need not be allocated to specific candidates in committee 
reports except as provided in 11 CFR 100.7(b)(17)(iv).
    (vii) Payments made from funds donated by a national committee of a 
political party to a State or local party committee for voter 
registration and get-out-the-vote activities shall not qualify under 
this exemption. Rather, such funds shall be subject to the limitations 
of 2 U.S.C. 441a(d) and 11 CFR 110.7.
    (18) Payments made to any party committee by a candidate or the 
authorized committee of a candidate as a condition of ballot access are 
not contributions.
    (19) [Reserved]
    (20) A gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or 
anything of value made with respect to a recount of the results of a 
Federal election, or an election contest concerning a Federal election, 
is not a contribution except that the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4(a) 
and part 114 apply.
    (21) Funds provided to defray costs incurred in staging candidate 
debates in accordance with the provisions of 11 CFR 110.13 and 114.4(f).
    (c) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.7 (a) and (b), a contribution or 
payment made by an individual shall not be attributed to any other 
individual, unless otherwise specified by that other individual in 
accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k).

Sec. 100.8  Expenditure (2 U.S.C. 431(9)).

    (a) The term expenditure incudes the following payments, gifts or 
other things of value:
    (1) A purchase, payment, distribution, loan (except for a loan made 
in accordance with 11 CFR 100.8(b)(12)), advance, deposit, or gift of 
money or

[[Page 57]]

anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any 
election for Federal office is an expenditure.
    (i) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(a)(1), the term payment includes 
payment of any interest on an obligation and any guarantee or 
endorsement of a loan by a candidate or a political committee.
    (ii) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(a)(1), the term payment does not 
include the repayment by a political committee of the principal of an 
outstanding obligation which is owed by such committee, except that the 
repayment shall be reported as disbursements in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.3(b).
    (iii) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(a)(1), the term money includes 
currency of the United States or of any foreign nation, checks, money 
orders, or any other negotiable instrument payable on demand.
    (iv)(A) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(a)(1), the term anything of

under 11 CFR 100.8(b), the provision of any goods or services without 
charge or at a charge which is less than the usual and normal charge for 
the goods or services is an expenditure. Examples of such goods or 
services include, but are not limited to: Securities, facilities, 
equipment, supplies, personnel, advertising services, membership lists, 
and mailing lists. If goods or services are provided at less than the 
usual and normal charge, the amount of the expenditure is the difference 
between the usual and normal charge for the goods or services at the 
time of the expenditure and the amount charged the candidate or 
political committee.
    (B) For the purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(a)(1)(iv)(A), usual and normal 
charge for goods means the price of those goods in the market from which 
they ordinarily would have been purchased at the time of the 
expenditure; and usual and normal charge for services, other than those 
provided by an unpaid volunteer, means the hourly or piecework charge 
for the services at a commerically reasonable rate prevailing at the 
time the services were rendered.
    (2) A written contract, including a media contract, promise, or 
agreement to make an expenditure is an expenditure as of the date such 
contract, promise or obligation is made.
    (3) An independent expenditure which meets the requirements of 11 
CFR 104.4 or part 109 is an expenditure, and such independent 
expenditure is to be reported by the person making the expenditure in 
accordance with 11 CFR 104.4 and part 109.
    (b) The term expenditure does not include the following payments, 
gifts, or other things of value:
    (1)(i) Payments made solely for the purpose of determining whether 
an individual should become a candidate are not expenditures. Examples 
of activities permissible under this exemption if they are conducted to 
determine whether an individual should become a candidate include, but 
are not limited to, conducting a poll, telephone calls, and travel. Only 
funds permissible under the Act may be used for such activities. The 
individual shall keep records of all such payments. See 11 CFR 101.3. If 
the individual subsequently becomes a candidate, the payments made are 
subject to the reporting requirements of the Act. Such expenditures must 
be reported with the first report filed by the principal campaign 
committee of the candidate, regardless of the date the payments were 
made.
    (ii) This exemption does not apply to payments made for activities 
indicating that an individual has decided to become a candidate for a 
particular office or for activities relevant to conducting a campaign. 
Examples of activities that indicate that an individual has decided to 
become a candidate include, but are not limited to:
    (A) The individual uses general public political advertising to 
publicize his or her intention to campaign for Federal office.
    (B) The individual raises funds in excess of what could reasonably 
be expected to be used for exploratory activities or undertakes 
activities designed to amass campaign funds that would be spent after he 
or she becomes a candidate.

    (E) The individual has taken action to qualify for the ballot under 
State law.
    (2) Any cost incurred in covering or carrying a new story, 
commentary, or editorial by any broadcasting station (including a cable 
television operator, programmer or producer), newspaper, magazine, or 
other periodical publication is not an expenditure unless the facility 
is owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or 
candidate, in which case the costs for a news story (i) which represents 
a bona fide news account communicated in a publication of general 
circulation or on a licensed broadcasting facility, and (ii) which is 
part of a general pattern of campaign-related news account which give 
reasonably equal coverage to all opposing candidates in the circulation 
or listening area, is not an expenditure.
    (3) Any cost incurred for activity designed to encourage individuals 
to register to vote or to vote is not an expenditure if no effort is or 
has been made to determine the party or candidate preference of 
individuals before encouraging them to register to vote or to vote, 
except that corporations and labor organizations shall engage in such 
activity in accordance with 11 CFR 114.4 (c) and (d). See also 11 CFR 
114.3(c)(4)
    (4) Any cost incurred for any communication by a membership 
organization, including a labor organization, to its members, or any 
cost incurred for any communication by a corporation to its stockholders 
or executive or administrative personnel, is not an expenditure, except 
that the costs directly attributable to such a communication that 
expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified 
candidate (other than a communication primarily devoted to subjects 
other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly 
identified candidate) shall, if those costs exceed $2,000 per election, 
be reported to the Commission on FEC Form 7 in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.6.
    (i) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(4), labor organization means an 
organization of any kind (any local, national, or international union, 
or any local or State central body of a federation of unions is each 
considered a separate labor organization for purposes of this section) 
or any agency or employee representative committee or plan, in which 
employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in 
part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, 
wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.
    (ii) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(4), stockholder means a person 
who has a vested beneficial interest in stock, has the power to direct 
how that stock shall be voted, if it is voting stock, and has the right 
to receive dividends.
    (iii) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(4), executive or 
administrative personnel means individuals employed by a corporation who 
are paid on a salary rather than hourly basis and who have policymaking, 
managerial, professional, or supervisory responsibilities.
    (A) This definition includes--

officers, other executives, and plant, division, and section managers; 
and
    (2) Individuals following the recognized professions, such as 
lawyers and engineers.

    (1) Professionals who are represented by a labor organization;
    (2) Salaried foremen and other salaried lower level supervisors 
having direct supervision over hourly employees;
    (3) Former or retired personnel who are not stockholders; or
    (4) Individuals who may be paid by the corporation, such as

31.3401(c)-(1), of the corporation for the purpose of the collection of, 
and liability for, employee tax under 26 CFR 31.3402(a)-(1).
    (C) Individuals on commission may be considered executive or

professional, or supervisory responsibility and if the individuals are 
employees, within the meaning of 26 CFR 31.3401(c)-(1), of the 
corporation for the purpose of the collection of, and liability for, 
employee tax under 26 CFR 31.3402(a)-(1).

[[Page 59]]

    (D) The Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 USC 201, et seq. and the 
regulations issued pursuant to such Act, 29 CFR part 541, et seq., may 
serve as a guideline in determining whether individuals have 
policymaking, managerial, professional, or supervisory responsibilities.
    (iv) (A) For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section membership 
organization means an unincorporated association, trade association, 
cooperative, corporation without capital stock, or a local, national, or 
international labor organization that:
    (1) Is composed of members, some or all of whom are vested with the 
power and authority to operate or administer the organization, pursuant 
to the organization's articles, bylaws, constitution or other formal 
organizational documents;

    (4) Expressly solicits persons to become members;
    (5) Expressly acknowledges the acceptance of membership, such as by 
sending a membership card or including the member's name on a membership 
newsletter list; and
    (6) Is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the 
nomination for election, or election, of any individual for Federal 
office.
    (B) For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the term 
members includes all persons who are currently satisfying the 
requirements for membership in a membership organization, affirmatively 
accept the membership organization's invitation to become a member, and 
either:
    (1) Have some significant financial attachment to the membership 
organization, such as a significant investment or ownership stake; or
    (2) Pay membership dues at least annually, of a specific amount 
predetermined by the organization; or
    (3) Have a significant organizational attachment to the membership 
organization which includes: affirmation of membership on at least an 
annual basis and direct participatory rights in the governance of the 
organization. For example, such rights could include the right to vote 
directly or indirectly for at least one individual on the membership 
organization's highest governing board; the right to vote on policy 
questions where the highest governing body of the membership 
organization is obligated to abide by the results; the right to approve 
the organization's annual budget; or the right to participate directly 
in similar aspects of the organization's governance.
    (C) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(B) of 
this section, the Commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, 
that persons who do not precisely meet the requirements of the general 
rule, but have a relatively enduring and independently significant 
financial or organizational attachment to the organization, may be 
considered members for purposes of this section. For example, student 
members who pay a lower amount of dues while in school, long term dues 
paying members who qualify for lifetime membership status with little or 
no dues obligation, and retired members may be considered members of the 
organization.
    (D) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (b)(4)(iv)(B)(1) 
through (3) of this section, members of a local union are considered to 
be members of any national or international union of which the local 
union is a part and of any federation with which the local, national, or 
international union is affiliated.
    (E) In the case of a membership organization which has a national 
federation structure or has several levels, including, for example, 
national, state, regional and/or local affiliates, a person who 
qualifies as a member of any entity within the federation or of any 
affiliate by meeting the requirements of paragraphs (b)(4)(iv)(B)(1), 
(2), or (3) of this section shall also qualify as a member of all 
affiliates for purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section. The 
factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5(g)(2), (3) and (4) shall be used to 
determine whether entities are affiliated for purposes of this 
paragraph.

[[Page 60]]

    (F) The status of a membership organization, and of members, for 
purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, shall be determined 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section and not by provisions 
of state law governing unincorporated associations, trade associations, 
cooperatives, corporations without capital stock, or labor 
organizations.
    (v) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(4), election means two separate 
processes in a calendar year, to each of which the $2,000 threshold 
described above applies separately. The first process is comprised of 
all primary elections for Federal office, whenever and wherever held; 
the second process is comprised of all general elections for Federal 
office, whenever and wherever held. The term election shall also include 
each special election held to fill a vacancy in a Federal office (11 CFR 
100.2(f)) or each runoff election (11 CFR 100.2(d)).
    (vi) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(4), corporation means any 
separately incorporated entity, whether or not affiliated.
    (vii) When the aggregate costs under 11 CFR 100.8(b)(4) exceed 
$2,000 per election, all costs of the communication(s) shall be reported 
on the filing dates specified in 11 CFR 104.6, and shall include the 
total amount expended for each candidate supported.
    (5) No expenditure results where an individual, in the course of 
volunteering personal services on his or her residential premises to any 
candidate or political committee of a political party, provides the use 
of his or her real or personal property to such candidate for candidate-
related activity or to such political committee of a political party for 
party-related activity. For the purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(5), an 
individual's residential premises shall include a recreation room in a 
residential complex where the individual volunteering services resides, 
provided that the room is available for use without regard to political 
affiliation. A nominal fee paid by such individual for the use of such 
room is not an expenditure.
    (6) No expenditure results where an individual, in the course of 
volunteering personal services to any candidate or political committee 
of a political party, obtains the use of a church or community room and 
provides such room to any candidate for candidate-related activity or to 
any political committee of a political party for party-related activity, 
provided that the room is used on a regular basis by members of the 
community for noncommercial purposes and the room is available for use 
by members of the community without regard to political affiliation. A 
nominal fee paid by such individual for the use of such room is not an 
expenditure.
    (7) The cost of invitations, food, and beverages is not an 
expenditure where such items are voluntarily provided by an individual 
in rendering voluntary personal services on the individual's residential 
premises or in a church or community room as specified at 11 CFR 
100.8(b) (5) and (6) to a candidate for candidate-related activity or to 
a political committee of a political party for party-related activity, 
to the extent that: The aggregate value of such invitations, food and 
beverages provided by the individual on behalf of the candidate does not 
exceed $1,000 with respect to any single election; and on behalf of all 
political committees of each political party does not exceed $2,000 in 
any calendar year.
    (8) The sale of any food or beverage by a vendor (whether 
incorporated or not) for use in a candidate's campaign, or for use by a 
political committee of a political party, at a charge less than the 
normal or comparable commercial charge, is not an expenditure, provided 
that the charge is at least equal to the cost of such food or beverage 
to the vendor, to the extent that: The aggregate value of such discount 
given by the vendor on behalf of any single candidate does not exceed 
$1,000 with respect to any single election; and on behalf of all 
political committees of each political party does not exceed $2,000 in a 
calendar year.
    (9) Any unreimbursed payment for transportation expenses incurred by 
any individual on behalf of any candidate or political committee of a 
political party is not an expenditure to the extent that: The aggregate 
value of the payments made by such individual

[[Page 61]]

on behalf of a candidate does not exceed $1,000 with respect to a single 
election; and on behalf of all political committees of each political 
party does not exceed $2,000 in a calendar year. Additionally, any 
unreimbursed payment from a volunteer's personal funds for usual and 
normal subsistence expenses incident to volunteer activity is not an 
expenditure.
    (10) The payment by a State or local committee of a political party 
of the costs of preparation, display, or mailing or other distribution 
incurred by such committee with respect to a printed slate card, sample 
ballot, palm card, or other printed listing(s) of three or more 
candidates for any public office for which an election is held in the 
State in which the committee is organized is not an expenditure. The 
payment of the portion of such costs allocable to Federal candidates 
must be made from funds subject to the limitations and prohibitions of 
the Act. If made by a political party committee, such payments shall be 
reported by that committee as disbursements, but need not be allocated 
in committee reports to specific candidates. This exemption shall not 
apply to costs incurred by such a committee with respect to the 
preparation and display of listings made on broadcasting stations, or in 
newspapers, magazines, and similar types of general public political 
advertising such as billboards.
    (11) Any payment made or obligation incurred by a corporation or 
labor organization is not an expenditure if under the provisions of 11 
CFR part 114 such payment or obligation would not constitute an 
expenditure by the corporation or labor organization.
    (12) A loan of money by a State bank, a federally chartered 
depository institution (including a national bank) or a depository 
institution whose deposits and accounts are insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corporation, or the National Credit Union Administration is not an 
expenditure by the lending institution if such loan is made in 
accordance with applicable banking laws and regulations and is made in 
the ordinary course of business. A loan will be deemed to be made in the 
ordinary course of business if it: Bears the usual and customary 
interest rate of the lending institution for the category of loan 
involved; is made on a basis which assures repayment; is evidenced by a 
written instrument; and is subject to a due date or amortization 
schedule. Such loans shall be reported by the political committee in 
accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(a). Each endorser or guarantor shall be 
deemed to have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan 
for which he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement, except 
that, in the event of a signature by the candidate's spouse, the 
provisions of 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1)(i)(D) shall apply. Any reduction in the 
unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount 
endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written 
agreement. In the event that the loan agreement does not stipulate the 
portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the 
loan shall be considered an expenditure by each endorser or guarantor in 
the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or 
guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors. For the 
purpose of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(12), an overdraft made on a checking or 
savings account shall be considered an expenditure unless: The overdraft 
is made on an account which is subject to automatic overdraft 
protection; and the overdraft is subject to a definite interest rate and 
a definite repayment schedule.
    (i) A loan, including a line of credit, shall be considered made on 
a basis which assures repayment if it is obtained using either of the 
sources of repayment described in paragraphs (b)(12)(i) (A) or (B) of 
this section, or a combination of paragraphs (b)(12)(i) (A) and (B) of 
this section:
    (A)(1) The lending institution making the loan has perfected a 
security interest in collateral owned by the candidate or political 
committee receiving the loan; the fair market value of the collateral is 
equal to or greater than the loan amount and any senior liens as 
determined on the date of the loan; and the candidate or political 
committee provides documentation to show

[[Page 62]]

that the lending institution has a perfected security interest in the 
collateral. Sources of collateral include, but are not limited to, 
ownership in real estate, personal property, goods, negotiable 
instruments, certificates of deposit, chattel papers, stocks, accounts 
receivable and cash on deposit.
    (2) Amounts guaranteed by secondary sources of repayment, such as 
guarantors and cosigners, shall not exceed the contribution limits of 11 
CFR part 110 or contravene the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4, part 114 
and part 115; or
    (B) The lending institution making the loan has obtained a written 
agreement whereby the candidate or political committee receiving the 
loan has pledged future receipts, such as public financing payments 
under 11 CFR part 9001 et seq. or part 9031 et seq., contributions, or 
interest income, provided that:
    (1) The amount of the loan(s) obtained the basis of such funds does 
not exceed the amount of pledged funds;
    (2) Loan amounts are based on a reasonable expectation of the 
receipt of pledged funds. To that end, the candidate or political 
committee must furnish the lending institution documentation, i.e., cash 
flow charts or other financial plans, that reasonably establish that 
such future funds will be available;
    (3) A separate depository account is established at the lending 
institution or the lender obtains an assignment from the candidate or 
political committee to access funds in a committee account at another 
depository institution that meets the requirements of 11 CFR 103.2, and 
the committee has notified the other institution of this assignment;
    (4) The loan agreement requires the deposit of the public financing 
payments, contributions, interest or other income pledged as collateral 
into the separate depository account for the purpose of retiring the 
debt according to the repayment requirements of the loan; and
    (5) In the case of public financing payments, the borrower 
authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to directly deposit the 
payments into the depository account for the purpose of retiring the 
debt.
    (ii) If the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(12)(i) of this 
section are not met, the Commission will consider the totality of 
circumstances on a case-by-case basis in determining whether a loan was 
made on a basis which assures repayment.
    (13) A purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, or deposit of 
money or anything of value made to a national committee or a state 
committee of a political party is not an expenditure if it is 
specifically designated to defray any cost incurred for construction or 
purchase of any office facility which is not acquired for the purpose of 
influencing the election of any candidate in any particular election for 
Federal office. If such purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, 
or deposit of money or anything of value is made to a committee which is 
not a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5, the amount need not be 
reported. However, if such purchase, payment, distribution, loan, 
advance, or deposit of money or anything of value is made to a political 
committee, it shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(g).
    (14) Legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of any 
political committee of a political party are not expenditures if the 
person paying for such services is the regular employer of the 
individual rendering the services and such services are not attributable 
to activities which directly further the election of any designated 
candidate for Federal office. For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(14), a 
partnership shall be deemed to be the regular employer of a partner. 
Amounts paid by the regular employer for such services shall be reported 
by the committee receiving such services in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.3(h).
    (15) Legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of an 
authorized committee of a candidate or any other political committee are 
not expenditures if the person paying for such services is the regular 
employer of the individual rendering such services and if the services 
are solely to ensure compliance with the Act or 26 U.S.C. 9001 et seq. 
and 9032 et seq. For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(15), a partnership 
shall be deemed to be the regular employer of a

[[Page 63]]

partner. Amounts paid by the regular employer for these services shall 
be reported by the committee receiving such services in accordance with 
11 CFR 104.3(h). Expenditures for these services by a candidate 
certified to receive Primary Matching Funds under 11 CFR part 9034 do 
not count against such candidate's expenditure limitations under 11 CFR 
part 9035 or 11 CFR 110.8. Unless paid for with federal funds received 
pursuant to 11 CFR part 9005, disbursements for these services by a 
candidate who is certified to receive payments from the Presidential 
Election Campaign Fund under 11 CFR part 9005 do not count against that 
candidate's expenditure limitations under 11 CFR 110.8.
    (16) The payment by a state or local committee of a political party 
of the costs of campaign materials (such as pins, bumper stickers, 
handbills, brochures, posters, party tabloids or newsletters, and yard 
signs) used by such committee in connection with volunteer activities on 
behalf of any nominee(s) of such party is not an expenditure, provided 
that the following conditions are met.
    (i) Such payment is not for costs incurred in connection with any 
broadcasting, newspaper, magazine, billboard, direct mail, or similar 
type of general public communication or political advertising. For the 
purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(16)(i), the term direct mail means any 
mailing(s) by a commercial vendor or any mailing(s) made from commercial 
lists.
    (ii) The portion of the cost of such materials allocable to Federal 
candidates is paid from contributions subject to the limitations and 
prohibitions of the Act.
    (iii) Such payment is not made from contributions designated by the 
donor to be spent on behalf of a particular candidate or candidates for 
Federal office. For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(16)(iii), a contribution 
shall not be considered a designated contribution if the party committee 
disbursing the funds makes the final decision regarding which 
candidate(s) shall receive the benefit of such disbursement.
    (iv) Such materials are distributed by volunteers and not by 
commercial or for-profit operations. For the purposes of 11 CFR 
100.8(b)(16)(iv), payments by the party organization for travel and 
subsistence or customary token payments to volunteers do not remove such 
individuals from the volunteer category.
    (v) If made by a political party committee, such payments shall be 
reported by that committee as disbursements, in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.3, but need not be allocated to specific candidates in committee 
reports.
    (vi) Payments by a State candidate or his or her campaign committee 
to a State or local political party committee for the State candidate's 
share of expenses for such campaign materials are not expenditures, 
provided the amount paid by the State candidate or his or her committee 
does not exceed his or her proportionate share of the expenses.
    (vii) Campaign materials purchased by the national committee of a 
political party and delivered to a State or local party committee, or 
materials purchased with funds donated by the national committee to such 
State or local committee for the purchase of such materials, shall not 
qualify under this exemption. Rather, the cost of such materials shall 
be subject to the limitations of 2 U.S.C. 441a(d) and 11 CFR 110.7.
    (17) The payment by a candidate for any public office (including 
State or local office), or by such candidate's authorized committee, of 
the costs of that candidate's campaign materials which include 
information on or any reference to a candidate for Federal office and 
which are used in connection with volunteer activities (such as pins, 
bumper stickers, handbills, brochures, posters, and yard signs) is not 
an expenditure on behalf of such candidate for Federal office, provided 
that the payment is not for the use of broadcasting, newspapers, 
magazines, billboards, direct mail or similar types of general public 
communication or political advertising. The payment of the portion of 
the cost of such materials allocable to Federal candidates shall be made 
from contributions subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the 
Act. For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(17), the term direct mail means 
mailings by commercial vendors or mailings made

[[Page 64]]

from lists which were not developed by the candidate.
    (18) The payment by a State or local committee of a political party 
of the costs of voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities 
conducted by such committee on behalf of the Presidential and Vice 
Presidential nominee(s) of that party is not an expenditure for the 
purpose of influencing the election of such candidates provided that the 
following conditions are met:
    (i) Such payment is not for the costs incurred in connection with 
any broadcasting, newspaper, magazine, billboard, direct mail, or 
similar type of general public communication or political advertising. 
For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(18)(i), the term direct mail means any 
mailing(s) by a commercial vendor or any mailing(s) made from commercial 
lists.
    (ii) The portion of the costs of such activities allocable to 
Federal candidates is paid from contributions subject to the limitations 
and prohibitions of the Act.
    (iii) Such payment is not made from contributions designated to be 
spent on behalf of a particular candidate or candidates for Federal 
office. For the purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(18)(iii), a contribution 
shall not be considerd a designated contribution if the party committee 
disbursing the funds makes the final decision regarding which 
candidate(s) shall receive the benefit of such disbursement.
    (iv) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(18), if such activities include 
references to any candidate(s) for the House or Senate, the costs of 
such activities which are allocable to that candidate(s) shall be an 
expenditure on behalf of such candidate(s) unless the mention of such 
candidate(s) is merely incidental to the overall activity.
    (v) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(18), payment of the costs 
incurred in the use of phone banks in connection with voter registration 
and get-out-the-vote activities is not an expenditure when such phone 
banks are operated by volunteer workers. The use of paid professionals 
to design the phone bank system, develop calling instructions and train 
supervisors is permissible. The payment of the costs of such 
professional services is not an expenditure but shall be reported as a 
disbursement in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3 if made by a political 
committee.
    (vi) If made by a political committee, such payments for voter

defined at 11 CFR 110.10(b), for the candidate's routine living expenses 
which would have been incurred without candidacy, including the cost of

a member of the candidate's family as defined in 11 CFR 113.1(g)(7), are 
not expenditures if the payments are made from an account jointly held 
with the candidate, or if the expenses were paid by the family member 
before the candidate became a candidate.
    (23) Funds used to defray costs incurred in staging candidate 
debates in accordance with the provisions of 11 CFR 110.13 and 114.4(f).
    (c) For purposes of 11 CFR 100.8 (a) and (b), a payment made by an

Sec. 102.5  Organizations financing political activity in connection with Federal and non-Federal elections, other than through transfers and joint fundraisers.

    (a) Organizations that are political committees under the Act
    (1) Each organization, including a party committee, which finances 
political activity in connection with both federal and non-federal 
elections and which qualifies as a political committee under 11 CFR 
100.5 shall either:
    (i) Establish a separate federal account in a depository in 
accordance with 11 CFR part 103. Such account shall be treated as a 
separate federal political committee which shall comply with the 
requirements of the Act including the registration and reporting 
requirements of 11 CFR parts 102 and 104. Only funds subject to the 
prohibitions and limitations of the Act shall be deposited in such 
separate federal account. All disbursements, contributions, expenditures 
and transfers by the committee in connection with any federal election 
shall be made from its federal account. No transfers may be made to such 
federal account from any other account(s) maintained by such 
organization for the purpose of financing activity in connection with 
non-federal elections, except as provided in 11 CFR 106.5(g) and 
106.6(e). Administrative expenses shall be allocated pursuant to 11 CFR 
part 106 between such federal account and any other account maintained 
by such committee for the purpose of financing activity in connection 
with non-federal elections; or
    (ii) Establish a political committee which shall receive only 
contributions subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act, 
regardless of whether such contributions are for use in connection with 
federal or non-federal elections. Such organization shall register as a 
political committee and comply with the requirements of the Act.
    (2) Only contributions meeting the conditions set forth at 
subsections (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section may be deposited in a 
federal account established under 11 CFR 102.5(a)(1)(i) or may be 
received by a political committee established under 11 CFR 
102.5(a)(1)(ii).
    (i) Contributions designated for the federal account;
    (ii) Contributions that result from a solicitation which expressly 
states that the contribution will be used in connection with a federal 
election; and
    (iii) Contributions from contributors who are informed that all 
contributions are subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the 
Act.
    (3) Any party committee solicitation that makes reference to a 
federal candidate or a federal election shall be presumed to be for the 
purpose of influencing a federal election, and contributions resulting 
from that solicitation shall be subject to the prohibitions and 
limitations of the Act. This presumption may be rebutted by 
demonstrating to the Commission that the funds were solicited with 
express notice that they would not be used for federal election 
purposes.
    (b) Organizations that are not political committees under the Act
    (1) Any organization that makes contributions or expenditures but 
does not qualify as a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5 and any 
State or local party organization that makes contributions, expenditures 
and exempted payments under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(9), (15) and (17) and 
100.8(b)(10), (16) and (18) shall either:
    (i) Establish a separate account to which only funds subject to the 
prohibitions and limitations of the Act shall be deposited and from 
which contributions, expenditures and exempted payments shall be made. 
Such organization shall keep records of deposits to and disbursements 
from such account and, upon request, shall make such records available 
for examination by the Commission.
    (ii) Demonstrate through a reasonable accounting method that 
whenever such organization makes a contribution, expenditure or exempted 
payment, that organization has received sufficient funds subject to the 
limitations and prohibitions of the Act to make such contribution, 
expenditure or payment. Such organization shall keep records of amounts 
received or expended under this subsection and, upon

[[Page 72]]

request, shall make such records available for examination by the 
Commission.

Sec. 102.6  Transfers of funds; collecting agents.

    (a) Transfers of funds; registration and reporting required--(1) Who 
may make transfers under this section. (i) Transfers of funds may be 
made without limit on amount between affiliated committees whether or 
not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5.
    (ii) Transfers of funds may be made without limit on amount between 
or among a national party committee, a State party committee and/or any 
subordinate party committee whether or not they are political committees 
under 11 CFR 100.5 and whether or not such committees are affiliated.
    (iii) Transfers of joint fundraising proceeds may be made without 
limit on amount between organizations or committees participating in the 
joint fundraising activity provided that no participating committee or 
organization governed by 11 CFR 102.17 received more than its allocated 
share of the funds raised.
    (iv) Transfers under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) shall be 
made only from funds which are permissible under the Act. See 11 CFR 
parts 110, 114 and 115.
    (2) When registration and reporting required. Except as provided in 
11 CFR 102.6(b), organizations or committees making transfers under 11 
CFR 102.6(a)(1) shall count such transfers against the reporting 
thresholds of the Act for determining whether an organization or 
committee is a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5.
    (b) Fundraising by collecting agents; No reporting required--(1) 
Definition of collecting agent. A collecting agent is an organization or 
committee that collects and transmits contributions to one or more 
separate segregated funds to which the collecting agent is related. A 
collecting agent may be either:
    (i) A committee, whether or not it is a political committee as 
defined in 11 CFR 100.5, affiliated with the separate segregated fund 
under 11 CFR 110.3; or
    (ii) The connected organization of the separate segregated fund as 
defined in 11 CFR 100.6; or
    (iii) A parent, subsidiary, branch, division, department, or local 
unit of the connected organization of the separate segregated fund; or
    (iv) A local, national or international union collecting 
contributions on behalf of the separate segregated fund of any 
federation with which the local, national or international union is 
affiliated. See 11 CFR 114.1(e).
    (2) Collecting agent not required to report. A collecting agent that 
is an unregistered organization and that follows the procedures of 11 
CFR 102.6(c) is not required to register and report as a political 
committee under 11 CFR parts 102 and 104, provided that the organization 
does not engage in other activities such as making contributions or 
expenditures for the purpose of influencing federal elections.
    (3) Who is not a collecting agent--(i) Commercial fundraising firm. 
A separate segregated fund or a collecting agent may hire a commercial 
fundraising firm to assist in fundraising; however, the commercial 
fundraising firm shall not be considered as a collecting agent for the 
purpose of this section. Rather, the commercial fundraising firm shall 
be considered to be the agent of the separate segregated fund or 
collecting agent.
    (ii) Individuals. An individual who collects contributions for a 
separate segregated fund shall not be considered a collecting agent for 
the purpose of this section. Individuals who collect contributions are 
subject to the requirements of 11 CFR 102.8 and the provisions of 11 CFR 
part 110.
    (4) Separate segregated fund may collect contributions. Nothing in 
this section shall preclude a separate segregated fund from soliciting 
and collecting contributions on its own behalf.
    (c) Procedures for collecting agents--(1)Separate segregated fund 
responsible for acts of collecting agent. The separate segregated fund 
shall be responsible for ensuring that the recordkeeping, reporting and 
transmittal requirements of this section are met.

[[Page 73]]

    (2) Solicitation for contributions. A collecting agent may include a 
solicitation for voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund 
in a bill for membership dues or other payments such as conference 
registration fees or a solicitation for contributions to the collecting 
agent. The collecting agent may only solicit contributions from those 
persons permitted to be solicited under 11 CFR part 114. The 
solicitation for contributions must meet all of the requirements for 
proper solicitations under 11 CFR 114.5.
    (i) The collecting agent may pay any or all of the costs incurred in 
soliciting and transmitting contributions to the separate segregated 
fund.
    (ii) If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other 
administrative expense from its own account, which expense could be paid 
for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting 
agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30 
calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated 
fund.
    (3) Checks combining contributions with other payments. A 
contributor may write a check that represents both a contribution and 
payment of dues or other fees. The check must be drawn on the 
contributor's personal checking account or on a non-repayable corporate 
drawing account of the individual contributor. Under a payroll deduction 
plan, an employer may write a check on behalf of its employees to a 
union or its agent, which check represents a combined payment of 
voluntary contributions to the union's separate segregated fund and 
union dues or other employee deductions.
    (4) Transmittal of contributions. The full amount of each 
contribution collected by a collecting agent on behalf of a separate 
segregated fund shall be transmitted to that fund within 10 or 30 days 
as required by 11 CFR 102.8.
    (i) Checks made payable to the separate segregated fund shall be 
transmitted by the collecting agent directly to the separate segregated 
fund in accordance with 11 CFR 102.8.
    (ii) To transfer all other contributions, a collecting agent shall 
either:
    (A) Establish a transmittal account to be used solely for the 
deposit and transmittal of funds collected on behalf of the separate 
segregated fund. Funds deposited into this account are subject to the 
prohibitions and limitations of the Act. If any expenditure is made from 
the account, other than a transfer of funds to an affiliated committee, 
the account shall be considered a depository of the recipient committee 
and all activity of that account shall be reported; or
    (B) Deposit the contributions collected into the collecting agent's 
treasury account. The collecting agent shall keep separate records of 
all receipts and deposits that represent contributions to the separate 
segregated fund and, in the case of cash contributions, the collecting 
agent shall make separate deposits of such funds; or
    (C) Deposit the contributions collected into an account otherwise 
established solely for State or local election activity. The collecting 
agent shall keep separate records of all receipts and deposits that 
represent contributions to the separate segregated fund; or
    (D) In the case of cash contributions, transmit the contributions to 
the separate segregated fund in the form of money orders or cashier's 
checks.
    (5) Contributor information. The collecting agent shall comply with 
the requirements of 11 CFR 102.8 regarding transmittal of contributions 
and contributor information to the separate segregated fund, except that 
if contributions of $50 or less are received at a mass collection, a 
record shall be kept of the date, the total amount collected, and the 
name of the function at which the collection was made.
    (6) Retention of records. The collecting agent shall retain all 
records of contribution deposits and transmittals under this section for 
a period of three years and shall make these records available to the 
Commission on request. The separate segregated fund shall keep a record 
of all transmittals of contributions received from collecting agents 
under this section, and shall retain these records for a period of three 
years.
    (7) Reporting of funds received through collecting agents. A 
separate segregated fund receiving contributions collected by a 
collecting agent shall report the

[[Page 74]]

full amount of each contribution received as a contribution from the 
original contributor to the extent required by 11 CFR 104.3(a).

reporting political committee and an authorized committee of each 
candidate for federal office participating in the joint fundraising 
activity. If the participants establish a separate committee to act as 
the fundraising representative, the separate committee shall not be a 
participant in any other joint fundraising effort, but the separate 
committee may conduct more than one joint fundraising effort for the 
participants.
    (ii) The participants may hire a commercial fundraising firm or 
other agent

[[Page 78]]

to assist in conducting the joint fundraising activity. In that case, 
however, the fundraising representative shall still be responsible for 
ensuring that the recordkeeping and reporting requirements set forth in 
this section are met.
    (2) The procedures in 11 CFR 102.17(c) will govern all joint 
fundraising activity conducted under this section. The participants in 
joint fundraising activity may include political party committees 
(whether or not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5), 
candidate committees, multicandidate committees, and unregistered 
organizations which do not qualify as collecting agents under 11 CFR 
102.6(b).
    (3) A fundraising representative conducting joint fundraising under 
this section is distinguished from an unregistered organization acting 
as a collecting agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b). If a separate segregated 
fund or an unregistered organization qualifies and acts as a collecting 
agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b), the provisions of 11 CFR 102.17 will not 
apply to that fundraising activity.
    (b) Fundraising representatives--(1) Separate fundraising committee 
as fundraising representative. Participating committees may establish a 
separate political committee to act as fundraising representative for 
all participants. This separate committee shall be a reporting political 
committee and shall collect contributions, pay fundraising costs from 
gross proceeds and from funds advanced by participants, and disburse net 
proceeds to each participant.
    (2) Participating committee as fundraising representative. All 
participating committees may select one participant to act as 
fundraising representative for all participants. The fundraising 
representative must be a political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5. 
The fundraising representative and any other participating committees 
may collect contributions; however, all contributions received by other 
participants shall be forwarded to the fundraising representative as 
required by 11 CFR 102.8. The fundraising representative shall pay 
fundraising costs from gross proceeds and from funds advanced by 
participants and shall disburse net proceeds to each participant.
    (3) Funds advanced for fundraising costs. (i) Except as provided in 
11 CFR 102.17(b) (3)(ii) and (iii), the amount of funds advanced by each 
participant for fundraising costs shall be in proportion to the 
allocation formula agreed upon under 11 CFR 102.17 (c)(1).
    (ii) A participant may advance more than its proportionate share of 
the fundraising costs, however, the amount advanced which is in excess 
of the participant's proportionate share shall not exceed the amount 
that participant could legally contribute to the remaining participants. 
See 11 CFR 102.12(c)(2) and part 110.
    (iii) If all the participants are affiliated under 11 CFR 110.3 or 
if the participants are all party committees of the same political 
party, there is no limit on the amount a participant may advance for 
fundraising costs on behalf of the other participants.
    (c) Joint fundraising procedures. The requirements of 11 CFR 
102.17(c)(1) through (8) shall govern joint fundraising activity 
conducted under this section.
    (1) Written agreement. The participants in a joint fundraising 
activity shall enter into a written agreement, whether or not all 
participants are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5. The written 
agreement shall identify the fundraising representative and shall state 
a formula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds. The formula shall 
be stated as the amount or percentage of each contribution received to 
be allocated to each participant. The fundraising representative shall 
retain the written agreement for a period of three years and shall make 
it available to the Commission on request.
    (2) Fundraising notice. In addition to any notice required under 11 
CFR 110.11, a joint fundraising notice shall be included with every 
solicitation for contributions.
    (i) This notice shall include the following information:
    (A) The names of all committees participating in the joint 
fundraising activity whether or not such committees are political 
committees under 11 CFR 100.5; and

[[Page 79]]

    (B) The allocation formula to be used for distributing joint 
fundraising proceeds; and
    (C) A statement informing contributors that, notwithstanding the 
stated allocation formula, they may designate their contributions for a 
particular participant or participants; and
    (D) A statement informing contributors that the allocation formula 
may change if a contributor makes a contribution which would exceed the 
amount that contributor may give to any participant.
    (ii) In the following situations, the notice shall include the 
following additional information:
    (A) If one or more participants engage in the joint fundraising 
activity solely to satisfy outstanding debts, a statement informing 
contributors that the allocation formula may change if a participant 
receives sufficient funds to pay its outstanding debts; and
    (B) If one or more participants can lawfully accept contributions 
that are prohibited under the Act, a statement informing contributors 
that contributions from prohibited sources will be distributed only to 
those participants that can accept them.
    (3) Separate depository account. (i) The participants or the 
fundraising representative shall establish a separate depository account 
to be used solely for the receipt and disbursement of the joint 
fundraising proceeds. All contributions deposited into the separate 
depository account must be permissible under the Act. Each political 
committee shall amend its Statement of Organization to reflect the 
account as an additional depository. If one or more participants can 
lawfully accept contributions that are prohibited under the Act, the 
participants may either establish a second depository account for 
contributions received from prohibited sources or they may forward such 
contributions directly to the nonfederal participants.
    (ii) The fundraising representative shall deposit all joint 
fundraising proceeds in the separate depository account within ten days 
of receipt as required by 11 CFR 103.3. The fundraising representative 
may delay distribution of the fundraising proceeds to the participants 
until all contributions are received and all expenses are paid.
    (iii) For contribution reporting and limitation purposes, the date 
of receipt of a contribution by a participating political committee is 
the date that the contribution is received by the fundraising 
representative. The fundraising representative shall report 
contributions in the reporting period in which they are received. 
Participating political committees shall report joint fundraising 
proceeds in accordance with 11 CFR 102.17(c)(8) when such funds are 
received from the fundraising representative.
    (4) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) The fundraising representative 
and participating committees shall screen all contributions received to 
insure that the prohibitions and limitations of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114 
are observed. Participating political committees shall make their 
contributor records available to the fundraising representative to 
enable the fundraising representative to carry out its duty to screen 
contributions.
    (ii) The fundraising representative shall collect and retain 
contributor information with regard to gross proceeds as required under 
11 CFR 102.8 and shall also forward such information to participating 
political committees. The fundraising representative shall also keep a 
record of the total amount of contributions received from prohibited 
sources, if any, and of all transfers of prohibited contributions to 
participants that can accept them.
    (iii) The fundraising representative shall retain the records 
required under 11 CFR 102.9 regarding fundraising disbursements for a 
period of three years. Commercial fundraising firms or agents shall 
forward such information to the fundraising representative.
    (5) Contribution limitations. Except to the extent that the 
contributor has previously contributed to any of the participants, a 
contributor may make a contribution to the joint fundraising effort 
which contribution represents the total amount that the contributor 
could contribute to all of the participants under the applicable limits 
of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2.

[[Page 80]]

    (6) Allocation of gross proceeds. (i) The fundraising representative 
shall allocate proceeds according to the formula stated in the 
fundraising agreement. If distribution according to the allocation 
formula extinguishes the debts of one or more participants and results 
in a surplus for those participants or if distribution under the formula 
results in a violation of the contribution limits of 11 CFR 110.1(a), 
the fundraising representative may reallocate the exesss funds. 
Reallocation shall be based upon the remaining participants' 
proportionate shares under the allocation formula. If reallocation 
results in a violation of a contributor's limit under 11 CFR 110.1, the 
fundraising representative shall return to the contributor the amount of 
the contribution that exceeds the limit.
    (ii) Designated contributions which exceed the contributor's limit 
to the designated participant under 11 CFR part 110 may not be 
reallocated by the fundraising representative absent the prior written 
permission of the contributor.
    (iii) If any participants can lawfully accept contributions from 
sources prohibited under the Act, any such contributions that are 
received are not required to be distributed according to the allocation 
formula.
    (7) Allocation of expenses and distribution of net proceeds. (i) If 
participating committees are not affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 
prior to the joint fundraising activity and are not committees of the 
same political party;
    (A) After gross contributions are allocated among the participants 
under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6), the fundraising representative shall 
calculate each participant's share of expenses based on the percentage 
of the total receipts each participant had been allocated. If 
contributions from sources prohibited under the Act have been received 
and distributed under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6)(iii), those contributions need 
not be included in the total receipts for the purpose of allocating 
expenses under this section. To calculate each participant's net 
proceeds, the fundraising representative shall subtract the 
participant's share of expenses from the amount that participant has 
been allocated from gross proceeds.
    (B) A participant may only pay expenses on behalf of another 
participant subject to the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110.
    (C) The expenses from a series of fundraising events or activities 
shall be allocated among the participants on a per-event basis 
regardless of whether the participants change or remain the same 
throughout the series.
    (ii) If participating committees are affilated as defined in 11 CFR 
110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity or if participants are 
party committees of the same political party, expenses need not be 
allocated among those participants. Payment of such expenses by an 
unregistered committee or organization on behalf of an affiliated 
political committee may cause the unregistered organization to become a 
political committee.
    (iii) Payment of expenses may be made from gross proceeds by the 
fundraising representative.
    (8) Reporting of receipts and disbursements--(i) Reporting receipts. 
(A) The fundraising representative shall report all funds received in 
the reporting period in which they are received. The fundraising 
representative shall report the total amount of contributions received 
from prohibited sources during the reporting period, if any, as a memo 
entry. Each Schedule A filed by the fundraising representative under 
this section shall clearly indicate that the contributions reported on 
that schedule represent joint fundraising proceeds.
    (B) After distribution of net proceeds, each participating political 
committee shall report its share of net proceeds received as a transfer-
in from the fundraising representative. Each participating political 
committee shall also file a memo Schedule A itemizing its share of gross 
receipts as contributions from original contributors to the extent 
required under 11 CFR 104.3(a).
    (ii) Reporting disbursements. The fundraising representative shall 
report all disbursements in the reporting period in which they are made.

Sec. 103.1  Notification of the commission.

depository(ies) it has designated, pursuant to 11 CFR 101.1 and 103.2.


<R05>
Sec. 103.2  Depositories (2 U.S.C. 432(h)(1)).

    Each political committee shall designate one or more State banks, 
federally chartered depository institutions (including a national bank), 
or depository institutions the depositor accounts of which are insured 
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corporation, or the National Credit Union Administration, as 
its campaign depository or depositories. One or more depositories may be 
established in one or more States. Each political committee shall 
maintain at least one checking account or transaction account at one of 
its depositories. Additional accounts may be established at each 
depository.


<R05>
Sec. 103.3  Deposit of receipts and disbursements (2 U.S.C. 432(h)(1)).

    (a) All receipts by a political committee shall be deposited in 
account(s) established pursuant to 11 CFR 103.2, except that any 
contribution may be, within 10 days of the treasurer's receipt, returned 
to the contributor without being deposited. The treasurer of the 
committee shall be responsible for making such deposits. All deposits 
shall be made within 10 days of the treasurer's receipt. A committee 
shall make all disbursements by check or similar drafts drawn on an 
account at its designated campaign depository, except for expenditures 
of $100 or less made from a petty cash fund maintained pursuant to 11 
CFR 102.11. Funds may be transferred from the depository for investment 
purposes, but shall be returned to the depository before such funds are 
used to make expenditures.
    (b) The treasurer shall be responsible for examining all 
contributions received for evidence of illegality and for ascertaining 
whether contributions received, when aggregated with other contributions 
from the same contributor, exceed the contribution limitations of 11 CFR 
110.1 or 110.2.
    (1) Contributions that present genuine questions as to whether they 
were made by corporations, labor organizations, foreign nationals, or 
Federal contractors may be, within ten days of the treasurer's receipt, 
either deposited into a campaign depository under 11 CFR 103.3(a) or 
returned to the contributor. If any such contribution is deposited, the 
treasurer shall make his or her best efforts to determine the legality 
of the contribution. The treasurer shall make at least one written or 
oral request for evidence of the legality of the contribution. Such 
evidence includes, but is not limited to, a written statement from the 
contributor explaining why the contribution is legal, or a written 
statement by the treasurer memorializing an oral communication 
explaining why the contribution is legal. If the contribution cannot be 
determined to be legal, the treasurer shall, within thirty days of the 
treasurer's receipt of the contribution, refund the contribution to the 
contributor.
    (2) If the treasurer in exercising his or her responsibilities under 
11 CFR 103.3(b) determined that at the time a contribution was received 
and deposited, it did not appear to be made by a corporation, labor 
organization, foreign national or Federal contractor, or made in the 
name of another, but later discovers that it is illegal based on new 
evidence not available to the political committee at the time of receipt 
and deposit, the treasurer shall refund the contribution to the 
contributor within thirty days of the date on which the illegality is 
discovered. If the political committee does not have sufficient funds to 
refund the contribution at the time the illegality is discovered, the

[[Page 82]]

political committee shall make the refund from the next funds it 
receives.
    (3) Contributions which on their face exceed the contribution 
limitations set forth in 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2, and contributions which 
do not appear to be excessive on their face, but which exceed the 
contribution limits set forth in 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2 when aggregated 
with other contributions from the same contributor, and contributions 
which cannot be accepted under the net debts outstanding provisions of 
11 CFR 110.1(b)(3) and 110.2(b)(3) may be either deposited into a 
campaign depository under 11 CFR 103.3(a) or returned to the 
contributor. If any such contribution is deposited, the treasurer may 
request redesignation or reattribution of the contribution by the 
contributor in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b), 110.1(k) or 110.2(b), as 
appropriate. If a redesignation or reattribution is not obtained, the 
treasurer shall, within sixty days of the treasurer's receipt of the 
contribution, refund the contribution to the contributor.
    (4) Any contribution which appears to be illegal under 11 CFR 
103.3(b) (1) or (3), and which is deposited into a campaign depository 
shall not be used for any disbursements by the political committee until 
the contribution has been determined to be legal. The political 
committee must either establish a separate account in a campaign 
depository for such contributions or maintain sufficient funds to make 
all such refunds.
    (5) If a contribution which appears to be illegal under 11 CFR 
103.3(b) (1) or (3) is deposited in a campaign depository, the treasurer 
shall make and retain a written record noting the basis for the 
appearance of illegality. A statement noting that the legality of the 
contribution is in question shall be included in the report noting the 
receipt of the contribution. If a contribution is refunded to the 
contributor because it cannot be determined to be legal, the treasurer 
shall note the refund on the report covering the reporting period in 
which the refund is made.

nature of outstanding debts and obligations owed by or to the reporting 
committee. Loans obtained by an individual prior to becoming a candidate 
for use in connection with that individual's campaign shall be reported 
as an outstanding loan owed to the lender by the candidate's principal 
campaign committee, if such loans are outstanding at the time the 
individual becomes a candidate. Where such debts and obligations are 
settled for less than their reported amount or value, each report filed 
under 11 CFR 104.1 shall contain a statement as to the circumstances and 
conditions under which such debts or obligations were extinguished and 
the amount paid. See 11 CFR 116.7.
    (1) In addition, when a candidate or political committee obtains a 
loan from, or establishes a line of credit at, a lending institution as 
described in 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11) and 100.8(b)(12), it shall disclose in 
the next due report the following information on schedule C-1 or C-P-1:
    (i) The date and amount of the loan or line of credit;
    (ii) The interest rate and repayment schedule of the loan, or of 
each draw on the line of credit;
    (iii) The types and value of traditional collateral or other sources 
of repayment that secure the loan or the line of credit, and whether 
that security interest is perfected;
    (iv) An explanation of the basis upon which the loan was made or the 
line of credit established, if not made on the basis of either 
traditional collateral or the other sources of repayment described in 11 
CFR 100.7(b)(11)(i) (A) and (B) and 100.8(b)(12)(i) (A) and (B); and
    (v) A certification from the lending institution that the borrower's 
responses to paragraphs (d)(1)(i)-(iv) of this section are accurate, to 
the best of the lending institution's knowledge; that the loan was made 
or the line of credit established on terms and conditions (including 
interest rate) no more favorable at the time than those imposed for 
similar extensions of credit to other borrowers of comparable credit 
worthiness; and that the lending institution is aware of the requirement 
that a loan or a line of credit must be made on a basis which assures 
repayment and that the lending institution has complied with Commission 
regulations at 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11) and 100.8(b)(12).
    (2) The political committee shall submit a copy of the loan or line 
of credit agreement which describes the terms and conditions of the loan 
or line of credit when it files Schedule C-1 or C-P-1.
    (3) The political committee shall file in the next due report a 
Schedule C-1 or C-P-1 each time a draw is made on a line of credit, and 
each time a loan or line of credit is restructured to change the terms 
of repayment.
    (e) Use of pseudonyms. (1) To determine whether the names and 
addresses of its contributors are being used in violation of 11 CFR 
104.15 to solicit contributions or for commercial purposes, a political 
committee may submit up to ten (10) pseudonyms on each report filed.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a pseudonym is a wholly fictitious 
name which does not represent the name of an actual contributor to a 
committee.
    (3) If a committee uses pseudonyms it shall subtract the total 
dollar amount of the fictitious contributions from the total amount 
listed as a memo entry on line 11(a) of the Detailed Summary page, 
Unitemized contributions from individual persons other than political 
committees. Thus, the committee will, for this purpose only, be 
overstating the amount of itemized contributions received and 
understating the amount of unitemized contributions received.
    (4) No authorized committee of a candidate shall attribute more than 
$1,000 in contributions to the same pseudonym for each election and no 
other political committee shall attribute more than $5,000 in 
contributions to

[[Page 89]]

the same pseudonym in any calendar year.
    (5) A committee using pseudonyms shall send a list of such 
pseudonyms under separate cover directly to the Reports Analysis 
Division, Federal Election Commission, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20463, on or before the date on which any report containing such 
pseudonyms is filed with the Secretary of the Senate or the Commission. 
The Commission shall maintain the list, but shall exclude it from the 
public record. A committee shall not send any list of pseudonyms to the 
Secretary of the Senate or to any Secretary of State or equivalent state 
officer.
    (6) A political committee shall not use pseudonyms for the purpose 
of circumventing the reporting requirements or the limitations and 
prohibitions of the Act.
    (f) Consolidated reports. Each principal campaign committee shall 
consolidate in each report those reports required to be filed with it. 
Such consolidated reports shall include: (1) Reports submitted to it by 
any authorized committees and (2) the principal campaign committee's own 
report. Such consolidation shall be made on FEC Form 3-Z and shall be 
submitted with the reports of the principal campaign committee and with 
the reports, or applicable portions thereof, of the committees shown on 
the consolidation.
    (g) Building funds. Gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits 
of money or anything of value made to defray costs of construction or 
purchase of office facilities received by a political committee in 
accordance with 11 CFR 100.7(b)(12) shall be reported as a memo entry on 
Schedule A.
    (h) Legal and accounting services. A committee which receives legal 
or accounting services pursuant to 11 CFR 100.7(b) (13) and (14) shall 
report as a memo entry, on Schedule A, the amounts paid for these 
services by the regular employer of the person(s) providing such 
services; the date(s) such services were performed; and the name of each 
person performing such services.
    (i) Cumulative reports. The reports required to be filed under 11 
CFR 104.5 shall be cumulative for the calendar year to which they 
relate, but if there has been no change in a category reported in a 
previous report during that year, only the amount thereof need be 
carried forward.
    (j) Earmarked contributions. Earmarked contributions shall be 
reported in accordance with 11 CFR 110.6. See also 11 CFR 102.8(c).

Sec. 104.6  Form and content of internal communications reports (2 U.S.C. 431(9)(B)(iii)).

    (a) Form. Every membership organization or corporation which makes 
disbursements for communications pursuant to 11 CFR 100.8(b)(4) and 
114.3 shall report to the Commission on FEC Form 7 such costs which are 
directly attributable to any communication expressly advocating the 
election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate (other than a 
communication primarily devoted to subjects other than the election or 
defeat of a clearly identified candidate), if such costs exceed $2,000 
for any election.
    (1) For the purposes of 11 CFR 104.6(a), election means two separate 
processes in a calendar year, to each of which the $2,000 threshold 
described above applies separately. The first process is comprised of 
all primary elections for federal office, wherever and whenever held; 
the second process is comprised of all general elections for federal 
office, wherever and whenever held.
    (2) The term election shall also include each special election held 
to fill a vacancy in a Federal office (11 CFR 100.2(f)) or each runoff 
election (11 CFR 100.2(d)).
    (b) Filing dates. Organizations required to report under 11 CFR 
104.6(a) shall file such reports during a calendar year in which a 
regularly scheduled general election is held. Such reports shall be 
filed quarterly in accordance with 11 CFR 104.5(a)(1)(iii) and, with 
respect to any general election, in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.5(a)(1)(i). The organization shall be required to file reports 
beginning with the first reporting period during which the aggregate 
cost for such communications exceeds $2,000 per election as defined in 
11 CFR 104.6(a)(1), and for each quarter thereafter in which the 
organization makes additional disbursements in connection with the same 
election.
    (c) Each report filed under 11 CFR 104.6 shall include, for each 
communication:
    (1) The type of communication (such as direct mail, telephone or 
telegram);
    (2) The date(s) of the communication;
    (3) The name of the candidate, the office sought (and the district 
and state

[[Page 93]]

of the office, if applicable), and whether the communication was for the 
primary or general election;
    (4) Whether the communication was in support of or in opposition to, 
a particular candidate; and
    (5) The cost of the communication.

Sec. 104.7  Best efforts (2 U.S.C. 432(i)).

    (a) When the treasurer of a political committee shows that best 
efforts have been used to obtain, maintain and submit the information 
required by the Act for the political committee, any report of such 
committee shall be considered in compliance with the Act.
    (b) With regard to reporting the identification as defined at 11 CFR 
100.12 of each person whose contribution(s) to the political committee 
and its affiliated committees aggregate in excess of $200 in a calendar 
year (pursuant to 11 CFR 104.3(a)(4)), the treasurer and the committee 
will only be deemed to have exercised best efforts to obtain, maintain 
and report the required information if--
    (1) All written solicitations for contributions include a clear 
request for the contributor's full name, mailing address, occupation and 
name of employer, and include an accurate statement of Federal law 
regarding the collection and reporting of individual contributor 
identifications. The following are examples of acceptable statements, 
but are not the only allowable statements: ``Federal law requires us to 
use our best efforts to collect and report the name, mailing address, 
occupation and name of employer of individuals whose contributions 
exceed $200 in a calendar year;'' and ``To comply with Federal law, we 
must use best efforts to obtain, maintain, and submit the name, mailing 
address, occupation and name of employer of individuals whose 
contributions exceed $200 per calendar year.'' The request and statement 
shall appear in a clear and conspicuous manner on any response material 
included in a solicitation. The request and statement are not clear and 
conspicuous if they are in small type in comparison to the solicitation 
and response materials, or if the printing is difficult to read or if 
the placement is easily overlooked.
    (2) For each contribution received aggregating in excess of $200 per 
calendar year which lacks required contributor information, such as the 
contributor's full name, mailing address, occupation or name of 
employer, the treasurer makes at least one effort after the receipt of 
the contribution to obtain the missing information. Such effort shall 
consist of either a written request sent to the contributor or an oral 
request to the contributor documented in writing. The written or oral 
request must be made no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the 
contribution. The written or oral request shall not include material on 
any other subject or any additional solicitation, except that it may 
include language solely thanking the contributor for the contribution. 
The request must clearly ask for the missing information, and must 
include the statement set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
Written requests must include this statement in a clear and conspicuous 
manner. If the request is written, it shall be accompanied by a pre-
addressed return post card or envelope for the response material;
    (3) The treasurer reports all contributor information not provided 
by the contributor, but in the political committee's possession, or in 
its connected organization's possession, regarding contributor 
identifications, including information in contributor records, 
fundraising records and previously filed reports, in the same two-year 
election cycle in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3; and
    (4)(i) If any of the contributor information is received after the 
contribution has been disclosed on a regularly scheduled report, the 
political committee shall either:
    (A) File with its next regularly scheduled report, an amended memo 
Schedule A listing all contributions for which contributor 
identifications have been received during the reporting period covered 
by the next regularly scheduled report together with the dates and 
amounts of the contribution(s) and an indication of the previous 
report(s) to which the memo Schedule A relates; or

[[Page 94]]

    (B) File on or before its next regularly scheduled reporting date, 
amendments to the report(s) originally disclosing the contribution(s), 
which include the contributor identifications together with the dates 
and amounts of the contribution(s).
    (ii) Amendments must be filed for all reports that cover the two-
year election cycle in which the contribution was received and that 
disclose itemizable contributions from the same contributor. However, 
political committees are not required to file amendments to reports 
covering previous election cycles.

Sec. 104.8  Uniform reporting of receipts.

    (a) A reporting committee shall disclose the identification of each 
individual who contributes an amount in excess of $200 to the 
committee's federal account(s). This identification shall include the 
individual's name, mailing address, occupation, the name of his or her 
employer, if any, and the date of receipt and amount of any such 
contribution. If an individual contributor's name is known to have 
changed since an earlier contribution reported during the calendar year, 
the exact name or address previously used shall be noted with the first 
reported contribution from that contributor subsequent to the name 
change.
    (b) In each case where a contribution received from an individual in 
a reporting period is added to previously unitemized contributions from 
the same individual and the aggregate exceeds $200 in a calendar year 
the reporting committee shall disclose the identification of such 
individual along with the date of receipt and amount of any such 
contribution. Except for contributions by payroll deduction, each 
additional contribution from the individual shall be separately 
itemized. In the case of a political committee other than an authorized 
committee which receives contributions through a payroll deduction plan, 
such committee is not required to separately itemize each additional 
contribution received from the contributor during the reporting period. 
In lieu of separate itemization, such committee may report: the 
aggregate amount of contributions received from the contributor through 
the payroll deduction plan during the reporting period; the 
identification of the individual; and a statement of the amount deducted 
per pay period.
    (c) Absent evidence to the contrary, any contribution made by check, 
money order, or other written instrument shall be reported as a 
contribution by the last person signing the instrument prior to delivery 
to the candidate or committee.
    (d)(1) If an itemized contribution is made by more than one person 
in a single written instrument, the treasurer shall report the amount to 
be attributed to each contributor.
    (2)(i) If a contribution is redesignated by a contributor, in 
accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b) or 110.2(b), the treasurer of the 
authorized political committee receiving the contribution shall report 
the redesignation in a memo entry on Schedule A of the report covering 
the reporting period in which the redesignation is received. The memo 
entry for each redesignated contribution shall be reported in the 
following manner--
    (A) The first part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the 
information for the contribution as it was originally reported on 
Schedule A;
    (B) The second part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the 
information for the contribution as it was redesignated by the 
contributor, including the election for which the contribution was 
redesignated and the date on which the redesignation was received.
    (ii) If a contribution from a political committee is redesignated by 
the contributing political committee in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b) 
or 110.2(b), the treasurer of such political committee shall report the 
redesignation in a memo entry on Schedule B of the report covering the 
reporting period in which the redesignation is made. The memo entry for 
each redesignated contribution shall be reported in the following 
manner--
    (A) The first part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the 
information for the contribution as it was originally reported on 
Schedule B;

[[Page 95]]

    (B) The second part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the 
information for the contribution as it was redesignated by the 
contributing political committee, including the election for which the 
contribution was redesignated and the date on which the redesignation 
was made.
    (3) If an itemized contribution is reattributed by the 
contributor(s) in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k), the treasurer shall 
report the reattribution in a memo entry on Schedule A of the report 
covering the reporting period in which the reattribution is received. 
The memo entry for each reattributed contribution shall be reported in 
the following manner--
    (i) The first part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the 
information for the contribution as it was originally reported on 
Schedule A;
    (ii) The second part of the memo entry shall disclose all of the 
information for the contribution as it was reattributed by the 
contributors, including the date on which the reattribution was 
received.
    (4) If a contribution is refunded to the contributor, the treasurer 
of the political committee making the refund shall report the refund on 
Schedule B of the report covering the reporting period in which the 
refund is made, in accordance with 11 CFR 103.3(b)(5) and 104.3(b). If a 
contribution is refunded to a political committee, the treasurer of the 
political committee receiving the refund shall report the refund on 
Schedule A of the report covering the reporting period in which the 
refund is received, in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(a).
    (e) National party committees shall disclose in a memo Schedule A 
information about each individual, committee, corporation, labor 
organization, or other entity that donates an aggregate amount in excess 
of $200 in a calendar year to the committee's non-federal account(s). 
This information shall include the donating individual's or entity's 
name, mailing address, occupation or type of business, and the date of 
receipt and amount of any such donation. If a donor's name is known to 
have changed since an earlier donation reported during the calendar 
year, the exact name or address previously used shall be noted with the 
first reported donation from that donor subsequent to the name change. 
The memo entry shall also include, where applicable, the information 
required by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

first reported donation from that donor subsequent to the name change. 
The memo entry shall also include, where applicable, the information 
required by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

of each in-kind contribution, independent expenditure, or coordinated 
expenditure attributed to each federal candidate. If a payment also 
includes amounts attributable to one or more non-federal candidates, and 
is made by a political committee with separate federal and non-federal 
accounts, then the payment shall be made according to the procedures set 
forth in 11 CFR 106.5(g) or 106.6(e), as appropriate, but shall be 
reported pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4), as follows:

candidates and disbursements on behalf of one or more non-federal 
candidates, the committee shall assign a unique identifying title or 
code to each program or activity conducted on behalf of such candidates,

committee shall also summarize the total amounts attributed to each 
candidate, to date, for each joint program or activity.
    (2) Reporting of transfers between accounts for the purpose of 
paying expenses attributable to specific federal and non-federal 
candidates. A political committee that pays allocable expenses in 
accordance with 11 CFR 106.5(g) or 106.6(e) shall report each transfer 
of funds from its non-federal account to its federal account or to its 
separate allocation account for the purpose of paying such expenses. In 
the report covering the period in which each transfer occurred, the 
committee shall explain in a memo entry the allocable expenses to which 
the transfer relates and the date on which the transfer was made. If the 
transfer includes funds for the allocable costs of more than one program 
or activity, the committee shall itemize the transfer, showing the 
amounts designated for each program or activity conducted on behalf of 
one or more clearly identified federal candidates and one or more 
clearly identified non-federal candidates.
    (3) Reporting of allocated disbursements attributable to specific 
federal and non-federal candidates. A political committee that pays 
allocable expenses in accordance with 11 CFR 106.5(g) or

disbursement was made, and the date, amount and purpose of each such 
disbursement. If the disbursement includes payment for the allocable 
costs of more than one program or activity, the committee shall itemize 
the disbursement, showing the amounts designated for payment of each 
program or activity conducted on behalf of one or more clearly 
identified federal candidates and one or more clearly identified non-

supporting the committee's allocation on behalf of specific federal and 
non-federal candidates, in accordance with 11 CFR 104.14.
    (b) Expenses allocated among activities. A political committee that 
has established separate federal and non-federal accounts under 11 CFR 
102.5(a)(1)(i) shall allocate between those accounts its administrative 
expenses and its costs for fundraising, exempt activities, and generic 
voter drives according to 11 CFR 106.5 or 106.6, as appropriate, and 
shall report those allocations according to paragraphs (b) (1) through

amounts expended in donations and direct disbursements on behalf of 
specific state and local candidates, to date, in that calendar year.
    (2) Reporting of allocation of the direct costs of fundraising and 
costs of exempt activities. In each report disclosing a disbursement for 
the direct costs of a fundraising program or an exempt activity, as 
described in 11 CFR 106.5(a)(2) or 106.6(b), the committee shall assign 
a unique identifying title or code to each such program or activity,

accounts that year, to date, for each such program or activity.
    (3) Reporting of transfers between accounts for the purpose of 
paying allocable expenses. A political committee that pays allocable

non-federal account to its federal account or to its separate allocation 
account for the purpose of paying such expenses. In the report covering 
the period in which each transfer occurred, the committee shall explain 
in a memo entry the allocable expenses to which the transfer relates and 
the date on which the transfer was made. If the transfer includes funds 
for the allocable costs of more than one activity, the committee shall 
itemize the transfer, showing the amounts designated for administrative 
expenses and generic voter drives, and for each fundraising program or 
exempt activity, as described in 11 CFR 106.5(a)(2) or 106.6(b).

    (a) Debts and obligations owed by or to a political committee which 
remain outstanding shall be continuously reported until extinguished. 
See 11 CFR 104.3(d). These debts and obligations shall be reported on

    (b) A debt or obligation, including a loan, written contract, 
written promise or written agreement to make an expenditure, the amount 
of which is $500 or less, shall be reported as of the time payment is

whichever comes first. A debt or obligation, including a loan, written 
contract, written promise or written agreement to make an expenditure, 
the amount of which is over $500 shall be reported as of the date on 
which the debt or obligation is incurred, except that any obligation 
incurred for rent, salary or other regularly reoccurring administrative 
expense shall not be reported as a debt before the payment due date. See 
11 CFR 116.6. If the exact amount of a debt or obligation is not known, 
the report shall state that the amount reported is an estimate. Once the 
exact amount is determined, the political committee shall either amend 
the report(s) containing the estimate or indicate the correct amount on 
the report for the reporting period in which such amount is determined.

Sec. 104.17  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 104.18  Electronic filing of reports (2 U.S.C. 432(d) and 434(a)(11)).

    (a) General. A political committee that files reports with the 
Commission, as provided in 11 CFR part 105, may choose to file its 
reports in an electronic format that meets the requirements of this 
section. If a committee chooses to file its reports electronically, and 
its first electronic report passes the Commission's validation program 
in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, it must continue to 
file in an electronic format all reports covering financial activity for 
that calendar year, unless the Commission determines that extraordinary 
and unforeseeable circumstances have made it impracticable for the 
committee to continue filing electronically.
    (b) Format specifications. Reports filed electronically shall 
conform to the technical specifications described in the Federal 
Election Commission's Electronic Filing Specifications Requirements. The 
data contained in the computerized magnetic media provided to the 
Commission shall be organized in the order specified by the Electronic 
Filing Specifications Requirements.
    (c) Acceptance of reports filed in electronic format. (1) Each 
committee that submits an electronic report shall check the report 
against the Commission's validation program before it is submitted, to 
ensure that the files submitted meet the Commission's format 
specifications and can be read by the Commission's computer system. Each 
report submitted in an electronic format under this section shall also 
be checked upon receipt against the Commission's validation program. The 
Commission's validation program is available on request and at no 
charge.
    (2) A report that does not pass the validation program will not be 
accepted by the Commission and will not be considered filed. If a 
committee submits a report that does not pass the validation program, 
the Commission will notify the committee that the report has not been 
accepted.
    (d) Amended reports. If a committee files an amendment to a report 
that was filed electronically, it shall also submit the amendment in an 
electronic

[[Page 101]]

format. The committee shall submit a complete version of the report as 
amended, rather than just those portions of the report that are being 
amended. In addition, the amended report shall contain electronic flags 
or markings that point to the portions of the report that are being 
amended.
    (e) Signature requirements. The committee's treasurer, or any other 
person having the responsibility to file a designation, report or 
statement under this subchapter, shall verify the report in one of the 
following ways: by submitting a signed certification on paper that is 
submitted with the computerized media; or by submitting a digitized copy 
of the signed certification as a separate file in the electronic 
submission. Each verification submitted under this section shall certify 
that the person has examined the report or statement and, to the best of 
the signatory's knowledge and belief, it is true, correct and complete. 
Any verification under this section shall be treated for all purposes 
(including penalties for perjury) in the same manner as a verification 
by signature on a report submitted in a paper format.
    (f) Schedules and forms with special requirements. The following 
list of schedules, materials, and forms have special signature and other 
requirements and reports containing these documents shall include, in 
addition to providing the required data within the electronic report, 
either a paper copy submitted with the committee's electronic report or 
a digitized version submitted as a separate file in the electronic 
submission: Schedule C-1 (Loans and Lines of Credit From Lending 
Institutions), including copies of loan agreements required to be filed 
with that Schedule, Schedule E (Itemized Independent Expenditures), Form 
5 (Report of Independent Expenditures Made and Contributions Received), 
and Form 8 (Debt Settlement Plan). The committee shall submit any paper 
materials together with the electronic media containing the committee's 
report.
    (g) Preservation of reports. For any report filed in electronic 
format under this section, the treasurer shall retain a machine-readable 
copy of the report as the copy preserved under 11 CFR 104.14(b)(2). In 
addition, the treasurer shall retain the original signed version of any 
documents submitted in a digitized format under paragraphs (e) and (f) 
of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 106.1  Allocation of expenses between candidates.

    (a) General rule. (1) Expenditures, including in-kind contributions, 
independent expenditures, and coordinated expenditures made on behalf of 
more than one clearly identified federal candidate shall be attributed 
to each such candidate according to the benefit reasonably expected to 
be derived. For example, in the case of a publication or broadcast 
communication, the attribution shall be determined by the proportion of 
space or time devoted to each candidate as compared to the total space 
or time devoted to all candidates. In the case of a fundraising program 
or event where funds are collected by one committee for more than one 
clearly identified candidate, the

[[Page 103]]

attribution shall be determined by the proportion of funds received by 
each candidate as compared to the total receipts by all candidates. 
These methods shall also be used to allocate payments involving both 
expenditures on behalf of one or more clearly identified federal 
candidates and disbursements on behalf of one or more clearly identified 
non-federal candidates.
    (2) An expenditure made on behalf of more than one clearly 
identified federal candidate shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 
104.10(a). A payment that also includes amounts attributable to one or 
more non-federal candidates, and that is made by a political committee 
with separate federal and non-federal accounts, shall be made according 
to the procedures set forth in 11 CFR 106.5(g) or 106.6(e), as 
appropriate, but shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(a).
    (b) An authorized expenditure made by a candidate or political 
committee on behalf of another candidate shall be reported as a 
contribution in-kind (transfer) to the candidate on whose behalf the 
expenditure was made, except that expenditures made by party committees 
pursuant to Sec. 110.7 need only be reported as an expenditure.
    (c) Exceptions:
    (1) Expenditures for rent, personnel, overhead, general 
administrative, fund-raising, and other day-to-day costs of political 
committees need not be attributed to individual candidates, unless these 
expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate and 
the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.
    (2) Expenditures for educational campaign seminars, for training of 
campaign workers, and for registration or get-out-the-vote drives of 
committees need not be attributed to individual candidates unless these 
expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate, and 
the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.
    (3) Payments made for the cost of certain voter registration and 
get-out-the-vote activities conducted by State or local party 
organizations on behalf of any Presidential or Vice-Presidential 
candidate(s) are exempt from the definition of a contribution or an 
expenditure under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(17) and 100.8(b)(18). If the State or 
local party organization includes references to any candidate(s) seeking 
nomination or election to the House of Representatives or Senate of the 
United States the portion of the cost of such activities allocable to 
such candidate(s) shall be considered a contribution to or an 
expenditure on behalf of such candidate(s), unless such reference is 
incidental to the overall activity. If such reference is incidental to 
the overall activity, such costs shall not be considered a contribution 
to or expenditure on behalf of any candidate(s).
    (d) For purposes of this section, clearly identified shall have the 
same meaning as set forth at 11 CFR 100.17.
    (e) Party committees, separate segregated funds, and nonconnected 
committees that make disbursements for administrative expenses, 
fundraising, exempt activities, or generic voter drives in connection 
with both federal and non-federal elections shall allocate their 
expenses in accordance with Sec. 106.5 or Sec. 106.6, as appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 106.2  State allocation of expenditures incurred by authorized committees of Presidential primary candidates receiving matching funds.

    (a) General--(1) This section applies to Presidential primary 
candidates receiving or expecting to receive federal matching funds 
pursuant to 11 CFR parts 9031 et seq. The expenditures described in 11 
CFR 106.2(b)(2) shall be allocated to a particular State if incurred by 
a candidate's authorized committee(s) for the purpose of influencing the 
nomination of that candidate for the office of President with respect to 
that State. An expenditure shall not necessarily be allocated to the 
State in which the expenditure is incurred or paid. In the event that 
the Commission disputes the candidate's allocation or claim of exemption 
for a particular expense, the candidate shall demonstrate, with 
supporting documentation, that his or her proposed

[[Page 104]]

method of allocation or claim of exemption was reasonable. Expenditures 
required to be allocated to the primary election under 11 CFR 9034.4(e) 
shall also be allocated to particular states in accordance with this 
section.
    (2) Disbursements made prior to the time an individual becomes a 
candidate for the purpose of determining whether that individual should 
become a candidate pursuant to 11 CFR 100.7(b)(1) and 100.8(b)(1), i.e., 
payments for testing the waters, shall be allocable expenditures under 
this section if the individual becomes a candidate.
    (b) Method of allocating expenditures among States--(1) General 
allocation method. Unless otherwise specified under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2), 
an expenditure described in 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2) and incurred by a 
candidate's authorized committee(s) for the purpose of influencing the 
nomination of that candidate in more than one State shall be allocated 
to each State on a reasonable and uniformly applied basis. The total 
amount allocated to a particular State may be reduced by the amount of 
exempt fundraising expenses for that State, as specified in 11 CFR 
110.8(c)(2).
    (2) Specific allocation methods. Expenditures that fall within the 
categories listed below shall be allocated based on the following 
methods. The method used to allocate a category of expenditures shall be 
based on consistent data for each State to which an allocation is made.
    (i) Media expenditures--(A) Print media. Except for expenditures 
exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(i) (E) and (F), allocation of 
expenditures for the publication and distribution of newspaper, magazine 
and other types of printed advertisements distributed in more than one 
State shall be made using relative circulation percentages in each State 
or an estimate thereof. For purposes of this section, allocation to a 
particular State will not be required if less than 3% of the total 
estimated readership of the publication is in that State.
    (B) Broadcast media. Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 
106.2(b)(2)(i) (E) and (F), expenditures for radio, television and 
similar types of advertisements purchased in a particular media market 
that covers more than one State shall be allocated to each State in 
proportion to the estimated audience. This allocation of expenditures, 
shall be made using industry market data. If industry market data is not 
available, the committee shall obtain market data from the media carrier 
transmitting the advertisement(s).
    (C) Refunds for media expenditures. Refunds for broadcast time or 
advertisement space, purchased but not used, shall be credited to the 
States on the same basis as the original allocation.
    (D) Limits on allocation of media expenditures. No allocation of 
media expenditures shall be made to any State in which the primary 
election has already been held.
    (E) National advertising. Expenditures incurred for advertisements 
on national networks, national cable or in publications distributed 
nationwide need not be allocated to any State.
    (F) Media production costs. Expenditures incurred for production of 
media advertising, whether or not that advertising is used in more than 
one State, need not be allocated to any State.
    (G) Commissions. Expenditures for commissions, fees and other 
compensation for the purchase of broadcast or print media need not be 
allocated to any State.
    (ii) Expenditures for mass mailings and other campaign materials. 
Expenditures for mass mailings of more than 500 pieces to addresses in 
the same State, and expenditures for shipping campaign materials to a 
State, including pins, bumperstickers, handbills, brochures, posters and 
yardsigns, shall be allocated to that State. For purposes of this 
section, mass mailing includes newsletters and other materials in which 
the content of the materials is substantially identical. Records 
supporting the committee's allocations under this section shall include: 
For each mass mailing, documentation showing the total number of pieces 
mailed and the number mailed to each state or zip code; and, for other 
campaign materials acquired for use outside the State of purchase, 
records relating to any shipping costs incurred for transporting these 
items to each State.

[[Page 105]]

    (iii) Overhead expenditures--(A) Overhead expenditures of State 
offices and other facilities. Except for expenditures exempted under 11 
CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii)(C), overhead expenditures of committee offices 
whose activities are directed at a particular State, and the costs of 
other facilities used for office functions and campaign events, shall be 
allocated to that State. An amount that does not exceed 10% of office 
overhead expenditures for a particular State may be treated as exempt 
compliance expenses, and may be excluded from allocation to that State.
    (B) Overhead expenditures of regional offices. Except for 
expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii)(C), overhead 
expenditures of a committee regional office or any committee office with 
responsibilities in two or more States shall be allocated to the State 
holding the next primary election, caucus or convention in the region. 
The committee shall maintain records to demonstrate that an office 
operated on a regional basis. These records should show, for example, 
the kinds of programs conducted from the office, the number and nature 
of contacts with other States in the region, and the amount of time 
devoted to regional programs by staff working in the regional office.
    (C) Overhead expenditures of national campaign headquarters. 
Expenditures incurred for administrative, staff, and overhead 
expenditures of the national campaign headquarters need not be allocated 
to any State, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this 
section.
    (D) Definition of overhead expenditures. For purposes of 11 CFR 
106.2(b)(2)(iii), overhead expenditures include, but are not limited to, 
rent, utilities, equipment, furniture, supplies, and telephone service 
base charges. ``Telephone service base charges'' include any regular 
monthly charges for committee phone service, and charges for phone 
installation and intrastate phone calls other than charges related to a 
special program under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iv). Inter-state calls are not 
included in ``telephone service base charges.'' Overhead expenditures 
also include the costs of temporary offices established while the 
candidate is traveling in the State or in the final weeks before the 
primary election, as well as expenses paid by campaign staff and 
subsequently reimbursed by the committee, such as miscellaneous 
supplies, copying, printing and telephone expenses. See 11 CFR 116.5.
    (iv) Expenditures for special telephone programs. Expenditures for 
special telephone programs targeted at a particular State, including the 
costs of designing and operating the program, the costs of installing or 
renting telephone lines and equipment, toll charges, personnel costs, 
consultants' fees, related travel costs, and rental of office space, 
including a pro rata portion of national, regional or State office space 
used for such purposes, shall be allocated to that State based on the 
percentage of telephone calls made to that State. Special telephone 
programs include voter registration, get out the vote efforts, 
fundraising, and telemarketing efforts conducted on behalf of the 
candidate. A special telephone program is targeted at a particular State 
if 10% or more of the total telephone calls made each month are made to 
that State. Records supporting the committee's allocation of each 
special telephone program under this section shall include either the 
telephone bills showing the total number of calls made in that program 
and the number made to each State; or, a copy of the list used to make 
the calls, from which these numbers can be determined.
    (v) Public opinion poll expenditures. Expenditures incurred for the 
taking of a public opinion poll covering only one State shall be 
allocated to that State. Except for expenditures incurred in conducting 
a public opinion poll on a nationwide basis, expenditures incurred for 
the taking of a public opinion poll covering two or more States shall be 
allocated to those States based on the number of people interviewed in 
each State. Expenditures incurred for the taking of a public opinion 
poll include consultant's fees, travel costs and other expenses 
associated with designing and conducting the poll. Records supporting 
the committee's allocation under this section shall include 
documentation showing the total number of people contacted for each

[[Page 106]]

poll and the number contacted in each State.
    (3) National consulting fees. Expenditures for consultants' fees 
need not be allocated to any State if the fees are charged for 
consulting on national campaign strategy. Expenditures for consultants' 
fees charged for conducting special telephone programs and public 
opinion polls shall be allocated in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) 
(iv) and (v) of this section.
    (c) Reporting. All expenditures allocated under this section shall 
be reported on FEC Form 3P, page 3.
    (d) Recordkeeping. All assumptions and supporting calculations for 
allocations made under this section shall be documented and retained for 
Commission inspection. In addition to the records specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section, the treasurer shall retain records supporting the 
committee's allocations of expenditures to particular States and claims 
of exemption from allocation under this section. If the records 
supporting the allocation or claim of exemption are not retained, the 
expenditure shall be considered allocable and shall be allocated to the 
State holding the next primary election, caucus or convention after the 
expenditure is incurred.

Sec. 106.3  Allocation of expenses between campaign and non-campaign related travel.

    (a) This section applies to allocation for expenses between campaign 
and non-campaign related travel with respect to campaigns of candidates 
for Federal office, other than Presidential and Vice Presidential 
candidates who receive federal funds pursuant to 11 CFR part 9005 or 
9036. (See 11 CFR 9004.7 and 9034.7) All expenditures for campaign-
related travel paid for by a candidate from a campaign account or by his 
or her authorized committees or by any other political committee shall 
be reported.
    (b)(1) Travel expenses paid for by a candidate from personal funds, 
or from a source other than a political committee, shall constitute 
reportable expenditures if the travel is campaign-related.
    (2) Where a candidate's trip involves both campaign-related and non-
campaign-related stops, the expenditures allocable for campaign purposes 
are reportable, and are calculated on the actual cost-per-mile of the 
means of transportation actually used, starting at the point of origin 
of the trip, via every campaign-related stop and ending at the point of 
origin.
    (3) Where a candidate conducts any campaign-related activity in a 
stop, the stop is a campaign-related stop and travel expenditures made 
are reportable. Campaign-related activity shall not include any 
incidental contacts.
    (c)(1) Where an individual, other than a candidate, conducts 
campaign-related activities on a trip, the portion of the trip 
attributed to each candidate shall be allocated on a reasonable basis.
    (2) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family are 
reportable as expenditures only if the spouse or family members conduct 
campaign-related activities.
    (d) Costs incurred by a candidate for the United States Senate or 
House of Representatives for travel between Washington, DC, and the 
State or district in which he or she is a candidate need not be reported 
herein unless the costs are paid by a candidate's authorized 
committee(s), or by any other political committee(s).
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the 
reportable expenditure for a candidate who uses government conveyance or 
accommodations for travel which is campaign-related is the rate for 
comparable commercial conveyance or accommodation. In the case of a 
candidate authorized by law or required by national security to be 
accompanied by staff and equipment, the allocable expenditures are the 
costs of facilities sufficient to accommodate the party, less authorized 
or required personnel and equipment. If such a trip includes both 
campaign and noncampaign stops,

[[Page 107]]

equivalent costs are calculated in accordance with paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section.

Sec. 106.4  Allocation of polling expenses.

    (a) The purchase of opinion poll results by a candidate or a 
candidate's authorized political committee or agent is an expenditure by 
the candidate. Regarding the purchase of opinion poll results for the 
purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate, 
see 11 CFR 100.8(b)(1).
    (b) The purchase of opinion poll results by a political committee or 
other person not authorized by a candidate to make expenditures and the 
subsequent acceptance of the poll results by a candidate or a 
candidate's authorized political committee or agent or by another 
unauthorized political committee is a contribution in-kind by the 
purchaser to the candidate or other political committee and an 
expenditure by the candidate or other political committee. Regarding the 
purchase of opinion poll results for the purpose of determining whether 
an individual should become a candidate, see 11 CFR 100.7(b)(1). The 
poll results are accepted by a candidate or other political committee if 
the candidate or the candidate's authorized political committee or agent 
or the other unauthorized political committee--
    (1) Requested the poll results before their receipt;
    (2) Uses the poll results; or
    (3) Does not notify the contributor that the results are refused.
    (c) The acceptance of any part of a poll's results which part, prior 
to receipt, has been made public without any request, authorization, 
prearrangement, or coordination by the candidate-receipient or political 
committee-recipient, shall not be treated as a contribution in-kind and 
expenditure under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The purchase of opinion poll results by an unauthorized 
political committee for its own use, in whole or in part, is an overhead 
expenditure by the political committee under Sec. 106.1(c)(1) to the 
extent of the benefit derived by the committee.
    (e) The amount of a contribution under paragraph (b) of this section 
or of any expenditure under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
attributable to each candidate-recipient or political committee-
recipient shall be--
    (1) That share of the overall cost of the poll which is allocable to 
each candidate (including State and local candidates) or political 
committee, based upon the cost allocation formula of the polling firm 
from which the results are purchased. Under this method the size of the 
sample, the number of computer column codes, the extent of computer 
tabulations, and the extent of written analysis and verbal consultation, 
if applicable, may be used to determine the shares; or
    (2) An amount computed by dividing the overall cost of the poll 
equally among candidates (including State and local candidates) or 
political committees receiving the results; or
    (3) A proportion of the overall cost of the poll equal to the 
proportion that the number of question results received by the candidate 
or political committee bears to the total number of question results 
received by all candidates (including State and local candidates) and 
political committees; or
    (4) An amount computed by any other method which reasonably reflects 
the benefit derived.
    (f) The first candidate(s) or committee(s) receiving poll results 
under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section and any candidate or 
political committee receiving poll results under paragraph (b) of this 
section within 15 days after receipt by the initial recipient(s) shall 
compute the amount of the contribution in-kind and the expenditure as 
provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) The amount of the contribution and expenditure reported by a 
candidate or a political committee receiving poll results under 
paragraph (b) of this section more than 15 days after receipt of such 
poll results by the initial recipient(s) shall be--

[[Page 108]]

    (1) If the results are received during the period 16 to 60 days 
following receipt by the initial recipient(s), 50 percent of the amount 
allocated to an initial recipient of the same results;
    (2) If the results are received during the period 61 to 180 days 
after receipt by the initial recipient(s), 5 percent of the amount 
allocated to an initial recipient of the same results;
    (3) If the results are received more than 180 days after receipt by 
the initial recipient(s), no amount need be allocated.
    (h) A contributor of poll results under paragraph (b) of this 
section shall maintain records sufficient to support the valuation of 
the contribution(s) in-kind and shall inform the candidate-recipient(s) 
or political committee-recipient(s) of the value of the contribution(s).

Sec. 106.5  Allocation of expenses between federal and non-federal activities by party committees.

    (a) General rules. (1) Party committees that make disbursements in 
connection with federal and non-federal elections shall make those 
disbursements entirely from funds subject to the prohibitions and 
limitations of the Act, or from accounts established pursuant to 11 CFR 
102.5. Political committees that have established separate federal and 
non-federal accounts under 11 CFR 102.5(a)(1)(i) shall allocate expenses 
between those accounts according to this section. Organizations that are 
not political committees but have established separate federal and non-
federal accounts under 11 CFR 102.5(b)(1)(i), or that make federal and 
non-federal disbursements from a single account under 11 CFR 
102.5(b)(1)(ii) shall also allocate their federal and non-federal 
expenses according to this section. This section covers (i) general 
rules regarding allocation of federal and non-federal expenses by party 
committees, (ii) percentages to be allocated for administrative expenses 
and costs of generic voter drives by national party committees, (iii) 
methods for allocation of administrative expenses, costs of generic 
voter drives, and exempt activities by state and local party committees, 
and of fundraising costs by all party committees, and (iv) procedures 
for payment of allocable expenses. Requirements for reporting of 
allocated disbursements are set forth in 11 CFR 104.10.
    (2) Costs to be allocated. Committees that make disbursements in 
connection with federal and non-federal elections shall allocate 
expenses according to this section for the following categories of 
activity:
    (i) Administrative expenses including rent, utilities, office 
supplies, and salaries, except for such expenses directly attributable 
to a clearly identified candidate;
    (ii) The direct costs of a fundraising program or event including 
disbursements for solicitation of funds and for planning and 
administration of actual fundraising events, where federal and non-
federal funds are collected by one committee through such program or 
event;
    (iii) State and local party activities exempt from the definitions 
of contribution and expenditure under 11 CFR 100.7(b) (9), (15) or (17), 
and 100.8(b) (10), (16) or (18) (exempt activities) including the 
production and distribution of slate cards and sample ballots, campaign 
materials distributed by volunteers, and voter registration and get-out-
the-vote drives on behalf of the party's presidential and vice-
presidential nominees, where such activities are conducted in 
conjunction with non-federal election activities; and
    (iv) Generic voter drives including voter identification, voter 
registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, or any other activities that 
urge the general public to register, vote or support candidates of a 
particular party or associated with a particular issue, without 
mentioning a specific candidate.
    (b) National party committees other than Senate or House campaign 
committees; fixed percentages for allocating administrative expenses and 
costs of generic voter drives--(1) General rule. Each national party 
committee other than a Senate or House campaign committee shall allocate 
a fixed percentage of its administrative expenses and costs of generic 
voter drives, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to its 
federal and non-federal account(s) each

[[Page 109]]

year. These percentages shall differ according to whether or not the 
allocable expenses were incurred in a presidential election year. Such 
committees shall allocate the costs of each combined federal and non-
federal fundraising program or event according to paragraph (f) of this 
section, with no fixed percentages required.
    (2) Fixed percentages according to type of election year. National 
party committees other than the Senate or House campaign committees 
shall allocate their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter 
drives according to paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii) as follows:
    (i) Presidential election years. In presidential election years, 
national party committees other than the Senate or House campaign 
committees shall allocate to their federal accounts at least 65% each of 
their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.
    (ii) Non-presidential election years. In all years other than 
presidential election years, national party committees other than the 
Senate or House campaign committees shall allocate to their federal 
accounts at least 60% each of their administrative expenses and costs of 
generic voter drives.
    (c) Senate and House campaign committees of a national party; method 
and minimum federal percentage for allocating administrative expenses 
and costs of generic voter drives--(1) Method for allocating 
administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives. Subject to 
the minimum percentage set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
each Senate or House campaign committee of a national party shall 
allocate its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives, 
as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the funds 
expended method, described in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) as follows:
    (i) Under this method, expenses shall be allocated based on the 
ratio of federal expenditures to total federal and non-federal 
disbursements made by the committee during the two-year federal election 
cycle. This ratio shall be estimated and reported at the beginning of 
each federal election cycle, based upon the committee's federal and non-
federal disbursements in a prior comparable federal election cycle or 
upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its disbursements for the 
coming two years. In calculating its federal expenditures, the committee 
shall include only amounts contributed to or otherwise spent on behalf 
of specific federal candidates. Calculation of total federal and non-
federal disbursements shall also be limited to disbursements for 
specific candidates, and shall not include overhead or other generic 
costs.
    (ii) On each of its periodic reports, the committee shall adjust its 
allocation ratio to reconcile it with the ratio of actual federal and 
non-federal disbursements made, to date. If the non-federal account has 
paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds 
from its federal to its non-federal account, as necessary, to reflect 
the adjusted allocation ratio. The committee shall make note of any such 
adjustments and transfers on its periodic reports, submitted pursuant to 
11 CFR 104.5.
    (2) Minimum federal percentage for administrative expenses and costs 
of generic voter drives. Regardless of the allocation ratio calculated 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each Senate or House campaign 
committee of a national party shall allocate to its federal account at 
least 65% each of its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter 
drives each year. If the committee's own allocation calculation under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section yields a federal share greater than 
65%, then the higher percentage shall be applied. If such calculation 
yields a federal share lower than 65%, then the committee shall report 
its calculated ratio according to 11 CFR 104.10(b), and shall apply the 
required minimum federal percentage.
    (3) Allocation of fundraising costs. Senate and House campaign 
committees shall allocate the costs of each combined federal and non-
federal fundraising program or event according to paragraph (f) of this 
section, with no minimum percentages required.
    (d) State and local party committees; method for allocating 
administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives--(1) General 
rule. All state and local party committees except those covered by 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall

[[Page 110]]

allocate their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter 
drives, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to 
the ballot composition method, described in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and 
(ii) as follows:
    (i) Under this method, expenses shall be allocated based on the 
ratio of federal offices expected on the ballot to total federal and 
non-federal offices expected on the ballot in the next general election 
to be held in the committee's state or geographic area. This ratio shall 
be determined by the number of categories of federal offices on the 
ballot and the number of categories of non-federal offices on the 
ballot, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) In calculating a ballot composition ratio, a state or local 
party committee shall count the federal offices of President, United 
States Senator, and United States Representative, if expected on the 
ballot in the next general election, as one federal office each. The 
committee shall count the non-federal offices of Governor, State 
Senator, and State Representative, if expected on the ballot in the next 
general election, as one non-federal office each. The committee shall 
count the total of all other partisan statewide executive candidates, if 
expected on the ballot in the next general election, as a maximum of two 
non-federal offices. State party committees shall also include in the 
ratio one additional non-federal office if any partisan local candidates 
are expected on the ballot in any regularly scheduled election during 
the two-year congressional election cycle. Local party committees shall 
also include in the ratio a maximum of two additional non-federal 
offices if any partisan local candidates are expected on the ballot in 
any regularly scheduled election during the two-year congressional 
election cycle. State and local party committees shall also include in 
the ratio one additional non-federal office.
    (2) Exception for states that do not hold federal and non-federal 
elections in the same year. State and local party committees in states 
that do not hold federal and non-federal elections in the same year 
shall allocate the costs of generic voter drives according to the ballot 
composition method described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, based 
on a ratio calculated for that calendar year. These committees shall 
allocate their administrative expenses according to the ballot 
composition method described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, based 
on a ratio calculated for the two-year Congressional election cycle.
    (e) State and local party committees; method for allocating costs of 
exempt activities. Each state or local party committee shall allocate 
its expenses for activities exempt from the definitions of contribution 
and expenditure under 11 CFR 100.7(b) (9), (15) or (17), and 100.8(b) 
(10), (16) or (18), when conducted in conjunction with non-federal 
election activities, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, 
according to the proportion of time or space devoted in a communication. 
Under this method, the committee shall allocate expenses of a particular 
communication based on the ratio of the portion of the communication 
devoted to federal candidates or elections as compared to the entire 
communication. In the case of a publication, this ratio shall be 
determined by the space devoted to federal candidates or elections as 
compared to the total space devoted to all federal and non-federal 
candidates or elections. In the case of a phone bank, the ratio shall be 
determined by the number of questions or statements devoted to federal 
candidates or elections as compared to the total number of questions or 
statements devoted to all federal and non-federal candidates or 
elections.
    (f) All party committees; method for allocating direct costs of 
fundraising. (1) If federal and non-federal funds are collected by one 
committee through a joint activity, that committee shall allocate its 
direct costs of fundraising, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, according to the funds received method. Under this method, the 
committee shall allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of 
funds received into its federal account to its total receipts from each 
fundraising program or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to 
each such program or event based upon the committee's reasonable 
prediction of its federal and non-federal revenue from that program

[[Page 111]]

or event, and shall be noted in the committee's report for the period in 
which the first disbursement for such program or event occurred, 
submitted pursuant 11 CFR 104.5. Any disbursements for fundraising costs 
made prior to the actual program or event shall be allocated according 
to this estimated ratio.
    (2) No later than the date 60 days after each fundraising program or 
event from which both federal and non-federal funds are collected, the 
committee shall adjust the allocation ratio for that program or event to 
reflect the actual ratio of funds received. If the non-federal account 
has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer 
funds from its federal to its non-federal account, as necessary, to 
reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. If the federal account has paid 
more than its allocable share, the committee shall make any transfers of 
funds from its non-federal to its federal account to reflect the 
adjusted allocation ratio within the 60-day time period established by 
this paragraph. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments 
and transfers in its report for any period in which a transfer was made, 
and shall also report the date of the fundraising program or event which 
serves as the basis for the transfer. In the case of a telemarketing or 
direct mail campaign, the ``date'' for purposes of this paragraph is the 
last day of the telemarketing campaign, or the day on which the final 
direct mail solicitations are mailed.
    (g) Payment of allocable expenses by committees with separate 
federal and non-federal accounts--(1) Payment options. Committees that 
have established separate federal and non-federal accounts under 11 CFR 
102.5 (a)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(i) shall pay the expenses of joint federal and 
non-federal activities described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
according to either paragraph (g)(1) (i) or (ii), as follows:
    (i) Payment by federal account; transfers from non-federal account 
to federal account. The committee shall pay the entire amount of an 
allocable expense from its federal account and shall transfer funds from 
its non-federal account to its federal account solely to cover the non-
federal share of that allocable expense.
    (ii) Payment by separate allocation account; transfers from federal 
and non-federal accounts to allocation account. (A) The committee shall 
establish a separate allocation account into which funds from its 
federal and non-federal accounts shall be deposited solely for the 
purpose of paying the allocable expenses of joint federal and non-
federal activities. Once a committee has established a separate 
allocation account for this purpose, all allocable expenses shall be 
paid from that account for as long as the account is maintained.
    (B) The committee shall transfer funds from its federal and non-
federal accounts to its allocation account in amounts proportionate to 
the federal or non-federal share of each allocable expense.
    (C) No funds contained in the allocation account may be transferred 
to any other account maintained by the committee.
    (2) Timing of transfers between accounts. (i) Under either payment 
option described in paragraphs (g)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, the 
committee shall transfer funds from its non-federal account to its 
federal account or from its federal and non-federal accounts to its 
separate allocation account following determination of the final cost of 
each joint federal and non-federal activity, or in advance of such 
determination if advance payment is required by the vendor and if such 
payment is based on a reasonable estimate of the activity's final cost 
as determined by the committee and the vendor(s) involved.
    (ii) Funds transferred from a committee's non-federal account to its 
federal account or its allocation account are subject to the following 
requirements:
    (A) For each such transfer, the committee must itemize in its 
reports the allocable activities for which the transferred funds are 
intended to pay, as required by 11 CFR 104.10(b)(3); and
    (B) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, such 
funds may not be transferred more than 10 days before or more than 60 
days after the payments for which they are designated are made.

[[Page 112]]

    (iii) Any portion of a transfer from a committee's non-federal 
account to its federal account or its allocation account that does not 
meet the requirements of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section shall be 
presumed to be a loan or contribution from the non-federal account to a 
federal account, in violation of the Act.
    (3) Reporting transfers of funds and allocated disbursements. A 
political committee that transfers funds between accounts and pays 
allocable expenses according to this section shall report each such 
transfer and disbursement pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(b).

Sec. 106.6  Allocation of expenses between federal and non-federal activities by separate segregated funds and nonconnected committees.

    (a) General rule. Separate segregated funds and nonconnected 
committees that make disbursements in connection with federal and non-
federal elections shall make those disbursements either entirely from 
funds subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act, or from 
accounts established pursuant to 11 CFR 102.5. Separate segregated funds 
and nonconnected committees that have established separate federal and 
non-federal accounts under 11 CFR 102.5 (a)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(i), or that 
make federal and non-federal disbursements from a single account under 
11 CFR 102.5(b)(1)(ii), shall allocate their federal and non-federal 
expenses according to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For 
purposes of this section, ``nonconnected committee'' includes any 
committee which conducts activities in connection with an election, but 
which is not a party committee, an authorized committee of any candidate 
for federal election, or a separate segregated fund.
    (b) Costs to be allocated--(1) Separate segregated funds. Separate 
segregated funds that make disbursements in connection with federal and 
non-federal elections shall allocate expenses for the following 
categories of activity:
    (i) Administrative expenses including rent, utilities, office 
supplies, and salaries not attributable to a clearly identified 
candidate, if such expenses are not paid by the separate segregated 
fund's connected organization;
    (ii) The direct costs of a fundraising program or event including 
disbursements for solicitation of funds and for planning and 
administration of actual fundraising events, where federal and non-
federal funds are collected through such program or event, if such 
expenses are not paid by the separate segregated fund's connected 
organization; and
    (iii) Generic voter drives including voter identification, voter 
registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, or any other activities that 
urge the general public to register, vote or support candidates of a 
particular party or associated with a particular issue, without 
mentioning a specific candidate.
    (2) Nonconnected committees. Nonconnected committees that make 
disbursements in connection with federal and non-federal elections shall 
allocate expenses for the following categories of activity:
    (i) Administrative expenses including rent, utilities, office 
supplies, and salaries, except for such expenses directly attributable 
to a clearly identified candidate;
    (ii) The direct costs of a fundraising program or event including 
disbursements for solicitation of funds and for planning and 
administration of actual fundraising events, where federal and non-
federal funds are collected through such program or event; and
    (iii) Generic voter drives including voter identification, voter 
registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, or any other activities that 
urge the general public to register, vote or support candidates of a 
particular party or associated with a particular issue, without 
mentioning a specific candidate.
    (c) Method for allocating administrative expenses and costs of 
generic voter drives. Nonconnected committees and separate segregated 
funds shall allocate their administrative expenses and costs of generic 
voter drives, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, according 
to the funds expended method, described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) as 
follows:
    (1) Under this method, expenses shall be allocated based on the 
ratio of federal expenditures to total federal and

[[Page 113]]

non-federal disbursements made by the committee during the two-year 
federal election cycle. This ratio shall be estimated and reported at 
the beginning of each federal election cycle, based upon the committee's 
federal and non-federal disbursements in a prior comparable federal 
election cycle or upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its 
disbursements for the coming two years. In calculating its federal 
expenditures, the committee shall include only amounts contributed to or 
otherwise spent on behalf of specific federal candidates. Calculation of 
total federal and non-federal disbursements shall also be limited to 
disbursements for specific candidates, and shall not include overhead or 
other generic costs.
    (2) On each of its periodic reports, the committee shall adjust its 
allocation ratio to reconcile it with the ratio of actual federal and 
non-federal disbursements made, to date. If the non-federal account has 
paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds 
from its federal to its non-federal account, as necessary, to reflect 
the adjusted allocation ratio. The committee shall make note of any such 
adjustments and transfers on its periodic reports, submitted pursuant to 
11 CFR 104.5.
    (d) Method for allocating direct costs of fundraising. (1) If 
federal and non-federal funds are collected by one committee through a 
joint activity, that committee shall allocate its direct costs of 
fundraising, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according 
to the funds received method. Under this method, the committee shall 
allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of funds received into 
its federal account to its total receipts from each fundraising program 
or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to each such program or 
event based upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its federal 
and non-federal revenue from that program or event, and shall be noted 
in the committee's report for the period in which the first disbursement 
for such program or event occurred, submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 104.5. 
Any disbursements for fundraising costs made prior to the actual program 
or event shall be allocated according to this estimated ratio.
    (2) No later than the date 60 days after each fundraising program or 
event from which both federal and non-federal funds are collected, the 
committee shall adjust the allocation ratio for that program or event to 
reflect the actual ratio of funds received. If the non-federal account 
has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer 
funds from its federal to its non-federal account, as necessary, to 
reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. If the federal account has paid 
more than its allocable share, the committee shall make any transfers of 
funds from its non-federal to its federal account to reflect the 
adjusted allocation ratio within the 60-day time period established by 
this paragraph. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments 
and transfers in its report for any period in which a transfer was made, 
and shall also report the date of the fundraising program or event which 
serves as the basis for the transfer. In the case of a telemarketing or 
direct mail campaign, the ``date'' for purposes of this paragraph is the 
last day of the telemarketing campaign, or the day on which the final 
direct mail solicitations are mailed.
    (e) Payment of allocable expenses by committees with separate 
federal and non-federal accounts--(1) Payment options. Nonconnected 
committees and separate segregated funds that have established separate 
federal and non-federal accounts under 11 CFR 102.5 (a)(1)(i) or 
(b)(1)(i) shall pay the expenses of joint federal and non-federal 
activities described in paragraph (b) of this section according to 
either paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii), as follows:
    (i) Payment by federal account; transfers from non-federal account 
to federal account. The committee shall pay the entire amount of an 
allocable expense from its federal account and shall transfer funds from 
its non-federal account to its federal account solely to cover the non-
federal share of that allocable expense.
    (ii) Payment by separate allocation account; transfers from federal 
and non-federal accounts to allocation account. (A) The committee shall 
establish a separate allocation account into which

[[Page 114]]

funds from its federal and non-federal accounts shall be deposited 
solely for the purpose of paying the allocable expenses of joint federal 
and non-federal activities. Once a committee has established an 
allocation account for this purpose, all allocable expenses shall be 
paid from that account for as long as the account is maintained.
    (B) The committee shall transfer funds from its federal and non-
federal accounts to its allocation account in amounts proportionate to 
the federal or non-federal share of each allocable expense.
    (C) No funds contained in the allocation account may be transferred 
to any other account maintained by the committee.
    (2) Timing of transfers between accounts. (i) Under either payment 
option described in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, the 
committee shall transfer funds from its non-federal account or from its 
federal and non-federal accounts to its separate allocation account 
following determination of the final cost of each joint federal and non-
federal activity, or in advance of such determination if advance payment 
is required by the vendor and if such payment is based on a reasonable 
estimate of the activity's final cost as determined by the committee and 
the vendor(s) involved.
    (ii) Funds transferred from a committee's non-federal account to its 
federal account or its allocation account are subject to the following 
requirements:
    (A) For each such transfer, the committee must itemize in its 
reports the allocable activities for which the tranferred funds are 
intended to pay, as required by 11 CFR 104.10(b)(3); and
    (B) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, such 
funds may not be transferred more than 10 days before or more than 60 
days after the payments for which they are designated are made.
    (iii) Any portion of a transfer from a committee's non-federal 
account to its federal account or its allocation account that does not 
meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section shall be 
presumed to be a loan or contribution from the non-federal account to a 
federal account, in violation of the Act.
    (3) Reporting transfers of funds and allocated disbursements. A 
political committee that transfers funds between accounts and pays 
allocable expenses according to this section shall report each such 
transfer and disbursement pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(b).

<R05>
Sec. 110.1  Contributions by persons other than multicandidate political committees (2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(1)).

    (a) Scope. This section applies to all contributions made by any 
person as defined in 11 CFR 100.10, except multicandidate political 
committees as defined in 11 CFR 100.5(e)(3) or entities and individuals 
prohibited from making contributions under 11 CFR 110.4 and 11 CFR parts 
114 and 115.
    (b) Contributions to candidates; designations; and redesignations. 
(1) No person shall make contributions to any candidate, his or her 
authorized political committees or agents with respect to any election 
for Federal office which, in the aggregate, exceed $1,000.
    (2) For purposes of this section, with respect to any election 
means--
    (i) In the case of a contribution designated in writing by the 
contributor for a particular election, the election so designated. 
Contributors to candidates are encouraged to designate their 
contributions in writing for particular elections. See 11 CFR 
110.1(b)(4).
    (ii) In the case of a contribution not designated in writing by the 
contributor for a particular election, the next election for that 
Federal office after the contribution is made.

[[Page 119]]

    (3)(i) A contribution designated in writing for a particular 
election, but made after that election, shall be made only to the extent 
that the contribution does not exceed net debts outstanding from such 
election. To the extent that such contribution exceeds net debts 
outstanding, the candidate or the candidate's authorized political 
committee shall return or deposit the contribution within ten days from 
the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution as provided by 
11 CFR 103.3(a), and if deposited, then within sixty days from the date 
of the treasurer's receipt the treasurer shall take the following 
action, as appropriate:
    (A) Refund the contribution using a committee check or draft; or
    (B) Obtain a written redesignation by the contributor for another 
election in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5); or
    (C) Obtain a written reattribution to another contributor in 
accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k)(3).
    If the candidate is not a candidate in the general election, all 
contributions made for the general election shall be either returned or 
refunded to the contributors or redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR 
110.1(b)(5), or reattributed in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k)(3), as 
appropriate.
    (ii) In order to determine whether there are net debts outstanding 
from a particular election, the treasurer of the candidate's authorized 
political committee shall calculate net debts outstanding as of the date 
of the election. For purposes of this section, net debts outstanding 
means the total amount of unpaid debts and obligations incurred with 
respect to an election, including the estimated cost of raising funds to 
liquidate debts incurred with respect to the election and, if the 
candidate's authorized committee terminates or if the candidate will not 
be a candidate for the next election, estimated necessary costs 
associated with termination of political activity, such as the costs of 
complying with the post-election requirements of the Act and other 
necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the 
campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries and office 
supplies, less the sum of:
    (A) The total cash on hand available to pay those debts and 
obligations, including: currency; balances on deposit in banks, savings 
and loan institutions, and other depository institutions; traveler's 
checks; certificates of deposit; treasury bills; and any other committee 
investments valued at fair market value; and
    (B) The total amounts owed to the candidate or political committee 
in the form of credits, refunds of deposits, returns, or receivables, or 
a commercially reasonable amount based on the collectibility of those 
credits, refunds, returns, or receivables.
    (iii) The amount of the net debts outstanding shall be adjusted as 
additional funds are received and expenditures are made. The candidate 
and his or her authorized political committee(s) may accept 
contributions made after the date of the election if such contributions 
are designated in writing by the contributor for that election and if 
such contributions do not exceed the adjusted amount of net debts 
outstanding on the date the contribution is received.
    (iv) This paragraph shall not be construed to prevent a candidate 
who is a candidate in the general election or his or her authorized 
political committee(s) from paying primary election debts and 
obligations with funds which represent contributions made with respect 
to the general election.
    (4) For purposes of this section, a contribution shall be considered 
to be designated in writing for a particular election if--
    (i) The contribution is made by check, money order, or other 
negotiable instrument which clearly indicates the particular election 
with respect to which the contribution is made;
    (ii) The contribution is accompanied by a writing, signed by the 
contributor, which clearly indicates the particular election with 
respect to which the contribution is made; or
    (iii) The contribution is redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR 
110.1(b)(5).
    (5)(i) The treasurer of an authorized political committee may 
request a written redesignation of a contribution by the contributor for 
a different election if--
    (A) The contribution was designated in writing for a particular 
election, and

[[Page 120]]

the contribution, either on its face or when aggregated with other 
contributions from the same contributor for the same election, exceeds 
the limitation on contributions set forth in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(1);
    (B) The contribution was designated in writing for a particular 
election and the contribution was made after that election and the 
contribution cannot be accepted under the net debts outstanding 
provisions of 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3);
    (C) The contribution was not designated in writing for a particular 
election, and the contribution exceeds the limitation on contributions 
set forth in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(1); or
    (D) The contribution was not designated in writing for a particular 
election, and the contribution was received after the date of an 
election for which there are net debts outstanding on the date the 
contribution is received.
    (ii) A contribution shall be considered to be redesignated for 
another election if--
    (A) The treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee 
requests that the contributor provide a written redesignation of the 
contribution and informs the contributor that the contributor may 
request the refund of the contribution as an alternative to providing a 
written redesignation; and
    (B) Within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of 
the contribution, the contributor provides the treasurer with a written 
redesignation of the contribution for another election, which is signed 
by the contributor.
    (iii) A contribution redesignated for another election shall not

by the transferor committee. The transferor committee must be able to 
demonstrate that such cash on hand contains sufficient funds at the time 
of the transfer that comply with the limitations and prohibitions of the 
Act to cover the amount transferred. A contribution shall be excluded 
from the amount transferred to the extent that such contribution, when 
aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor to the 
transferee principal campaign committee, exceeds the contribution limits 
set forth at 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2, as appropriate; and
    (iii) The candidate has not elected to receive funds under 26 U.S.C. 
9006 or 9037 for either election; or

funds or assets from a candidate's campaign committee or account for a 
nonfederal election to his or her principal campaign committee or other 
authorized committee for a federal election are prohibited. However, at 
the option of the nonfederal committee, the nonfederal committee may 
refund contributions, and may coordinate arrangements with the 
candidate's principal campaign committee or other authorized committee

election, convention or caucus relating to the primary election,

    (2) The candidate may treat an amount that does not exceed 50% of 
the candidate's total expenditures allocable to a particular State under 
11 CFR 106.2 as exempt fundraising expenses, and may exclude this amount

a candidate who is engaging in party-building activities, without the 
payment being considered a contribution to the candidate, and without 
the unreimbursed expense being considered an expenditure counting 
against the limitations in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, as 
long as--
    (i) The event is a bona fide party event or appearance; and
    (ii) No aspect of the solicitation for the event, the setting of the

section, an event or appearance occurring on or after January 1 of the 
year of the election for which the individual is a candidate is

Vice-Presidential candidate, if it is made by--
    (1) An authorized committee or any other agent of the candidate for 
purposes of making any expenditure;
    (2) Any person authorized or requested by the candidate, an 
authorized committee of the candidate, or an agent of the candidate to

    (a)(1) General rules. Except as provided at paragraph (a)(6) of this 
section, whenever any person makes an expenditure for the purpose of 
financing a communication that expressly advocates the election or 
defeat of a clearly identified candidate, or that solicits any 
contribution, through any broadcasting station, newspaper, magazine, 
outdoor advertising facility, poster, yard sign, direct mailing or any 
other form of general public political advertising, a disclaimer meeting 
the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (a)(2) 
of this section shall appear and be presented in a clear and conspicuous 
manner to give the reader, observer or listener adequate notice of the 
identity of persons who paid for and, where required, who authorized the 
communication.
    (i) Such communication, including any solicitation, if paid for and 
authorized by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or 
its agent, shall clearly state that the communication has been paid for 
by the authorized political committee; or
    (ii) Such communication, including any solicitation, if authorized 
by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate or an agent 
thereof, but paid for by any other person, shall clearly state that the 
communication is paid for by such other person and is authorized by such 
candidate, authorized committee or agent; or
    (iii) Such communication, including any solicitation, if made on 
behalf of or in opposition to a candidate, but paid for by any other 
person and not authorized by a candidate, authorized committee of a 
candidate or its agent, shall clearly state that the communication has 
been paid for by such person and is not authorized by any candidate or 
candidate's committee.
    (iv) For solicitations directed to the general public on behalf of a 
political committee which is not an authorized committee of a candidate, 
such solicitation shall clearly state the full name

[[Page 136]]

of the person who paid for the communication.
    (2) Coordinated Party Expenditures. (i) For a communication paid for 
by a party committee pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 441a(d), the disclaimer 
required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall identify the 
committee that makes the expenditure as the person who paid for the 
communication, regardless of whether the committee was acting in its own 
capacity or as the designated agent of another committee.
    (ii) A communication made by a party committee pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 
441a(d) prior to the date the party's candidate is nominated shall 
satisfy the requirements of this section if it clearly states who paid 
for the communication.
    (3) Definition of ``direct mailing.'' For purposes of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section only, direct mailing includes any number of 
substantially similar pieces of mail but does not include a mailing of 
one hundred pieces or less by any person.
    (4) Exempt Activities. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section only, the term expenditure includes a communication by a

excepted under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, shall clearly state who 
paid for the communication but do not have to include an authorization 
statement.
    (5) Placement of Disclaimer. The disclaimers specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section shall be presented in a clear and conspicuous 
manner, to give the reader, observer or listener adequate notice of the 
identity of the person or committee that paid for, and, where required, 
that authorized the communication. A disclaimer is not clear and 
conspicuous if the printing is difficult to read or if the placement is 
easily overlooked.
    (i) The disclaimer need not appear on the front or cover page of the 
communication as long as it appears within the communication, except on 
communications, such as billboards, that contain only a front face.
    (ii) Each communication that would require a disclaimer if 
distributed separately, that is included in a package of materials, must 
contain the required disclaimer.

organization. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, whenever 
a separate segregated fund or its connected organization solicits 
contributions to the fund from those persons it may solicit under the 
applicable provisions of 11 CFR part 114, or makes a communication to 
those persons, such communication shall not be considered a form of 
general public political advertising and need not contain the disclaimer 
set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b)(1) No person who sells space in a newspaper or magazine to a 
candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of the 
candidate, for use in connection with the candidate's campaign for 
nomination or for election, shall charge an amount for the space which 
exceeds the comparable rate for the space for non-campaign purposes.

Sec. 110.13  Candidate debates.

    (a) Staging organizations. (1) Nonprofit organizations described in 
26 U.S.C. 501 (c)(3) or (c)(4) and which do not endorse, support, or 
oppose political candidates or political parties may stage candidate 
debates in accordance with this section and 11 CFR 114.4(f).
    (2) Broadcasters (including a cable television operator, programmer 
or producer), bona fide newspapers, magazines and other periodical 
publications may stage candidate debates in accordance with this section 
and 11 CFR 114.4(f), provided that they are not owned or controlled by a 
political party, political committee or candidate. In addition, 
broadcasters (including a cable television operator, programmer or

publications, acting as press entities, may also cover or carry 
candidate debates in accordance with 11 CFR 100.7 and 100.8.
    (b) Debate structure. The structure of debates staged in accordance 
with this section and 11 CFR 114.4(f) is left to the discretion of the 
staging organizations(s), provided that:
    (1) Such debates include at least two candidates; and
    (2) The staging organization(s) does not structure the debates to 
promote or advance one candidate over another.
    (c) Criteria for candidate selection. For all debates, staging 
organization(s) must use pre-established objective criteria to determine 
which candidates may participate in a debate. For general election 
debates, staging organizations(s) shall not use nomination by a 
particular political party as the sole objective criterion to determine 
whether to include a candidate in a debate. For debates held prior to a 
primary election, caucus or convention, staging organizations may 
restrict candidate participation to candidates seeking the nomination of 
one party, and need not stage a debate for candidates seeking the 
nomination of any other political party or independent candidates.

agreement reached under this subsection is subject to the provisions of 
11 CFR 111.18(b) and shall have the same force and effect as a 
conciliation agreement reached under 11 CFR 111.18(c).

properly be introduced pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence or 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    (a) In order to avoid the possibility of prejudice, real or 
apparent, to the public interest in enforcement actions pending before 
the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR part 111, except to the extent 
required for the disposition of ex parte matters as required by law (for 
example, during the normal course of an investigation or a conciliation 
effort), no interested person outside the agency shall make or cause to

complaint is filed with the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR part 111 or 
from the time that the Commission determines on the basis of information 
ascertained in the normal course of its supervisory responsibilities

pursuant to 11 CFR part 111, and remains in force until the Commission 
has finally concluded all action with respect to the enforcement matter 
in question.

between a respondent or respondent's attorney and any attorney or staff 
member of the Office of General Counsel in the course of representing 
the Commission or the respondent with respect to an enforcement 
proceeding or civil action. No statement made by such a Commission 
attorney or staff member during any such communication shall bind or 
estop the Commission in any way.

employee, or other person who knowingly and willfully violates this

<R05>
Sec. 113.1  Definitions (2 U.S.C. 439a).

    When used in this part--
    (a) Funds donated. Funds donated means all funds, including, but not 
limited to, gifts, loans, advances, credits or deposits of money which 
are donated for the purpose of supporting the activities of a Federal or 
State officeholder; but does not mean funds appropriated by Congress, a 
State legislature, or another similar public appropriating body, or 
personal funds of the officeholder donated to an account containing only 
those personal funds.
    (b) Office account. Office account means an account established for 
the purposes of supporting the activities of a Federal or State 
officeholder which contains excess campaign funds and funds donated, but 
does not include an account used exclusively for funds appropriated by 
Congress, a State legislature, or another similar public appropriating 
body, or an account of the officeholder which contains only the personal 
funds of the officeholder, or an account containing only appropriated 
funds and only personal funds of the officeholder.
    (c) Federal officeholder. Federal officeholder means an individual 
elected to or serving in the office of President or Vice President of 
the United States; or a Senator or a Representative in, or Delegate or 
Resident Commissioner to, the Congress of the United States.
    (d) State officeholder. State officeholder means an individual 
elected to or serving in any elected public office within a State of the 
United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
or any subdivision thereof.
    (e) Excess campaign funds. Excess campaign funds means amounts 
received by a candidate as contributions which he or she determines are 
in excess of any amount necessary to defray his or her campaign 
expenditures.
    (f) Qualified Member. Qualified Member means an individual who was 
serving as a Senator or Representative in, or Delegate or Resident 
Commissioner to, Congress, on January 8, 1980.
    (g) Personal use. Personal use means any use of funds in a campaign 
account of a present or former candidate to fulfill a commitment, 
obligation or expense of any person that would exist irrespective of the 
candidate's campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder.
    (1)(i) Personal use includes but is not limited to the use of funds 
in a campaign account for:
    (A) Household food items or supplies;
    (B) Funeral, cremation or burial expenses;

[[Page 151]]

    (C) Clothing, other than items of de minimis value that are used in 
the campaign, such as campaign ``T-shirts'' or caps with campaign 
slogans;
    (D) Tuition payments, other than those associated with training 
campaign staff;
    (E) Mortgage, rent or utility payments--
    (1) For any part of any personal residence of the candidate or a 
member of the candidate's family; or
    (2) For real or personal property that is owned by the candidate or 
a member of the candidate's family and used for campaign purposes, to 
the extent the payments exceed the fair market value of the property 
usage;
    (F) Admission to a sporting event, concert, theater or other form of 
entertainment, unless part of a specific campaign or officeholder 
activity;
    (G) Dues, fees or gratuities at a country club, health club, 
recreational facility or other nonpolitical organization, unless they 
are part of the costs of a specific fundraising event that takes place 
on the organization's premises; and
    (H) Salary payments to a member of the candidate's family, unless 
the family member is providing bona fide services to the campaign. If a 
family member provides bona fide services to the campaign, any salary 
payment in excess of the fair market value of the services provided is 
personal use.
    (ii) The Commission will determine, on a case by case basis, whether 
other uses of funds in a campaign account fulfill a commitment, 
obligation or expense that would exist irrespective of the candidate's 
campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder, and therefore are personal 
use. Examples of such other uses include:
    (A) Legal expenses;
    (B) Meal expenses;
    (C) Travel expenses, including subsistence expenses incurred during 
travel. If a committee uses campaign funds to pay expenses associated 
with travel that involves both personal activities and campaign or 
officeholder related activities, the incremental expenses that result 
from the personal activities are personal use, unless the person(s) 
benefiting from this use reimburse(s) the campaign account within thirty 
days for the amount of the incremental expenses; and
    (D) Vehicle expenses, unless they are a de minimis amount. If a 
committee uses campaign funds to pay expenses associated with a vehicle 
that is used for both personal activities beyond a de minimus amount and 
campaign or officerholder related activities, the portion of the vehicle 
expenses associated with the personal activities is personal use, unless 
the person(s) using the vehicle for personal activities reimburse(s) the 
campaign account within thirty days for the expenses associated with the 
personal activities.
    (2) Charitable donations. Donations of campaign funds or assets to 
an organization described in section 170(c) of Title 26 of the United 
States Code are not personal use, unless the candidate receives 
compensation from the organization before the organization has expended 
the entire amount donated for purposes unrelated to his or her personal 
benefit.
    (3) Transfers of campaign assets. The transfer of a campaign 
committee asset is not personal use so long as the transfer is for fair 
market value. Any depreciation that takes place before the transfer must 
be allocated between the committee and the purchaser based on the useful 
life of the asset.
    (4) Gifts. Gifts of nominal value and donations of a nominal amount 
made on a special occasion such as a holiday, graduation, marriage, 
retirement, or death are not personal use, unless made to a member of 
the candidate's family.
    (5) Political or officially connected expenses. The use of campaign 
funds for an expense that would be a political expense under the rules 
of the United States House of Representatives or an officially connected 
expense under the rules of the United States Senate is not personal use 
to the extent that the expense is an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.8 or 
an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties 
of a holder of Federal office. Any use of funds that would be personal 
use under 11 CFR 113.1(g)(1) will not be considered an expenditure under 
11 CFR 100.8 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection 
with the duties of a holder of Federal office.

[[Page 152]]

    (6) Third party payments. Notwithstanding that the use of funds for 
a particular expense would be a personal use under this section, payment 
of that expense by any person other than the candidate or the campaign 
committee shall be a contribution under 11 CFR 100.7 to the candidate 
unless the payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy. 
Examples of payments considered to be irrespective of the candidacy 
include, but are not limited to, situations where--
    (i) The payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund 
established in accordance with the rules of the United States Senate or 
the United State House of Representatives;
    (ii) The payment is made from funds that are the candidate's 
personal funds as defined in 11 CFR 110.10(b), including an account 
jointly held by the candidate and a member of the candidate's family;
    (iii) Payments for that expense were made by the person making the 
payment before the candidate became a candidate. Payments that are 
compensation shall be considered contributions unless--
    (A) The compensation results from bona fide employment that is 
genuinely independent of the candidacy;
    (B) The compensation is exclusively in consideration of services 
provided by the employee as part of this employment; and
    (C) The compensation does not exceed the amount of compensation 
which would be paid to any other similarly qualified person for the same 
work over the same period of time.
    (7) Members of the candidate's family. For the purposes of section 
113.1(g), the candidate's family includes:
    (i) The spouse of the candidate;
    (ii) Any child, step-child, parent, grandparent, sibling, half-
sibling or step-sibling of the candidate or the candidate's spouse;
    (iii) The spouse of any child, step-child, parent, grandparent, 
sibling, half-sibling or step-sibling of the candidate; and
    (iv) A person who has a committed relationship with the candidate, 
such as sharing a household and having mutual responsibility for each 
other's personal welfare or living expenses.

<R05>
Sec. 113.2  Use of funds (2 U.S.C. 439a).

    Excess campaign funds and funds donated:
    (a) May be used to defray any ordinary and necessary expenses 
incurred in connection with the recipient's duties as a holder of 
Federal office, if applicable, including:
    (1) The costs of travel by the recipient Federal officeholder and an 
accompanying spouse to participate in a function directly connected to 
bona fide official responsibilities, such as a fact-finding meeting or 
an event at which the officeholder's services are provided through a 
speech or appearance in an official capacity; and
    (2) The costs of winding down the office of a former Federal 
officeholder for a period of 6 months after he or she leaves office; or
    (b) May be contributed to any organization described in section 
170(c) of Title 26, of the United States Code; or
    (c) May be transferred without limitation to any national, State, or 
local committee of any political party; or
    (d) May be used for any other lawful purpose, except that, other 
than as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, no such amounts may 
be converted by any person to any personal use, other than: To defray 
any ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with his or 
her duties as a holder of Federal office, or to repay to a candidate any 
loan the proceeds of which were used in connection with his or her 
campaign.
    (e)(1) Except as limited by paragraph (e)(5) of this section, a 
qualified Member who serves in the 102d or an earlier Congress may 
convert to personal use no more than the unobligated balance of excess 
funds as of November 30, 1989. This unobligated balance shall be 
calculated under either paragraph (e)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) Cash assets. The Member may convert any excess campaign or 
donated funds in an amount up to the Member's authorized committee(s)' 
cash on hand, determined under 11 CFR 104.3(a)(1), as

[[Page 153]]

of November 30, 1989, less the committee(s)' total outstanding debts as 
of that date.
    (ii) Cash Plus Nonliquid Assets. (A) The Member may convert 
unliquidated committee assets held by his or her authorized committee(s) 
on November 30, 1989; or the value of such assets may be added to the 
value of the committee(s)' cash assets under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this 
section to determine the amount which is eligible for conversion. In 
either case, prior to conversion, the committee shall amend its 1989 
year end reports to indicate, as memo entries to Schedule A, the assets 
to be converted. These amendments shall list each asset, give its date 
of acquisition, its fair market value as of November 30, 1989, and a 
brief narrative description of how this value was ascertained. The 
committee shall also disclose the disposition made of each such asset, 
including its fair market value on the date of sale or other 
disposition, in its termination report, unless the asset was sold or 
otherwise disposed of during an earlier period and included in the 
report covering that period.
    (B) The Member may add the value of debts and loans reported as owed 
to the Member's authorized committee(s) as of November 30, 1989, and 
itemized on the committee(s)' year end reports for 1989, to the 
unobligated balance, provided that such receivables are actually 
collected by the committee(s) prior to their termination.
    (C) The Member may add to the unobligated balance the value of 
vendor credits and deposit refunds to which authorized campaign 
committee(s) are entitled, if these receivables are itemized on Schedule 
C or D of the committee(s)' 1989 year end reports or in amendment(s) 
thereto.
    (2) If the unobligated balance subsequently falls below its November 
30, 1989, level, a qualified Member may use contributions lawfully 
received or other lawful committee income received after that date to 
restore the account up to that level.
    (3) A qualified Member may convert committee assets which were not 
held on November 30, 1989, to personal use; however, the fair market 
value of such assets at the time of conversion shall be counted against 
the unobligated balance.
    (4) Under no circumstances may an amount greater than the 
unobligated balance on November 30, 1989, be converted to personal use. 
Should money from subsequent contributions, other committee income, and/
or the sale of campaign assets exceed the amount needed to restore the 
unobligated balance to its November 30, 1989, level, such additional 
funds shall not be converted to personal use but may be used for the 
purposes set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.
    (5) 103d Congress or later Congress: A qualified Member who serves 
in the 103d Congress or a later Congress may not convert to personal use 
any excess campaign or donated funds, as of the first day of such 
service.
    (f) Nothing in this section modifies or supersedes other Federal 
statutory restrictions or relevant State laws which may apply to the use 
of excess campaign or donated funds by candidates or Federal 
officeholders.

for the purpose of income withholding tax on employee wages under 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, section 3402.
    (3) Individuals on commission may be considered executive or 
administrative personnel if they have policymaking, managerial, 
professional, or supervisory responsibility and if the individuals are 
employees, within the meaning of 26 CFR 31.3401(c)-1 of the corporation 
for the purpose of income withholding tax on employee wages under the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954, section 3402.
    (4) The Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201, et seq. and the

guideline in determining whether individuals have policymaking, 
managerial, professional, or supervisory responsibilities.
    (d) Labor organization means any organization of any kind, or any 
agency or employee representative committee or plan, in which employees 
participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of

trade association, cooperative, corporation without capital stock, or a 
local, national, or international labor organization that:
    (i) Is composed of members, some or all of whom are vested with the

membership organization, affirmatively accept the membership 
organization's invitation to become a member, and either:
    (i) Have some significant financial attachment to the membership 
organization, such as a significant investment or ownership stake; or
    (ii) Pay membership dues at least annually, of a specific amount 
predetermined by the organization; or
    (iii) Have a significant organizational attachment to the membership 
organization which includes: affirmation of membership on at least an

    (3) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, the Commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that 
persons who do not precisely meet the requirements on the general rule, 
but have a relatively enduring and independently significant financial 
or organizational attachment to the organization, may be considered 
members for purposes of this section. For example, student members who 
pay a lower amount of dues while in school, long term dues paying 
members who qualify for lifetime membership status with little or no 
dues obligation, and retired members of the organization may be 
considered members for purposes of these rules.
    (4) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section, members of a local union are considered to be 
members of any national or international union of which the local union 
is a part and of any federation with which the local, national, or 
international union is affiliated.
    (5) In the case of a membership organization which has a national 
federation structure or has several levels, including, for example, 
national, state, regional and/or local affiliates, a person who 
qualifies as a member of any entity within the federation or of any 
affiliate by meeting the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(i), (ii), or 
(iii) of this section shall also qualify as a member of all affiliates 
for purposes of this part. The factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5 (g)(2), 
(3) and (4) shall be used to determine whether entities are affiliated 
for purposes of this paragraph.
    (6) The status of a membership organization, and of members, for 
purposes of this part, shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section and not by provisions of state law governing trade 
associations, cooperatives, corporations without capital stock, or labor 
organizations.
    (f) Method of facilitating the making of contributions means the 
manner in which the contributions are received or collected such as, but 
not limited to, payroll deduction or checkoff systems, other periodic 
payment plans, or return envelopes enclosed in a solicitation request.

[[Page 157]]

mailings, oral requests for contributions, and hand distribution of 
pamphlets.
    (h) Stockholder means a person who has a vested beneficial interest 
in stock, has the power to direct how that stock shall be voted, if it 
is voting stock, and has the right to receive dividends.

    (j) Restricted class. A corporation's restricted class is its 
stockholders and executive or administrative personnel, and their 
families, and the executive and administrative personnel of its 
subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and departments and their families. A 
labor organization's restricted class is its members and executive or 
administrative personnel, and their families. For communications under 
11 CFR 114.3, the restricted class of an incorporated membership 
organization, incorporated trade association, incorporated cooperative 
or corporation without capital stock is its members and executive or 
administrative personnel, and their families. (The solicitable class of 
a membership organization, cooperative, corporation without capital 
stock or trade association, as described in 11 CFR 114.7 and 114.8, may 
include some persons who are not considered part of the organization's 
restricted class, and may exclude some persons who are in the restricted 
class.)

Sec. 114.2  Prohibitions on contributions and expenditures.

    (a) National banks and corporations organized by authority of any 
law of Congress are prohibited from making a contribution, as defined in 
11 CFR 114.1(a), in connection with any election to any political 
office, including local, State and Federal offices, or in connection 
with any primary election or political convention or caucus held to 
select candidates for any political office, including any local, State 
or Federal office. National banks and corporations organized by 
authority of any law of Congress are prohibited form making expenditures 
as defined in 11 FR 114.1(a) for communications to those outside the 
restricted class expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or 
more clearly identified candidate(s) or the candidates of a clearly 
identified political party, with respect to an election to any political 
office, including any local, State or Federal office.
    (1) Such national banks and corporations may engage in the 
activities permitted by 11 CFR part 114, except to the extent that such 
activity is foreclosed by provisions of law other than the Act.
    (2) The provisions of 11 CFR part 114 apply to the activities of a 
national bank, or a corporation organized by any law of Congress, in 
connection with local, State and Federal elections.
    (b) Any corporation whatever or any labor organization is prohibited 
from making a contribution as defined in 11 CFR 114.1(a) in connection 
with any Federal election. Except as provided at 11 CFR 114.10, 
corporations and labor organizations are prohibited from making 
expenditures with respect to a Federal election (as defined in 11 CFR 
114.1(a)) for communications to those outside the restricted class 
expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly 
identified candidate(s) or the candidates of a clearly identified 
political party.
    (c) Disbursements by corporations and labor organizations for the 
election-related activities described in 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.4 will not 
cause those activities to be contributions or expenditures, even when 
coordinated with any candidate, candidate's agent, candidate's 
authorized committee(s) or any party committee to the extent permitted 
in those sections. Coordination beyond that described in 11 CFR 114.3

[[Page 158]]

and 114.4 shall not cause subsequent activities directed at the 
restricted class to be considered contributions or expenditures. 
However, such coordination may be considered evidence that could negate 
the independence of subsequent communications to those outside the 
restricted class by the corporation, labor organization or its separate 
segregated fund, and could result in an in-kind contribution. See 11 CFR 
109.1 regarding independent expenditures and coordination with 
candidates.
    (d) A candidate, political committee, or other person is prohibited 
from knowingly accepting or receiving any contribution prohibited by 
this section.
    (e) No officer or director of any corporation or any national bank, 
and no officer of any labor organization shall consent to any 
contribution or expenditure by the corporation, national bank, or labor 
organization prohibited by this section.
    (f) Facilitating the making of contributions. (1) Corporations and 
labor organizations (including officers, directors or other 
representatives acting as agents of corporations and labor 
organizations) are prohibited from facilitating the making of 
contributions to candidates or political committees, other than to the 
separate segregated funds of the corporations and labor organizations. 
Facilitation means using corporate or labor organization resources or 
facilities to engage in fundraising activities in connection with any 
federal election, such as activities which go beyond the limited 
exemptions set forth in 11 CFR 100.7, 100.8, 114.9(a) through (c) and 
114.13. A corporation does not facilitate the making of a contribution 
to a candidate or political committee if it provides goods or services 
in the ordinary course of its business as a commercial vendor in 
accordance with 11 CFR part 116 at the usual and normal charge.
    (2) Examples of facilitating the making of contributions include but 
are not limited to--
    (i) Fundraising activities by corporations (except commercial 
vendors) or labor organizations that involve--
    (A) Officials or employees of the corporation or labor organization 
ordering or directing subordinates or support staff (who therefore are 
not acting as volunteers) to plan, organize or carry out the fundraising 
project as a part of their work responsibilities using corporate or 
labor organization resources, unless the corporation or labor 
organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of such 
services;
    (B) Failure to reimburse a corporation or labor organization within 
a commercially reasonable time for the use of corporate facilities 
described in 11 CFR 114.9(d) in connection with such fundraising 
activities;
    (C) Using a corporate or labor organization list of customers, 
clients, vendors or others who are not in the restricted class to 
solicit contributions or distribute invitations to the fundraiser, 
unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment 
for the fair market value of the list;
    (D) Using meeting rooms that are not customarily made available to 
clubs, civic or community organizations or other groups; or
    (E) Providing catering or other food services operated or obtained 
by the corporation or labor organization, unless the corporation or 
labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of 
the services;
    (ii) Providing materials for the purpose of transmitting or 
delivering contributions, such as stamps, envelopes addressed to a 
candidate or political committee other than the corporation's or labor 
organization's separate segregated fund, or other similar items which 
would assist in transmitting or delivering contributions, but not 
including providing the address of the candidate or political committee;
    (iii) Soliciting contributions earmarked for a candidate that are to 
be collected and forwarded by the corporation's or labor organizations's 
separate segregated fund, except to the extent such contributions also 
are treated as contributions to and by the separate segregated fund; or
    (iv) Using coercion, such as the threat of a detrimental job action, 
the threat of any other financial reprisal, or the threat of force, to 
urge any individual to make a contribution or engage in fundraising 
activities on behalf of a candidate or political committee.

[[Page 159]]

    (3) Facilitating the making of contributions does not include the 
following activities if conducted by a separate segregated fund--
    (i) Any activity specifically permitted under 11 CFR 110.1, 110.2, 
or 114.5 through 114.8, including soliciting contributions to a 
candidate or political committee, and making in kind contributions to a 
candidate or political committee; and
    (ii) Collecting and forwarding contributions earmarked to a 
candidate in accordance with 11 CFR 110.6.
    (4) Facilitating the making of contributions also does not include 
the following activities if conducted by a corporation or labor 
organization--
    (i) Enrolling members of a corporation's or labor organization's 
restricted class in a payroll deduction plan or check-off system which 
deducts contributions from dividend or payroll checks to make 
contributions to the corporation's or labor organization's separate 
segregated fund or an employee participation plan pursuant to 11 CFR 
114.11;
    (ii) Soliciting contributions to be sent directly to candidates if 
the solicitation is directed to the restricted class, see 11 CFR 
114.1(a)(2)(i); and
    (iii) Soliciting contributions earmarked for a candidate that are to 
be collected and forwarded by the corporation's or labor organization's 
separate segregated fund, to the extent such contributions also are 
treated as contributions to and by the separate segregated fund.

Sec. 114.3  Disbursements for communications to the restricted class in connection with a Federal election.

    (a) General. (1) Corporations and labor organizations may make 
communications on any subject, including communications containing 
express advocacy, to their restricted class or any part of that class. 
Corporations and labor organizations may also make the communications 
permitted under 11 CFR 114.4 to their restricted class or any part of 
that class. The activities permitted under this section may involve 
election-related coordination with candidates and political committees. 
See 11 CFR 109.1 and 114.2(c) regarding independent expenditures and 
coordination with candidates.
    (2) Incorporated membership organizations, incorporated trade 
associations, incorporated cooperatives and corporations without capital 
stock may make communications to their restricted class, or any part of 
that class as permitted in paragraphs (a)(1) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Reporting communications containing express advocacy. 
Disbursements for communications expressly advocating the election or 
defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) made by a 
corporation, including a corporation described in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, or labor organization to its restricted class shall be 
reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.8(b)(4) and 104.6.
    (c) Communications containing express advocacy. Communications 
containing express advocacy which may be made to the restricted class 
include, but are not limited to, the examples set forth in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
    (1) Publications. Printed material expressly advocating the election 
or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) or candidates 
of a clearly identified political party may be distributed by a 
corporation or by a labor organization to its restricted class, provided 
that:
    (i) The material is produced at the expense of the corporation or 
labor organization; and
    (ii) The material constitutes a communications of the views of the 
corporation or the labor organization, and is not the republication or 
reproduction, in whole or in part, of any broadcast, transcript or tape 
or any written, graphic, or other form of campaign materials prepared by 
the candidate, his or her campaign committees, or their authorized 
agents. A corporation or labor organization may, under this section, use 
brief quotations from speeches or other materials of a candidate that 
demonstrate the candidate's position as part of the corporation's or 
labor organization's expression of its own views.
    (2) Candidate and party appearances. (i) A corporation may allow a 
candidate, candidate's representative or

[[Page 160]]

party representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, 
convention or other function of the corporation, but is not required to 
do so. A labor organization may allow a candidate or party 
representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, convention, 
or other function of the labor organization, but is not required to do 
so. A corporation or labor organization may bar other candidates for the 
same office or a different office and their representatives, and 
representatives of other parties addressing the restricted class. A 
corporation or labor organization may allow the presence of employees 
outside the restricted class of the corporation or labor organization 
who are necessary to administer the meeting, other guests of the 
corporation or labor organization who are being honored or speaking or 
participating in the event, and representatives of the news media.
    (ii) The candidate, candidate's representative or party 
representative may ask for contributions to his or her campaign or 
party, or ask that contributions to the separate segregated fund of the 
corporation or labor organization be designated for his or her campaign 
or party. The incidental solicitation of persons outside the 
corporation's or labor organization's restricted class who may be 
present at the meeting as permitted by this section will not be a 
violation of 11 CFR part 114. The candidate's representative or party 
representative (other than an officer, director or other representative 
of a corporation or official, member or employee of a labor 
organization) or the candidate, may accept contributions before, during 
or after the appearance at the meeting, convention or other function of 
the corporation or labor organization.
    (iii) The corporation or labor organization may suggest that members 
of its restricted class contribute to the candidate or party committee, 
but the collection of contributions by any officer, director or other 
representative of the corporation or labor organization before, during, 
or after the appearance while at the meeting, is an example of a 
prohibited facilitation of contributions under 11 CFR 114.2(f).
    (iv) If the corporation or labor organization permits more than one 
candidate for the same office, or more than one candidate's 
representative or party representative, to address its restricted class, 
and permits the news media to cover or carry an appearance by one 
candidate or candidate's representative or party representative, the 
corporation or labor organization shall also permit the news media to 
cover or carry the appearances by the other candidate(s) for that 
office, or the other candidates' representatives or party 
representatives. If the corporation or labor organization permits a 
representative of the news media to cover or carry a candidate or 
candidate's representative or party representative appearance, the 
corporation or labor organization shall provide all other 
representatives of the news media with equal access for covering or 
carrying that appearance. Equal access is provided by--
    (A) Providing advance information regarding the appearance to the 
representatives of the news media whom the corporation or labor 
organization customarily contacts and other representatives of the news 
media upon request; and
    (B) Allowing all representatives of the news media to cover or carry 
the appearance, through the use of pooling arrangements if necessary.
    (3) Phone banks. A corporation or a labor organization may establish 
and operate phone banks to communicate with its restricted class, urging 
them to register and/or vote for a particular candidate or candidates, 
or to register with a particular political party.
    (4) Registration and get-out-the-vote drives. A corporation or a 
labor organization may conduct registration and get-out-the-vote drives 
aimed at its restricted class. Registration and get-out-the-vote drives 
include providing transportation to the place of registration and to the 
polls. Such drives may include communications containing express 
advocacy, such as urging individuals to register with a particular party 
or to vote for a particular candidate or candidates. Information and 
other assistance regarding registering or voting, including 
transportation and other services offered, shall not be withheld

[[Page 161]]

or refused on the basis of support for or opposition to particular 
candidates, or a particular political party.

corporation or labor organization may make only to its restricted class 
are found at 11 CFR 114.3. The activities permitted under paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section may involve election-related coordination with 
candidates and political committees only to the extent permitted by this 
section. See 11 CFR 109.1 and 114.2(c) regarding independent 
expenditures and coordination with candidates. Incorporated membership

Other guests of the corporation who are being honored or speaking or 
participating in the event and representatives of the news media may be

representative is permitted to address or meet employees, all candidates 
for that seat who request to appear must be given a similar opportunity 
to appear;
    (ii) If a Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate or candidate's 
representative is permitted to address or meet employees, all candidates 
for that office who are seeking the nomination or election, and who meet

request to appear must be given a similar opportunity to appear;
    (iii) If representatives of a political party are permitted to 
address or meet employees, representatives of all political parties 
which had a candidate or candidates on the ballot in the last general 
election or which are actively engaged in placing or will have a 
candidate or candidates on the ballot in the next general election and 
who request to appear must be given a similar opportunity to appear;
    (iv) The candidate's representative or party representative (other 
than an officer, director or other representative of a corporation) or 
the candidate, may ask for contributions to his or her campaign or 
party, or ask that contributions to the separate segregated fund of the 
corporation be designated for his or her campaign or party. The 
candidate, candidate's representative or party representative shall not 
accept contributions before, during or after the appearance while at the 
meeting, convention or other function of the corporation, but may leave 
campaign materials or envelopes for members of the audience. A 
corporation, its restricted class, or other employees of the corporation 
or its separate segregated

[[Page 162]]

fund shall not, either orally or in writing, solicit or direct or 
control contributions by members of the audience to any candidate or 
party in conjunction with any appearance by any candidate or party 
representative under this section, and shall not facilitate the making 
of contributions to any such candidate or party (see 11 CFR 114.2(f));
    (v) A corporation or its separate segregated fund shall not, in 
conjunction with any candidate, candidate representative or party 
representative appearance under this section, expressly advocate the 
election or defeat of any clearly identified candidate(s) or candidates 
of a clearly identified political party and shall not promote or 
encourage express advocacy by employees;
    (vi) No candidate, candidate's representative or party 
representative shall be provided with more time or a substantially 
better location than other candidates, candidates' representatives or 
party representatives who appear, unless the corporation is able to 
demonstrate that it is clearly impractical to provide all candidates, 
candidates' representatives and party representatives with similar times 
or locations;
    (vii) Coordination with each candidate, candidate's agent, and 
candidate's authorized committee(s) may include discussions of the 
structure, format and timing of the candidate appearance and the 
candidate's positions on issues, but shall not include discussions of 
the candidate's plans, projects, or needs relating to the campaign; and
    (viii) Representatives of the news media may be allowed to be 
present during a candidate, candidate representative or party 
representative appearance under this section, in accordance with the 
procedures set forth at 11 CFR 114.3(c)(2)(iv).
    (2) Candidate and party appearances on labor organization premises 
or at a meeting, convention or other function. A labor organization may 
permit candidates, candidates' representatives or representatives of 
political parties on the labor organization's premises or at a meeting,

meet its restricted class and other employees of the labor organization, 
and their families, in accordance with the conditions set forth in 
paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (iii), (vi) through (viii), and paragraphs 
(b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Other guests of the labor 
organization who are being honored or speaking or participating in the 
event and representatives of the news media may be present. A labor 
organization may bar all candidates, candidates' representatives and 
representatives of political parties from addressing or meeting its 
restricted class and other employees of the labor organization and their 
families on the labor organization's premises or at any meeting, 
convention or other function of the labor organization.
    (i) The candidate's representative or party representative (other 
than an official, member or employee of a labor organization) or the 
candidate, may ask for contributions to his or her campaign or party, or 
ask that contributions to the separate segregated fund of the labor 
organization be designated for his or her campaign or party. The 
candidate, candidate's representative or party representative shall not 
accept contributions before, during or after the appearance while at the 
meeting, convention or other function of the labor organization, but may 
leave campaign materials or envelopes for members of the audience. No 
official, member, or employee of a labor organization or its separate 
segregated fund shall, either orally or in writing, solicit or direct or 
control contributions by members of the audience to any candidate or 
party representative under this section, and shall not facilitate the 
making of contributions to any such candidate or party. See 11 CFR 
114.2(f).
    (ii) A labor organization or its separate segregated fund shall not, 
in conjunction with any candidate or party representative appearance 
under this section, expressly advocate the election or defeat of any 
clearly identified candidate(s), and shall not promote or encourage

Congress, provided that the voting record and all communications 
distributed with it do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of

more candidates' positions on campaign issues, including voter guides 
obtained from a nonprofit organization which is described in 26 U.S.C.

or labor organization may publicly announce the endorsement and state 
the reasons therefor, in accordance with the conditions set forth in 
paragraphs (c)(6) (i) and (ii) of this section. The Internal Revenue

regarding restrictions or prohibitions on endorsements by nonprofit 
corporations described in 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3).
    (i) The public announcement of the endorsement may be made through a 
press release and press conference. Disbursements for the press release

conference is distributed only to the representatives of the news media 
that the corporation or labor organization customarily contacts when 
issuing non-political press releases or holding press conferences for 
other purposes.
    (ii) The public announcement of the endorsement may not be 
coordinated with the candidate, the candidate's agents or the 
candidate's authorized committee(s).

which such individuals address or meet the institution's academic 
community or the general public (whichever is invited) on the 
educational institution's premises at no charge or at less than the 
usual and normal charge, if:
    (A) The educational institution makes reasonable efforts to ensure 
that the appearances constitute speeches, question and answer sessions, 
or similar communications in an academic setting, and makes reasonable 
efforts to ensure that the appearances are not conducted as campaign 
rallies or events; and

corporation or labor organization.
    (4) These services shall be made available without regard to the 
voter's political preference. Information and other assistance regarding 
registering or voting, including transportation and other services 
offered, shall not be withheld or refused on the basis of support for or 
opposition to particular candidates or a particular political party.
    (5) Individuals conducting the registration or get-out-the-vote 
drive shall not be paid on the basis of the number of individuals 
registered or transported who support one or more particular candidates 
or political party.
    (6) The corporation or labor organization shall notify those 
receiving information or assistance of the requirements of paragraph

<R05>
Sec. 114.5  Separate segregated funds.

    (a) Voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund. (1) A 
separate segregated fund is prohibited from making a contribution or 
expenditure by utilizing money or anything of value secured by physical 
force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat of force, 
job discrimination, or financial reprisal; or by dues, fees, or other

[[Page 166]]

monies required as a condition of membership in a labor organization or 
as a condition of employment or by monies obtained in any commercial 
transaction. For purposes of this section, fees or monies paid as a 
condition of acquiring or retaining membership or employment are monies 
required as a condition of membership or employment even though they are 
refundable upon request of the payor.
    (2) A guideline for contributions may be suggested by a corporation 
or a labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, 
provided that the person soliciting or the solicitation informs the 
persons being solicited--
    (i) That the guidelines are merely suggestions; and
    (ii) That an individual is free to contribute more or less than the 
guidelines suggest and the corporation or labor organization will not 
favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their 
contribution or their decision not to contribute.

A corporation or labor organization or the separate segregated fund of 
either may not enforce any guideline for contributions.
    (3) Any person soliciting an employee or member for a contribution 
to a separate segregated fund must inform such employee or member of the 
political purposes of the fund at the time of the solicitation.
    (4) Any persons soliciting an employee or member for a contribution 
to a separate segregated fund must inform the employee or member at the 
time of such solicitation of his or her right to refuse to so contribute 
without any reprisal.
    (5) Any written solicitation for a contribution to a separate 
segregated fund which is addressed to an employee or member must contain 
statements which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (3) and 
(4) of this section, and if a guideline is suggested, statements which 
comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Use of treasury monies. Corporations, labor organizations, 
membership organizations, cooperatives, or corporations without capital 
stock may use general treasury monies, including monies obtained in 
commercial transactions and dues monies or membership fees, for the 
establishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to its 
separate segregated fund. A corporation, labor organization, membership 
organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may not 
use the establishment, administration, and solicitation process as a 
means of exchanging treasury monies for voluntary contributions.
    (1) A contributor may not be paid for his or her contribution 
through a bonus, expense account, or other form of direct or indirect 
compensation.
    (2) A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, 
cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may, subject to the 
provisions of 39 U.S.C. 3005 and chapter 61, title 18, United States 
Code, utilize a raffle or other fundraising device which involves a 
prize, so long as State law permits and the prize is not 
disproportionately valuable. Dances, parties, and other types of 
entertainment may also be used as fundraising devices. When using 
raffles or entertainment to raise funds, a reasonable practice to follow 
is for the separate segregated fund to reimburse the corporation or 
labor organization for costs which exceed one-third of the money 
contributed.
    (3) If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other 
administrative expense from its own account, which expense could be paid 
for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting 
agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30 
calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated 
fund.
    (c) Membership in separate segregated funds. (1) A separate 
segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, 
membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital 
stock may provide that persons who contribute a certain amount to its 
separate segregated fund will become members of its separate segregated 
fund, so long as--
    (i) The fund accepts contributions of all amounts, subject to the 
limitations of part 110;
    (ii) Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, nothing of 
value may be

[[Page 167]]

given in return for or in the course of membership;
    (iii) The fund may use membership status for intangible privileges 
such as allowing members only to choose the candidates to whom the fund 
will contribute.
    (2) The fact that the separate segregated fund of a corporation, 
labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation 
without capital stock is a membership group does not provide the 
corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, 
or corporation without capital stock with any greater right of 
communication or solicitation than the corporation, labor organization, 
membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital 
stock is otherwise granted under this part.
    (d) Control of funds. A corporation, membership organization, 
cooperative, corporation without capital stock, or labor organization 
may exercise control over its separate segregated fund.
    (e) Disclosure. Separate segregated funds are subject to the 
following disclosure requirements:
    (1) A corporation or labor organization is not required to report 
any payment made or obligation incurred which is not a contribution or 
expenditure, as defined in Sec. 114.1(a), except those reporting 
requirements specifically set forth in this section.
    (2) A membership organization or corporation is not required to 
report the cost of any communication to its members or stockholders or 
executive or administrative personnel, if such membership organization 
or corporation is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing 
the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal 
office, except that--
    (i) The costs incurred by a membership organization, including a 
labor organization, or by a corporation, directly attributable to a 
communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly 
identified candidate (other than a communication primarily devoted to 
subjects other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a 
clearly identified candidate) shall, if those costs exceed $2,000 per 
election, be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.8(b)(4); and
    (ii) The amounts paid or incurred for legal or accounting services 
rendered to or on behalf of a candidate or political committee solely 
for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act or 
chapter 95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 paid by a 
corporation or labor organization which is the regular employer of the 
individual rendering such services, shall be reported in accordance with 
the provisions of part 104.
    (3) A separate segregated fund is subject to all other disclosure 
requirements of political committees as set forth in part 104.
    (f) Contribution limits. Separate segregated funds are subject to 
the contribution limitations for political committees set forth in part 
110. (See particularly Sec. 110.3).
    (g) Solicitations. Except as specifically provided in Secs. 114.6, 
114.7, and 114.8, a corporation and/or its separate segregated fund or a 
labor organization and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the 
following limitations on solicitations:
    (1) A corporation or a separate segregated fund established by a 
corporation is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such fund 
from any person other than its stockholders and their families and its 
executive or administrative personnel and their families. A corporation 
may solicit the executive or administrative personnel of its 
subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates and their families. 
For purposes of this section, the factors set forth at 11 CFR 
100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an organization is an 
affiliate of a corporation.
    (2) A labor organization, or a separate segregated fund established 
by a labor organization is prohibited from soliciting contributions to 
such a fund from any person other than its members and executive or 
administrative personnel, and their families.
    (h) Accidental or inadvertent solicitation. Accidental or 
inadvertent solicitation by a corporation or labor organization, or the 
separate segregated fund of either, of persons apart from and beyond 
those whom it is permitted to solicit will not be deemed a violation, 
provided that such corporation or

[[Page 168]]

labor organization or separate segregated fund has used its best efforts 
to comply with the limitations regarding the persons it may solicit and 
that the method of solicitation is corrected forthwith after the 
discovery of such erroneous solicitation.
    (i) Communications paid for with voluntary contributions. A separate 
segregated fund may, using voluntary contributions, communicate with the 
general public, except that such communications may not solicit 
contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a 
corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, 
or corporation without capital stock, unless such solicitation is 
permitted under paragraph (g) of this section.
    (j) Acceptance of contributions. A separate segregated fund may 
accept contributions from persons otherwise permitted by law to make 
contributions.
    (k) Availability of methods. Any corporation, including its 
subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, that uses a method of 
soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of 
voluntary contributions from its stockholders or executive or 
administrative personnel and their families, shall make that method 
available to a labor organization representing any members working for 
the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates 
for soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of 
voluntary contributions from its members and their families. Such method 
shall be made available on the written request of the labor organization 
and at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the 
expenses incurred thereby. For example--
    (1) If a corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, 
divisions, or affiliates utilizes a payroll deduction plan, check-off 
system, or other plan which deducts contributions from the dividend or 
payroll checks of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, 
the corporation shall, upon written request of the labor organization, 
make that method available to members of the labor organization working 
for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or 
affiliates, who wish to contribute to the separate segregated fund of 
the labor organization representing any members working for the 
corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or 
affiliates. The corporation shall make the payroll deduction plan 
available to the labor organization at a cost sufficient only to 
reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses incurred thereby.
    (2) If a corporation uses a computer for addressing envelopes or 
labels for a solicitation to its stockholders or executive or 
administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request, 
program the computer to enable the labor organization to solicit its 
members. The corporation shall charge the labor organization a cost 
sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses 
incurred in programming the computers and the allocated cost of employee 
time relating to the work, and the materials used.
    (3) If a corporation uses corporate facilities, such as a company 
dining room or cafeteria, for meetings of stockholders or executive or 
administrative personnel at which solicitations are made, the 
corporation shall upon written request of the labor organization allow 
that labor organization to use existing corporate facilities for 
meetings to solicit its members. The labor organization shall be 
required to reimburse the corporation for any actual expenses incurred 
thereby, such as any increase in the overhead to the corporation and any 
cost involved in setting up the facilities.
    (4) If a corporation uses no method to solicit voluntary 
contributions or to facilitate the making of voluntary contributions 
from stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, it is not 
required by law to make any method available to the labor organization 
for its members. The corporation and the labor organization may agree 
upon making any lawful method available even though such agreement is 
not required by the Act.
    (5) The availability of methods of twice yearly solicitations is 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 114.6(e).
    (l) Methods permitted by law to labor organizations. Notwithstanding 
any other law, any method of soliciting voluntary contributions or of 
facilitating

[[Page 169]]

the making of voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund 
established by a corporation, permitted by law to corporations with 
regard to stockholders and executive or administrative personnel, shall 
also be permitted to labor organizations with regard to their members 
and executive or administrative personnel.

    (a) A corporation and/or its separate segregated fund may make a 
total of two written solicitations for contributions to its separate 
segregated fund per calendar year of its employees other than

stockholders and executive or administrative personnel under 
Sec. 114.5(g).
    (b) A labor organization and/or its separate segregated fund may 
make a total of two written solicitations per calendar year of employees 
who are not members of the labor organization, executive or 
administrative personnel, or stockholders (and their families) of a 
corporation in which the labor organization represents members working 
for the corporation. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the number of 
solicitations a labor organization may make of its members under 
Sec. 114.5(g).
    (c) Written solicitation. A solicitation under this section may be 
made only by mail addressed to stockholders, executive or administrative 
personnel, or employees at their residences. All written solicitations 
must inform the recipient--
    (1) Of the existence of the custodial arrangement described 
hereinafter;
    (2) That the corporation, labor organization, or the separate 
segregated fund of either cannot be informed of persons who do not make 
contributions; and
    (3) That persons who, in a calendar year make a single contribution 
of $50 or less, or multiple contributions aggregating $200 or less may 
maintain their anonymity by returning their contributions to the 
custodian.
    (d) The custodial arrangement. In order to maintain the anonymity of 
persons who do not wish to contribute and of persons who wish to respond 
with a single contribution of $50 or less, or multiple contributions 
aggregating $200 or less in a calendar year, and to satisfy the 
recordkeeping provisions, the corporation, labor organization, or 
separate segregated fund of either shall establish a custodial 
arrangement for collecting the contributions under this section.
    (1) The custodian for a separate segregated fund established by a 
corporation shall not be a stockholder, officer, executive or 
administrative personnel, or employee of the corporation, or an officer, 
or employee of its separate segregated fund. The custodian for a 
separate segregated fund established by a labor organization shall not 
be a member, officer or employee of the labor organization or its 
separate segregated fund.
    (2) The custodian shall keep the records of contributions received 
in accordance with the requirements of part 102 and shall also--
    (i) Establish a separate account and deposit contributions in 
accordance with the provisions of part 103;
    (ii) Provide the fund with the identification of any person who 
makes a single contribution of more than $50 and the identification of 
any person who makes multiple contributions aggregating more than $200. 
The custodian must provide this information within a reasonable time 
prior to the reporting date of the fund under part 104;
    (iii) Periodically forward all funds in the separate account, by 
check drawn on that account, to the separate segregated fund; and
    (iv) Treat all funds which appear to be illegal in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 103.3(b).
    (3) The custodian shall not--
    (i) Make the records of persons making a single contribution of $50 
or less, or multiple contributions aggregating

[[Page 170]]

$200 or less, in a calendar year, available to any person other than 
representatives of the Federal Election Commission or the Secretary of 
the Senate, as appropriate, and law enforcement officials or judicial 
bodies.
    (ii) Provide the corporation or labor organization or the separate 
segregated fund of either with any information pertaining to persons 
who, in a calendar year, make a single contribution of $50 or less or 
multiple contributions aggregating $200 or less except that the 
custodian may forward to the corporation, labor organization or separate 
segregated fund of either the total number of contributions received; or
    (iii) Provide the corporation, labor organization, or the separate 
segregated fund of either with any information pertaining to persons who 
have not contributed.
    (4) The corporation, labor organization, or the separate segregated 
fund of either shall provide the custodian with a list of all 
contributions, indicating the contributor's identification and amount 
contributed, which have been made directly to the separate segregated 
fund by any person within the group of persons solicited under this 
section.
    (5) Notwithstanding the prohibitions of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, the custodian may be employed by the separate segregated fund 
as its treasurer and may handle all of its contributions, provided that 
the custodian preserves the anonymity of the contributors as required by 
this section. The custodian shall file the required reports with the 
Federal Election Commission or the Secretary of the Senate, as 
appropriate. A custodian who serves as treasurer is subject to all of 
the duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of a treasurer under the 
Act, and may not participate in the decision making process whereby the 
separate segregated fund makes contributions and expenditures.
    (e) Availability of methods. (1) A corporation or labor organization 
or the separate segregated fund of either may not use a payroll 
deduction plan, a check-off system, or other plan which deducts 
contributions from an employee's paycheck as a method of facilitating 
the making of contributions under this section.
    (2) The twice yearly solicitation may only be used by a corporation 
or labor organization to solicit contributions to its separate 
segregated fund and may not be used for any other purpose.
    (3) A corporation is required to make available to a labor 
organization representing any members working for the corporation or its 
subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates the method which the 
corporation uses to solicit employees under this section during any 
calendar year.
    (i) If the corporation uses a method to solicit any employees under 
this section, the corporation is required to make that method available 
to the labor organization to solicit the employees of the corporation 
who are not represented by that labor organization, and the executive or 
administrative personnel and the stockholders of the corporation and 
their families.
    (ii) If the corporation does not wish to disclose the names and 
addresses of stockholders or employees, the corporation shall make the 
names and addresses of stockholders and employees available to an 
independent mailing service which shall be retained to make the mailing 
for both the corporation and the labor organization for any mailings 
under this section.
    (iii) If the corporation makes no solicitation of employees under 
this section during the calendar year, the corporation is not required 
to make any method or any names and addresses available to any labor 
organization.
    (4) The corporation shall notify the labor organization of its 
intention to make a solicitation under this section during a calendar 
year and of the method it will use, within a reasonable time prior to 
the solicitation, in order to allow the labor organization opportunity 
to make a similar solicitation.

employed at a single corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, 
or affiliates, the labor organizations, either singularly or jointly, 
may not make a combined total of more than two written solicitations per 
calendar year. A

may solicit contributions to the fund from members and executive or 
administrative personnel, and their families, of the organization,

to the separate segregated fund by corporations, national banks, or 
labor organizations which are members of a membership organization, 
cooperative, or corporation without capital stock.
    (c) A trade association whose membership is made up in whole or in 
part of corporations is subject to the provisions of Sec. 114.8 when

member corporations. A trade association which is a membership 
organization may solicit its noncorporate members under the provisions 
of this section.
    (d) The question of whether a professional organization is a 
corporation is determined by the law of the State in which the 
professional organization exists.
    (e) There is no limitation upon the number of times an organization

organization, including a trade association, cooperative, or corporation 
without capital stock may, however, accept unsolicited contributions 
from the separate segregated funds established by its members.
    (k)(1) A federated cooperative as defined in the Agricultural 
Marketing Act of 1929, 12 U.S.C. 1141j, or a rural cooperative eligible

Sec. 114.8  Trade associations.

    (a) Definition. A trade association is generally a membership 
organization of persons engaging in a similar or related line of 
commerce, organized to promote and improve business conditions in that 
line of commerce and not to engage in a regular business of a kind 
ordinarily carried on for profit, and no part of the net earnings of

[[Page 172]]

which inures to the benefit of any member.
    (b) Prohibition. Nothing in this section waives the prohibition on 
contributions by corporations which are members of a trade association.
    (c) Limitations. A trade association or a separate segregated fund 
established by a trade association may solicit contributions from the 
stockholders and executive or administrative personnel of the member 
corporations of such trade association and the families of such 
stockholders and personnel if--
    (1) The member corporation involved has separately and specifically 
approved the solicitations; and
    (2) The member corporation has not approved a solicitation by any 
other trade association for the same calendar year.
    (d) Separate and specific approval. (1) The member corporation must 
knowingly and specifically approve any solicitation for a trade 
association, whether the solicitation is done by the trade association, 
its separate segregated fund, or the corporation or any of its 
personnel, for contributions to the trade association's separate 
segregated fund.
    (2) A copy of each approved request received by a trade association 
or its separate segregated fund shall be maintained by the trade 
association or its fund for three years from the year for which the 
approval is given.
    (3) The request for approval may contain a copy of solicitation 
materials which will be used if approval is granted. Such a mailing must 
specifically indicate the requirement of approval and the limitation of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and approval must be granted to the 
trade association or its separate segregated fund prior to the time any 
solicitation is made of the stockholders or executive or administrative 
personnel by the trade association, its separate segregated fund, or by 
the corporation for contributions to the separate segregated fund of the 
trade association. (The request for approval may be sent to the 
representatives of the corporation with whom the trade association 
normally conducts the association's activities.)
    (4) A separate authorization specifically allowing a trade 
association to solicit its corporate member's stockholders, and 
executive or administrative personnel applies through the calendar year 
for which it is designated. A separate authorization by the corporate 
member must be designated for each year during which the solicitation is 
to occur. This authorization may be requested and may also be received 
prior to the calendar year in which the solicitation is to occur.
    (5) In its request to a member corporation, a trade association may 
indicate that it intends to solicit, for example, a limited class of the 
executive or administrative personnel of the member corporation, or only 
the executive or administrative personnel but not the stockholders of 
the member corporation. Moreover, in its approval, a member corporation 
may similarly limit any solicitation by the trade association or its 
separate segregated fund. In any event, a member corporation, once it 
has approved any solicitation--even to a limited extent--of its 
personnel or stockholders by a trade association or its separate 
segregated fund, is precluded from approving any such solicitation by 
another trade association or its separate segregated fund and the 
corporation and its personnel are precluded from soliciting the 
corporation's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders on 
behalf of another trade association or its separate segregated fund.
    (e) Solicitation. (1) After a trade association has obtained the 
approval required in paragraph (c) of this section, there is no limit on 
the number of times the trade association or its separate segregated 
fund may solicit the persons approved by the member corporation during 
the calendar year to which the approval applies. The member corporation 
may, however, in its approval limit the number of times solicitations 
may be made.
    (2) A member corporation which grants permission to a trade 
association to solicit is in no way restricted in its rights under 
Sec. 114.5(g) to solicit its stockholders or executive or administrative 
personnel and their families for contributions to the corporation's own 
separate segregated fund.

[[Page 173]]

    (3) There is no limitation on the method of soliciting voluntary 
contributions or the method of facilitating the making of voluntary 
contributions which a trade association may use. The member corporation 
may not use a payroll deduction or checkoff system for executive or 
administrative personnel contributing to the separate segregated fund of 
the trade association.
    (4) A trade association and/or its separate segregated fund is 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 114.5(a).
    (f) Solicitation of a subsidiary corporation. If a parent 
corporation is a member of the trade association but its subsidiary is 
not, the trade association or its separate segregated fund may only 
solicit the parent's executive or administrative personnel and their 
families and the parent's stockholders and their families; it may not 
solicit the subsidiary's executive or administrative personnel or 
stockholders or their families. If a subsidiary is a member of the trade 
association but the parent corporation is not, the trade association or 
its separate segregated fund may only solicit the subsidiary's executive 
or administrative personnel and their families and the subsidiary's 
stockholders and their families; it may not solicit the parent's 
executive or administrative personnel or stockholders or their families. 
If both parent and subsidiary are members of the trade association, the 
executive or administrative personnel and their families and the 
stockholders and their families of each may be solicited.
    (g) Federations of trade associations. (1) A federation of trade 
associations is an organization representing trade associations involved 
in the same or allied line of commerce. Such a federation may, subject 
to the following limitations, solicit the members of the federation's 
regional, State or local affiliates or members, provided that all of the 
political committees established, financed, maintained or controlled by 
the federation and its regional, State, or local affiliates or members 
are considered one political committee for the purposes of the 
limitations in Secs. 110.1 and 110.2. The factors set forth at 
Sec. 100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an entity is a 
regional, State or local affiliate of a federation of trade 
associations.
    (i) The federation and its member associations may engage in a joint 
solicitation; or
    (ii) The member association may delegate its solicitation rights to 
the federation.
    (2) A federation is subject to the provisions of this section when 
soliciting the stockholders and executive or administrative personnel of 
the corporate members of its member associations.
    (h) Communications other than solicitations. A trade association may 
make communications, other than solicitations, to its members and their 
families under the provisions of Sec. 114.3. When making communications 
to a member which is a corporation, the trade association may 
communicate with the representatives of the corporation with whom the 
trade association normally conducts the association's activities.
    (i) Trade association employees. (1) A trade association may 
communicate with its executive or administrative personnel and their 
families under the provisions of Sec. 114.3; a trade association may 
communicate with its other employees under the provisions of Sec. 114.4.
    (2) A trade association may solicit its executive or administrative 
personnel and their families under the provisions of Sec. 114.5(g); a 
trade association may solicit its other employees under the provisions 
of Sec. 114.6.

Sec. 114.9  Use of corporate or labor organization facilities and means of transportation.

    (a) Use of corporate facilities for individual volunteer activity by 
stockholders and employees. (1) Stockholders and employees of the 
corporation may, subject to the rules and practices of the corporation, 
make occasional, isolated, or incidental use of the facilities of a 
corporation for individual volunteer activity in connection with a 
Federal election and will be required to reimburse the corporation only 
to the extent that

[[Page 174]]

the overhead or operating costs of the corporation are increased. As 
used in this paragraph, occasional, isolated, or incidental use 
generally means--
    (i) When used by employees during working hours, an amount of 
activity during any particular work period which does not prevent the 
employee from completing the normal amount of work which that employee 
usually carries out during such work period; or
    (ii) When used by stockholders other than employees during the 
working period, such use does not interfere with the corporation in 
carrying out its normal activities; but
    (iii) Any such activity which does not exceed one hour per week or 
four hours per month, regardless of whether the activity is undertaken 
during or after normal working hours, shall be considered as occasional, 
isolated, or incidental use of the corporate facilities.
    (2) A stockholder or employee who makes more than occasional, 
isolated, or incidental use of a corporation's facilities for individual 
volunteer activities in connection with a Federal election is required 
to reimburse the corporation within a commercially reasonable time for 
the normal and usual rental charge, as defined in 11 CFR 
100.7(a)(1)(iii)(B), for the use of such facilities.
    (b) Use of labor organization facilities for individual volunteer 
activity by officials, members and employees. (1) The officials, 
members, and employees of a labor organization may, subject to the rules 
and practices of the labor organization, make occasional, isolated, or 
incidental use of the facilities of a labor organization for individual 
volunteer activity in connection with a Federal election and will be 
required to reimburse the labor organization only to the extent that the 
overhead or operating costs of the labor organization are increased. As 
used in this paragraph, occasional, isolated, or incidental use 
generally means--
    (i) When used by employees during working hours, an amount of 
activity during any particular work period which does not prevent the 
employee from completing the normal amount of work which that employee 
usually carries out during such work period; or
    (ii) When used by members other than employees during the working 
period, such use does not interfere with the labor organization in 
carrying out its normal activities; but
    (iii) Any such activity which does not exceed one hour per week or 
four hours per month, regardless of whether the activity is undertaken 
during or after normal working hours, shall be considered as occasional, 
isolated, or incidental use of the labor organization facilities.
    (2) The officials, members, and employees who make more than 
occasional, isolated, or incidental use of a labor organization's 
facilities for individual volunteer activities in connection with a 
Federal election are required to reimburse the labor organization within 
a commercially reasonable time for the normal and usual rental charge, 
as defined in 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1)(iii)(B), for the use of such 
facilities.
    (c) Use of corporate or labor organization facilities to produce 
materials. Any person who uses the facilities of a corporation or labor 
organization to produce materials in connection with a Federal election 
is required to reimburse the corporation or labor organization within a 
commercially reasonable time for the normal and usual charge for 
producing such materials in the commercial market.
    (d) Use or rental of corporate or labor organization facilities by 
other persons. Persons, other than those specifically mentioned in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, who make any use of corporate or 
labor organization facilities, such as by using telephones or 
typewriters or borrowing office furniture, for activity in connection 
with a Federal election are required to reimburse the corporation or 
labor organization within a commercially reasonable time in the amount 
of the normal and usual rental charge, as defined in 11 CFR 
100.7(a)(1)(iii)(B), for the use of the facilities.
    (e) Use of airplanes and other means of transportation. (1) A 
candidate, candidate's agent, or person traveling on behalf of a 
candidate who uses an airplane which is owned or leased by a corporation 
or labor organization other

[[Page 175]]

than a corporation or labor organization licensed to offer commercial 
services for travel in connection with a Federal election must, in 
advance, reimburse the corporation or labor organization--
    (i) In the case of travel to a city served by regularly scheduled 
commercial service, the first class air fare;
    (ii) In the case of travel to a city not served by a regularly 
scheduled commercial service, the usual charter rate.
    (2) A candidate, candidate's agent, or person traveling on behalf of 
a candidate who uses other means of transportation owned or leased by a 
corporation or labor organization must reimburse, within a commercially 
reasonable time, the corporation or labor organization at the normal and 
usual rental charge.

Sec. 114.11  Employee participation plans.

    (a) A corporation may establish and administer an employee 
participation plan (i.e. a trustee plan) which is a political giving 
program in which a corporation pays the cost of establishing and 
administering separate bank accounts for any employee who wishes to 
participate. The cost of administering and establishing includes the 
payment of costs for a payroll deduction or check-off plan and the cost 
of maintaining the separate bank accounts.
    (1) The employees must exercise complete control and discretion over 
the disbursement of the monies in their accounts.
    (2) The trustee, bank, or other administrator shall not provide the 
corporation or its separate segregated fund any report of the source or 
recipient of any contribution(s) or donation(s) into or out of any 
account or of the amount any employee has in an account.
    (3) The trustee, bank, or other administrator may provide the 
corporation or its separate segregated fund with a periodic report 
limited to information about the total number of employees in the 
program, the total number of funds in all the accounts combined, and the 
total amount of contributions made to all candidates and committees 
combined.

[[Page 177]]

    (4) No stockholder, director, or employee of the corporation or its 
separate segregated fund may exert pressure of any kind to induce 
participation in the program.
    (5) No stockholder, director, or employee of the corporation or its 
separate segregated fund may exercise any direction or control, either 
oral or written, over contributions by participants in the program to 
any candidate, group of candidates, political party, or other person.
    (b) An employee participation plan must be made available to all 
employees including members of a labor organization who are employees of

participation plan subject to the above provisions, except that the cost

Sec. 114.12  Incorporation of political committees; payment of fringe benefits.

    (a) An organization may incorporate and not be subject to the 
provisions of this part if the organization incorporates for liability 
purposes only, and if the organization is a political committee as 
defined in 11 CFR 100.5. Notwithstanding the corporate status of the 
political committee, the treasurer of an incorporated political 
committee remains personally responsible for carrying out their 
respective duties under the Act.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c)(1) A corporation of labor organization may not pay the 
employer's share of the cost of fringe benefits, such as health and life 
insurance and retirement, for employees or members on leave-without-pay 
to participate in political campaigns of Federal candidates. The 
separate segregated fund of a corporation or a labor organization may 
pay the employer's share of fringe benefits, and such payment would be a 
contribution in-kind to the candidate. An employee or member may, out of 
unreimbursed personal funds, assure the continuity of his or her fringe 
benefits during absence from work for political campaigning, and such 
payment would not be a contribution in-kind.
    (2) Service credit for periods of leave-without-pay is not 
considered compensation for purposes of this section if the employer 
normally gives identical treatment to employees placed on leave-without-
pay for nonpolitical purposes.

upon request and on the same terms given to other groups using the 
meeting rooms.

    (d) The basic contractual relationship must be with the United 
States or any department or agency thereof. A person who contracts with 
a State or local jurisdiction or entity other than the United States or 
any department or agency thereof is not subject to this part, even if 
the State or local jurisdiction or entity is funded in whole or in part 
from funds appropriated by the Congress. The third party beneficiary of 
a Federal contract is not subject to the prohibitions of this part.
    (e) The term labor organization has the meaning given it by 
Sec. 114.1(a).

Sec. 116.1  Definitions.

    (a) Terminating committee. For purposes of this part, terminating 
committee means any political committee that is winding down its 
political activities in preparation for filing a termination report, and 
that would be able to terminate under 11 CFR 102.3 except that it has 
outstanding debts or obligations. A political committee will be 
considered to be winding down its political activities if it has ceased 
to make or accept contributions and expenditures, other than 
contributions accepted for debt retirement purposes and expenditures 
representing payments of debts or obligations previously incurred or 
payments for the costs associated with the termination of political 
activity, such as the costs of complying with the post election 
requirements of the Act, if applicable, and other necessary 
administrative costs associated with winding down a campaign or winding 
down committee activities, including office space rental, staff salaries 
and office supplies.
    (b) Ongoing committee. For purposes of this part, ongoing committee 
means any political committee that has not terminated and does not 
qualify as a terminating committee.

means any persons providing goods or services to a candidate or 
political committee whose usual and normal business involves the sale, 
rental, lease or provision of those goods or services.
    (d) Disputed debt. For purposes of this part, disputed debt means an 
actual or potential debt or obligation owed by a political committee, 
including an obligation arising from a written contract, promise or 
agreement to make an expenditure, where there is a bona fide 
disagreement between the creditor and the political committee as to the 
existence or amount of the obligation owed by the political committee.
    (e) Extension of credit. For purposes of this part, extension of 
credit includes but is not limited to:
    (1) Any agreement between the creditor and political committee that 
full payment is not due until after the creditor provides goods or 
services to the political committee;

[[Page 180]]

    (2) Any agreement between the creditor and the political committee 
that the political committee will have additional time to pay the 
creditor beyond the previously agreed to due date; and

<R05>
Sec. 116.2  Debts owed by terminating committees, ongoing committees, and authorized committees.

    (a) Terminating committees. A terminating committee may settle 
outstanding debts provided that the terminating committee files a debt 
settlement plan and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 are satisfied. The 
Commission will review each debt settlement plan filed to determine 
whether or not the terminating committee appears to have complied with 
the requirements set forth in this part, and whether or not the proposed 
debt settlement plan would result in an apparent violation of the Act or 
the Commission's regulations.
    (b) Ongoing committees. Ongoing committees shall not settle any 
outstanding debts for less than the entire amount owed, but may request 
a Commission determination that such debts are not payable under 11 CFR 
116.9, and may resolve disputed debts under 11 CFR 116.10. Creditors may 
forgive debts owed by ongoing committees under the limited circumstances 
provided in 11 CFR 116.8.
    (c) Authorized committees. (1) An authorized committee shall not 
settle any outstanding debts for less than the entire amount owed if any 
other authorized committee of the same candidate has permissible funds 
available to pay part or all of the amount outstanding. Except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(3), of this section, an authorized committee 
shall not terminate under 11 CFR 102.3 if--
    (i) It has any outstanding debts or obligations; or
    (ii) It has any funds or assets available to pay part or all of the 
outstanding debts or obligations owed by another authorized committee of 
the same candidate and that other authorized committee is unable to pay 
such debts or obligations.
    (2) No transfers of funds may be made from a candidate's authorized 
committee to another authorized committee of the same candidate if the 
transferor committee has net debts outstanding at the time of the 
transfer under the formula described in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3)(ii).
    (3) An authorized committee that qualifies as a terminating 
committee may assign debts to another authorized committee of the same 
candidate to the extent permitted under applicable state law provided 
that the authorized committee assigning the debts has no cash on hand or 
assets available to pay any part of the outstanding debts, and provided 
that the authorized committee assigning the debts was not organized to 
further the candidate's campaign in an election not yet held. If a 
Presidential candidate elects to receive federal funds pursuant to 11 
CFR part 9001 et seq. or 11 CFR part 9031 et seq., the authorized 
committee(s) of the Presidential candidate shall not assign debts or 
receive assigned debts until after the authorized committee(s) or the 
Presidential candidate has made all required repayments pursuant to 11 
CFR parts 9007 and 9038 and has paid all civil penalties pursuant to 2 
U.S.C. 437g. An authorized committee that has assigned all its 
outstanding debts may terminate if--
    (i) The authorized committee that has assigned the debts otherwise 
qualifies for termination under 11 CFR 102.3; and
    (ii) The authorized committee that received the assigned debts 
notifies the Commission in writing that it has assumed the obligation to 
pay the entire amount owed and that it has assumed the obligation to 
report the debts, and any contributions received for retirement of the 
assigned debts, in accordance with 11 CFR part 104. The assigned debts 
shall be disclosed on a separate schedule of debts and obligations 
attached to the authorized committee's reports. Contributions received 
for retirement of the assigned debts shall be

[[Page 181]]

disclosed on a separate schedule of receipts attached to the authorized 
committee's reports. See 11 CFR 110.1 (b)(3) and (b)(4) and 110.2 (b)(3) 
and (b)(4). The authorized committee that has assigned the debts shall 
notify each creditor in writing of the assignment no later than thirty 
days before the assignment takes effect and shall include the name and 
address of the authorized committee that will receive the assigned 
debts.


<R05>
Sec. 116.3  Extensions of credit by commercial vendors.

    (a) Unincorporated vendor. A commercial vendor that is not a 
corporation may extend credit to a candidate, a political committee or 
another person on behalf of a candidate or political committee. An 
extension of credit will not be considered a contribution to the 
candidate or political committee provided that the credit is extended in 
the ordinary course of the commercial vendor's business and the terms 
are substantially similar to extensions of credit to nonpolitical 
debtors that are of similar risk and size of obligation.
    (b) Incorporated vendor. A corporation in its capacity as a 
commercial vendor may extend credit to a candidate, a political 
committee or another person on behalf of a candidate or political 
committee provided that the credit is extended in the ordinary course of 
the corporation's business and the terms are substantially similar to 
extensions of credit to nonpolitical debtors that are of similar risk 
and size of obligation.
    (c) Ordinary course of business. In determining whether credit was 
extended in the ordinary course of business, the Commission will 
consider--
    (1) Whether the commercial vendor followed its established 
procedures and its past practice in approving the extension of credit;
    (2) Whether the commercial vendor received prompt payment in full if 
it previously extended credit to the same candidate or political 
committee; and
    (3) Whether the extension of credit conformed to the usual and 
normal practice in the commercial vendor's trade or industry.
    (d) Extension of credit by regulated industries. The Commission may 
rely on the regulations prescribed by the Federal Communications 
Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Department of 
Transportation on behalf of the Civil Aeronautics Board, issued pursuant 
to 2 U.S.C. 451 and any other regulations prescribed by other Federal 
agencies to determine whether extensions of credit by the entities 
regulated by those Federal agencies were made in the ordinary course of 
business.


<R05>
Sec. 116.4  Forgiveness or settlement of debts owed to commercial vendors.

    (a) Unincorporated vendor. A commercial vendor that is not a 
corporation may forgive or settle a debt incurred by a candidate, a 
political committee or another person on behalf of a candidate or 
political committee for less than the entire amount owed on the debt. 
The amount forgiven will not be considered a contribution by the 
commercial vendor to the candidate or political committee if--
    (1) The amount forgiven is exempted from the definition of 
contribution in 11 CFR 100.7(b); or
    (2) The commercial vendor has treated the debt in a commercially 
reasonable manner and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as 
appropriate, are satisfied.
    (b) Incorporated vendor. A corporation may not forgive or settle a 
debt incurred by a candidate, a political committee or another person on 
behalf of a candidate or political committee for less than the entire 
amount owed on the debt unless--
    (1) The amount forgiven is exempted from the definition of 
contribution in 11 CFR 100.7(b); or
    (2) The corporation has treated the debt in a commercially 
reasonable manner and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as 
appropriate, are satisfied.
    (c) Reasonable efforts by a political committee. A debt or 
obligation owed by a candidate or a political committee may be totally 
forgiven (see 11 CFR 116.8), or settled (see 11 CFR 116.7), provided 
that--
    (1) The amount forgiven is exempted from the definition of 
contribution in 11 CFR 100.7(b); or

[[Page 182]]

    (2) The candidate and the political committee have undertaken all 
reasonable efforts to satisfy the outstanding debt and the requirements 
of 11 CFR 116.7 or 116.8, as appropriate, including the submission of 
the information specified in those sections and Commission review, are 
satisfied.
    (d) Commercially reasonable. The Commission will determine that a 
debt settlement between a political committee and a commercial vendor is 
commercially reasonable if--
    (1) The initial extension of credit was made in accordance with 11 
CFR 116.3;
    (2) The candidate or political committee has undertaken all 
reasonable efforts to satisfy the outstanding debt. Such efforts may 
include, but are not limited to, the following--
    (i) Engaging in fundraising efforts;
    (ii) Reducing overhead and administrative costs; and
    (iii) Liquidating assets; and
    (3) The commercial vendor has pursued its remedies as vigorously as 
it would pursue its remedies against a nonpolitical debtor in similar 
circumstances. Such remedies may include, but are not limited to, the 
following--
    (i) Oral and written requests for payment;
    (ii) Withholding delivery of additional goods or services until 
overdue debts are satisfied;
    (iii) Imposition of additional charges or penalties for late 
payment;
    (iv) Referral of overdue debts to a commercial debt collection 
service; and
    (v) Litigation.
    (e) Settlement or forgiveness not required. The provisions of this 
part shall not be construed to require a commercial vendor to forgive or 
settle the debt for less than the entire amount owed.
    (f) Reporting. The political committee shall continue to report the 
debt in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(d) and 104.11 until the Commission 
has completed a review of the debt settlement plan pursuant to 11 CFR 
116.7(f) or until the Commission has completed a review of the request 
to forgive the debt pursuant to 11 CFR 116.8, or until the political 
committee pays the debt, whichever occurs first.


<R05>
Sec. 116.5  Advances by committee staff and other individuals.

    (a) Scope. This section applies to individuals who are not acting as 
commercial vendors. Individuals who are acting as commercial vendors 
shall follow the requirements of 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4.
    (b) Treatment as contributions. The payment by an individual from 
his or her personal funds, including a personal credit card, for the 
costs incurred in providing goods or services to, or obtaining goods or 
services that are used by or on behalf of, a candidate or a political 
committee is a contribution unless the payment is exempted from the 
definition of contribution under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(8). If the payment is 
not exempted under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(8), it shall be considered a 
contribution by the individual unless--
    (1) The payment is for the individual's transportation expenses 
incurred while traveling on behalf of a candidate or political committee 
of a political party or for usual and normal subsistence expenses 
incurred by an individual, other than a volunteer, while traveling on 
behalf of a candidate or political committee of a political party; and
    (2) The individual is reimbursed within sixty days after the closing 
date of the billing statement on which the charges first appear if the 
payment was made using a personal credit card, or within thirty days 
after the date on which the expenses were incurred if a personal credit 
card was not used. For purposes of this section, the closing date shall 
be the date indicated on the billing statement which serves as the 
cutoff date for determining which charges are included on that billing 
statement. In addition, ``subsistence expenses'' include only 
expenditures for personal living expenses related to a particular 
individual traveling on committee business, such as food or lodging.
    (c) Treatment as debts. A political committee shall treat the 
obligation arising from a payment described in paragraph (b) of this 
section as an outstanding debt until reimbursed.

[[Page 183]]

    (d) Settlement or forgiveness of the debt. The individual and the 
political committee may agree to the total forgiveness of the debt (See 
11 CFR 116.8) or a settlement of the debt for less than the entire 
amount owed (See 11 CFR 116.7), provided that the requirements of 11 CFR 
116.7 or 116.8, as appropriate, including the submission of the 
information specified in these sections and Commission review, are 
satisfied. The provisions of this part shall not be construed to require 
the individual to forgive or settle the debt for less than the entire 
amount owed.
    (e) Reporting. The political committee shall continue to report the 
obligation arising from the payment as a debt in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.3(d) and 104.11 until the Commission has completed a review of the 
debt settlement plan pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(f) or until the Commission 
has completed a review of the request to forgive the debt pursuant to 11 
CFR 116.8, or until the political committee pays the debt, whichever

<R05>
Sec. 116.6  Salary payments owed to employees.

    (a) Treatment as debts or volunteer services. If a political 
committee does not pay an employee for services rendered to the 
political committee in accordance with an employment contract or a 
formal or informal agreement to do so, the unpaid amount either may be 
treated as a debt owed by the political committee to the employee or, 
provided that the employee signs a written statement agreeing to be 
considered a volunteer, converted to a volunteer services arrangement 
under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(3). The unpaid amount shall not be treated as a 
contribution under 11 CFR 100.7.
    (b) Settlement or forgiveness of the debt. If the unpaid amount is 
treated as a debt, the employee and the political committee may agree to 
a settlement of the debt for less than the entire amount owed pursuant 
to 11 CFR 116.7. The provisions of this part shall not be construed to 
require the employee to settle the debt for less than the entire amount 
owed.
    (c) Reporting. If the unpaid amount is treated as a debt, the 
political committee shall continue to report the debt in accordance with 
11 CFR 104.3(d) and 104.11 until the Commission has completed a review 
of the debt settlement plan pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(f) or until the 
employee agrees to be considered a volunteer, or until the political 
committee pays the debt, whichever occurs first.


<R05>

    (a) Procedures for filing debt settlement plans. Every terminating

of this section. The terminating committee shall continue to report all 
remaining debts and obligations not included in the debt settlement plan 
in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3 and 104.11.
    (e) Contents of debt settlement plans. (1) The debt settlement plan

of the creditor's other debt settlements involving nonpolitical debtors 
in similar circumstances, if any.
    (2) Each debt settlement plan filed under this section shall include

the Commission may require to review the debt settlement plan. The 
Commission may also require the submission of additional debt settlement 
agreements prior to Commission review of the debt settlement plan.
    (f) Commission review of debt settlement plans. In reviewing the 
debt settlement plan, the Commission will consider--

creditors under this section;
    (2) The amount of each debt that remains unpaid and the length of 
time each debt has been overdue;
    (3) The amount and percentage of each debt that would be forgiven

Sec. 116.8  Creditor forgiveness of debts owed by ongoing committees; Commission review.

    (a) General requirements. A creditor may forgive the outstanding 
balance of a debt owed by an ongoing committee if the creditor and the 
ongoing committee have satisfied the requirements of 11 CFR 116.3 or 
116.5, as appropriate, regarding extensions of credit by commercial 
vendors and advances by committee staff and other individuals, and the 
debt has been outstanding for at least twenty-four months, and--
    (1) The creditor has exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to 
locate the ongoing committee and has been unable to do so; or
    (2) The ongoing committee--
    (i) Does not have sufficient cash on hand to pay the creditor;
    (ii) Has receipts of less than $1000 during the previous twenty-four 
months;
    (iii) Has disbursements of less than $1000 during the previous 
twenty-four months; and
    (iv) Owes debts to other creditors of such magnitude that the 
creditor could reasonably conclude that the ongoing committee will not 
pay this particular debt.
    (b) Procedures for forgiving debts. A creditor that intends to 
forgive a debt owed by an ongoing committee shall notify the Commission 
by letter of its intent. The letter shall demonstrate that the 
requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section are satisfied. 
The letter shall provide the following information--
    (1) The terms of the initial extension of credit and a description 
of the terms under which the creditor has extended credit to 
nonpolitical debtors of similar risk and size of obligation;
    (2) A description of the efforts made by the candidate or the 
ongoing committee to satisfy the debt;
    (3) A description of the remedies pursued by the creditor to obtain 
payment of the debt and a comparison to the remedies customarily pursued 
by the creditor in similar circumstances involving nonpolitical debtors; 
and
    (4) An indication that the creditor has forgiven other debts 
involving nonpolitical debtors in similar circumstances, if any.
    (c) Commission review. Upon the Commission's request, the ongoing 
committee or the creditor shall provide such additional information as 
the Commission may require to review the

[[Page 186]]

creditor's request. The Commission will review each request to forgive a 
debt to determine whether the candidate, the ongoing committee, and the 
creditor have complied with the requirements of 11 CFR part 116, and 
whether or not the forgiveness of the debt would result in an apparent 
violation of the Act or the Commission's regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 116.9  Creditors that cannot be found or that are out of business.

    (a) General requirements. A political committee may request that the 
Commission determine that a debt owed to a creditor is not payable for 
purposes of the Act if the debt has been outstanding for at least 
twenty-four months, and the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section, as appropriate, have been satisfied, and--
    (1) The creditor has gone out of business and no other entity has a 
right to be paid the amount owed; or
    (2) The political committee has exercised reasonable diligence in 
attempting to locate the creditor and has been unable to do so. 
Reasonable diligence in attempting to locate the creditor means the 
political committee has attempted to ascertain the current address and 
telephone number, and has attempted to contact the creditor by 
registered or certified mail, and either in person or by telephone.
    (b) Terminating committees. If the political committee making the 
request is a terminating committee, the terminating committee shall 
include the request in a debt settlement plan filed with the Commission, 
and shall demonstrate that the requirements of 11 CFR 116.3, 116.5 or 
116.6, as appropriate, and 116.9(a) are satisfied. The terminating 
committee shall continue to disclose the debt on its schedules of 
outstanding debts and obligations until the Commission has completed its 
review of the debt settlement plan pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(f) and has 
determined that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act.
    (c) Ongoing committees. If the political committee making the 
request is an ongoing committee, the ongoing committee shall make the 
request in writing and shall demonstrate that the requirements of 11 CFR 
116.3, 116.5 or 116.6, as appropriate, and 116.9(a) are satisfied. The 
Commission will review the request to determine whether the ongoing 
committee and the creditor have complied with the requirements of 11 CFR 
part 116, and to determine whether reporting the debt as not payable 
would result in an apparent violation of the Act or the Commission's 
regulations. The ongoing committee shall continue to disclose the debt 
on its schedules of outstanding debts and obligations until the 
Commission has completed its review of the request and has determined 
that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act.
    (d) Reporting. Upon notification that the Commission has determined 
that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act, the political 
committee may list the debt as not payable on the next due report. 
Notwithstanding 11 CFR 104.11, the debt does not have to be included in 
subsequent reports unless the status of the debt changes. The presence 
of a debt that the Commission has determined is not payable shall not 
bar the political committee from terminating its registration pursuant 
to 11 CFR 102.3.


<R05>
Sec. 116.10  Disputed debts.

    (a) Reporting disputed debts. A political committee shall report a 
disputed debt in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(d) and 104.11 if the 
creditor has provided something of value to the political committee. 
Until the dispute is resolved, the political committee shall disclose on 
the appropriate reports any amounts paid to the creditor, any amount the 
political committee admits it owes and the amount the creditor claims is 
owed. The political committee may also note on the appropriate reports 
that the disclosure of the disputed debt does not constitute an 
admission of liability or a waiver of any claims the political committee 
may have against the creditor. (See also 11 CFR 9035.1(a)(2) regarding 
the effect of disputed debts on a candidate's expenditure limitations 
under 11 CFR part 9035.)
    (b) Disputed debts owed by terminating committees. If a terminating 
committee

[[Page 187]]

and a creditor have been unable to resolve a disputed debt, and the 
terminating committee files a debt settlement plan covering other debts 
or other creditors, the terminating committee shall include in the debt 
settlement plan a brief description as to the nature of the dispute and 
the status of the terminating committee's efforts to resolve the 
dispute. The debt settlement plan need not include a signed affidavit 
from the creditor involved in the dispute pursuant to 11 CFR 
116.7(e)(2).

    (c) The petition may include draft regulatory language that would 
effectuate the petitioner's proposal.
    (d) The Commission may, in its discretion, treat a document that

Commission may consider whether to initiate a rulemaking project 
addressing issues raised in an advisory opinion request submitted under

petition and informing the petitioner of the above actions.
    (b) If the petition does not comply with the requirements of 11 CFR 
200.2(b), the Office of General Counsel may notify the petitioner of the 
nature of any discrepancies.

[[Page 189]]

    (c) If the Commission decides that a Notice of Inquiry, Advance 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or a public hearing on the petition would 
contribute to its determination whether to commence a rulemaking 
proceeding, it will publish an appropriate notice in the Federal 
Register, to advise interested persons and to invite their 
participation.
    (d) The Commission will not consider the merits of the petition 
before the expiration of the comment period on the Notice of 
Availability.
    (e) The Commission will consider all comments filed within the 
comment period prescribed in the relevant Federal Register notice. The

    (a) After considering the comments that have been filed within the 
comment period(s) and any other information relevant to the subject 
matter of the petition, the Commission will decide whether to initiate a 
rulemaking based on the filed petition.
    (b) If the Commission decides not to initiate a rulemaking, it will 
give notice of this action by publishing a Notice of Disposition in the 
Federal Register and sending a letter to the petitioner. The Notice of 
Disposition will include a brief statement of the grounds for the 
Commission's decision, except in an action affirming a prior denial.
    (c) The Commission may reconsider a petition for rulemaking 
previously denied if the petitioner submits a written request for 
reconsideration within 30 calendar days after the date of the denial and 
if, upon the motion of a Commissioner who voted with the majority that 
originally denied the petition, the Commission adopts the motion to 
reconsider by the affirmative vote of four members.


<R05>
Sec. 200.5  Agency considerations.

    The Commission's decision on the petition for rulemaking may 
include, but will not be limited to, the following considerations--
    (a) The Commission's statutory authority;
    (b) Policy considerations;
    (c) The desirability of proceeding on a case-by-case-basis;
    (d) The necessity or desirability of statutory revision;
    (e) Available agency resources.


<R05>
Sec. 200.6  Administrative record.

    (a) The agency record for the petition process consists of the 
following:
    (1) The petition, including all attachments on which it relies, 
filed by the petitioner.
    (2) Written comments on the petition which have been circulated to 
and considered by the Commission, including attachments submitted as a

petition.
    (6) All correspondence between the Commission and the petitioner, 
other commentators and state or federal agencies pertaining to

    Presidential election means the election of Presidential and Vice

Sec. 9002.11  Qualified campaign expense.

    (a) Qualified campaign expense means any expenditure, including a 
purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of 
money or anything of value--
    (1) Incurred to further a candidate's campaign for election to the 
office of President or Vice President of the United States;
    (2) Incurred within the expenditure report period, as defined under 
11 CFR 9002.12, or incurred before the beginning of such period in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9003.4 to the extent such expenditure is for 
property, services or facilities to be used during such period; and
    (3) Neither the incurrence nor the payment of such expenditure 
constitutes a violation of any law of the United States, any law of the 
State in which such expense is incurred or paid, or any regulation 
prescribed under such Federal or State law, except that any State law 
which has been pre-empted by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 
as amended, shall not be considered a State law for purposes of this 
subchapter. An expenditure which constitutes such a violation shall 
nevertheless count against the candidate's expenditure limitation if the 
expenditure meets the conditions set forth at 11 CFR 9002.11(a) (1) and 
(2).

[[Page 194]]

    (b)(1) An expenditure is made to further a Presidential or Vice 
Presidential candidate's campaign if it is incurred by or on behalf of 
such candidate or his or her authorized committee. For purposes of 11 
CFR 9002.11(b)(1), any expenditure incurred by or on behalf of a 
Presidential candidate of a political party will also be considered an 
expenditure to further the campaign of the Vice Presidential candidate 
of that party. Any expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the Vice 
Presidential candidate will also be considered an expenditure to further 
the campaign of the Presidential candidate of that party.
    (2) An expenditure is made on behalf of a candidate if it is made 
by--
    (i) Any authorized committee or any other agent of the candidate for 
the purpose of making an expenditure; or
    (ii) Any person authorized or requested by the candidate, by the 
candidate's authorized committee(s), or by an agent of the candidate or 
his or her authorized committee(s) to make an expenditure; or
    (iii) A committee which has been requested by the candidate, the 
candidate's authorized committee(s), or an agent thereof to make the 
expenditure, even though such committee is not authorized in writing.
    (3) Expenditures that further the election of other candidates for 
any public office shall be allocated in accordance with 11 CFR 106.1(a) 
and will be considered qualified campaign expenses only to the extent 
that they specifically further the election of the candidate for 
President or Vice President. A candidate may make expenditures under 
this section in conjunction with other candidates for any public office, 
but each candidate shall pay his or her proportionate share of the cost 
in accordance with 11 CFR 106.1(a).
    (4) Expenditures by a candidate's authorized committee(s) pursuant 
to 11 CFR 9004.6 for the travel and related ground service costs of 
media shall be qualified campaign expenses. Any reimbursement for travel 
and related services costs received by a candidate's authorized 
committee shall be subject to the provisions of 11 CFR 9004.6.
    (5) Legal and accounting services which are provided solely to 
ensure compliance with 2 U.S.C. 431 et seq. or 26 U.S.C. 9001, et seq. 
shall be qualified campaign expenses which may be paid from payments 
received from the Fund. If federal funds are used to pay for such 
services, the payments will count against the candidate's expenditure 
limitation. Payments for such services may also be made from an account 
established in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3 or may be provided to the 
committee in accordance with 11 CFR 100.7(b)(14) and 100.8(b)(15). If 
payments for such services are made from an account established in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3, the payments do not count against the 
candidate's expenditure limitation. If payments for such services are 
made by a minor or new party candidate from an account containing 
private contributions, the payments do not count against that 
candidate's expenditure limitation. The amount paid by the committee 
shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR part 9006. Amounts paid by 
the regular employer of the person providing such services pursuant to 
11 CFR 100.7(b)(14) and 100.8(b)(15) shall be reported by the recipient 
committee in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(h).
    (c) Except as provided in 11 CFR 9034.4(e), expenditures incurred 
either before the beginning of the expenditure report period or after 
the last day of a candidate's eligibility will be considered qualified 
campaign expenses if they meet the provisions of 11 CFR 9004.4(a). 
Expenditures described under 11 CFR 9004.4(b) will not be considered 
qualified campaign expenses.

the aggregate payments to which the eligible

[[Page 197]]

candidates of a major party are entitled under 11 CFR 9004.1.
    (2) That no contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses have 
been or will be accepted by the candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) except to the extent that the qualified campaign expenses 
incurred exceed the aggregate payments received by such candidate from 
the Fund under 11 CFR 9004.2.
    (c) All candidates. To be eligible to receive any payment under 11 
CFR 9004.2, the Presidential candidate of each major, minor or new party 
shall certify to the Commission, under penalty of perjury, that such 
candidate will not knowingly make expenditures from his or her personal 
funds, or the personal funds of his or her immediate family, in 
connection with his or her campaign for the office of President in 
excess of $50,000 in the aggregate.
    (1) For purposes of this section, the term immediate family means a 
candidate's spouse, and any child, parent, grandparent, brother, half-
brother, sister, or half-sister of the candidate, and the spouses of 
such persons.
    (2) Expenditures from personal funds made under this paragraph shall 
not apply against the expenditure limitations.
    (3) For purposes of this section, the terms personal funds and 
personal funds of his or her immediate family mean:
    (i) Any assets which, under applicable state law, at the time he or 
she became a candidate, the candidate had legal right of access to or 
control over, and with respect to which the candidate had either:

or her spouse as personal funds. The portion of the jointly owned assets 
that shall be considered as personal funds of the candidate shall be 
that portion which is the candidate's share under the instrument(s) of 
conveyance or ownership. If no specific share is indicated by any 
instrument of conveyance or ownership, the value of one-half of the 
property used shall be considered as personal funds of the candidate.
    (4) For purposes of this section, expenditures from personal funds 
made by a candidate of a political party for the office of Vice

    (5) Contributions made by members of a candidate's family from funds 
which do not meet the definition of personal funds under 11 CFR 
9003.2(c)(3) shall not count against such candidate's $50,000

her committee knowingly incurs expenditures in excess of the limitations 
of 11 CFR 110.8(a), the Commission may seek civil penalties under 11 CFR 
part 111 in addition to any repayment determinations made on the basis 
of such excessive expenditures.
    (8) Expenditures made using a credit card for which the candidate is 
jointly or solely liable will count against the limits of this section

not paid by the committee within 60 days after the closing date of the 
billing statement on which the charges first appear. For purposes of 
this section, the ``closing date'' shall be the date indicated on the 
billing statement which serves as the cutoff date for determining which 
charges are included on that billing statement.

    (a) Legal and accounting compliance fund--major party candidates. 
(1) Sources. (i) A major party candidate, or an individual who is 
seeking the nomination of a major party, may accept contributions to a 
legal and accounting compliance fund if such contributions are received 
and disbursed in accordance with this section. A general election legal 
and accounting compliance fund (``GELAC'') may be established by such 
individual prior to being nominated or selected as the candidate of a 
political party for the office of President or Vice President of the 
United States. Before June 1 of the calendar year in which a 
Presidential general election is held, contributions may only be 
deposited in the GELAC if they are made for the primary and exceed the 
contributor's contribution limits for the primary and are lawfully 
redesignated by the contributor for the GELAC pursuant to 11 CFR 110.1.
    (A) All solicitations for contributions to the GELAC shall clearly 
state that Federal law prohibits private contributions from being used 
for the candidate's election and that contributions will be used solely 
for legal and accounting services to ensure compliance with Federal law, 
and shall clearly state how contribution checks should be made payable. 
Contributions shall not be solicited for the GELAC before June 1 of the 
calendar year in which a Presidential general election is held. If the 
candidate does not become the nominee, all contributions accepted for 
the GELAC, including redesignated contributions, shall be refunded 
within sixty (60) days after the candidate's date of ineligibility.
    (B) Contributions to the GELAC shall be subject to the limitations 
and prohibitions of 11 CFR parts 110, 114, and 115.
    (C) Contributions shall be deposited in the GELAC only if they are 
designated in writing for the GELAC, or transferred pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1) (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this section. Any 
contribution which otherwise could be matched pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.2 
shall not be considered designated in writing for the GELAC unless the 
contributor specifically redesignates it for the GELAC or unless it is 
accompanied by a proper designation for the GELAC. Any contribution that 
is designated in writing or redesignated for the GELAC shall not be 
matched pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.2.
    (ii)(A) Contributions made during the matching payment period that 
do not exceed the contributor's limit for the primary election may be 
redesignated for the GELAC and subsequently transferred to the GELAC 
before the nomination only if--
    (1) The contributions represent funds in excess of any amount needed 
to pay remaining primary expenses;
    (2) The contributions have not been submitted for matching;
    (3) The redesignations are received within 60 days of the 
Treasurer's receipt of the contributions; and
    (4) The requirements of 11 CFR 110.1(b) (5) and (l) regarding 
redesignation are satisfied.
    (B) All contributions redesignated and deposited pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall be subject to the 
contribution limitations applicable for the general election pursuant to 
11 CFR 110.1(b)(2)(i).
    (iii) Funds received during the matching payment period that are 
remaining in a candidate's primary election account after the nomination 
may be transferred to the GELAC without regard to the contribution 
limitations of 11 CFR part 110 and used for any purpose permitted under 
this section, only if the funds are in excess of any amount needed to 
pay remaining net outstanding campaign obligations under 11 CFR 
9034.1(b) and any amount

[[Page 199]]

required to be reimbursed to the Presidential Primary Matching Payment 
Account under 11 CFR 9038.2. The excess funds so transferred may include 
contributions made before the beginning of the expenditure report 
period, which contributions do not exceed the contributor's limit for 
the primary election. Such contributions need not be redesignated by the 
contributors for the GELAC.
    (iv) Contributions that are made after the beginning of the 
expenditure report period but which are not designated in writing for 
the GELAC may be redesignated for the GELAC and transferred to the GELAC 
only if--
    (A) The funds are in excess of any amount needed to pay remaining 
net outstanding campaign obligations under 11 CFR 9034.1(b) and any 
amount required to be reimbursed to the Presidential Primary Matching 
Payment Account under 11 CFR 9038.2;
    (B) The contributions have not been submitted for matching; and
    (C) The candidate obtains the contributor's redesignation in 
accordance with 11 CFR 110.1.
    (v) Contributions made with respect to the primary election that 
exceed the contributor's limit for the primary election may be 
redesignated for the GELAC and transferred to the GELAC if the candidate 
obtains the contributor's redesignation for the GELAC in accordance with 
11 CFR 110.1.
    (vi) For purposes of this section, a contribution shall be 
considered to be designated in writing for the GELAC if--
    (A) The contribution is made by check, money order, or other 
negotiable instrument which clearly indicates that it is made with 
respect to the GELAC; or
    (B) The contribution is accompanied by a writing, signed by the 
contributor, which clearly indicates that it is made with respect to the 
GELAC.
    (2) Uses. (i) Contributions to the GELAC shall be used only for the 
following purposes:
    (A) To defray the cost of legal and accounting services provided 
solely to ensure compliance with 2 U.S.C. 431 et seq. and 26 U.S.C. 9001 
et seq. in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section;
    (B) To defray in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section, that portion of expenditures for payroll, overhead, and 
computer services related to ensuring compliance with 2 U.S.C. 431 et 
seq. and 26 U.S.C. 9001 et seq.;
    (C) To defray any civil or criminal penalties imposed pursuant to 2 
U.S.C. 437g or 26 U.S.C. 9012;
    (D) To make repayments under 11 CFR 9007.2;
    (E) To defray the cost of soliciting contributions to the GELAC;
    (F) To defray the cost of producing, delivering and explaining the 
computerized information and materials provided pursuant to 11 CFR 
9003.6 and explaining the operation of the computer system's software;
    (G) To make a loan to an account established pursuant to 11 CFR 
9003.4 to defray qualified campaign expenses incurred prior to the 
expenditure report period or prior to receipt of Federal funds, provided 
that the amounts so loaned are restored to the GELAC; and
    (H) To defray unreimbursed costs incurred in providing 
transportation and services for the Secret Service and national security 
staff pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.6.
    (ii)(A) Expenditures for payroll (including payroll taxes), overhead 
and computer services, a portion of which are related to ensuring 
compliance with Title 2 of the United States Code and Chapter 95 of 
Title 26 of the United States Code, shall be initially paid from the 
candidate's Federal fund account under 11 CFR 9005.2 and may be later 
reimbursed by the compliance fund. For purposes of paragraph 
(a)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a candidate may use contributions to the 
GELAC to reimburse his or her Federal fund account an amount equal to 
10% of the payroll and overhead expenditures of his or her national 
campaign headquarters and state offices.
    (B) Overhead expenditures include, but are not limited to rent, 
utilities, office equipment, furniture, supplies and all telephone 
charges except for telephone charges related to a special use such as 
voter registration and get out the vote efforts.

[[Page 200]]

    (C) If the candidate wishes to claim a larger compliance exemption 
for payroll or overhead expenditures, the candidate shall establish 
allocation percentages for each individual who spends all or a portion 
of his or her time to perform duties which are considered necessary to 
ensure compliance with title 2 of the United States Code or chapter 95 
of title 26 of the United States Code. The candidate shall keep detailed 
records to support the derivation of each percentage. Such records shall 
indicate which duties are considered compliance and the percentage of 
time each person spends on such activity.
    (D) In addition, a candidate may use contributions to the GELAC to 
reimburse his or her Federal fund account an amount equal to 50% of the 
costs (other than payroll) associated with computer services. Such costs 
include but are not limited to rental and maintenance of computer 
equipment, data entry services not performed by committee personnel, and 
related supplies.
    (E) If the candidate wishes to claim a larger compliance exemption 
for costs associated with computer services, the candidate shall 
establish allocation percentages for each computer function that is 
considered necessary, in whole or in part, to ensure compliance with 2 
U.S.C. 431 et seq., and 26 U.S.C. 9001 et seq. The allocation shall be 
based on a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with each 
computer function, such as the costs for data entry services performed 
by persons other than committee personnel and processing time. The 
candidate shall keep detailed records to support such calculations. The 
records shall indicate which computer functions are considered 
compliance-related and shall reflect which costs are associated with 
each computer function.
    (F) The Commission's Financial Control and Compliance Manual for 
General Election Candidates Receiving Public Funding contains some 
accepted alternative allocation methods for determining the amount of 
salaries and overhead expenditures that may be considered exempt 
compliance costs.
    (G) Reimbursement from the GELAC may be made to the separate account 
maintained for federal funds under 11 CFR 9005.2 for legal and 
accounting compliance services disbursements that are initially paid 
from the separate federal funds account. Such reimbursement must be made

Sec. 9004.1  Major parties.

    The eligible candidates of each major party in a Presidential 
election shall be entitled to equal payments under 11 CFR part 9005 in 
an amount which, in the aggregate, shall not exceed $20,000,000 as

110.9(c).


<R05>
Sec. 9004.2  Pre-election payments for minor and new party candidates.

    (a) Candidate of a minor party in the preceding election. An 
eligible candidate of a minor party is entitled to pre-election 
payments:
    (1) If he or she received at least 5% of the total popular vote as 
the candidate of a minor party in the preceding election whether or not 
he or she is the same minor party's candidate in this election.
    (2) In an amount which is equal, in the aggregate, to a 
proportionate share of the amount to which major party candidates are 
entitled under 11 CFR 9004.1.

The aggregate amount received by a minor party candidate shall bear the 
same ratio to the amount received by the major party candidates as the 
number of popular votes received by the minor party Presidential 
candidate in the preceding Presidential election bears to the average 
number of popular votes received by all major party candidates in that 
election.
    (b) Candidate of a minor party in the current election. The eligible 
candidate of a minor party whose candidate for the office of President 
in the preceding election received at least 5% but less than 25% of the 
total popular vote is eligible to receive pre-election payments. The 
amount which a minor party candidate is entitled to receive

[[Page 206]]

under this section shall be computed pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.2(a) based 
on the number of popular votes received by the minor party's candidate 
in the preceding Presidential election; however, the amount to which the 
minor party candidate is entitled under this section shall be reduced by 
the amount to which the minor party's Presidential candidate in this 
election is entitled under 11 CFR 9004.2(a), if any.
    (c) New party candidate. A candidate of a new party who was a 
candidate for the office of President in at least 10 States in the 
preceding election may be eligible to receive pre-election payments if 
he or she received at least 5% but less than 25% of the total popular 
vote in the preceding election. The amount which a new party candidate 
is entitled to receive under this section shall be computed pursuant to 
11 CFR 9004.2(a) based on the number of popular votes received by the 
new party candidate in the preceding election. If a new party candidate 
is entitled to payments under this section, the amount of the 
entitlement shall be reduced by the amount to which the candidate is 
entitled under 11 CFR 9004.2(a), if any.


<R05>
Sec. 9004.3  Post-election payments.

    (a) Minor and new party candidates. Eligible candidates of a minor 
party or of a new party who, as candidates, receive 5 percent or more of 
the total number of popular votes cast for the office of President in 
the election shall be entitled to payments under 11 CFR part 9005 equal, 
in the aggregate, to a proportionate share of the amount allowed for 
major party candidates under 11 CFR 9004.1. The amount to which a minor 
or new party candidate is entitled shall bear the same ratio to the 
amount received by the major party candidates as the number of popular 
votes received by the minor or new party candidate in the Presidential 
election bears to the average number of popular votes received by the 
major party candidates for President in that election.
    (b) Amount of entitlement. The aggregate payments to which an 
eligible candidate shall be entitled shall not exceed an amount equal to 
the lower of:
    (1) The amount of qualified campaign expenses incurred by such 
eligible candidate and his or her authorized committee(s), reduced by 
the amount of contributions which are received to defray qualified 
campaign expenses by such eligible candidate and such committee(s); or
    (2) The aggregate payments to which the eligible candidates of a 
major party are entitled under 11 CFR 9004.1, reduced by the amount of 
contributions received by such eligible candidates and their authorized 
committees to defray qualified campaign expenses in the case of a 
deficiency in the Fund.
    (c) Amount of entitlement limited by pre-election payment. If an 
eligible candidate is entitled to payment under 11 CFR 9004.2, the 
amount allowable to that candidate under this section shall also be 
limited to the amount, if any, by which the entitlement under 11 CFR 
9004.3(a) exceeds the amount of the entitlement under 11 CFR 9004.2.


<R05>
Sec. 9004.4  Use of payments.

    (a) Qualified campaign expenses. An eligible candidate shall use 
payments received under 11 CFR part 9005 only for the following 
purposes:
    (1) To defray qualified campaign expenses;
    (2) To repay loans that meet the requirements of 11 CFR 100.7 (a)(1) 
or (b)(11) or to otherwise restore funds (other than contributions 
received pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3 (b) or (c) and expended to defray 
qualified campaign expenses) used to defray qualified campaign expenses;
    (3) To restore funds expended in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.4 for 
qualified campaign expenses incurred by the candidate prior to the 
beginning of the expenditure report period.
    (4) Winding down costs. The following costs shall be considered 
qualified campaign expenses:
    (i) Costs associated with the termination of the candidate's general 
election campaign such as complying with the post-election requirements

    (ii) Costs associated with the candidate's general election campaign 
and incurred by the candidate prior to the end of the expenditure report 
period for which written arrangement or commitment was made on or before 
the close of the expenditure report period.
    (5) Gifts and monetary bonuses. Gifts and monetary bonuses shall be 
considered qualified campaign expenses, provided that:
    (i) Gifts for committee employees, consultants and volunteers in 
recognition for campaign-related activities or services do not exceed

$20,000; and

examples of disbursements that are not qualified campaign expenses.
    (2) Excessive expenditures. An expenditure which is in excess of any 
of the limitations under 11 CFR 9003.2 shall not be considered a 
qualified campaign expense. The Commission will calculate the amount of 
expenditures attributable to these limitations using the full amounts 
originally charged for goods and services rendered to the committee and 
not the amounts for which such obligations were later settled and paid, 
unless the committee can demonstrate that the lower amount paid reflects 
a reasonable settlement of a bona fide dispute with the creditor.
    (3) Expenditures incurred after the close of the expenditure report 
period. Any expenditures incurred after the close of the expenditure 
report period, as defined in 11 CFR 9002.12, are not qualified campaign 
expenses except to the extent permitted under 11 CFR 9004.4(a)(4).
    (4) Civil or criminal penalties. Civil or criminal penalties paid 
pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act are not qualified campaign 
expenses and cannot be defrayed from payments received under 11 CFR part 
9005. Penalties may be paid from contributions in the candidate's legal 
and accounting compliance fund, in accordance with 11 CFR 
9003.3(a)(2)(i)(C). Additional amounts may be received and expended to 
pay such penalties, if necessary. These funds shall not be considered 
contributions or expenditures but all amounts so received shall be 
subject to the prohibitions of the Act. Amounts received and expended 
under this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR part 104.
    (5) Solicitation expenses. Any expenses incurred by a major party

9005.
    (6) Payments to candidate. Payments made to the candidate by his or 
her committee, other than to reimburse funds advanced by the candidate 
for qualified campaign expenses, are not qualified campaign expenses.

transfers, contributions and loans, to other committees authorized by 
the same candidate for a different election are not qualified campaign 
expenses.
    (8) Lost, misplaced, or stolen items. The cost of lost, misplaced, 
or stolen items may be considered a nonqualified campaign expense. 
Factors considered by the Commission in making this determination shall 
include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that 
it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; 
whether the committee sought or obtained insurance on the items; whether 
the committee filed a police report; the type of equipment involved; and

results in income is permissible, provided that an amount equal to all 
net income derived

[[Page 208]]

from such a use, less Federal, State and local taxes paid on such 
income, shall be paid to the Secretary. Any net loss from an investment

Sec. 9004.6  Expenditures for transportation and services made available to media personnel; reimbursements.

    (a) General. (1) Expenditures by an authorized committee for 
transportation, ground services or facilities (including air travel, 
ground transportation, housing, meals, telephone service, typewriters, 
and computers) provided to media personnel, Secret Service personnel or 
national security staff will be considered qualified campaign expenses, 
and, except for costs relating to Secret Service personnel or national 
security staff, will be subject to the overall expenditure limitations 
of 11 CFR 9003.2(a)(1) and (b)(1).
    (2) Subject to the limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, committees may seek reimbursement from the media for the 
expenses described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and may deduct 
reimbursements received from media representatives from the amount of 
expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation of 11 CFR 
Sec. 9003.2(a)(1) and (b)(1). Expenses for which the committee receives 
no reimbursement will be considered qualified campaign expenses, and, 
with the exception of those expenses relating to Secret Service 
personnel and national security staff, will be subject to the overall 
expenditure limitation.
    (3) Committees may seek reimbursement from the media only for the 
billable items specified in the White House Press Corps Travel Policies 
and Procedures issued by the White House Travel Office.
    (b) Reimbursement limits; billing. (1) The amount of reimbursement 
sought from a media representative under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section shall not exceed 110% of the media representative's pro rata 
share (or a reasonable estimate of the media representative's pro rata 
share) of the actual cost of the transportation and services made 
available. Any reimbursement received in excess of this amount shall be 
disposed of in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a media representative's pro 
rata share shall be calculated by dividing the total actual cost of the 
transportation and services provided by the total number of individuals 
to whom such transportation and services are made available. For 
purposes of this calculation, the total number of individuals shall 
include committee staff, media personnel, Secret Service personnel, 
national security staff and any other individuals to whom such 
transportation and services are made available, except that, when 
seeking reimbursement for transportation costs paid by the committee 
under 11 CFR Sec. 9004.7(b)(5)(i)(C), the total number of individuals 
shall not include national security staff.
    (3) No later than sixty (60) days of the campaign trip or event, the 
committee shall provide each media representative attending the event 
with an itemized bill that specifies the amounts charged for air and 
ground transportation for each segment of the trip, housing, meals, 
telephone service, and other billable items specified in the White House 
Press Corps Travel Policies and Procedures issued by the White House 
Travel Office. Payments shall be due sixty (60) days from the date of 
the bill, unless the media representative disputes the charges.
    (c) Deducation of reimbursements from expenditures subject to the 
overall expenditure limitation. (1) The committee may deduct from the 
amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation:
    (i) The amount of reimbursements received from media representatives 
in payment for the transportation and services described in paragraph 
(a) of this section, up to the actual cost of the transportation and 
services provided to media representatives; and

[[Page 209]]

    (ii) An additional amount of the reimbursements received from media 
representatives, representing the administrative costs incurred by the 
committee in providing these services to the media representative and 
seeking reimbursement for them, equal to:
    (A) Three percent of the actual cost of transportation and services 
provided to the media representatives under this section; or
    (B) An amount in excess of 3% representing the administrative costs 
actually incurred by the committee in providing services to the media 
representatives, provided that the committee is able to document the 
total amount of administrative costs actually incurred.
    (2) For the purpose of this paragraph, ``administrative costs'' 
includes all costs incurred by the committee in making travel 
arrangements and seeking reimbursement, whether these services are 
performed by committee staff or by independent contractors.
    (d) Disposal of excess reimbursements. If the committee receives 
reimbursements in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of 
this section, it shall dispose of the excess amount in the following 
manner:
    (1) Any reimbursement received in excess of 110% of the actual pro 
rata cost of the transportation and services made available to a media 
representative shall be returned to the media representative.
    (2) Any amount in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph 
(c) of this section that is not required to be returned to the media 
representative under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be paid to 
the Treasury.
    (e) Reporting. The total amount paid by an authorized committee for 
the services and facilities described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, plus the administrative costs incurred by the committee in 
providing these services and facilities and seeking reimbursement for 
them, shall be reported as an expenditure in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.3(b)(2)(i). Any reimbursement received by such committee under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 
CFR 104.3(a)(3)(ix).

Sec. 9004.7  Allocation of travel expenditures.

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of 11 CFR 106.3, expenditures for 
travel relating to a Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate's 
campaign by any individual, including a candidate, shall, pursuant to 
the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, be qualified campaign 
expenses and be reported by the candidate's authorized committee(s) as 
expenditures.
    (b)(1) For a trip which is entirely campaign-related, the total cost 
of the trip shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable 
expenditure.
    (2) For a trip which includes campaign-related and non-campaign 
related stops, that portion of the cost of the trip allocable to 
campaign activity shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable 
expenditure. Such portion shall be determined by calculating what the 
trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first 
campaign-related stop and from the stop through each subsequent 
campaign-related stop to the point of origin. If any campaign activity, 
other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall 
be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes soliciting, 
making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the 
election or defeat of the candidate. Other factors, including the 
setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an 
event, and the substance of the remarks or speech made, will also be 
considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.
    (3) For each trip, an itinerary shall be prepared and such itinerary 
shall be made available by the committee for Commission inspection. The 
itinerary shall show the time of arrival and departure and the type of 
events held.
    (4) For trips by government conveyance or by charter, a list of all 
passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers 
are and which are not campaign-related, shall

[[Page 210]]

be made available for Commission inspection. When required to be 
created, a copy of the government's or charter company's official 
manifest shall also be maintained and made available by the committee.
    (5)(i) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government 
airplane for campaign-related travel, the candidate's authorized 
committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal 
to:
    (A) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted first class 
commercial air fare available for the time traveled, in the case of 
travel to a city served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline 
service; or
    (B) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted coach commercial air 
fare available for the time traveled, in the case of travel to a city 
served by regularly scheduled coach airline service, but not regularly 
scheduled first class airline service; or
    (C) In the case of travel to a city not served by a regularly 
scheduled commercial airline service, the commercial charter rate for an 
airplane sufficient in size to accommodate the campaign-related 
travelers, including the candidate, plus the news media and the Secret 
Service.
    (ii) If a government airplane is flown to a campaign-related stop 
where it will pick up passengers, or from a campaign-related stop where 
it left off passengers, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay 
the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the greater of the 
amount billed or the amount required under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this 
section for one passenger.
    (iii) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government 
conveyance, other than an airplane, for campaign-related travel, the 
candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government 
entity an amount equal to the commercial rental rate for a conveyance 
sufficient in size to accommodate the campaign-related travelers, 
including the candidate, plus the news media and the Secret Service.
    (iv) If any individual, including a candidate, uses accommodations, 
including lodging and meeting rooms, during campaign-related travel, and 
the accommodations are paid for by a government entity, the candidate's 
authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an 
amount equal to the usual and normal charge for the accommodations, and 
shall maintain documentation supporting the amount paid.
    (v) For travel by airplane, the committee shall maintain 
documentation of the lowest unrestricted nondiscounted air fare 
available for the time traveled, including the airline, flight number 
and travel service providing that fare or the charter rate, as 
appropriate. For travel by other conveyances, the committee shall 
maintain documentation of the commercial rental rate for a conveyance of 
sufficient size, including the provider of the conveyance and the size, 
model and make of the conveyance.
    (6) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family when 
accompanying the candidate on campaign-related travel may be treated as 
qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures. If the spouse 
or family members conduct campaign-related activities, their travel 
expenses shall be qualified campaign expenses and reportable 
expenditures.
    (7) If any individual, including a candidate, incurs expenses for 
campaign-related travel, other than by use of government conveyance or 
accommodations, an amount equal to that portion of the actual cost of 
the conveyance or accommodations which is allocable to all passengers, 
including the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes shall 
be a qualified campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee 
as an expenditure.
    (i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger 
shall be determined by dividing the total operating cost for the charter 
by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a 
qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure shall be 
calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 
9004.7(b)(2) on the basis of the actual cost per passenger multiplied by 
the number of passengers traveling for campaign purposes.
    (ii) If the trip is by non-charter commercial transportation, the 
actual cost

[[Page 211]]

shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 
9004.7(b)(2) on the basis of the commercial fare. Such actual cost shall 
be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.
    (8) Travel on corporate airplanes and other corporate conveyances is 
governed by 11 CFR 114.9(e).

Sec. 9004.9  Net outstanding qualified campaign expenses.

    (a) Candidates receiving post-election funding. A candidate who is 
eligible to receive post-election payments under 11 CFR 9004.3 shall 
file, no later than 20 calendar days after the date of the election, a 
preliminary statement of that candidate's net outstanding qualified 
campaign expenses. The candidate's net outstanding qualified campaign

    (1) The total of:
    (i) All outstanding obligations for qualified campaign expenses as

    (ii) An estimate of the amount of qualified campaign expenses that 
will be incurred by the end of the expenditure report period; plus

under 11 CFR 9004.4(a)(4), submitted in the format required by paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section; less
    (2) The total of:
    (i) Cash on hand as of the close of business on the day of the

currency; balances on deposit in banks, savings and loan institutions, 
and other depository institutions; traveler's checks; certificates of

fair market value;
    (ii) The fair market value of capital assets and other assets on 
hand; and
    (iii) Amounts owed to the candidate's authorized committee(s) in the 
form of credits, refunds of deposits, returns, receivables, or rebates 
of qualified campaign expenses; or a commercially reasonable amount 
based on the collectibility of those credits, returns, receivables or 
rebates.
    (3) The amount submitted as the total of outstanding campaign 
obligations under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not include any 
accounts payable for non-qualified campaign expenses nor any amounts 
determined or anticipated to be required as a repayment under 11 CFR 
part 9007 or any amounts paid to secure a surety bond under 11 CFR 
9007.5(c).
    (4) The amount submitted as an estimate of necessary winding down 
costs under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section shall be broken down 
by expense category and quarterly or monthly time period. This breakdown 
shall include estimated costs for office space rental, staff salaries, 
legal expenses, accounting expenses, office supplies, equipment rental, 
telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing and 
storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in 
each category from the time the statement is submitted until the 
expected termination of the committee's political activity.
    (b) All candidates. Each candidate, except for individuals who have 
withdrawn pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.8, shall submit a statement of net 
outstanding qualified campaign expenses no later than 30 calendar days 
after the end of the expenditure report period. The statement shall 
contain the information required by 11 CFR 9004.9(a) (1) and (2), except 
that the amount of outstanding obligations under 11 CFR 9004.9(a)(1)(i) 
and the amount of cash on hand, assets and receivables under 11 CFR 
9004.9(a)(2) shall be complete as

[[Page 212]]

of the last day of the expenditure report period.
    (c) Candidates who withdraw. An individual who ceases to be a 
candidate pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.8 shall file a statement of net 
outstanding qualified campaign expenses no later than 30 calendar days 
after he or she ceases to be a candidate. The statement shall contain 
the information required under 11 CFR 9004.9(a) (1) and (2), except that 
the amount of outstanding obligations under 11 CFR 9004.9(a)(1)(i) and 
the amount of cash on hand, assets and receivables under 11 CFR 
9004.9(a)(2) shall be complete as of the day on which the individual 
ceased to be a candidate.
    (d) (1) Capital assets and assets purchased from the primary 
election committee.
    (i) For purposes of this section, the term capital asset means any 
property used in the operation of the campaign whose purchase price 
exceeded $2000 when acquired by the committee. Property that must be 
valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited 
to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use 
in the operation of the candidate's campaign, but does not include 
property defined as ``other assets'' under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section. Capital assets include items such as computer systems and 
telecommunications systems, if the equipment is used together and if the 
total cost of all components that are used together exceeds $2000. A 
list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the committee in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5(d)(1). The fair market value of capital 
assets shall be considered to be 60% of the total original cost of such 
items when acquired, except that items received after the end of the 
expenditure report period must be valued at their fair market value on 
the date acquired. A candidate may claim a lower fair market value for a 
capital asset by listing that capital asset on the statement separately 
and demonstrating, through documentation, the lower fair market value.
    (ii) If capital assets are obtained from the candidate's primary 
election committee, the purchase price shall be considered to be 60% of 
the original cost of such assets to the candidate's primary election 
committee. For purposes of the statement of net outstanding qualified 
campaign expenses filed after the end of the expenditure report period, 
the fair market value of capital assets obtained from the candidate's 
primary election committee shall be considered to be 20% of the original 
cost of such assets to the candidate's primary election committee.
    (iii) Items purchased from the primary election committee that are 
not capital assets, and also are not other assets under paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section, shall be listed on an inventory that states their 
valuation.
    (2) Other assets. The term other assets means any property acquired 
by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for campaign 
loans. ``Other assets'' must be included on the candidate's statement of 
net outstanding qualified campaign expenses if the aggregate value of 
such assets exceeds $5000. The value of ``other assets'' shall be 
determined by the fair market value of each item on the last day of the 
expenditure report period or the day on which the individual ceased to 
be a candidate, whichever is earlier, unless the item is acquired after 
these dates, in which case the item shall be valued on the date it is 
acquired. A list of other assets shall be maintained by the committee in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5(d)(2).
    (e) Collectibility of accounts receivable. If the committee 
determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any 
credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in 
part, the committee shall demonstrate through documentation that the 
determination was commercially reasonable. The documentation shall 
include records showing the original amount of the account receivable, 
copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor 
showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how 
the lesser amount or full write-off was determined.
    (f) Review of candidate statement--(1) General. The Commission will 
review the statement filed by each candidate under this section. The 
Commission may request further information with respect to statements 
filed pursuant to

[[Page 213]]

11 CFR 9004.9(b) during the audit of that candidate's authorized 
committee(s) under 11 CFR part 9007.
    (2) Candidate eligible for post-election funding. (i) If, in 
reviewing the preliminary statement of a candidate eligible to receive 
post-election funding, the Commission receives information indicating 
that substantial assets of that candidate's authorized committee(s) have 
been undervalued or not included in the statement or that the amount of 
outstanding qualified campaign expenses has been otherwise overstated in 
relation to committee assets, the Commission may decide to temporarily 
postpone its certification of funds to that candidate pending a final 
determination of whether the candidate is entitled to all or a portion 
of the funds for which he or she is eligible based on the percentage of 
votes the candidate received in the general election.
    (ii) Initial determination. In making a determination under 11 CFR 
9004.9(f)(2)(i), the Commission will notify the candidate within 10 
business days after its receipt of the statement of its initial 
determination that the candidate is not entitled to receive the full 
amount for which the candidate may be eligible. The notice will give the 
legal and factual reasons for the initial determination and advise the 
candidate of the evidence on which the Commission's initial 
determination is based. The candidate will be given the opportunity to 
revise the statement or to submit, within 10 business days, written 
legal or factual materials to demonstrate that the candidate has net 
outstanding qualified campaign expenses that entitle the candidate to 
post-election funds. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the 
candidate so desires.
    (iii) Final determination. The Commission will consider any written 
legal or factual materials submitted by the candidate before making its 
final determination. A final determination that the candidate is 
entitled to receive only a portion or no post-election funding will be 
accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's 
action. This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons 
underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results 
of any investigation on which the determination is based.
    (iv) If the candidate demonstrates that the amount of outstanding 
qualified campaign expenses still exceeds committee assets, the 
Commission will certify the payment of post-election funds to which the 
candidate is entitled.
    (v) Petitions for rehearing. The candidate may file a petition for 
rehearing of a final determination under this section in accordance with 
11 CFR 9007.5(a).

party candidate, or a major party candidate in the event of a deficiency 
in the payments received from the Fund due to the application of 11 CFR 
9005.2(b), whose outstanding debts exceed the cash on hand after the end 
of the expenditure report period as determined under 11 CFR 9002.12, may 
dispose of assets acquired for fundraising purposes in a sale to a 
wholesaler or other intermediary who will in turn sell such assets to 
the public provided that the sale to the wholesaler or intermediary is 
an arms-length transaction. Sales made under this subsection will not be 
subject to the limitations and prohibitions of title 2, United States 
Code and 11 CFR parts 110 and 114.

candidate of the evidence on which the determination is based. The 
Commission will also notify the candidate that it will deduct a 
percentage of the amount to which the candidate is entitled based on the 
unofficial vote results when the Commission certifies an amount for 
payment to the Secretary. This deduction will be based on the average 
percentage differential between the unofficial and official vote results 
for all candidates who received public funds in the preceding 
Presidential general election.
    (4) The candidate may submit within 15 days after the Commission's 
initial determination written legal or factual materials to demonstrate 
that a redetermination is appropriate. Such materials may be submitted 
by counsel if the candidate so desires.
    (5) The Commission will consider any written legal or factual 
materials timely submitted by the candidate in making its final 
determination. A final determination of certification by the

[[Page 215]]

Commission will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the 
Commission's action. This statement will explain the reasons underlying 
the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any 
investigation on which the determination is based.
    (d) All certifications made by the Commission pursuant to this 
section shall be final and conclusive, except to the extent that they 
are subject to examination and audit by the Commission under 11 CFR part 
9007 and judicial review under 26 U.S.C. 9011.

candidates of a political party, the Secretary shall pay to such 
candidates out of the Fund the amount certified by the Commission. 
Amounts paid to a candidate shall be under the control of that 
candidate.
    (b)(1) If at the time of a certification from the Commission under

an amount which is determined to be necessary to assure that the 
eligible candidates of each political party will receive their pro rata 
share.
    (2) Amounts withheld under 11 CFR 9005.2(b)(1) shall be paid when 
the Secretary determines that there are sufficient monies in the Fund to

establish a separate account for payments from the Fund or may deposit 
such payments with contributions received pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3(b). 
The account(s) shall be maintained at a State bank, federally chartered 
depository institution or other depository institution, the deposits or 
accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.
    (d) No funds other than the payments received from the Treasury, 
reimbursements, or income generated through use of public funds in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9004.5, shall be deposited in the account 
described in 11 CFR 9005.2(c). ``Reimbursements'' shall include, but are 
not limited to, refunds of deposits, vendor refunds, reimbursements for

<R05>
Sec. 9007.1  Audits.

    (a) General. (1) After each Presidential election, the Commission 
will conduct a thorough examination and audit of the receipts, 
disbursements, debts and obligations of each candidate, his or her 
authorized committee(s), and agents of such candidates or committees. 
Such examination and audit will include, but will not be limited to, 
expenditures pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.4 prior to the beginning of the 
expenditure report period, contributions to and expenditures made from 
the legal and accounting compliance fund established under 11 CFR 
9003.3(a), contributions received to supplement any payments received 
from the Fund, and qualified campaign expenses.
    (2) In addition, the Commission may conduct other examinations and 
audits from time to time as it deems necessary to carry out the 
provisions of this subchapter.
    (3) Information obtained pursuant to any audit and examination 
conducted under 11 CFR 9007.1(a) (1) and (2) may be used by the 
Commission as the basis, or partial basis, for its repayment 
determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2.
    (b) Conduct of fieldwork. (1) If the candidate or the candidate's 
authorized committee does not maintain or use any computerized 
information containing the data listed in 11 CFR 9003.6, the Commission 
will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' 
notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit 
and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by 
the committee. If the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee 
maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the data 
listed in 11 CFR 9003.6, the Commission generally will request such 
information prior to commencement of audit fieldwork. Such request will 
be made in writing. The committee shall produce the computerized 
information no later than 15 calendar days after service of such 
request. Upon receipt of the computerized information requested and 
compliance with the technical specifications of 11 CFR 9003.6(b), the 
Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two 
weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the 
audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted

[[Page 217]]

at a site provided by the committee. During or after audit fieldwork, 
the Commission may request additional or updated computerized 
information which expands the coverage dates of computerized information 
previously provided, and which may be used for purposes including, but 
not limited to, updating a statement of net outstanding qualified 
campaign expenses. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may 
also request additional computerized information which was created by or 
becomes available to the committee that is of assistance in the 
Commission's audit. The committee shall produce the additional or 
updated computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after 
service of the Commission's request.
    (i) Office space and records. On the date scheduled for the 
commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) shall provide Commission staff with office space and 
committee records in accordance with the candidate and committee 
agreement under 11 CFR 9003.1(b)(6).
    (ii) Availability of committee personnel. On the date scheduled for 
the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) shall have committee personnel present at the site of the 
fieldwork. Such personnel shall be familiar with the committee's records 
and operation and shall be available to Commission staff to answer 
questions and to aid in locating records.
    (iii) Failure to provide staff, records or office space. If the 
candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) fail to provide adequate 
office space, personnel or committee records, the Commission may seek 
judicial intervention under 2 U.S.C. 437d or 26 U.S.C. 9010(c) to 
enforce the candidate and committee agreement made under 11 CFR 
9003.1(b). Before seeking judicial intervention, the Commission will 
notify the candidate of his or her failure to comply with the agreement 
and will recommend corrective action to bring the candidate into 
compliance. Upon receipt of the Commission's notification, the candidate 
will have ten (10) calendar days in which to take the corrective action 
indicated or to otherwise demonstrate to the Commission in writing that 
he or she is complying with the candidate and committee agreements.
    (iv) If, in the course of the audit process, a dispute arises over 
the documentation sought or other requirements of the candidate 
agreement, the candidate may seek review by the Commission of the issues 
raised. To seek review, the candidate shall submit a written statement 
within 10 days after the disputed Commission staff request is made, 
describing the dispute and indicating the candidate's proposed 
alternative(s).
    (v) If the candidate or his or her authorized committee fails to 
produce particular records, materials, evidence or other information 
requested by the Commission, the Commission may issue an order pursuant 
to 2 U.S.C. 437d(a)(1) or a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum pursuant to 
2 U.S.C. 437d(a)(3). The procedures set forth in 11 CFR 111.11 through 
111.15, as appropriate, shall apply to the production of such records, 
materials, evidence or other information as specified in the order, 
subpoena or subpoena duces tecum.
    (2) Fieldwork will include the following steps designed to keep the 
candidate and committee informed as to the progress of the audit and to 
expedite the process:
    (i) Entrance conference. At the outset of the fieldwork, Commission 
staff will hold an entrance conference, at which the candidate's 
representatives will be advised of the purpose of the audit and the 
general procedures to be followed. Future requirements of the candidate 
and his or her authorized committee, such as possible repayments to the 
United States Treasury, will also be discussed. Committee 
representatives shall provide information and records necessary to 
conduct the audit, and Commission staff will be available to answer 
committee questions.
    (ii) Review of records. During the fieldwork, Commission staff will 
review committee records and may conduct interviews of committee 
personnel. Commission staff will be available to explain aspects of the 
audit and examination as it progresses. Additional meetings between 
Commission staff and committee personnel may be

[[Page 218]]

held from time to time during the fieldwork to discuss possible audit 
findings and to resolve issues arising during the course of the audit.
    (iii) Exit conference. At the conclusion of the fieldwork, 
Commission staff will hold an exit conference to discuss with committee 
representatives the staff's preliminary findings and recommendations 
that the staff anticipates it will present to the Commission for 
approval. Commission staff will advise committee representatives at this 
conference of the committee's opportunity to respond to these 
preliminary findings; the projected timetables regarding the issuance of 
the Preliminary Audit Report, the Audit Report, and any repayment 
determination; the committee's opportunity for an administrative review 
of any repayment determination; and the procedures involved in 
Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2.
    (3) Commission staff may conduct additional fieldwork after the 
completion of the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1(b) (1) 
and (2). Factors that may necessitate such follow-up fieldwork include, 
but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Committee response to audit findings;
    (ii) Financial activity of the committee subsequent to the fieldwork 
conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1(b)(1);
    (iii) Committee responses to Commission repayment determinations 
made under 11 CFR 9007.2.
    (4) The Commission will notify the candidate and his or her 
authorized committee if follow-up fieldwork is necessary. The provisions 
of 11 CFR 9007.1(b) (1) and (2) will apply to any additional fieldwork 
conducted.
    (c) Preliminary Audit Report: Issuance by Commission and committee 
response.
    (1) Commission staff will prepare a written Preliminary Audit 
Report, which will be provided to the committee after it is approved by 
an affirmative vote of four (4) members of the Commission. The 
Preliminary Audit Report may include--
    (i) An evaluation of procedures and systems employed by the 
candidate and committee to comply with applicable provisions of the 
Federal Election Campaign Act, the Presidential Election Campaign Fund 
Act and Commission regulations;
    (ii) The accuracy of statements and reports filed with the 
Commission by the candidate and committee; and
    (iii) Preliminary calculations regarding future repayments to the 
United States Treasury.
    (2) The candidate and his or her authorized committee may submit in 
writing within 60 calendar days after receipt of the Preliminary Audit 
Report, legal and factual materials disputing or commenting on the 
proposed findings contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In 
addition, the committee shall submit any additional documentation 
requested by the Commission. Such materials may be submitted by counsel 
if the candidate so desires.
    (d) Approval and issuance of the audit report. (1) Before voting on 
whether to approve and issue an audit report, the Commission will 
consider any written legal and factual materials timely submitted by the 
candidate or his or her authorized committee in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. The Commission-approved audit report may 
address issues other than those contained in the Preliminary Audit 
Report. In addition, this report will contain a repayment determination 
made by the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(1).
    (2) The audit report may contain issues that warrant referral to the 
Office of General Counsel for possible enforcement proceedings under 2 
U.S.C. 437g and 11 CFR part 111.
    (3) Addenda to the audit report may be approved and issued by the 
Commission from time to time as circumstances warrant and as additional 
information becomes available. Such addenda may be based on follow-up 
fieldwork conducted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and/or 
information ascertained by the Commission in the normal course of 
carrying out its supervisory responsibilities. The procedures set forth 
in paragraphs (c) and (d) (1) and (2) of this section will be followed 
in preparing such addenda. The addenda will be placed on the public 
record as set forth in paragraph (e) of

[[Page 219]]

this section. Such addenda may also include additional repayment 
determination(s).
    (e) Public release of audit report. (1) The Commission will consider 
the audit report in an open session agenda document. The Commission will 
provide the candidate and the committee with copies of any agenda 
document to be considered in an open session 24 hours prior to releasing 
the agenda document to the public.
    (2) Following Commission approval of the audit report, the report 
will be forwarded to the committee and released to the public. The 
Commission will provide the candidate and committee with copies of the 
audit report approved by the Commission 24 hours before releasing the 
report to the public.
    (f)(1) Sampling. In conducting an audit of contributions pursuant to 
this section, the Commission may utilize generally accepted statistical 
sampling techniques to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value 
of related audit findings. A projection of the total amount of 
violations based on apparent violations identified in such a sample may 
become the basis, in whole or in part, of any audit finding.
    (2) A committee in responding to a sample-based finding shall 
respond only to the specific sample items used to make the projection. 
If the committee demonstrates that any apparent errors found among the 
sample items were not errors, the Commission shall make a new projection 
based on the reduced number of errors in the sample.
    (3) Within 30 days of service of the Final Audit Report, the 
committee shall submit a check to the United States Treasury for the 
total amount of any excessive or prohibited contributions not refunded, 
reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner in accordance with 11 
CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) or (3); or take any other action required by the 
Commission with respect to sample-based findings.

<R05>
Sec. 9007.2  Repayments.

    (a) General. (1) A candidate who has received payments from the Fund 
under 11 CFR part 9005 shall pay the United States Treasury any amounts 
which the Commission determines to be repayable under this section. In 
making repayment determinations under this section, the Commission may 
utilize information obtained from audits and examinations conducted 
pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1 or otherwise obtained by the Commission in 
carrying out its responsibilities under this subchapter.
    (2) The Commission will notify the candidate of any repayment 
determinations made under this section as soon as possible, but not 
later than 3 years after the day of the presidential election. The 
Commission's issuance of the audit report to the candidate under 11 CFR 
9007.1(d) will constitute notification for purposes of this section.
    (3) Once the candidate receives notice of the Commission's repayment 
determination under this section, the candidate should give preference 
to the repayment over all other outstanding obligations of his or her 
committee, except for any federal taxes owed by the committee.
    (4) Repayments may be made only from the following sources: personal 
funds of the candidate (without regard to the limitations of 11 CFR 
9003.2(c)), contributions and federal funds in the committee's 
account(s), and any additional funds raised subject to the limitations 
and prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as 
amended.
    (b) Bases for repayment. The Commission may determine that an 
eligible candidate of a political party who has received payments from 
the Fund must repay the United States Treasury under any of the 
circumstances described below.
    (1) Payments in excess of candidate's entitlement. If the Commission 
determines that any portion of the payments made to the candidate was in 
excess of the aggregate payments to which such candidate was entitled, 
it will so notify the candidate, and such candidate shall pay to the 
United States Treasury an amount equal to such portion.
    (2) Use of funds for non-qualified campaign expenses. (i) If the 
Commission determines that any amount of any payment to an eligible 
candidate from the Fund was used for purposes other than those described 
in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A) through (C) of this section, it will notify 
the candidate of the amount so used, and such candidate shall pay to the 
United States Treasury an amount equal to such amount.
    (A) To defray qualified campaign expenses;
    (B) To repay loans, the proceeds of which were used to defray 
qualified campaign expenses; and
    (C) To restore funds (other than contributions which were received 
and expended by minor or new party candidates to defray qualified 
campaign expenses) which were used to defray qualified campaign 
expenses.
    (ii) Examples of Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 
9007.2(b)(2) include, but are not limited to the following:
    (A) Determinations that a candidate, a candidate's authorized 
committee(s) or agent(s) have incurred expenses in excess of the 
aggregate payments to which an eligible major party candidate is 
entitled;
    (B) Determinations that amounts spent by a candidate, a candidate's 
authorized committee(s) or agent(s) from the Fund were not documented in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5;
    (C) Determinations that any portion of the payments made to a 
candidate from the Fund was expended in violation of State or Federal 
law; and
    (D) Determinations that any portion of the payments made to a 
candidate from the Fund was used to defray expenses resulting from a 
violation of State or Federal law, such as the payment of fines or 
penalties.
    (iii) In the case of a candidate who has received contributions 
pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3 (b) or (c), the amount of any repayment sought 
under this section shall bear the same ratio to the total amount 
determined to have been

[[Page 221]]

used for non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of payments 
certified to the candidate from the Fund bears to the total deposits, as 
of December 31 of the Presidential election year. For purposes of this 
section, total deposits means all deposits to all candidate accounts 
minus transfers between accounts, refunds, rebates, reimbursements, 
checks returned for insufficient funds, proceeds of loans and other 
similar amounts.
    (3) Surplus. If the Commission determines that a portion of payments 
from the Fund remains unspent after all qualified campaign expenses have 
been paid, it shall so notify the candidate, and such candidate shall 
pay the United States Treasury that portion of surplus funds.
    (4) Income on investment or other use of payments from the Fund. If 
the Commission determines that a candidate received any income as a 
result of an investment or other use of payments from the fund pursuant 
to 11 CFR 9004.5, it shall so notify the candidate, and such candidate 
shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to the amount 
determined to be income, less any Federal, State or local taxes on such 
income.
    (5) Unlawful acceptance of contributions by an eligible candidate of 
a major party. If the Commission determines that an eligible candidate 
of a major party, the candidate's authorized committee(s) or agent(s) 
accepted contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses (other than 
contributions to make up deficiencies in payments from the Fund, or to 
defray expenses incurred for legal and accounting services in accordance 
with 11 CFR 9003.3(a)), it shall notify the candidate of the amount of 
contributions so accepted, and the candidate shall pay to the United 
States Treasury an amount equal to such amount.
    (c) Repayment determination procedures. The Commission's repayment 
determination will be made in accordance with the procedures set forth 
at paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
    (1) Repayment determination. The Commission will provide the 
candidate with a written notice of its repayment determination(s). This 
notice will be included in the Commission's audit report prepared 
pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1(d) and will set forth the legal and factual 
reasons for such determination(s), as well as the evidence upon which 
any such determination is based. The candidate shall repay to the United 
States Treasury in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the 
amount which the Commission has determined to be repayable.
    (2) Administrative review of repayment determination. If a candidate 
disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s), he or she may 
request an administrative review of the determination(s) as set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
    (i) Submission of written materials. A candidate who disputes the 
Commission's repayment determination(s) shall submit in writing, within 
60 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, legal and 
factual materials demonstrating that no repayment, or a lesser 
repayment, is required. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if 
the candidate so desires. The candidate's failure to timely raise an 
issue in written materials presented pursuant to this paragraph will be 
deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to raise the issue at any 
future stage of proceedings including any petition for review filed 
under 26 U.S.C. 9011(a).
    (ii) Oral hearing. A candidate who submits written materials 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section may at the same time 
request in writing that the Commission provide such candidate with an 
opportunity to address the Commission in open session to demonstrate 
that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. The candidate 
should identify in this request the repayment issues he or she wants to 
address at the oral hearing. If the Commission decides by an affirmative 
vote of four (4) of its members to grant the candidate's request, it 
will inform the candidate of the date and time set for the oral hearing. 
At the date and time set by the Commission, the candidate or candidate's 
designated representative will be allotted an amount of time in which to 
make an oral presentation to the Commission based upon

[[Page 222]]

the legal and factual materials submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of 
this section. The candidate or representative will also have the 
opportunity to answer any questions from individual members of the 
Commission.
    (3) Repayment determination upon review. In deciding whether to 
revise any repayment determination(s) following an administrative review 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Commission will 
consider any submission made under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section 
and any oral hearing conducted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section, and may also consider any new or additional information from 
other sources. A determination following an administrative review that a 
candidate must repay a certain amount will be accompanied by a written 
statement of reasons supporting the Commission's determination(s). This 
statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the 
Commission's determination(s) and will summarize the results of any 
investigation(s) upon which the determination(s) are based.
    (d) Repayment period. (1) Within 90 calendar days of service of the 
notice of the Commission's repayment determination(s), the candidate 
shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the 
Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the 
candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 calendar 
days in which to make repayment.
    (2) If the candidate requests an administrative review of the 
Commission's repayment determination(s) under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the time for repayment will be suspended until the Commission 
has concluded its administrative review of the repayment 
determination(s). Within 30 calendar days after service of the notice of 
the Commission's post-administrative review repayment determination(s), 
the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts 
which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by 
the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 
calendar days in which to make repayment.
    (3) Interest shall be assessed on all repayments made after the 
initial 90-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section or the 30-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section. The amount of interest due shall be the greater of:
    (i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and 
(b); or
    (ii) The amount actually earned on the funds set aside or to be 
repaid under this section.
    (e) Computation of time. The time periods established by this 
section shall be computed in accordance with 11 CFR 111.2.
    (f) Additional repayments. Nothing in this section will prevent the 
Commission from making additional repayment determinations on one or 
more of the bases set forth at 11 CFR 9007.2(b) after it has made a 
repayment determination on any such basis. The Commission may make 
additional repayment determinations where there exist facts not used as 
the basis for any previous determination. Any such additional repayment 
determination will be made in accordance with the provisions of this 
section.
    (g) Newly-discovered assets. If, after any repayment determination 
made under this section, a candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) receives or becomes aware of assets not previously included 
in any statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses 
submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.9, the candidate or his or her 
authorized committee(s) shall promptly notify the Commission of such 
newly-discovered assets. Newly-discovered assets may include refunds, 
rebates, late-arriving receivables, and actual receipts for capital 
assets in excess of the value specified in any previously-submitted 
statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses. Newly-
discovered assets may serve as a basis for additional repayment 
determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2(f).
    (h) Limit on repayment. No repayment shall be required from the 
eligible candidates of a political party under 11 CFR 9007.2 to the 
extent that such repayment, when added to other repayments required from 
such candidates under 11 CFR 9007.2, exceeds the

[[Page 223]]

amount of payments received by such candidates under 11 CFR 9005.2.
    (i) Petitions for rehearing; stays pending appeal. The candidate may 
file a petition for rehearing of a repayment determination in accordance 
with 11 CFR 9007.5(a). The candidate may request a stay of a repayment 
determination in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5(c) pending the 
candidate's appeal of that repayment determination.

<R05>
Sec. 9007.3  Extensions of time.

    (a) It is the policy of the Commission that extensions of time under 
11 CFR part 9007 will not be routinely granted.
    (b) Whenever a candidate has a right or is required to take action 
within a period of time prescribed by 11 CFR part 9007 or by notice 
given thereunder, the candidate may apply in writing to the Commission 
for an extension of time in which to exercise such right or take such 
action. The candidate shall demonstrate in the application for extension 
that good cause exists for his or her request.
    (c) An application for extension of time shall be made at least 7 
calendar days prior to the expiration of the time period for which the 
extension is sought. The Commission may, upon a showing of good cause, 
grant an extension of time to a candidate who has applied for such 
extension in a timely manner. The length of time of any extension 
granted hereunder shall be decided by the Commission and may be less 
than the amount of time sought by the candidate in his or her 
application. If a candidate seeks an extension of any 60-day response 
period under 11 CFR part 9007, the Commission may grant no more than one 
extension to that candidate, which extension shall not exceed 15 days.
    (d) If a candidate fails to seek an extension of time, exercise a 
right or take a required action prior to the expiration of a time period 
prescribed by 11 CFR part 9007, the Commission may, on the candidate's 
showing of excusable neglect:
    (1) Permit such candidate to exercise his or her right(s), or take 
such required action(s) after the expiration of the prescribed time 
period; and
    (2) Take into consideration any information obtained in connection 
with the exercise of any such right or taking of any such action before 
making decisions or determinations under 11 CFR part 9007.

[56 FR 35924, July 29, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 31880, June 16, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 9007.4  Additional audits.

    In accordance with 11 CFR 104.16(c), the Commission, pursuant to 11 
CFR 111.10, may upon affirmative vote of four members conduct an audit 
and field investigation of any committee in any case in which the 
Commission finds reason to believe that a violation of a statute or 
regulation over which the Commission has jurisdiction has occurred or is 
about to occur.


<R05>
Sec. 9007.5  Petitions for rehearing; stays of repayment determinations.

    (a) Petitions for rehearing. (1) Following the Commission's 
repayment determination or a final determination that a candidate is not 
entitled to all or a portion of post-election funding under 11 CFR 
9004.9(f), the candidate may file a petition for rehearing setting forth 
the relief desired and the legal and factual basis in support. To be 
considered by the Commission, petitions for rehearing must:
    (i) Be filed within 20 calendar days following service of the 
Commission's repayment determination or final determination;
    (ii) Raise new questions of law or fact that would materially alter 
the Commission's repayment determination or final determination; and
    (iii) Set forth clear and convincing grounds why such questions were 
not and could not have been presented during the original determination 
process.
    (2) If a candidate files a timely petition under this section 
challenging a Commission repayment determination, the time for repayment 
will be suspended until the Commission serves notice on the candidate of 
its determination on the petition. The time periods for making repayment 
under 11 CFR 9007.2(d) shall apply to any amounts determined to be 
repayable following the Commission's consideration of a petition for 
rehearing under this section.

[[Page 224]]

    (b) Effect of failure to raise issues. The candidate's failure to 
raise an argument in a timely fashion during the original determination 
process or in a petition for rehearing under this section, as 
appropriate, shall be deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to 
present such arguments in any future stage of proceedings including any 
petition for review filed under 26 U.S.C. 9011(a). An issue is not 
timely raised in a petition for rehearing if it could have been raised 
earlier in response to the Commission's original determination.
    (c) Stay of repayment determination pending appeal. (1)(i) The 
candidate may apply to the Commission for a stay of all or a portion of 
the amount determined to be repayable under this section or under 11 CFR 
9007.2 pending the candidate's appeal of that repayment determination 
pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 9011(a). The repayment amount requested to be 
stayed shall not exceed the amount at issue on appeal.
    (ii) A request for a stay shall be made in writing and shall be 
filed within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's decision 
on a petition for rehearing under paragraph (a) of this section or, if 
no petition for rehearing is filed, within 30 calendar days after 
service of the Commission's repayment determination under 11 CFR 
9007.2(c).
    (2) The Commission's approval of a stay request will be conditioned 
upon the candidate's presentation of evidence in the stay request that 
he or she:
    (i) Has placed the entire amount at issue in a separate interest-
bearing account pending the outcome of the appeal and that withdrawals 
from the account may only be made with the joint signatures of the 
candidate or his or her agent and a Commission representative; or
    (ii) Has posted a surety bond guaranteeing payment of the entire 
amount at issue plus interest; or
    (iii) Has met the following criteria:
    (A) He or she will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a 
stay; and, if so, that
    (B) He or she has made a strong showing of the likelihood of success 
on the merits of the judicial action.
    (C) Such relief is consistent with the public interest; and
    (D) No other party interested in the proceedings would be 
substantially harmed by the stay.
    (3) In determining whether the candidate has made a strong showing 
of the likelihood of success on the merits under paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the Commission may consider whether the 
issue on appeal presents a novel or admittedly difficult legal question 
and whether the equities of the case suggest that the status quo should 
be maintained.
    (4) All stays shall require the payment of interest on the amount at 
issue. The amount of interest due shall be calculated from the date 30 
days after service of the Commission's repayment determination under 11 
CFR 9007.2(c)(4) and shall be the greater of:
    (i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and 
(b); or
    (ii) The amount actually earned on the funds set aside under this 
section.

Sec. 9007.6  Stale-dated committee checks.

    If the committee has checks outstanding to creditors or contributors 
that have not been cashed, the committee shall notify the Commission. 
The committee shall inform the Commission of its efforts to locate the 
payees, if such efforts have been necessary, and its efforts to 
encourage the payees to cash the outstanding checks. The committee shall 
also submit a check for the total amount of such outstanding checks, 
payable to the United States Treasury.


<R05>
Sec. 9007.7  Administrative record.

    (a) The Commission's administrative record for final determinations 
under 11 CFR 9004.9 and 9005.1, and for repayment determinations under 
11 CFR 9007.2, consists of all documents and materials submitted to the 
Commission for its consideration in making those determinations. The 
administrative record will include the certification of the Commission's 
vote(s), the audit report that is sent to the committee (for repayment 
determinations), the statement(s) of reasons, and the candidate 
agreement. The committee may include documents or materials in

[[Page 225]]

the administrative record by submitting them within the time periods set 
forth at 11 CFR 9004.9(f)(2)(ii), 9005.1(b)(2), 9005.1(c)(4), 9007.1(c) 
and 9007.2(c)(2), as appropriate.
    (b) The Commission's administrative record for determinations under 
11 CFR 9004.9, 9005.1 and 9007.2 does not include:
    (1) Documents and materials in the files of individual Commissioners 
or employees of the Commission that do not constitute a basis for the 
Commission's decisions because they were not circulated to the 
Commission and were not referenced in documents that were circulated to 
the Commission;
    (2) Transcripts or audio tapes of Commission discussions other than 
transcripts or audio tapes of oral hearings pursuant to 11 CFR 
9007.2(c)(2), although such transcripts or tapes may be made available 
under 11 CFR parts 4 or 5; or
    (3) Documents properly subject to privileges such as an attorney-
client privilege, or items constituting attorney work product.
    (c) The administrative record identified in paragraph (a) of this 
section is the exclusive record for the Commission's determinations 
under 11 CFR 9004.9, 9005.1 and 9007.2

amounts which, in the aggregate, shall not exceed an amount which bears 
the same ratio to the amount which the national committee of a major

popular votes received in the preceding presidential election by that 
minor party's presidential candidate bears to the average number of 
popular votes received in the preceding presidential election by all of 
the major party presidential candidates.
    (c) Limitation on payments. Payments to the national committee of a 
major party or a minor party under 11 CFR 9008.6 from the account

allocated cost of the biographical films or materials used.
    (5) Any investment of public funds or any other use of public funds 
to generate income is permissible only if the income so generated is

nominating convention except that the expenses of a person participating 
in the convention as official personnel of the national party may be 
defrayed with public funds even though that person is simultaneously 
participating as a delegate or candidate to the convention. This part

official party convention activities including but not limited to 
dinners, concerts and receptions, where such activities are paid for 
with public funds.
    (2) Public funds shall not be used to defray any expense the

Sec. 9008.8  Limitation of expenditures.

    (a) National party limitations. (1) Major parties. Except as 
provided by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the national committee of 
a major party may not incur convention expenses with respect to a 
Presidential nominating convention which, in the aggregate, exceed the 
amount to which such committee is entitled under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 
9008.5.
    (2) Minor parties. Except as provided by paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the national committee of a minor party may not incur 
convention expenses with respect to a Presidential nominating convention 
which, in the aggregate, exceed the amount to which the national 
committee of a major party is entitled under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 9008.5.
    (3) Authorization to exceed limitation. The Commission may authorize 
the national committee of a major party or minor party to make 
expenditures for convention expenses, which expenditures exceed the 
limitation established by paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section. This 
authorization shall be based upon a determination by the Commission 
that, due to extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances, the 
expenditures are necessary to assure the effective operation of the 
Presidential nominating convention by the committee. Examples of 
``extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances'' include, but are not 
limited to, a natural disaster or a catastrophic occurrence at the 
convention site. In no case, however, will such authorization entitle a 
national committee to receive public funds greater than the entitlement 
specified under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 9008.5. All private contributions 
received to defray expenditures under this paragraph shall be subject to 
all reporting requirements, limitations (except for limitations imposed 
by paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section) and prohibitions of the 
Federal Election Campaign Act (2 U.S.C. 431 et seq.).
    (b) Payments not subject to limit. (1) Host committee expenditures. 
Expenditures made by the host committee shall not be considered 
expenditures by the national committee and shall not count against the 
expenditure limitations of this section provided the funds are spent in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9008.52.
    (2) Expenditures by government agencies and municipal corporations. 
Expenditures made by government agencies and municipal corporations 
shall not be considered expenditures by the national committee and shall 
not count against the expenditure limitations of this section if the 
funds are spent in accordance with the requirements of 11 CFR 9008.53.
    (3) Expenditures to participate in or attend convention. 
Expenditures made by presidential candidates from campaign accounts, by 
delegates, or by any other individual from his or her personal funds for 
the purpose of attending or participating in the convention or 
convention related activities, including, but not limited to the costs 
of transportation, lodging and meals, or by State or local committees of 
a political party on behalf of such delegates or individuals shall not 
be considered expenditures made by or on behalf of the national party, 
and shall therefore not be subject to the overall expenditure 
limitations of this section.
    (4) Legal and accounting services. (i) The payment of compensation 
to an individual by his or her regular employer for legal and accounting 
services rendered to or on behalf of the national committee shall not be 
considered an expenditure and shall not count against the expenditure 
limitations of this section.
    (ii) The payment by the national committee of compensation to any 
individual for legal and accounting services rendered to or on behalf of 
the national committee in connection with the presidential nominating 
convention or convention-related activities shall not be considered an 
expenditure

[[Page 232]]

and shall not count against the expenditure limitations of this section 
provided that:
    (A) The legal and accounting services relate solely to compliance 
with the Federal Election Campaign Act (2 U.S.C. 431, et seq.) and the 
Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act (26 U.S.C. Chapter 95); and
    (B) The contributions raised to pay for the legal and accounting 
services comply with the limitations and prohibitions of 11 CFR parts 
110, 114 and 115. These contributions, when aggregated with other 
contributions from the same contributor to the political committees 
established and maintained by the national political party, shall not 
exceed $20,000 per person, and $15,000 per multicandidate political 
committee in any calendar year.
    (iii) The convention committee shall report contributions received 
to pay for legal and accounting services on a separate Schedule A, and 
shall report payments for legal and accounting services on a separate 
Schedule B, attached to its reports.
    (5) Computerized information. Payments to defray the costs of 
producing, delivering and explaining the computerized information and 
materials provided pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.10(h), and explaining the 
operation of the computer system's software, shall not be considered 
expenditures and shall not count against the expenditure limitations of 
this section, provided that the contributions raised to pay these 
expenses comply with the limitations and prohibitions of 11 CFR parts 
110, 114 and 115.


<R05>
Sec. 9008.9  Receipt of goods and services from commercial vendors.

    Commercial vendors may sell, lease, rent or provide their goods or 
services to the national committee with respect to a presidential 
nominating convention at reduced or discounted rates, or at no charge, 
provided that the requirements of either paragraph (a), paragraph (b), 
or paragraph (c) of this section are met. For purposes of this section, 
commercial vendor shall have the same meaning as provided in 11 CFR 
116.1(c).
    (a) Standard reductions or discounts. A commercial vendor may 
provide reductions or discounts in the ordinary course of business. A 
reduction or discount shall be considered in the ordinary course of 
business if the commercial vendor has an established practice of 
providing the same reductions or discounts for the same amount of its 
goods or services to non-political clients, or if the reduction or 
discount is consistent with established practice in the commercial 
vendor's trade or industry. Examples of reductions or discounts made in 
the ordinary course of business include standard volume discounts and 
reduced rates for corporate, governmental or preferred customers. 
Reductions or discounts provided under paragraph (a) of this section 
need not be reported.
    (b) Items provided for promotional consideration.
    (1) A commercial vendor may provide goods or services in exchange 
for promotional consideration provided that doing so is in the ordinary 
course of business.
    (2) The provision of goods or services shall be considered in the 
ordinary course of business under this paragraph:
    (i) If the commercial vendor has an established practice of 
providing goods or services on a similar scale and on similar terms to 
non-political clients, or
    (ii) If the terms and conditions under which the goods or services 
are provided are consistent with established practice in the commercial 
vendor's trade or industry in similar circumstances.
    (3) In all cases, the value of the goods or services provided shall 
not exceed the commercial benefit reasonably expected to be derived from 
the unique promotional opportunity presented by the national nominating 
convention.
    (4) The convention committee shall maintain documentation showing: 
the goods or services provided; the date(s) on which the goods or 
services were provided, the terms and conditions of the arrangement; and 
what promotional consideration was provided. In addition, the convention 
committee shall disclose in its report covering the period the goods or 
services are received, in a memo entry, a description of the goods or 
services provided for

[[Page 233]]

promotional consideration, the name and address of the commercial 
vendor, and the dates on which the goods or services were provided 
(e.g., ``Generic Motor Co., Detroit, Michigan--ten automobiles for use 
7/15-7/20, received on 7/14'', or ``Workers Inc., New York, New York--
five temporary secretarial assistants for use 8/1-8/30, received on 8/
1'').
    (c) Items of de minimis value. Commercial vendors (including banks) 
may sell at nominal cost, or provide at no charge, items of de minimis 
value, such as samples, discount coupons, maps, pens, pencils, or other 
items included in tote bags for those attending the convention. The 
items of de minimis value may be distributed by or with the help of 
persons employed by the commercial vendor, or employed by or 
volunteering for the national party or a host committee. The value of 
the items of de minimis value provided under this paragraph need not be 
reported.
    (d) Expenditure Limits. The value of goods or services provided 
pursuant to this section will not count toward the national party's 
expenditure limitation under 11 CFR 9008.8(a).


<R05>
Sec. 9008.10  Documentation of disbursements; net outstanding convention expenses.

    The convention committee must include as part of the evidence of 
convention expenses the following documentation:
    (a) For disbursements in excess of $200 to a payee, either:
    (1) A receipted bill from the payee that states the purpose of the 
disbursement; or
    (2) If such a receipted bill is not available, the following 
documents;
    (i) A canceled check negotiated by the payee; plus
    (ii) One of the following documents generated by the payee--a bill, 
invoice, voucher or contemporaneous memorandum that states the purpose 
of the disbursement;
    (iii) Where the documents specified at paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section are not available, a voucher or contemporaneous memorandum from 
the committee that states the purpose of the disbursement;
    (3) If neither a receipted bill nor the supporting documentation 
specified in paragraph (a)(2) (ii) or (iii) of this section is 
available, a canceled check negotiated by the payee that states the 
purpose of the disbursement.
    (4) Where the supporting documentation required above is not 
available, the committee may present a canceled check and collateral 
evidence to document the convention expense. Such collateral evidence 
may include but is not limited to:
    (i) Evidence demonstrating that the disbursement is part of an 
identifiable program or project which is otherwise sufficiently 
documented, such as a disbursement which is one of a number of 
documented disbursements relating to the operation of a committee 
office;
    (ii) Evidence that the disbursement is covered by a preestablished 
written committee policy, such as a daily travel expense policy.
    (b) For all other disbursements:

and mailing address of the payee and the amount, date and purpose of the 
disbursement; or
    (2) A canceled check which has been negotiated by the payee and 
states the identification of the payee, and the amount and date of the 
disbursement.
    (c) For purposes of this section, payee means the person who 
provides the goods or services to the committee in return for the 
disbursement, except that an individual will be considered a payee under 
this section if he or she receives $2,000 or less advanced for travel 
and/or subsistence and if he or she is the recipient of the goods or 
services purchased.
    (d) For purposes of this section, the term purpose means the full 
name and mailing address of the payee, the date and amount of the 
disbursement, and a brief description of the goods or services 
purchased.
    (e) Upon the request of the Commission the convention committee 
shall supply an explanation of the connection between the disbursement 
and the convention.
    (f) The committee shall retain records with respect to each 
disbursement and receipt, including bank

[[Page 234]]

records, vouchers, worksheets, receipts, bills and accounts, journals, 
ledgers, fundraising solicitation material, accounting systems 
documentation, and any related material documenting campaign receipts 
and disbursements, for a period of three years pursuant to 11 CFR 
102.9(c), and shall present these records to the Commission on request.
    (g) Net outstanding convention expenses. A convention committee that 
is eligible to receive payments under 11 CFR 9008.3 shall file, no later 
than sixty days after the last day of the convention, a statement of 
that committee's net outstanding convention expenses. The convention 
committee shall file a revised statement of net outstanding convention 
expenses which shall reflect the financial position of the convention 
committee as of the end of the ninth month following the last day of the 
convention. The revised statement shall be filed no later than 30 
calendar days after the end of the ninth month following the last day of 
the convention, and shall be accompanied by the interim repayment, if 
required under 11 CFR 9008.12(b)(5)(ii). The committee's net outstanding 
convention expenses under this section equal the difference between 
paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section:
    (1) The total of:
    (i) All outstanding obligations for convention expenses as of 45 
days after the last day of the convention; plus
    (ii) An estimate of the amount of convention expenses that will be 
incurred after the 45th day and before the end of the ninth month 
following the last day of the convention; plus
    (iii) An estimate of necessary winding down costs; less
    (2) The total of:
    (i) Cash on hand as of 45 days after the last day of the convention, 
including: all receipts dated on or before that date; currency; balances 
on deposit in banks, savings and loan institutions, and other depository 
institutions; traveler's checks; certificates of deposit; treasury 
bills; and any other committee investments valued at fair market value;
    (ii) The fair market value of capital assets and other assets on 
hand; and
    (iii) Amounts owed to the committee in the form of credits, refunds 
of deposits, returns, receivables, or rebates of convention expenses; or 
a commercially reasonable amount based on the collectibility of those 
credits, returns, receivables or rebates.
    (3) The amount submitted as the total of outstanding convention 
obligations under paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall not include any 
accounts payable for non-convention expenses nor any amounts determined 
or anticipated to be required as a repayment under 11 CFR 9008.12 or any 
amounts paid to secure a surety bond under 11 CFR 9008.14(c).
    (4) Capital assets. For purposes of this section, the term capital 
asset means any property used in the operation of the convention whose 
purchase price exceeded $2000 when acquired by the committee. Property 
that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but 
is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles and fixtures 
acquired for use in the operation of the convention, but does not 
include property defined as ``other assets'' under 11 CFR 9008.10(g)(5). 
A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the committee, which 
shall include a brief description of each capital asset, the purchase 
price, the date it was acquired, the method of disposition and the 
amount received in disposition. The fair market value of capital assets 
may be considered to be the total original cost of such items when 
acquired less 40%, to account for depreciation. If the committee wishes 
to claim a higher depreciation percentage for an item, it must list that 
capital asset on the statement separately and demonstrate, through 
documentation, the fair market value of each such asset.
    (5) Other assets. The term other assets means any property acquired 
by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for loans. 
``Other assets'' must be included on the committee's statement of net 
outstanding convention expenses if the aggregate value of such assets 
exceeds $5000. The value of ``other assets'' shall be determined by the 
fair market value of each item as of 45 days after the last day of the 
convention, unless the item is acquired after this date, in which case 
the item

[[Page 235]]

shall be valued on the date it is acquired. A list of other assets shall 
be maintained by the committee, which shall include a brief description 
of each such asset, the fair market value of each asset, the method of 
disposition and the amount received in disposition.
    (6) Collectibility of accounts receivable. If the committee 
determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any 
credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in 
part, the committee shall demonstrate through documentation that the 
determination was commercially reasonable. The documentation shall 
include records showing the original amount of the account receivable, 
copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor 
showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how 
the lesser amount or full write-off was determined.
    (7) Winding down costs. The term winding down costs means:
    (i) Costs associated with the termination of the convention such as 
complying with the post-convention requirements of the Act and other 
necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the 
convention, including office space rental, staff salaries and office 
supplies; and
    (ii) Costs incurred by the convention committee prior to 45 days 
after the last day of the convention for which written arrangements or 
commitment was made on or before that date.
    (8) Review of convention committee statement. The Commission will 
review the statement filed by each convention committee under this 
section. The Commission may request further information with respect to 
statements filed pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.10 during the audit of that 
committee under 11 CFR 9008.11.
    (h) Production of computer information--(1) Categories of 
computerized information to be provided. If the convention committee 
maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the 
categories of data listed in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(iv) of 
this section, the committee shall provide computerized magnetic media, 
such as magnetic tapes or magnetic diskettes, containing the 
computerized information at the times specified in paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section:
    (i) Information required by law to be maintained regarding the 
committee's receipts or disbursements;
    (ii) Records used to reconcile bank statements;
    (iii) Records relating to the acquisition, use and disposition of 
capital assets; and
    (iv) Any other information that may be used during the Commission's 
audit to review the committee's receipts, disbursements, loans, debts, 
obligations, or bank reconciliations.
    (2) Time for Production. If the committee maintains or uses 
computerized information containing any of the data listed in paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section, the Commission generally will request such 
information prior to commencement of audit fieldwork. Such request will 
be made in writing. The committee shall produce the computerized 
information no later than 15 calendar days after service of such 
request. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may request 
additional or updated computerized information which expands the 
coverage dates of computerized information previously provided. During 
or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may also request additional 
computerized information which was created by or becomes available to 
the committee that is of assistance in the Commission's audit. The 
committee shall produce the additional or updated computerized 
information no later than 15 calendar days after service of the 
Commission's request.
    (3) Organization of computerized information and technical 
specifications. The computerized magnetic media shall be prepared and 
delivered at the committee's expense and shall conform to the technical 
specifications, including file requirements, described in the Federal 
Election Commission's Computerized Magnetic Media Requirements for Title 
26 Candidates/Committees Receiving Federal Funding. The data contained 
in the computerized magnetic media provided to the Commission shall be 
organized in the order specified by the Computerized Magnetic Media 
Requirements.

[[Page 236]]

    (4) Additional materials and assistance. Upon request, the committee 
shall produce documentation explaining the computer system's software 
capabilities, such as user guides, technical manuals, formats, layouts 
and other materials for processing and analyzing the information 
request. Upon request, the committee shall also make available such 
personnel as are necessary to explain the operation of the computer 
system's software and the computerized information prepared or 
maintained by the committee.


<R05>
Sec. 9008.11  Examinations and audits.

    The Commission shall conduct an examination and audit of the 
convention committee no later than December 31 of the calendar year of 
the convention and may at any time conduct other examinations and audits 
as it deems necessary. The Commission will follow the same procedures 
during the audit, and will afford the committee the same right to 
respond, as are provided for audits of publicly funded candidates under 
11 CFR 9007.1 and 9038.1.


<R05>
Sec. 9008.12  Repayments.

    (a) General. (1) A national committee that has received payments 
from the Fund under 11 CFR part 9008 shall pay the United States 
Treasury any amounts which the Commission determines to be repayable 
under this section. In making repayment determinations under this 
section, the Commission may utilize information obtained from audits and 
examinations conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.11 or otherwise obtained 
by the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under this 
subchapter.
    (2) The Commission will notify the committee of any repayment 
determinations made under this section as soon as possible, but not 
later than 3 years after the last day of the Presidential nominating 
convention. The Commission's issuance of an audit report to the 
committee will constitute notification for purposes of the three year 
period.
    (3) Once the committee receives notice of the Commission's final 
repayment determination under this section, the committee should give 
preference to the repayment over all other outstanding obligations of 
the committee, except for any federal taxes owed by the committee.
    (b) Bases for repayment. The Commission may determine that the 
national committee of a political party that has received payments from 
the Fund must repay the United States Treasury under any of the 
circumstances described below.
    (1) Excess payments. If the Commission determines that any portion 
of the payments to the national committee or convention committee under 
11 CFR 9008.6(b) was in excess of the aggregate payments to which the 
national committee was entitled under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 9008.5, it shall 
so notify the national committee, and the national committee shall pay 
to the Secretary an amount equal to such portion.
    (2) Excessive expenditures. If the Commission determines that the 
national committee or convention committee incurred convention expenses 
in excess of the limitations under 11 CFR 9008.8(a), it shall notify the 
national committee of the amount of such excessive expenditures, and the 
national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the 
amount specified.
    (3) Excessive contributions. If the Commission determines that the 
national committee accepted contributions to defray convention expenses 
which, when added to the amount of payments received, exceeds the 
expenditure limitation of such party, it shall notify the national 
committee of the amount of the contributions so accepted, and the 
national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the 
amount specified.
    (4) Improper usage or documentation. If the Commission determines 
that any amount of any payment to the national committee or convention 
committee under 11 CFR 9008.6(b) was used for any purposes other than 
the purposes authorized at 11 CFR 9008.7 or was not documented in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9008.10, it shall notify the national committee 
of the amount improperly used or documented and the national committee 
shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount specified.

[[Page 237]]

    (5) Unspent funds. (i) If any portion of the payment under 11 CFR 
9008.4 remains unspent after all convention expenses have been paid, 
that portion shall be returned to the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (ii) The national committee or convention committee shall make an 
interim repayment of unspent funds based on the financial position of 
the committee as of the end of the ninth month following the last day of 
the convention, allowing for a reasonable amount as determined by the 
Commission to be withheld for unanticipated contingencies. The interim 
repayment shall be made no later than 30 calendar days after the end of 
the ninth month following the last day of the convention. If, after 
written request by the national committee or convention committee, the 
Commission determines, upon review of evidence presented by either 
committee, that amounts previously refunded are needed to defray 
convention expenses, the Commission shall certify such amount for 
payment.
    (iii) All unspent funds shall be repaid to the U.S. Treasury no 
later than 24 months after the last day of the convention, unless the 
national committee has been granted an extension of time. The Commission 
may grant any extension of time it deems appropriate upon request of the 
national committee.
    (6) Income on investments of payments from the Fund. If the 
Commission determines that the national committee or the convention 
committee received any income as a result of investment or other use of 
payments from the Fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.7(a)(5), it shall so 
notify the committee and the committee shall pay to the United States 
Treasury an amount equal to the amount determined to be income, less any 
Federal, State or local taxes on such income.
    (7) The Commission may seek repayment, or may initiate an 
enforcement action, if the convention committee knowingly helps, assists 
or participates in the making of a convention expenditure by the host 
committee, government agency or municipal corporation which is not in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9008.52 or 9008.53, or the acceptance of a 
contribution by the host committee or government agency or municipal 
corporation from an impermissible source, such as a nonlocal business.
    (c) Repayment determination procedures. The Commission will follow 
the same repayment determination procedures, and the committee has the 
same rights and obligations as are provided for repayment determinations 
involving publicly funded candidates under 11 CFR 9007.2 (c) through 
(h).

<R05>
Sec. 9008.15  Extensions of time.

    (a) It is the policy of the Commission that extensions of time under 
11 CFR part 9008 will not be routinely granted.
    (b) Whenever a committee has a right or is required to take action 
within a period of time prescribed by 11 CFR part 9008 or by notice 
given thereunder, the committee may apply in writing to the Commission 
for an extension of time in which to exercise such right or take such 
action. The committee shall demonstrate in the application for extension 
that good cause exists for its request.
    (c) An application for extension of time shall be made at least 7 
calendar days prior to the expiration of the time

[[Page 238]]

period for which the extension is sought. The Commission may, upon a 
showing of good cause, grant an extension of time to a committee that 
has applied for such extension in a timely manner. The length of time of 
any extension granted hereunder shall be decided by the Commission and 
may be less than the amount of time sought by the committee in its 
application.
    (d) If a committee fails to seek an extension of time, exercise a 
right or take a required action prior to the expiration of a time period 
prescribed by 11 CFR part 9008, the Commission may, on the committee's 
showing of excusable neglect:
    (1) Permit such committee to exercise its right(s), or take such 
required action(s) after the expiration of the prescribed time period; 
and
    (2) Take into consideration any information obtained in connection 
with the exercise of any such right or taking of any such action before 
making decisions or determinations under 11 CFR part 9008.


<R05>
Sec. 9008.16  Stale-dated committee checks.

been necessary, and its efforts to encourage the payees to cash the 
outstanding checks. The committee shall also submit a check for the 
total amount of such outstanding checks, payable to the United States 
Treasury.

Sec. 9033.2  Candidate and committee certifications; threshold submission.

    (a) General. (1) A candidate seeking to become eligible to receive 
Presidential

[[Page 247]]

primary matching fund payments shall make the certifications set forth 
in 11 CFR 9033.2(b) to the Commission in a written statement signed by 
the candidate. The candidate may submit the letter containing the 
required certifications at any time after January 1 of the year 
immediately preceding the Presidential election year.
    (2) The Commission will not consider a candidate's threshold 
submission until the candidate has submitted candidate certifications 
that meet the requirements of this section.
    (b) Certifications. (1) The candidate shall certify that he or she 
is seeking nomination by a political party to the Office of President in 
more than one State. For purposes of this section, in order for a 
candidate to be deemed to be seeking nomination by a political party to 
the office of President, the party whose nomination the candidate seeks 
must have a procedure for holding a primary election, as defined in 11 
CFR 9032.7, for nomination to that office. For purposes of this section, 
the term political party means an association, committee or organization 
which nominates an individual for election to the office of President. 
The fact that an association, committee or organization qualifies as a 
political party under this section does not affect the party's status as 
a national political party for purposes of 2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(1)(B) and 
441a(a)(2)(B).
    (2) The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) shall 
certify that they have not incurred and will not incur expenditures in 
connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination, which 
expenditures are in excess of the limitations under 11 CFR part 9035.
    (3) The candidate and the candidate's authorized committee(s) shall 
certify:
    (i) That they have received matchable contributions totaling more 
than $5,000 in each of at least 20 States; and
    (ii) That the matchable contributions are from individuals who are 
residents of the State for which their contributions are submitted.
    (iii) A maximum of $250 of each individual's aggregate contributions 
will be considered as matchable contributions for the purpose of meeting 
the thresholds of this section.
    (iv) For purposes of this section, contributions of an individual 
who maintains residences in more than one State may only be counted 
toward the $5,000 threshold for the State from which the earliest 
contribution was made by that contributor.
    (c) Threshold submission. To become eligible to receive matching 
payments, the candidate shall submit documentation of the contributions 
described in 11 CFR 9033.2(b)(3) to the Commission for review. The 
submission shall follow the format and requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1.


<R05>
Sec. 9033.3  Expenditure limitation certification.

    (a) If the Commission makes an initial determination that a 
candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) have knowingly and 
substantially exceeded the expenditure limitations at 11 CFR part 9035 
prior to that candidate's application for certification, the Commission 
may make an initial determination that the candidate is ineligible to 
receive matching funds.
    (b) The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial 
determination, in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 
9033.10(b). The candidate may submit, within 20 calendar days after 
service of the Commission's notice, written legal or factual materials, 
in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b), demonstrating that he or she has 
not knowingly and substantially exceeded the expenditure limitations at 
11 CFR part 9035.
    (c) A final determination of the candidate's ineligibility will be 
made by the Commission in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 
CFR 9033.10(c).
    (d) A candidate who receives a final determination of ineligibility 
under 11 CFR 9033.3(c) shall be ineligible to receive matching fund 
payments under 11 CFR 9034.1.


<R05>
Sec. 9033.4  Matching payment eligibility threshold requirements.

    (a) The Commission will examine the submission made under 11 CFR 
9033.1 and 9033.2 and either--
    (1) Make a determination that the candidate has satisfied the 
minimum

[[Page 248]]

contribution threshold requirements under 11 CFR 9033.2(c); or
    (2) Make an initial determination that the candidate has failed to 
satisfy the matching payment threshold requirements. The Commission will 
notify the candidate of its initial determination in accordance with the 
procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(b). The candidate may, within 30 
calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, satisfy the 
threshold requirements or submit in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b) 
written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she has 
satisfied those requirements. A final determination by the Commission 
that the candidate has failed to satisfy threshold requirements will be 
made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).
    (b) The Commission will make its examination and determination under 
this section as soon as practicable. During the Presidential election 
year, the Commission will generally complete its review and make its 
determination within 15 business days.

[56 FR 35930, July 29, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 31881, June 16, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 9033.5  Determination of ineligibility date.

    The candidate's date of ineligibility shall be whichever date by 
operation of 11 CFR 9033.5 (a), (b), or (c) occurs first. After the 
candidate's date of ineligibility, he or she may only receive matching 
payments to the extent that he or she has net outstanding campaign 
obligations as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5.
    (a) Inactive candidate. The ineligibility date shall be the day on 
which an individual ceases to be a candidate because he or she is not 
actively conducting campaigns in more than one State in connection with 
seeking the Presidential nomination. This date shall be the earliest 
of--
    (1) The date the candidate publicly announces that he or she will 
not be actively conducting campaigns in more than one State; or
    (2) The date the candidate notifies the Commission by letter that he 
or she is not actively conducting campaigns in more than one State; or
    (3) The date which the Commission determines under 11 CFR 9033.6 to 
be the date that the candidate is not actively seeking election in more 
than one State.
    (b) Insufficient votes. The ineligibility date shall be the 30th day 
following the date of the second consecutive primary election in which 
such individual receives less than 10 percent of the number of popular 
votes cast for all candidates of the same party for the same office in 
that primary election, if the candidate permitted or authorized his or 
her name to appear on the ballot, unless the candidate certifies to the 
Commission at least 25 business days prior to the primary that he or she 
will not be an active candidate in the primary involved.
    (1) The Commission may refuse to accept the candidate's 
certification if it determines under 11 CFR 9033.7 that the candidate is 
an active candidate in the primary involved.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph, if the candidate is running in 
two primary elections in different States on the same date, the highest 
percentage of votes the candidate receives in any one State will govern. 
Separate primary elections held in more than one State on the same date 
are not deemed to be consecutive primaries. If two primary elections are 
held on the same date in the same State (e.g., a primary to select 
delegates to a national nominating convention and a primary for the 
expression of preference for the nomination of candidates for election 
to the office of President), the highest percentage of votes a candidate 
receives in either election will govern. If two or more primaries are 
held in the same State on different dates, the earliest primary will 
govern.
    (3) If the candidate certifies that he or she will not be an active 
candidate in a particular primary, and the Commission accepts the 
candidate's certification, the primary involved shall not be counted in 
determining the candidate's date of ineligibility under paragraph (b) of 
this section, regardless of the percentage of popular votes cast for the 
candidate in that primary.
    (c) End of matching payment period. The ineligibility date shall be 
the last day of the matching payment period

[[Page 249]]

for the candidate as specified in 11 CFR 9032.6.
    (d) Reestablishment of eligibility. If the Commission has determined 
that a candidate is ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5 (a) or (b), the 
candidate may reestablish eligibility to receive matching funds under 11 
CFR 9033.8.


<R05>
Sec. 9033.6  Determination of inactive candidacy.

    (a) General. The Commission may, on the basis of the factors listed 
in 11 CFR 9033.6(b) below, make a determination that a candidate is no 
longer actively seeking nomination for election in more than one State. 
Upon a final determination by the Commission that a candidate is 
inactive, that candidate will become ineligible as provided in 11 CFR 
9033.5.
    (b) Factors considered. In making its determination of inactive 
candidacy, the Commission may consider, but is not limited to 
considering, the following factors:
    (1) The frequency and type of public appearances, speeches, and 
advertisements;
    (2) Campaign activity with respect to soliciting contributions or 
making expenditures for campaign purposes;
    (3) Continued employment of campaign personnel or the use of 
volunteers;
    (4) The release of committed delegates;
    (5) The candidate urges his or her delegates to support another 
candidate while not actually releasing committed delegates;
    (6) The candidate urges supporters to support another candidate.
    (c) Initial determination. The Commission will notify the candidate 
of its initial determination in accordance with the procedures outlined 
in 11 CFR 9033.10(b) and will advise the candidate of the date on which 
active campaigning in more than one State ceased. The candidate may, 
within 15 business days after service of the Commission's notice, submit 
in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b) written legal or factual materials 
to demonstrate that he or she is actively campaigning in more than one 
State.
    (d) Final determination. A final determination of inactive candidacy 
will be made by the Commission in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(c).


<R05>
Sec. 9033.7  Determination of active candidacy.

    (a) Where a candidate certifies to the Commission under 11 CFR 
9033.5(b) that he or she will not be an active candidate in an upcoming 
primary, the Commission may, nevertheless, on the basis of factors 
listed in 11 CFR 9033.6(b), make an initial determination that the 
candidate is an active candidate in the primary involved.
    (b) The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial 
determination within 10 business days of receiving the candidate's 
certification under 11 CFR 9033.5(b) or, if the timing of the activity 
does not permit notice during the 10 day period, as soon as practicable 
following campaign activity by the candidate in the primary state. The 
Commission's initial determination will be made in accordance with the 
procedures outlined in 11 CFR 9033.10(b). Within 10 business days after 
service of the Commission's notice the candidate may submit, in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9033.10(b), written legal or factual materials to 
demonstrate that he or she is not an active candidate in the primary 
involved.
    (c) A final determination by the Commission that the candidate is 
active will be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 
9033.10(c).


<R05>
Sec. 9033.8  Reestablishment of eligibility.

    (a) Candidates found to be inactive. A candidate who has become 
ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5(a) on the basis that he or she is not 
actively campaigning in more than one State may reestablish eligibility 
for matching payments by submitting to the Commission evidence of active 
campaigning in more than one State. In determining whether the candidate 
has reestablished eligibility, the Commission will consider, but is not 
limited to considering, the factors listed in 11 CFR 9033.6(b). The day 
the Commission determines to be the day the candidate becomes active 
again will be the date on which eligibility is reestablished.

[[Page 250]]

    (b) Candidates receiving insufficient votes. A candidate determined 
to be ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5(b) by failing to obtain the 
required percentage of votes in two consecutive primaries may have his 
or her eligibility reestablished if the candidate receives at least 20 
percent of the total number of votes cast for candidates of the same 
party for the same office in a primary election held subsequent to the 
date of the election which rendered the candidate ineligible.
    (c) The Commission will make its determination under 11 CFR 9033.8 
(a) or (b) without requiring the individual to reestablish eligibility 
under 11 CFR 9033.1 and 2. A candidate whose eligibility is 
reestablished under this section may submit, for matching payment, 
contributions received during ineligibility. Any expenses incurred 
during the period of ineligibility that would have been considered 
qualified campaign expenses if the candidate had been eligible during 
that time may be defrayed with matching payments.


<R05>
Sec. 9033.9  Failure to comply with disclosure requirements or expenditure limitations.

    (a) If the Commission receives information indicating that a 
candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) has knowingly and 
substantially failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of 2 
U.S.C. 434 and 11 CFR part 104, or that a candidate has knowingly and 
substantially exceeded the expenditure limitations at 11 CFR part 9035, 
the Commission may make an initial determination to suspend payments to 
that candidate.
    (b) The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial 
determination in accordance with the procedures outlined in 11 CFR 
9033.10(b). The candidate will be given an opportunity, within 20 
calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, to comply with 
the above cited provisions or to submit in accordance with 11 CFR 
9033.10(b) written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or 
she is not in violation of those provisions.
    (c) Suspension of payments to a candidate will occur upon a final 
determination by the Commission to suspend payments. Such final 
determination will be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in 
11 CFR 9033.10(c).
    (d)(1) A candidate whose payments have been suspended for failure to 
comply with reporting requirements may become entitled to receive 
payments if he or she subsequently files the required reports and pays 
or agrees to pay any civil or criminal penalties resulting from failure 
to comply.
    (2) A candidate whose payments are suspended for exceeding the 
expenditure limitations shall not be entitled to receive further 
matching payments under 11 CFR 9034.1.


<R05>
Sec. 9033.10  Procedures for initial and final determinations.

    (a) General. The Commission will follow the procedures set forth in 
this section when making an initial or final determination based on any 
of the following reasons.
    (1) The candidate has knowingly and substantially exceeded the 
expenditure limitations of 11 CFR part 9035 prior to the candidate's 
application for certification, as provided in 11 CFR 9033.3;
    (2) The candidate has failed to satisfy the matching payment 
threshold requirements, as provided in 11 CFR 9033.4;
    (3) The candidate is no longer actively seeking nomination in more 
than one state, as provided in 11 CFR 9033.6;
    (4) The candidate is an active candidate in an upcoming primary 
despite the candidate's assertion to the contrary, as provided in 11 CFR 
9033.7;
    (5) The Commission receives information indicating that the 
candidate has knowingly and substantially failed to comply with the 
disclosure requirements or exceeded the expenditure limits, as provided 
in 11 CFR 9033.9; or
    (6) The Commission receives information indicating that substantial 
assets of the candidate's authorized committee have been undervalued or 
not included in the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign 
obligations or that the amount of outstanding campaign obligations has 
been otherwise overstated in relation to committee assets, as provided 
in 11 CFR 9034.5(g).

[[Page 251]]

    (b) Initial determination. If the Commission makes an initial 
determination that a candidate may not receive matching funds for one or 
more of the reasons indicated in 11 CFR 9033.10(a), the Commission will 
notify the candidate of its initial determination. The notification will 
give the legal and factual reasons for the determination and advise the 
candidate of the evidence on which the Commission's initial 
determination is based. The candidate will be given an opportunity to 
comply with the requirements at issue or to submit, within the time 
provided by the relevant section as referred to in 11 CFR 9033.10(a), 
written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that the candidate has 
satisfied those requirements. Such materials may be submitted by counsel 
if the candidate so desires.
    (c) Final determination. The Commission will consider any written 
legal or factual materials timely submitted by the candidate before 
making its final determination. A final determination that the candidate 
has failed to satisfy the requirements at issue will be accompanied by a 
written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement 
will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's 
determination and will summarize the results of any investigation upon 
which the determination is based.
    (d) Effect on other determinations. If the Commission makes an 
initial determination under this section, but decides to take no further 
action at that time, the Commission may use the legal and factual bases 
on which the initial determination was based in any future repayment 
determination under 11 CFR part 9038 or 9039. A determination by the 
Commission under this section may be independent of any Commission 
decision to institute an enforcement proceeding under 2 U.S.C. 437g.
    (e) Petitions for rehearing. Following a final determination under 
this section, the candidate may file a petition for rehearing in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(a).


<R05>
Sec. 9033.11  Documentation of disbursements.

    (a) Burden of proof. Each candidate shall have the burden of proving 
that disbursements made by the candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) or persons authorized to make expenditures on behalf of the 
candidate or authorized committee(s) are qualified campaign expenses as 
defined in 11 CFR 9032.9. The candidate and his or her authorized 
committee(s) shall obtain and furnish to the Commission on request any 
evidence regarding qualified campaign expenses made by the candidate, 
his or her authorized committees and agents or persons authorized to 
make expenditures on behalf of the candidate or committee(s) as provided 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Documentation required. (1) For disbursements in excess of $200 
to a payee, the candidate shall present a canceled check negotiated by 
the payee and either:
    (i) A receipted bill from the payee that states the purpose of the 
disbursement; or
    (ii) If such a receipt is not available,
    (A) One of the following documents generated by the payee: a bill, 
invoice, or voucher that states the purpose of the disbursement; or
    (B) Where the documents specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this 
section are not available, a voucher or contemporaneous memorandum from 
the candidate or the committee that states the purpose of the 
disbursement; or
    (iii) Where the supporting documentation required in paragraphs

Sec. 9034.1  Candidate entitlements.

    (a) A candidate who has been notified by the Commission under 11 CFR 
9036.1 that he or she has successfully satisfied eligibility and 
certification requirements is entitled to receive payments under 26 
U.S.C. 9037 and 11 CFR part 9037 in an amount equal to the amount of 
each matchable campaign contribution received by the candidate, except 
that a candidate who has become ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5 may not 
receive further matching payments regardless of the date of deposit of 
the underlying contributions if he or she has no net outstanding 
campaign obligations as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5. See also 26 CFR parts 
701 and 702 regarding payments by the Department of the Treasury.
    (b) If on the date of ineligibility a candidate has net outstanding 
campaign obligations as defined under 11 CFR 9034.5, that candidate may 
continue to receive matching payments for matchable contributions 
received and deposited on or before December 31 of the Presidential 
election year provided that on the date of payment there are remaining 
net outstanding campaign obligations, i.e., the sum of the contributions 
received on or after the date of ineligibility plus matching funds 
received on or after the date of ineligibility is less than the 
candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations. This entitlement will 
be equal to the lesser of:
    (1) The amount of contributions submitted for matching; or
    (2) The remaining net outstanding campaign obligations.
    (c) A candidate whose eligibility has been reestablished under 11 
CFR 9033.8 or who after suspension of payments has met the conditions 
set forth at 11 CFR 9033.9(d) is entitled to receive payments for 
matchable contributions for which payments were not received during the 
ineligibility or suspension period.
    (d) The total amount of payments to a candidate under this section 
shall not exceed 50% of the total expenditure

<R05>
Sec. 9034.2  Matchable contributions.

    (a) Contributions meeting the following requirements will be 
considered matchable campaign contributions.
    (1) The contribution shall be a gift of money made: By an 
individual; by a written instrument and for the purpose of influencing 
the result of a primary election.
    (2) Only a maximum of $250 of the aggregate amount contributed by an 
individual may be matched.
    (3) Before a contribution may be submitted for matching, it must 
actually be received by the candidate or any of the candidate's 
authorized committees and deposited in a designated campaign depository 
maintained by the candidate's authorized committee.
    (4) The written instrument used in making the contribution must be 
dated, physically received and deposited by the candidate or authorized 
committee on or after January l of the year immediately preceding the 
calendar year of the Presidential election, but no later than December 
31 following the matching payment period as defined under 11 CFR 9032.6. 
Donations received by an individual who is testing the waters pursuant 
to 11 CFR 100.7(b)(1) and 100.8(b)(1) may be matched when the individual 
becomes a candidate if such donations meet the requirements of this 
section.
    (b) For purposes of this section, the term written instrument means 
a check written on a personal, escrow or trust account representing or 
containing the contributor's personal funds; a money order; any similar 
negotiable instrument; or, for contributions by credit or debit card, a 
paper record, or an electronic record that can be reproduced on paper, 
of the transaction. For purposes of this section, the term written 
instrument also means, in the case of a contribution by a credit card or 
debit card, either a transaction slip or other writing signed by the 
cardholder, or in the case of such a contribution made over the 
Internet, an electronic record of the transaction created and 
transmitted by the cardholder, and including the name of the cardholder 
and the card number, which can be maintained electronically and 
reproduced in a written form by the recipient candidate or candidate's 
committee.
    (c) The written instrument shall be: Payable on demand; and to the 
order of, or specifically endorsed without qualification to, the 
Presidential candidate, or his or her authorized committee. The written 
instrument shall contain: The full name and signature of the 
contributor(s); the amount and date of the contribution; and the mailing 
address of the contributor(s). For purposes of this section, the term 
signature means, in the case of a contribution by a credit card or debit 
card, either an actual signature by the cardholder who is the donor on a 
transaction slip or other writing, or in the case of such a contribution 
made over the Internet, the full name and card number of the cardholder 
who is the donor, entered and transmitted by the cardholder.
    (1) In cases of a check drawn on a joint checking account, the 
contributor is considered to be the owner whose signature appears on the 
check.
    (i) To be attributed equally to other joint tenants of the account, 
the check or other accompanying written document shall contain the 
signature(s) of the joint tenant(s). If a contribution on a joint 
account is to be attributed other than equally to the joint tenants, the 
check or other written documentation shall also indicate the amount to 
be attributed to each joint tenant.
    (ii) In the case of a check for a contribution attributed to more 
than one person, where it is not apparent from the face of the check 
that each contributor is a joint tenant of the account, a written 
statement shall accompany the check stating that the contribution was 
made from each individual's personal funds in the amount so attributed 
and shall be signed by each contributor.
    (iii) In the case of a contribution reattributed to a joint tenant 
of the account, the reattribution shall comply with the requirements of 
11 CFR 110.1(k) and the documentation described in 11 CFR 110.1 (1), 
(3), (5) and (6) shall accompany the reattributed contribution.

[[Page 255]]

    (2) Contributions in the form of checks drawn on an escrow or trust 
account are matchable contributions, provided that:
    (i) The contributor has equitable ownership of the account; and
    (ii) The check is accompanied by a statement, signed by each 
contributor to whom all or a portion of the contribution is being 
attributed, together with the check number, amount and date of 
contribution. This statement shall specify that the contributor has 
equitable ownership of the account and the account represents the 
personal funds of the contributor.
    (3) Contributions in the form of checks written on partnership 
accounts or accounts of unincorporated associations or businesses are 
matchable contributions, so long as:
    (i) The check is accompanied by a statement, signed by each 
contributor to whom all or a portion of the contribution is being 
attributed, together with the check number, amount and date of 
contribution. This statement shall specify that the contribution is made 
with the contributor's personal funds and that the account on which the 
contribution is drawn is not maintained or controlled by an incorporated 
entity; and
    (ii) The aggregate amount of the contributions drawn on a 
partnership or unincorporated association or business does not exceed 
$1,000 to any one Presidential candidate seeking nomination.
    (4) Contributions in the form of money orders, cashier's checks, or 
other similar negotiable instruments are matchable contributions, 
provided that:
    (i) At the time it is initially submitted for matching, such 
instrument is signed by each contributor and is accompanied by a 
statement which specifies that the contribution was made in the form of 
a money order, cashier's check, traveler's check, or other similar 
negotiable instrument, with the contributor's personal funds;
    (ii) Such statement identifies the date and amount of the 
contribution made by money order, cashier's check, traveler's check, or 
other similar negotiable instrument, the check or serial number, and the 
name of the issuer of the negotiable instrument; and
    (iii) Such statement is signed by each contributor.
    (5) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for the 
admission to any activity that primarily confers private benefits in the 
form of entertainment to the contributor (i.e., concerts, motion 
pictures) are matchable. The promotional material and tickets for the 
event shall clearly indicate that the ticket purchase price represents a 
contribution to the Presidential candidate.
    (6) Contributions in the form of a purchase price paid for admission 
to an activity that is essentially political are matchable. An 
``essentially political'' activity is one the principal purpose of which 
is political speech or discussion, such as the traditional political 
dinner or reception.
    (7) Contributions received from a joint fundraising activity 
conducted in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.8 are matchable, provided that 
such contributions are accompanied by a copy of the joint fundraising 
agreement when they are submitted for matching.
    (8) Contributions by credit or debit card are matchable 
contributions, provided that:
    (i) The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section concerning a 
written instrument and of paragraph (c) of this section concerning a 
signature are satisfied. Contributions by credit card or debit card 
where the cardholder's name and card number are given to the recipient 
candidate or candidate's committee only orally are not matchable.
    (ii) Evidence is submitted by the committee that the contributor has 
affirmed that the contribution is from personal funds and not from funds 
otherwise prohibited by law.

<R05>
Sec. 9034.3  Non-matchable contributions.

    A contribution to a candidate other than one which meets the 
requirements of 11 CFR 9034.2 is not matchable. Contributions which are 
not matchable include, for example:
    (a) In-kind contributions of real or personal property;
    (b) A subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money, or anything 
of value;

[[Page 256]]

    (c) A contract, promise, or agreement, whether or not legally 
enforceable, such as a pledge card to make a contribution for any such 
purposes (but a gift of money by written instrument is not rendered 
unmatchable solely because the contribution was preceded by a promise or 
pledge);
    (d) Funds from a corporation, labor organization, government 
contractor, political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5 or any group 
of persons other than those under 11 CFR 9034.2(c)(3);
    (e) Contributions which are made or accepted in violation of 2 
U.S.C. 441a, 441b, 441c, 441e, 441f, or 441g;
    (f) Contributions in the form of a check drawn on the account of a 
committee, corporation, union or government contractor even though the 
funds represent personal funds earmarked by a contributing individual to 
a Presidential candidate;
    (g) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for an item 
with significant intrinsic and enduring value, such as a watch;
    (h) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for or 
other otherwise induced by a chance to participate in a raffle, lottery, 
or a similar drawing for valuable prizes;
    (i) Contributions which are made by persons without the necessary 
donative intent to make a gift or made for any purpose other than to 
influence the result of a primary election;
    (j) Contributions of currency of the United States or currency of 
any foreign country; and
    (k) Contributions redesignated for a different election or 
redesignated for a legal and accounting compliance fund pursuant to 11 
CFR 9003.3.

[56 FR 34132, July 5, 1991; 56 FR 35934, July 29, 1991, as amended at 64 
FR 32397, June 17, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 9034.4  Use of contributions and matching payments.

    (a) Qualified campaign expenses--(1) General. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all contributions received by an 
individual from the date he or she becomes a candidate and all matching 
payments received by the candidate shall be used only to defray 
qualified campaign expenses or to repay loans or otherwise restore funds 
(other than contributions which were received and expended to defray 
qualified campaign expenses), which were used to defray qualified 
campaign expenses.
    (2) Testing the waters. Even though incurred prior to the date an 
individual becomes a candidate, payments made in accordance with the 11 
CFR 100.8(b)(1) for the purpose of determining whether an individual 
should become a candidate shall be considered qualified campaign 
expenses if the individual subsequently becomes a candidate and shall 
count against that candidate's limits under 2 U.S.C. 441a(b).
    (3) Winding down costs and continuing to campaign. (i) Costs 
associated with the termination of political activity, such as the costs 
of complying with the post election requirements of the Act and other 
necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the 
campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries, and office 
supplies, shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. A candidate 
may receive and use matching funds for these purposes either after he or 
she has notified the Commission in writing of his or her withdrawal from 
the campaign for nomination or after the date of the party's nominating 
convention, if he or she has not withdrawn before the convention.
    (ii) If the candidate continues to campaign after becoming 
ineligible due to the operation of 11 CFR 9033.5(b), the candidate may 
only receive matching funds based on net outstanding campaign 
obligations as of the candidate's date of ineligibility. The statement 
of net outstanding campaign obligations shall only include costs 
incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and 
services to be received before the date of ineligibility and for which 
written arrangement or commitment was made on or before the candidate's 
date of ineligibility, and shall not include winding down costs until 
the date on which the candidate qualifies to receive winding down costs 
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. Contributions received after 
the candidate's date of ineligibility may be used to continue to 
campaign, and may be submitted for matching fund payments. The candidate 
shall be entitled

[[Page 257]]

to receive the same proportion of matching funds to defray net 
outstanding campaign obligations as the candidate received before his or 
her date of ineligibility. Payments from the matching payment account 
that are received after the candidate's date of ineligibility may be 
used to defray the candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations, but 
shall not be used to defray any costs associated with continuing to 
campaign unless the candidate reestablishes eligibility under 11 CFR 
9033.8.
    (iii) In the case of a candidate who does not receive public funding 
for the general election, for purposes of the expenditure limitations 
set forth in 11 CFR 9035.1, 100% of salary, overhead and computer 
expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility may be 
treated as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses beginning 
with the first full reporting period after the candidate's date of 
ineligibility. For candidates who continue to campaign or re-establish 
eligibility, this paragraph shall not apply to expenses incurred during 
the period between the date of ineligibility and the date on which the 
candidate either re-establishes eligibility or ceases to continue to 
campaign. For purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in 11 
CFR 9035.1, candidates who receive public funding for the general 
election must wait until the end of the expenditure report period 
described in 11 CFR 9002.12 before they may treat 100% of salary, 
overhead and computer expenses as exempt legal and accounting compliance 
expenses.
    (4) Taxes. Federal income taxes paid by the committee on non-exempt 
function income, such as interest, dividends and sale of property, shall 
be considered qualified campaign expenses. These expenses shall not, 
however, count against the state or overall expenditure limits of 11 CFR 
9035.1(a).
    (5) Gifts and monetary bonuses. Gifts and monetary bonuses shall be 
considered qualified campaign expenses, provided that:
    (i) Gifts for committee employees, consultants and volunteers in 
recognition for campaign-related activities or services do not exceed 
$150 total per individual and the total of all gifts does not exceed 
$20,000; and
    (ii) All monetary bonuses for committee employees and consultants in 
recognition for campaign-related activities or services:
    (A) Are provided for pursuant to a written contract made prior to 
the date of ineligibility; and
    (B) Are paid no later than thirty days after the date of 
ineligibility.
    (b) Non-qualified campaign expenses--(1) General. The following are 
examples of disbursements that are not qualified campaign expenses.
    (2) Excessive expenditures. An expenditure which is in excess of any 
of the limitations under 11 CFR part 9035 shall not be considered a 
qualified campaign expense. The Commission will calculate the amount of 
expenditures attributable to the limitations in accordance with 11 CFR 
9035.1(a)(2).
    (3) General election and post-ineligibility expenditures. Any 
expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility, as 
determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, are not qualified campaign expenses 
except to the extent permitted under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3). In addition, 
any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for 
goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of 
ineligibility, or for property, services, or facilities used to benefit 
the candidate's general election campaign, are not qualified campaign 
expenses.
    (4) Civil or criminal penalties. Civil or criminal penalties paid 
pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act are not qualified campaign 
expenses and cannot be defrayed from contributions or matching payments. 
Any amounts received or expended to pay such penalties shall not be 
considered contributions or expenditures but all amounts so received 
shall be subject to the prohibitions of the Act. Amounts received and 
expended under this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 
part 104.
    (5) Payments to candidate. Payments made to the candidate by his or 
her committee, other than to reimburse funds advanced by the candidate 
for qualified campaign expenses, are not qualified campaign expenses.

[[Page 258]]

    (6) Payments to other authorized committees. Payments, including 
transfers and loans, to other committees authorized by the same 
candidate for a different election are not qualified campaign expenses.
    (7) Allocable expenses. Payments for expenses subject to state 
allocation under 11 CFR 106.2 are not qualified campaign expenses if the 
records retained are not sufficient to permit allocation to any state, 
such as the failure to keep records of the date on which the expense is 
incurred.
    (8) Lost, misplaced, or stolen items. The cost of lost, misplaced, 
or stolen items may be considered a nonqualified campaign expense. 
Factors considered by the Commission in making this determination shall 
include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that 
it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; 
whether the committee sought or obtained insurance on the items; whether 
the committee filed a police report; the type of equipment involved; and 
the number and value of items that were lost.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Transfers to other campaigns--(1) Other Federal offices. If a 
candidate has received matching funds and is simultaneously seeking 
nomination or election to another Federal office, no transfer of funds 
between his or her principal campaign committees or authorized 
committees may be made. See 2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(5)(C) and 11 CFR 
110.3(c)(5) and 110.8(d). A candidate will be considered to be 
simultaneously seeking nomination or election to another Federal office 
if he or she is seeking nomination or election to such Federal office 
under 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5).
    (2) General election. If a candidate has received matching funds, 
all transfers from the candidate's primary election account to a legal 
and accounting compliance fund established for the general election must 
be made in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3(a)(1).
    (e) Attribution of expenditures between the primary and the general 
election spending limits. The following rules apply to candidates who 
receive public funding in either the primary or the general election, or 
both.
    (1) General rule. Any expenditure for goods or services that are 
used for the primary election campaign, other than those listed in 
paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(7) of this section, shall be attributed to 
the limits set forth at 11 CFR 9035.1. Any expenditure for goods or 
services that are used for the general election campaign, other than 
those listed in paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(7) of this section, shall 
be attributed to the limits set forth at 11 CFR 110.8(a)(2), as adjusted 
under 11 CFR 110.9(c).
    (2) Polling expenses. Polling expenses shall be attributed according 
to when the results of the poll are received. If the results are 
received on or before the date of the candidate's nomination, the 
expenses shall be considered primary election expenses. If results are 
received from a single poll both before and after the date of the 
candidate's nomination, the costs shall be allocated between the primary 
and the general election limits based on the percentage of results 
received during each period.
    (3) State or national campaign offices. Prior to the date of the 
last primary election in a Presidential election year, overhead and 
salary costs incurred in connection with state or national campaign 
offices shall be attributed to the primary election. With regard to 
overhead and salary costs incurred on or after June 1 of the 
Presidential election year, but before or on the date of nomination, the 
committee may attribute to the general election an amount not to exceed 
15% of the limitation on primary-election expenditures set forth at 11 
CFR 110.8(a)(1). Overhead and payroll costs associated with winding down 
the campaign and compliance activities shall be governed by paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (4) Campaign materials. Expenditures for campaign materials, 
including bumper stickers, campaign brochures, buttons, pens and similar 
items, that are purchased by the primary election campaign committee and 
later transferred to and used by the general election committee shall be 
attributed to the general election limits. Materials transferred to but 
not used by the general election committee shall be attributed to the 
primary election limits.

[[Page 259]]

    (5) Media production costs. For media communications that are 
broadcast or published both before and after the date of the candidate's 
nomination, 50% of the media production costs shall be attributed to the 
primary election limits, and 50% to the general election limits. 
Distribution costs, including such costs as air time and advertising 
space in newspapers, shall be paid for 100% by the primary or general 
election campaign depending on when the communication is broadcast or 
distributed.
    (6) Campaign Communications.
    (i) Solicitations and fundraising costs. The costs of fundraising, 
including that of events and solicitation costs, shall be attributed to 
the primary election or to the GELAC, depending on the purposes of the 
fundraising. If a candidate raises funds for both the primary election 
and for the GELAC in a single communication or through a single 
fundraising event, the allocation of fundraising costs and the 
distribution of net proceeds will be made in the same manner as 
described in 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(8)(i) and (ii).
    (ii) Other communications. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of 
this section, the costs of a campaign communication that does not 
include a solicitation shall be attributed to the primary or general 
election limits based on the date on which the communication is 
broadcast, published or mailed. The cost of a communication that is 
broadcast, published or mailed before the date of the candidate's 
nomination shall be attributed to the primary election limits.
    (7) Travel costs. Expenditures for campaign-related transportation, 
food, and lodging by any individual, including a candidate, shall be 
attributed according to when the travel occurs. If the travel occurs on 
or before the date of the candidate's nomination, the cost is a primary 
election expense. Travel to and from the convention shall be attributed 
to the primary election. Travel by a person who is working exclusively 
on general election campaign preparations shall be considered a general 
election expense even if the travel occurs before the candidate's 
nomination.

Sec. 9034.5  Net outstanding campaign obligations.

    (a) Within 15 calendar days after the candidate's date of 
ineligibility, as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, the candidate shall 
submit a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. The 
candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations under this section 
equal the difference between paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section:
    (1) The total of all outstanding obligations for qualified campaign 
expenses as of the candidate's date of ineligibility as determined under 
11 CFR 9033.5, plus estimated necessary winding down costs as defined 
under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3), less
    (2) The total of:
    (i) Cash on hand as of the close of business on the last day of 
eligibility (including all contributions dated on or before that date 
whether or not submitted for matching; currency; balances on deposit in 
banks; savings and loan institutions; and other depository institutions; 
traveler's checks; certificates of deposit; treasury bills; and any 
other committee investments valued at fair market value);
    (ii) The fair market value of capital assets and other assets on 
hand; and
    (iii) Amounts owed to the committee in the form of credits, refunds 
of deposits, returns, receivables, or rebates of qualified campaign 
expenses; or a commercially reasonable amount based on the 
collectibility of those credits, returns, receivables or rebates.
    (b) Liabilities. (1) The amount submitted as the total of 
outstanding campaign obligations under paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
shall not include any accounts payable for non-qualified campaign 
expenses nor any amounts determined or anticipated to be required as 
repayment under 11 CFR part 9038 or any amounts paid to secure a surety 
bond under 11 CFR 9038.5.
    (2) The amount submitted as estimated necessary winding down costs 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be broken down by expense 
category and quarterly or monthly time period. This breakdown shall 
include estimated costs for office space rental, staff salaries, legal 
expenses, accounting expenses, office supplies, equipment rental, 
telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing and 
storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in 
each category from the time the statement is submitted until the 
expected termination of the committee's political activity.
    (c) (1) Capital assets. For purposes of this section, the term 
capital assets means any property used in the operation of the campaign 
whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when received by the committee. 
Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section 
includes, but is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles 
and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's 
campaign, but does not include property defined as ``other assets'' 
under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Capital assets include items 
such as computer systems and telecommunications systems, if the 
equipment is used together and if the total cost of all components that 
are used together exceeds $2000. A list of all capital assets shall be 
maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d). The 
fair market value of capital assets shall be considered to be 60% of the 
total original cost of such items when acquired, except that items 
received after the date of ineligibility must be valued at their fair 
market value on the date received. A candidate may claim a lower fair 
market value for a capital asset by listing that capital asset on the 
statement separately and demonstrating, through documentation, the lower 
fair market value. If the candidate receives public funding for the 
general election, a lower fair market value shall not be claimed under 
this section for any capital assets transferred or sold to the

[[Page 261]]

candidate's general election committee.
    (2) Other assets. The term other assets means any property acquired 
by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for campaign 
loans. ``Other assets'' must be included on the candidate's statement of 
net outstanding campaign obligations if the aggregate value of such 
assets exceeds $5000. The value of ``other assets'' shall be determined 
by the fair market value of each item on the candidate's date of 
ineligibility or on the date the item is acquired if acquired after the 
date of ineligibility. A list of other assets shall be maintained by the 
committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d)(2).
    (d) Collectibility of accounts receivable. If the committee 
determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any 
credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in 
part, the committee shall demonstrate through documentation that the 
determination was commercially reasonable. The documentation shall 
include records showing the original amount of the account receivable, 
copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor 
showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how 
the lesser amount or full writeoff was determined.
    (e) Contributions received from joint fundraising activities 
conducted under 11 CFR 9034.8 may be used to pay a candidate's 
outstanding campaign obligations.
    (1) Such contributions shall be deemed monies available to pay 
outstanding campaign obligations as of the date these funds are received 
by the fundraising representative committee and shall be included in the 
candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations.
    (2) The amount of money deemed available to pay a candidate's net 
outstanding campaign obligations will equal either--
    (i) An amount calculated on the basis of the predetermined 
allocation formula, as adjusted for 2 U.S.C. 441a limitations; or
    (ii) If a candidate receives an amount greater than that calculated 
under 11 CFR 9034.5(e)(2)(i), the amount actually received.
    (f)(1) With each submission for matching fund payments filed after 
the candidate's date of ineligibility, the candidate shall certify that, 
as of the close of business on the last business day preceding the date 
of submission for matching funds, his or her remaining net outstanding 
campaign obligations equal or exceed the amount submitted for matching.
    (2) A candidate who makes a submission for matching fund payments 
after his or her date of ineligibility shall also submit a revised 
statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. This revised 
statement shall be due before the next regularly scheduled payment date, 
on a date to be determined and published by the Commission. This 
statement shall reflect the financial status of the campaign as of the 
close of business three business days before the due date of the 
statement. The revised statement shall also contain a brief explanation 
of each change in the committee's assets and obligations from the 
previous statement.
    (3) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does 
not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly scheduled 
payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, the 
candidate shall also submit a revised statement of net outstanding 
campaign obligations. The revised statement shall be filed on a date to 
be determined and published by the commission, which will be before the 
next regularly scheduled payment date.
    (g)(1) If the Commission receives information indicating that 
substantial assets of the candidate's authorized committee(s) have been 
undervalued or not included in the statement or that the amount of 
outstanding campaign obligations has been otherwise overstated in 
relation to committee assets, the Commission may decide to temporarily 
suspend further matching payments pending a final determination whether 
the candidate is entitled to receive all or a portion of the matching 
funds requested.
    (2) In making a determination under 11 CFR 9034.5(g)(1), the 
Commission will follow the procedures for initial and final 
determinations under 11 CFR

[[Page 262]]

9033.10 (b) and (c). The Commission will notify the candidate of its 
initial determination within 15 business days after receipt of the 
candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. Within 15 
business days after service of the Commission's notice, the candidate 
may submit written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or 
she has net outstanding campaign obligations that entitle the campaign 
to further matching payments.
    (3) If the candidate demonstrates that the amount of outstanding 
campaign obligations still exceeds committee assets, he or she may 
continue to receive matching payments.
    (4) Following a final determination under this section, the 
candidate may file a petition for rehearing in accordance with 11 CFR 
9038.5(a).

Sec. 9034.6  Expenditures for transportation and services made available to media personnel; reimbursements.

    (a) General. (1) Expenditures by an authorized committee for 
transportation, ground services or facilities (including air travel, 
ground transportation, housing, meals, telephone service, typewriters, 
and computers) provided to media personnel, Secret Service personnel or 
national security staff will be considered qualified campaign expenses, 
and, except for costs relating to Secret Service personnel or national 
security staff, will be subject to the overall expenditure limitations 
of 11 CFR 9035.1(a).
    (2) Subject to the limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, committees may seek reimbursement from the media for the 
expenses described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and may deduct 
reimbursements received from media representatives from the amount of 
expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation of 11 CFR 
9035.1(a). Expenses for which the committee receives no reimbursement 
will be considered qualified campaign expenses, and, with the exception 
of those expenses relating to Secret Service personnel and national 
security staff, will be subject to the overall expenditure limitation.
    (3) Committees may seek reimbursement from the media only for the 
billable items specified in the White House Press Corps Travel Policies 
and Procedures issued by the White House Travel Office.
    (b) Reimbursement limits; billing. (1) The amount of reimbursement 
sought from a media representative under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section shall not exceed 110% of the media representative's pro rata 
share (or a reasonable estimate of the media representative's pro rata 
share) of the actual cost of the transportation and services made 
available. Any reimbursement received in excess of this amount shall be 
disposed of in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a media representative's pro 
rata share shall be calculated by dividing the total actual cost of the 
transportation and services provided by the total number of individuals 
to whom such transportation and services are made available. For 
purposes of this calculation, the total number of individuals shall 
include committee staff, media personnel, Secret Service personnel, 
national security staff and any other individuals to whom such 
transportation and services are made available, except that, when 
seeking reimbursement for transportation costs paid by the committee 
under 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(5)(i)(C), the total number of individuals shall 
not include national security staff.
    (3) No later than sixty (60) days of the campaign trip or event, the 
committee shall provide each media representative attending the event 
with an itemized bill that specifies the amounts charged for air and 
ground transportation for each segment of the trip, housing, meals, 
telephone service, and other billable items specified in the White House 
Press Corps Travel Policies and Procedures issued by the White House 
Travel Office. Payments shall be due sixty (60) days from the date of 
the bill, unless the media representative disputes the charges.
    (c) Deduction of reimbursements from expenditures subject to the 
overall expenditure limitation. (1) The Committee

[[Page 263]]

may deduct from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall 
expenditure limitation:
    (i) The amount of reimbursements received from media representatives 
in payment for the transportation and services described in paragraph 
(a) of this section, up to the actual cost of the transportation and 
services provided to media representatives; and
    (ii) An additional amount of the reimbursements received from media 
representatives, representing the administrative costs incurred by the 
committee in providing these services to the media representatives and 
seeking reimbursement for them, equal to:
    (A) Three percent of the actual cost of transportation and services 
provided to the media representatives under this section; or
    (B) An amount in excess of 3% representing the administrative costs 
actually incurred by the committee in providing services to the media 
representatives, provided that the committee is able to document the 
total amount of administrative costs actually incurred.
    (2) For the purposes of this paragraph, ``administrative costs'' 
includes all costs incurred by the committee in making travel 
arrangements and seeking reimbursement, whether these services are 
performed by committee staff or by independent contractors.
    (d) Disposal of excess reimbursements. If the committee receives 
reimbursements in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of 
this section, it shall dispose of the excess amount in the following 
manner:
    (1) Any reimbursement received in excess of 110% of the actual pro 
rata cost of the transportation and services made available to a media 
representative shall be returned to the media representative.
    (2) Any amount in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph 
(c) of this section that is not required to be returned to the media 
representative under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be paid to 
the Treasury.
    (e) Reporting. The total amount paid by an authorized committee for 
the services and facilities described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, plus the administrative costs incurred by the committee in 
providing these services and facilities and seeking reimbursement for 
them, shall be reported as an expenditure in accordance with 11 CFR 
104.3(b)(2)(i). Any reimbursement received by such committee under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 
CFR 104.3(a)(3)(ix).

Sec. 9034.7  Allocation of travel expenditures.

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of 11 CFR 106.3, expenditures for 
travel relating to the campaign of a candidate seeking nomination for 
election to the office of President by any individual, including a 
candidate, shall, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section, be qualified campaign expenses and be reported by the 
candidate's authorized committee(s) as expenditures.
    (b)(1) For a trip which is entirely campaign-related, the total cost 
of the trip shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable 
expenditure.
    (2) For a trip which includes campaign-related and non-campaign 
related stops, that portion of the cost of the trip allocable to 
campaign activity shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable 
expenditure. Such portion shall be determined by calculating what the 
trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first 
campaign-related stop and from that stop through each subsequent 
campaign-related stop, back to the point of origin. If any campaign 
activity, other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that 
stop shall be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes 
soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating 
the election or defeat of the candidate. Other factors, including the 
setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an event 
and the substance of the remarks or speech made, will also be considered 
in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.
    (3) For each trip, an itinerary shall be prepared and such itinerary 
shall be made available by the committee for Commission inspection. The 
itinerary

[[Page 264]]

shall show the time of arrival and departure and the type of event held.
    (4) For trips by government conveyance or by charter, a list of all 
passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers 
are and which are not campaign-related, shall be made available for 
Commission inspection. When required to be created, a copy of the 
government's or the charter company's official manifest shall also be 
maintained and made available by the committee.
    (5)(i) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government 
airplane for campaign-related travel, the candidate's authorized 
committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal 
to:
    (A) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted first class 
commercial air fare available for the time traveled, in the case of 
travel to a city served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline 
service; or
    (B) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted coach commercial air 
fare available for the time traveled, in the case of travel to a city 
served by regularly scheduled coach airline service, but not regularly 
scheduled first class airline service; or
    (C) In the case of travel to a city not served by a regularly 
scheduled commercial airline service, the commercial charter rate for an 
airplane sufficient in size to accommodate the campaign-related 
travelers, including the candidate, plus the news media and the Secret 
Service.
    (ii) If a government airplane is flown to a campaign-related stop 
where it will pick up passengers, or from a campaign-related stop where 
it left off passengers, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay 
the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the greater of the 
amount billed or the amount required under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this 
section for one passenger.
    (iii) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government 
conveyance, other than an airplane, for campaign-related travel, the 
candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government 
entity an amount equal to the commercial rental rate for a conveyance 
sufficient in size to accommodate the campaign-related travelers, 
including the candidate, plus the news media and the Secret Service.
    (iv) If any individual, including a candidate, uses accommodations, 
including lodging and meeting rooms, during campaign-related travel, and 
the accommodations are paid for by a government entity, the candidate's 
authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an 
amount equal to the usual and normal charge for the accommodations, and 
shall maintain documentation supporting the amount paid.
    (v) For travel by airplane, the committee shall maintain 
documentation of the lowest unrestricted nondiscounted air fare 
available for the time traveled, including the airline, the flight 
number and travel service providing that fare or the charter rate, as 
appropriate. For travel by other conveyances, the committee shall 
maintain documentation of the commercial rental rate for a conveyance of 
sufficient size, including the provider of the conveyance and the size, 
model and make of the conveyance.
    (6) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family when 
accompanying the candidate on campaign-related travel may be treated as 
qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures. If the spouse 
or family members conduct campaign-related activities, their travel 
expenses will be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable 
expenditures.
    (7) If any individual, including a candidate, incurs expenses for 
campaign-related travel, other than by use of government conveyance or 
accommodations, an amount equal to that portion of the actual cost of 
the conveyance or accommodations which is allocable to all passengers, 
including the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes will be 
a qualified campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee as 
an expenditure.
    (i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger 
shall be determined by dividing the total operating cost for the charter 
by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a 
qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure shall be 
calculated in accordance with

[[Page 265]]

the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on the basis of the actual 
cost per passenger multiplied by the number of passengers traveling for 
campaign purposes.
    (ii) If the trips is by non-charter commercial transportation, the 
actual cost shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth 
at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on the basis of the commercial fare. Such actual 
cost shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.
    (8) Travel on corporate airplanes and other corporate conveyances is 
governed by 11 CFR 114.9(e).

    (B) The allocation formula to be used for distributing joint 
fundraising proceeds;
    (C) A statement informing contributors that, notwithstanding the 
stated allocation formula, they may designate their contributions for a 
particular participant or participants; and
    (D) A statement informing contributors that the allocation formula 
may change if a contributor makes a contribution which would exceed the 
amount that contributor may give to any participant.
    (ii) If one or more participants engage in the joint fundraising 
activity solely to satisfy outstanding debts, the notice shall also 
contain a statement informing contributors that the allocation formula 
may change if a participant receives sufficient funds to pay its 
outstanding debts.
    (4) Separate depository account. (i) The participants or the 
fundraising representative shall establish a separate depository account 
to be used solely for the receipt and disbursement of the joint 
fundraising proceeds. All contributions deposited into the separate 
depository account must be permissible under title 2, United States 
Code. Each political committee shall amend its Statement of Organization 
to reflect the account as an additional depository.
    (ii) The fundraising representative shall deposit all joint 
fundraising proceeds in the separate depository account within ten days 
of receipt as required by 11 CFR 103.3. The fundraising representative 
may delay distribution of the fundraising proceeds to the participants 
until all contributions are received and all expenses are paid.
    (iii) For contribution reporting and limitation purposes, the date 
of receipt of a contribution by a participating political committee is 
the date that the contribution is received by the fundraising 
representative. The fundraising representative shall report 
contributions in the reporting period in which they are received. 
Participating political committees shall report joint fundraising 
proceeds in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(9) when such funds are 
received from the fundraising representative.
    (5) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) The fundraising representative 
and participating committees shall screen all contributions received to 
insure that the prohibitions and limitations of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114 
are observed. Participating political committees shall make their 
contributor records available to the fundraising representative to 
enable the fundraising representative to carry out its duty to screen 
contributions.
    (ii) The fundraising representative shall collect and retain 
contributor information with regard to gross proceeds as required under 
11 CFR 102.8 and shall also forward such information to participating 
political committees.
    (iii) The fundraising representative shall retain the records 
required under

[[Page 267]]

11 CFR 9033.11 regarding fundraising disbursements for a period of three 
years. Commercial fundraising firms or agents shall forward such 
information to the fundraising representative.
    (6) Contribution limitations. Except to the extent that the 
contributor has previously contributed to any of the participants, a 
contributor may make a contribution to the joint fundraising effort 
which contribution represents the total amount that the contributor 
could contribute to all of the participants under the applicable limits 
of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2.
    (7) Allocation of gross proceeds. (i) The fundraising representative 
shall allocate proceeds according to the formula stated in the 
fundraising agreement. Each contribution received shall be allocated 
among the participants in accordance with the allocation formula, unless 
the circumstances described in paragraphs (c)(7) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of 
this section apply. Funds may not be distributed or reallocated so as to 
maximize the matchability of the contributions.
    (ii) If distribution according to the allocation formula 
extinguishes the debts of one or more participants or if distribution 
under the formula results in a violation of the contribution limits of 
11 CFR 110.1(b), the fundraising representative may reallocate the 
surplus funds. The fundraising representative shall not reallocate funds 
so as to allow candidates seeking to extinguish outstanding debts to 
rely on the receipt of matching funds to pay the remainder of their 
debts; rather, all funds to which a participant is entitled under the 
allocation formula shall be deemed funds available to pay the 
candidate's outstanding campaign obligations as provided in 11 CFR 
9034.5(c).
    (iii) Reallocation shall be based upon the remaining participant's 
proportionate shares under the allocation formula. If reallocation 
results in a violation of a contributor's limit under 11 CFR 110.1, the 
fundraising representative shall return to the contributor the amount of 
the contribution that exceeds the limit.
    (iv) Earmarked contributions which exceed the contributor's limit to 
the designated participant under 11 CFR part 110 may not be reallocated 
by the fundraising representative without the prior written permission 
of the contributor. A written instrument made payable to one of the 
participants shall be considered an earmarked contribution unless a 
written statement by the contributor indicates that it is intended for 
inclusion in the general proceeds of the fundraising activity.
    (8) Allocation of expenses and distribution of net proceeds. (i) If 
participating committees are not affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 
prior to the joint fundraising activity and are not committees of the 
same political party:
    (A) After gross contributions are allocated among the participants 
under 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(7), the fundraising representative shall 
calculate each participant's share of expenses based on the percentage 
of the total receipts each participant had been allocated. To calculate 
each participant's net proceeds, the fundraising representative shall 
subtract the participant's share of expenses from the amount that 
participant has been allocated from gross proceeds.
    (B) A participant may only pay expenses on behalf of another 
participant subject to the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110. See 
also 11 CFR 9034.4(b)(6).
    (C) The expenses from a series of fundraising events or activities 
shall be allocated among the participants on a per-event basis 
regardless of whether the participants change or remain the same 
throughout the series.
    (ii) If participating committees are affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 
110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity or if participants are 
party committees of the same political party, expenses need not be 
allocated among those participants. Payment of such expenses by an 
unregistered committee or organization on behalf of an affiliated 
political committee may cause the unregistered organization to become a 
political committee.
    (iii) Payment of expenses may be made from gross proceeds by the 
fundraising representative.
    (9) Reporting of receipts and disbursements--(i) Reporting receipts. 
(A) The fundraising representative shall report all funds received in 
the reporting period in which they are received. Each

[[Page 268]]

Schedule A filed by the fundraising representative under this section 
shall clearly indicate that the contributions reported on that schedule 
represent joint fundraising proceeds.
    (B) After distribution of net proceeds, each participating political 
committee shall report its share of net proceeds received as a transfer-
in from the fundraising representative. Each participating political 
committee shall also file a memo Schedule A itemizing its share of gross 
receipts as contributions from original contributors to the extent 
required under 11 CFR 104.3(a).
    (ii) Reporting disbursements. The fundraising representative shall 
report all disbursements in the reporting period in which they are made. 
Each participant shall report in a memo Schedule B his or her total 
allocated share of these disbursements in the same reporting period in 
which net proceeds are distributed and reported and include the amount 
on page 4 of Form 3-P, under ``Expenditures Subject to Limit.''

other intermediary who will in turn sell such assets to the public,

length transaction. Sales made under this subsection will not be subject 
to the limitations and prohibitions of title 2, United States Code and 
11 CFR parts 110 and 114.

<R05>
Sec. 9035.1  Campaign expenditure limitation; compliance and fundraising exemptions.

    (a) Spending limit. (1) No candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) shall knowingly incur expenditures in connection with the 
candidate's campaign for nomination, which expenditures, in the 
aggregate, exceed $10,000,000 (as adjusted under 2 U.S.C. 441a(c)), 
except that the aggregate expenditures by a candidate in any one State 
shall not exceed the greater of: 16 cents (as adjusted under 2 U.S.C. 
441a(c)) multiplied by the voting age population of the State (as 
certified under 2 U.S.C. 441a(e)); or $200,000 (as adjusted under 2 
U.S.C. 441a(c)).
    (2) The Commission will calculate the amount of expenditures 
attributable to the overall expenditure limit or to a particular state 
using the full amounts originally charged for goods and services 
rendered to the committee and not the amounts for which such obligations 
were settled and paid, unless the committee can demonstrate that the 
lower amount paid reflects a reasonable settlement of a bona fide 
dispute with the creditor.
    (b) Allocation of expenditures. Each candidate receiving or 
expecting to receive matching funds under this subchapter shall also 
allocate his or her expenditures in accordance with the provisions of 11 
CFR 106.2.
    (c) Compliance and fundraising exemptions. (1) A candidate may 
exclude from the overall expenditure limitation set forth in paragraph 
(a) of this section an amount equal to 15% of the overall expenditure 
limitation as exempt legal and accounting compliance costs under 11 CFR 
100.8(b)(15).

[[Page 269]]

    (2) A candidate may exclude from the overall expenditure limitation 
of 11 CFR 9035.1 the amount of exempt fundraising costs specified in 11 
CFR 100.8(b)(21)(iii).
    (d) Candidates not receiving matching funds. The expenditure 
limitations of 11 CFR 9035.1 shall not apply to a candidate who does not 
receive matching funds at any time during the matching payment period.

[64 FR 49364, Sept. 13, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 9035.2  Limitation on expenditures from personal or family funds.

    (a)(1) No candidate who has accepted matching funds shall knowingly 
make expenditures from his or her personal funds, or funds of his or her 
immediate family, in connection with his or her campaign for nomination 
for election to the office of President which exceed $50,000, in the 
aggregate. This section shall not operate to prohibit any member of the 
candidate's immediate family from contributing his or her personal funds 
to the candidate, subject to the limitations of 11 CFR part 110. The 
provisions of this section also shall not limit the candidate's 
liability for, nor the candidate's ability to pay, any repayments 
required under 11 CFR part 9038. If the candidate or his or her 
committee knowingly incurs expenditures in excess of the limitations of 
11 CFR 110.8(a), the Commission may seek civil penalties under 11 CFR 
part 111 in addition to any repayment determinations made on the basis 
of such excessive expenditures.
    (2) Expenditures made using a credit card for which the candidate is 
jointly or solely liable will count against the limits of this section 
to the extent that the full amount due, including any finance charge, is 
not paid by the committee within 60 days after the closing date of the 
billing statement on which the charges first appear. For purposes of 
this section, the closing date shall be the date indicated on the 
billing statement which serves as the cutoff date for determining which 
charges are included on that billing statement.
    (b) For purposes of this section, the term immediate family means a 
candidate, spouse, and any child, parent, grandparent, brother, half-
brother, sister, or half-sister of the candidate, and the spouses of 
such persons.
    (c) For purposes of this section, personal funds has the same 
meaning as specified in 11 CFR 110.10.


<R05>
Sec. 9035.3  Contributions to and expenditures by Vice Presidential candidates.

    (a) Aggregation of contributions and expenditures. For purposes of 
the limitations on contributions and expenditures of this part and part 
110, contributions to, and expenditures by, the authorized committee of 
a candidate who becomes the nominee of a political party for the office 
of Vice President of the United States shall be aggregated with 
contributions to and expenditures by the publicly funded primary 
candidate who obtains that political party's nomination for the office 
of President of the United States, provided that the contributions to or 
expenditures by the authorized committee of the Vice Presidential 
candidate were made on or after the date on which--
    (1) The Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate publicly 
indicates that the two candidates intend to run on the same ticket;
    (2) The candidate for the office of Vice President accepts an offer 
by the publicly funded primary candidate for the office of President, or 
by the Presidential candidate's agent(s), to run on the same ticket; or
    (3) The Presidential and Vice Presidential committees become 
affiliated pursuant to 11 CFR 100.5(g)(4)(i) or (ii).
    (b) Exceptions. The following expenditures, if incurred by the 
authorized committee of a candidate who subsequently becomes the nominee 
of a political party for the office of Vice President of the United 
States, will not be aggregated under paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) The cost of attendance by the candidate, the candidate's family, 
and the candidate's authorized committee's staff at a political party's 
national nominating convention, including the cost of transportation, 
lodging, and subsistence;

    (b) Format for threshold submission. (1) For each State in which the 
candidate certifies that he or she has met the requirements of the 
certifications in 11 CFR 9033.2(b), the candidate shall submit an 
alphabetical list of contributors showing:
    (i) Each contributor's full name and residential address;

diskettes, containing the information required by 11 CFR 9036.1(b)(1) in 
accordance with 11 CFR 9033.12.
    (3) The candidate shall submit a full-size photocopy of each check 
or written instrument and of supporting documentation in accordance with 
11 CFR 9034.2 for each contribution that the candidate submits to 
establish eligibility for matching funds. For purposes of the threshold 
submission, the photocopies shall be segregated alphabetically by 
contributor within each State, and shall be accompanied by and 
referenced to copies of the relevant deposit slips. In lieu of 
submitting photocopies, the candidate may submit digital images of 
checks and other materials in accordance with the procedures specified 
in 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1)(vi). Digital images of contributions do not need 
to be segregated alphabetically by contributor within each State.
    (4) The candidate shall submit bank documentation, such as bank-
validated deposit slips or unvalidated deposit slips accompanied by the 
relevant bank statements, which indicate that the contributions 
submitted were deposited into a designated campaign depository.
    (5) For each State in which the candidate certifies that he or she 
has met the requirements to establish eligibility, the candidate shall 
submit a listing, alphabetically by contributor, of all checks returned 
by the bank to date as unpaid (e.g., stop payments,

[[Page 271]]

non-sufficient funds) regardless of whether the contribution was 
submitted for matching. This listing shall be accompanied by a full-size 
photocopy of each unpaid check, and copies of the associated debit memo 
and bank statement.
    (6) For each State in which the candidate certifies that he or she 
has met the requirements to establish eligibility, the candidate shall 
submit a listing, in alphabetical order by contributor, of all 
contributions that were refunded to the contributor, regardless of 
whether the contributions were submitted for matching. For each refunded 
contribution, the listing shall state the contributor's full name and 
address, the deposit date and batch number, an indication of which 
matching fund submission the contribution was included in, if any, and 
the amount and date of the refund. The listing shall be accompanied by a 
full-sized photocopy of each refunded contributor check.
    (7) In the case of a contribution made by a credit or debit card, 
including one made over the Internet, the candidate shall provide 
sufficient documentation to the Commission to insure that each such 
contribution was made by a lawful contributor who manifested an 
intention to make the contribution to the candidate or authorized 
committee that submits it for matching fund payments. Additional 
information on the documentation required to accompany such 
contributions is found in the Commission's Guideline for Presentation in 
Good Order. See 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(9).
    (8) The candidate shall submit all contributions in accordance with

eligibility and certification requirements of 11 CFR 9033.1 and 9033.2, 
the Commission will notify the candidate in writing that the candidate 
is eligible to receive primary matching fund payments as provided in 11 
CFR part 9034.
    (2) If the Commission makes a determination of a candidate's 
eligibility under 11 CFR 9036.1(a) in a Presidential election year, the 
Commission shall certify to the Secretary, within 10 calendar days after 
the Commission has made its determination, the amount to which the 
candidate is entitled.
    (3) If the Commission makes a determination of a candidate's 
eligibility under 11 CFR 9036.1(a) in the year preceding the 
Presidential election year, the Commission will notify the candidate 
that he or she is eligible to receive matching fund payments; however, 
the Commission's determination will not result in a payment of funds to 
the candidate until after January 1 of the Presidential election year.

<R05>
Sec. 9036.2  Additional submissions for matching fund payments.

    (a) Time for submission of additional submissions. The candidate may 
submit additional submissions for payments to the Commission on dates to 
be determined and published by the Commission. On the last two 
submission dates in the year prior to the election year and on each 
submission date after the beginning of the matching payment period, the 
candidate may not make more than one additional submission, and either 
one resubmission under 11 CFR 9036.5 or one corrected submission under 
11 CFR 9036.2(c) or (d)(2), as appropriate.
    (b) Format for additional submissions. The candidate may obtain 
additional matching fund payments subsequent to the Commission's 
threshold certification and payment of primary matching funds to the 
candidate by filing an additional submission for payment. All additional 
submissions for payments filed by the candidate shall be made in 
accordance with the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for 
Presentation in Good Order.
    (1) The first submission for matching funds following the 
candidate's threshold submission shall contain all the matchable 
contributions included in the threshold submission and any additional 
contributions to be submitted for matching in that submission. This

[[Page 272]]

submission shall contain all the information required for the threshold 
submission except that:
    (i) The candidate is not required to resubmit the candidate 
agreement and certifications of 11 CFR 9033.1 and 9033.2;
    (ii) The candidate is required to submit an alphabetical list of 
contributors (either solely in magnetic media from or in both printed 
and magnetic media forms), but not segregated by State as required in 
the threshold submission;
    (iii) The candidate is required to submit a listing, alphabetical by 
contributor, of all checks returned unpaid, but not segregated by State 
as required in the threshold submission;
    (iv) The candidate is required to submit a listing, in alphabetical 
order by contributor, of all contributions refunded to the contributor 
but not segregated by State as required in the threshold submission.
    (v) The occupation and employer's name need not be disclosed on the 
contributor list for individuals whose aggregate contributions exceed 
$200 in the calendar year, but such information is subject to the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of 2 U.S.C. 432(c)(3), 
434(b)(3)(A) and 11 CFR 102.9(a)(2), 104.3(a)(4)(i); and
    (vi) The photocopies of each check or written instrument and of 
supporting documentation shall either be alphabetized and referenced to 
copies of the relevant deposit slip, but not segregated by State as 
required in the threshold submission; or such photocopies may be batched 
in deposits of 50 contributions or less and cross-referenced by deposit 
number and sequence number within each deposit on the contributor list. 
In lieu of submitting photocopies, the candidate may submit digital 
images of checks, written instruments and deposit slips as specified in 
the Computerized Magnetic Media Requirements. The candidate may also 
submit digital images of contributor redesignations, reattributions and 
supporting statements and materials needed to verify the matchability of 
contributions. The candidate shall provide the computer equipment and 
software needed to retrieve and read the digital images, if necessary, 
at no cost to the Commission, and shall include digital images of every 
contribution received and imaged on or after the date of the previous 
matching fund request. Contributions and other documentation not imaged 
shall be submitted in photocopy form. The candidate shall maintain the 
originals of all contributor redesignations, reattributions and 
supporting statements and materials that are submitted for matching as 
digital images.
    (vii) In the case of a contribution made by a credit or debit card, 
including one made over the Internet, the candidate shall provide 
sufficient documentation to the Commission to insure that each such 
contribution was made by a lawful contributor who manifested an 
intention to make the contribution to the candidate or authorized 
committee that submits it for matching fund payments. Additional 
information on the documentation required to accompany such 
contributions is found in the Commission's Guideline for Presentation in 
Good Order. See 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(9).
    (2) Following the first submission under 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1), 
candidates may request additional matching funds on dates prescribed by 
the Commission by making a full submission as required under 11 CFR 
9036.2(b)(1). The amount requested for matching may include 
contributions received up to the last business day preceding the date of 
the request.
    (c) Additional submissions submitted in non-Presidential election 
year. The candidate may submit additional contributions for review 
during the year preceding the presidential election year; however, the 
amount of each submission made during this period must exceed $50,000. 
Additional submissions filed by a candidate in a non-Presidential 
election year will not result in payment of matching funds to the 
candidate until after January 1 of the Presidential election year. If 
the projected dollar value of the nonmatchable contributions exceeds 15% 
of the amount requested, the procedures described in 11 CFR 9036.2(d)(2) 
shall apply, unless the submission was made on the last submission date 
in December of the year before the Presidential election year.

[[Page 273]]

    (d) Certification of additional payments by Commission. (1) When a 
candidate who is eligible under 11 CFR 9033.4 submits an additional 
submission for payment in the Presidential election year, and before the 
candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review the 
additional submission and will certify to the Secretary at least once a 
month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission, an 
amount to which the candidate is entitled in accordance with 11 CFR 
9034.1(b). See 11 CFR 9036.4 for Commission procedures for certification 
of additional payments.
    (2) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will 
review each additional submission and resubmission, and will certify to 
the Secretary, at least once a month on dates to be determined and 
published by the Commission, an amount to which the ineligible candidate 
is entitled in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.1(b), unless the projected 
dollar value of the nonmatchable contributions contained in the 
submission or resubmission exceeds 15% of the amount requested. In the 
latter case, the Commission will return the additional submission or 
resubmission to the candidate and request that it be corrected, unless 
the resubmission was made on the last date for resubmissions in 
September of the year following the Presidential election year. 
Corrected submissions and resubmissions will be reviewed by the 
Commission in accordance with 11 CFR 9036.4 and 9036.5. Submissions and 
resubmissions will not be considered to be corrected unless the 
projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions has been reduced to 
no more than 15% of the amount requested.

<R05>
Sec. 9036.3  Submission errors and insufficient documentation.

    Contributions which are otherwise matchable may be rejected for 
matching purposes because of submission errors or insufficient 
supporting documentation. Contributions, other than those defined in 11 
CFR 9034.3 or in the form of money orders, cashier's checks, or similar 
negotiable instruments, may become matchable if there is a proper 
resubmission in accordance with 11 CFR 9036.5 and 9036.6. Insufficient 
documentation or submission errors include but are not limited to:
    (a) Discrepancies in the written instrument, such as:
    (1) Instruments drawn on other than personal accounts of 
contributors and not signed by the contributing individual;
    (2) Signature discrepancies; and
    (3) Lack of the contributor's signature, the amount or date of the 
contribution, or the listing of the committee or candidate as payee.
    (b) Discrepancies between listed contributions and the written 
instrument or supporting documentation, such as:
    (1) The listed amount requested for matching exceeds the amount 
contained on the written instrument;
    (2) A written instrument has not been submitted to support a listed 
contribution;
    (3) The submitted written instrument cannot be associated either by 
accountholder identification or signature with the listed contributor; 
or
    (4) A discrepancy between the listed contribution and the supporting 
bank documentation or the bank documentation is omitted.
    (c) Discrepancies within or between contributor lists submitted, 
such as:
    (1) The address of the contributor is omitted or incomplete or the 
contributor's name is alphabetized incorrectly, or more than one 
contributor is listed per item;
    (2) A discrepancy in aggregation within or between submissions which 
results in a request that more than $250 be matched for that 
contributor, or a listing of a contributor more than once within the 
same submission; or
    (3) A written instrument has been previously submitted and matched 
in full or is listed twice in the same submission.
    (d) The omission of information, supporting statements, or 
documentation required by 11 CFR 9034.2.


<R05>
Sec. 9036.4  Commission review of submissions.

    (a) Non-acceptance of submission for review of matchability. (1) The 
Commission will make an initial review of each

[[Page 274]]

submission made under 11 CFR part 9036 to determine if it substantially 
meets the format requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2(b) and the 
Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. 
If the Commission determines that a submission does not substantially 
meet these requirements, it will not review the matchability of the 
contributions contained therein.
    (2) For submissions made in the year before the Presidential 
election year (other than submissions made on the last submission date 
in that year), and submissions made after the candidate's date of 
ineligibility, the Commission will stop reviewing the submission once 
the projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions exceeds 15% of 
the amount requested, as provided in 11 CFR 9036.2 (c) or (d), as 
applicable.
    (3) Under either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the 
Commission will return the submission to the candidate and request that 
it be corrected in accordance with the applicable requirements. If the 
candidate makes a corrected submission within 5 business days after the 
Commission's return of the original, the Commission will review the 
corrected submission prior to the next regularly scheduled submission 
date, and will certify to the Secretary the amount to which the 
candidate is entitled on the regularly scheduled certification date for 
the original submission. Corrected submissions made after this five-day 
period will be reviewed subsequent to the next regularly scheduled 
submission date, and the Commission will certify to the Secretary the 
amount to which the candidate is entitled on the next regularly 
scheduled certification date. Each corrected submission shall only 
contain contributions previously submitted for matching in the returned 
submission and no new or additional contributions.
    (b) Acceptance of submission for review of matchability. If the 
Commission determines that a submission made under 11 CFR part 9036 
satisfies the requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2 (b), (c) and 
(d), and the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in 
Good Order, it will review the matchability of the contributions 
contained therein. The Commission, in conducting its review, may utilize 
statistical sampling techniques. Based on the results of its review, the 
Commission may calculate a matchable amount for the submission which is 
less than the amount requested by the candidate. If the Commission 
certifies for payment to the Secretary an amount that is less than the 
amount requested by the candidate in a particular submission, or reduces 
the amount of a subsequent certification to the Secretary by adjusting a 
previous certification made under 11 CFR 9036.2(c)(1), the Commission 
will notify the candidate in writing of the following:
    (1) The amount of the difference between the amount requested and 
the amount to be certified by the Commission;
    (2) The amount of each contribution and the corresponding 
contributor's name for each contribution that the Commission has 
rejected as nonmatchable and the reason that it is not matchable; or if 
statistical sampling is used, the estimated amount of contributions by 
type and the reason for rejection;
    (3) The amount of contributions that have been determined to be 
matchable and that the Commission will certify to the Secretary for 
payment; and
    (4) A statement that the candidate may supply the Commission with 
additional documentation or other information in the resubmission of any 
rejected contribution under 11 CFR 9036.5 in order to show that a 
rejected contribution is matchable under 11 CFR 9034.2.
    (c) Adjustment of amount to be certified by Commission. (1) The 
candidate shall notify the Commission as soon as possible if the 
candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) has knowledge that 
a contribution submitted for matching does not qualify under 11 CFR 
9034.2 as a matchable contribution, such as a check returned to the 
committee for insufficient funds or a contribution that has been 
refunded, so that the Commission may properly adjust the amount to be 
certified for payment.

[[Page 275]]

    (2) After the candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate 
does not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly 
scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment 
account, prior to each subsequent payment date on which the candidate 
receives payments from any previous certification, the Commission may 
revise the amount previously certified for payment pursuant to 11 CFR 
9034.5(f). The Commission will promptly notify the Secretary and the 
candidate of any revision to the amount certified.
    (d) Commission audit of submissions. The Commission may determine, 
for the reasons stated in 11 CFR part 9039, that an audit and 
examination of contributions submitted for matching payment is 
warranted. The audit and examination shall be conducted in accordance 
with the procedures of 11 CFR part 9039.

[56 FR 34133, July 25, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 9036.5  Resubmissions.

    (a) Alternative resubmission methods. Upon receipt of the 
Commission's notice of the results of the submission review pursuant to 
11 CFR 9036.4(b), or of an inquiry pursuant to 11 CFR 9039.3 that 
results in a downward adjustment to the amount of certified matching 
funds, a candidate may choose to:
    (1) Resubmit the entire submission; or
    (2) Make a written request for the identification of the specific 
contributions that were rejected for matching, and resubmit those 
specific contributions.
    (b) Time for presentation of resubmissions. If the candidate chooses 
to resubmit any contributions under 11 CFR 9036.5(a), the contributions 
shall be resubmitted on dates to be determined and published by the 
Commission. The candidate may not make any resubmissions later than the 
first Tuesday in September of the year following the Presidential 
election year.
    (c) Format for resubmissions. All resubmissions filed by the 
candidate shall be made in accordance with the Federal Election 
Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. In making a 
presentation of resubmitted contributions, the candidate shall follow 
the format requirements as specified in 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1), except 
that:
    (1) The candidate need not provide photocopies of written 
instruments, supporting documentation and bank documentation unless it 
is necessary to supplement the original documentation.
    (2) Each resubmitted contribution shall be referenced to the 
submission in which it was first presented.
    (3) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall reflect the 
aggregate amount of contributions submitted for matching from each 
contributor as of the date of the original submission.
    (4) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall reflect the 
aggregate amount of contributions submitted for matching from each 
contributor as of the date of the resubmission.
    (5) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall only contain 
contributions previously submitted for matching and no new or additional 
contributions.
    (6) Each resubmission shall be accompanied by a statement that the 
candidate has corrected his or her contributor records (including the 
data base for those candidates maintaining their contributor list on 
computer).
    (d) Certification of resubmitted contributions. Contributions that 
the Commission determines to be matchable will be certified to the 
Secretary at least once a month on dates to be determined and published 
by the Commission. If the candidate chooses to request the specific 
contributions rejected for matching pursuant to 11 CFR 9036.5(a)(2), the 
amount certified shall equal only the matchable amount of the particular 
contribution that meets the standards on resubmission, rather than the 
amount projected as being nonmatchable based on that contribution due to 
the sampling techniques used in reviewing the original submission.
    (e) Initial determinations. If the candidate resubmits a 
contribution for matching and the Commission determines that the 
rejected contribution is still non-matchable, the Commission will notify 
the candidate in writing of its determination. The Commission will 
advise the candidate of the legal and factual reasons for its 
determination and of the evidence on which that

[[Page 276]]

determination is based. The candidate may submit written legal or 
factual materials to demonstrate that the contribution is matchable 
within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice. Such 
materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.
    (f) Final determinations. The Commission will consider any written 
legal or factual materials timely submitted by the candidate in making 
its final determination. A final determination by the Commission that a 
contribution is not matchable will be accompanied by a written statement 
of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the 
reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the 
results of any investigation upon which the determination is based.

Sec. 9036.6  Continuation of certification.

    Candidates who have received matching funds and who are eligible to 
continue to receive such funds may continue to submit additional 
submissions for payment to the Commission on dates specified in the 
Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. 
The last date for first-time submissions will be the first Monday in 
March of the year following the election. No contribution will be 
matched if it is submitted after the last submission date, regardless of 
the date the contribution was deposited.

<R05>
Sec. 9038.1  Audit.

    (a) General. (1) The Commission will conduct an audit of the 
qualified campaign expenses of every candidate and his or her authorized 
committee(s) who received Presidential primary matching funds. The audit 
may be conducted at any time after the date of the candidate's 
ineligibility.
    (2) In addition, the Commission may conduct other examinations and 
audits from time to time as it deems necessary to carry out the 
provisions of this subchapter.
    (3) Information obtained pursuant to any audit and examination 
conducted under 11 CFR 9038.1(a) (1) and (2) may be used by the 
Commission as the basis, or partial basis, for its repayment 
determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2.
    (b) Conduct of fieldwork. (1) If the candidate or the candidate's 
authorized committee does not maintain or use any computerized 
information containing the data listed in 11 CFR 9033.12, the Commission 
will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' 
notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit 
and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by 
the committee. If the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee 
maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the data 
listed in 11 CFR 9033.12, the Commission generally will request such 
information prior to commencement of audit fieldwork. Such request will 
be made in writing. The committee shall produce the computerized 
information no later than 15 calendar days after service of such 
request. Upon receipt of the computerized information requested and 
compliance with the technical specifications of 11 CFR 9033.12(b), the 
Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two 
weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the 
audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site 
provided by the committee. During or after audit fieldwork, the 
Commission may request additional or updated computerized information 
which expands the coverage dates of computerized information previously 
provided, and which may be used for purposes including, but not limited 
to, updating a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations, or 
updating the amount chargeable to a state expenditure limit. During or 
after audit fieldwork, the Commission may also request additional 
computerized information which was created by or becomes available to 
the committee and that is of assistance in the Commission's audit. The 
committee shall produce the additional or updated computerized 
information no later than 15 calendar days after service of the 
Commission's request.
    (i) Office space and records. On the date scheduled for the 
commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) shall provide Commission staff with office space and 
committee records in accordance with the candidate and committee 
agreement under 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(6).
    (ii) Availability of committee personnel. On the date scheduled for 
the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) shall have committee personnel present at the site of the 
fieldwork. Such personnel shall be familiar with the committee's records 
and operation and shall be available to Commission staff to answer 
questions and to aid in locating records.
    (iii) Failure to provide staff, records or office space. If the 
candidate or his or

[[Page 278]]

her authorized committee(s) fail to provide adequate office space, 
personnel or committee records, the Commission may seek judicial 
intervention under 2 U.S.C. 437d or 26 U.S.C. 9040(c) to enforce the 
candidate and committee agreement made under 11 CFR 9033.1(b). Before 
seeking judicial intervention, the Commission will notify the candidate 
of his or her failure to comply with the agreement and will recommend 
corrective action to bring the candidate into compliance. Upon receipt 
of the Commission's notification, the candidate will have 10 calendar 
days in which to take the corrective action indicated or to otherwise 
demonstrate to the Commission in writing that he or she is complying 
with the candidate and committee agreement.
    (iv) If, in the course of the audit process, a dispute arises over 
the documentation sought or other requirements of the candidate 
agreement, the candidate may seek review by the Commission of the issues 
raised. To seek review, the candidate shall submit a written statement, 
within 10 calendar days after the disputed Commission staff request is 
made, describing the dispute and indicating the candidate's proposed 
alternative(s).
    (v) If the candidate or his or her authorized committee fails to 
produce particular records, materials, evidence or other information 
requested by the Commission, the Commission may issue an order pursuant 
to 2 U.S.C. 437d(a)(1) or a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum pursuant to 
2 U.S.C. 437(d)(a)(3). The procedures set forth in 11 CFR 111.11 through 
111.15, as appropriate, shall apply to the production of such records, 
materials, evidence or other information as specified in the order, 
subpoena or subpoena duces tecum.
    (2) Fieldwork will include the following steps designed to keep the 
candidate and committee informed as to the progress of the audit and to 
expedite the process:
    (i) Entrance conference. At the outset of the fieldwork, Commission 
staff will hold an entrance conference, at which the candidate's 
representatives will be advised of the purpose of the audit and the 
general procedures to be followed. Future requirements of the candidate 
and his or her authorized committee, such as possible repayments to the 
United States Treasury, will also be discussed. Committee 
representatives shall provide information and records necessary to 
conduct the audit, and Commission staff will be available to answer 
committee questions.
    (ii) Review of records. During the fieldwork, Commission staff will 
review committee records and may conduct interviews of committee 
personnel. Commission staff will be available to explain aspects of the 
audit and examination as it progresses. Additional meetings between 
Commission staff and committee personnel may be held from time to time 
during the fieldwork to discuss possible audit findings and to resolve 
issues arising during the course of the audit.
    (iii) Exit conference. At the conclusion of the fieldwork, 
Commission staff will hold an exit conference to discuss with committee 
representatives the staff's preliminary findings and recommendations 
that the staff anticipates it will present to the Commission for 
approval. Commission staff will advise committee representatives at this 
conference of the committee's opportunity to respond to these 
preliminary findings; the projected timetables regarding the issuance of 
the Preliminary Audit Report, the Audit Report, and any repayment 
determination; the committee's opportunity for an administrative review 
of any repayment determination; and the procedures involved in 
Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2.
    (3) Commission staff may conduct additional fieldwork after the 
completion of the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1(b) (1) 
and (2). Factors that may necessitate such follow-up fieldwork include, 
but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) Committee responses to audit findings;
    (ii) Financial activity of the committee subsequent to the fieldwork 
conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1(b)(1);
    (iii) Committee responses to Commission repayment determinations 
made under 11 CFR 9038.2.

[[Page 279]]

    (4) The Commission will notify the candidate and his or her 
authorized committee if follow-up fieldwork is necessary. The provisions 
of 11 CFR 9038.1(b) (1) and (2) shall apply to any additional fieldwork 
conducted.
    (c) Preliminary Audit Report: Issuance by Commission and committee 
response.
    (1) Commission staff will prepare a written Preliminary Audit 
Report, which will be provided to the committee after it is approved by 
an affirmative vote of four (4) members of the Commission. The 
Preliminary Audit Report may include--
    (i) An evaluation of procedures and systems employed by the 
candidate and committee to comply with applicable provisions of the 
Federal Election Campaign Act, the Presidential Election Campaign Fund 
Act and Commission regulations;
    (ii) The accuracy of statements and reports filed with the 
Commission by the candidate and committee; and
    (iii) Preliminary calculations regarding future repayments to the 
United States Treasury.
    (2) The candidate and his or her authorized committee may submit in 
writing within 60 calendar days after receipt of the Preliminary Audit 
Report, legal and factual materials disputing or commenting on the 
proposed findings contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In 
addition, the committee shall submit any additional documentation 
requested by the Commission. Such materials may be submitted by counsel 
if the candidate so desires.
    (d) Approval and issuance of audit report. (1) Before voting on 
whether to issue and approve an audit report, the Commission will 
consider any written legal and factual materials timely submitted by the 
candidate or his or her authorized committee in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. The Commission-approved audit report may 
address issues other than those contained in the Preliminary Audit 
Report. In addition, this report will contain a repayment determination 
made by the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.2(c)(1).
    (2) The audit report may contain issues that warrant referral to the 
Office of General Counsel for possible enforcement proceedings under 2 
U.S.C. 437g and 11 CFR part 111.
    (3) Addenda to the audit report may be approved and issued by the 
Commission from time to time as circumstances warrant and as additional 
information becomes available. Such addenda may be based on follow-up 
fieldwork conducted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and/or 
information ascertained by the Commission in the normal course of 
carrying out its supervisory responsibilities. The procedures set forth 
in paragraphs (c) and (d) (1) and (2) of this section will be followed 
in preparing such addenda. The addenda will be placed on the public 
record as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Such addenda may 
also include additional repayment determination(s).
    (e) Public release of audit report. (1) The Commission will consider 
the audit report in an open session agenda document. The Commission will 
provide the candidate and the committee with copies of any agenda 
document to be considered in an open session 24 hours prior to releasing 
the agenda document to the public.
    (2) Following Commission approval of the audit report, the report 
will be forwarded to the committee and released to the public. The 
Commission will provide the candidate and committee with copies of the 
audit report approved by the Commission 24 hours before releasing the 
report to the public.
    (f)(1) Sampling. In conducting an audit of contributions pursuant to 
this section, the Commission may utilize generally accepted statistical 
sampling techniques to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value 
of related audit findings. A projection of the total amount of 
violations based on apparent violations identified in such a sample may 
become the basis, in whole or in part, of any audit finding.
    (2) A committee in responding to a sample-based finding concerning 
excessive or prohibited contributions shall respond only to the specific 
sample items used to make the projection. If the committee demonstrates 
that any apparent errors found among the sample items were not errors, 
the Commission shall make a new projection based

[[Page 280]]

on the reduced number of errors in the sample.
    (3) Within 30 days of service of the Final Audit Report, the 
committee shall submit a check to the United States Treasury for the 
total amount of any excessive or prohibited contributions not refunded, 
reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner in accordance with 11 
CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) or (3); or take any other action required by the 
Commission with respect to sample-based findings.

Sec. 9038.2  Repayments.

    (a) General. (1) A candidate who has received payments from the 
matching payment account shall pay the United States Treasury any 
amounts which the Commission determines to be repayable under this 
section. In making repayment determinations under this section, the 
Commission may utilize information obtained from audits and examinations 
conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1 and part 9039 or otherwise obtained 
by the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under this 
subchapter.
    (2) The Commission will notify the candidate of any repayment 
determinations made under this section as soon as possible, but not 
later than 3 years after the close of the matching payment period. The 
Commission's issuance of the audit report to the candidate under 11 CFR 
9038.1(d) will constitute notification for purposes of this section.
    (3) Once the candidate receives notice of the Commission's repayment 
determination under this section, the candidate should give preference 
to the repayment over all other outstanding obligations of his or her 
committee, except for any federal taxes owned by the committee.
    (4) Repayments may be made only from the following sources: personal

[[Page 281]]

funds of the candidate (without regard to the limitations of 11 CFR 
9035.2), contributions and federal funds in the committee's account(s), 
and any additional funds raised subject to the limitations and 
prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended.
    (b) Bases for repayment--(1) Payments in excess of candidate's 
entitlement. The Commission may determine that certain portions of the 
payments made to a candidate from the matching payment account were in 
excess of the aggregate amount of payments to which such candidate was 
entitled. Examples of such excessive payments include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
    (i) Payments made to the candidate after the candidate's date of 
ineligibility where it is later determined that the candidate had no net 
outstanding campaign obligations as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5;
    (ii) Payments or portions of payments made to the candidate which 
are later determined to have been excessive due to the operation of the 
Commission's expedited payment procedures as set forth in the Federal 
Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order;
    (iii) Payments or portions of payments made on the basis of matched 
contributions later determined to have been non-matchable;
    (iv) Payments or portions of payments made to the candidate which 
are later determined to have been excessive due to the candidate's 
failure to include funds received by a fundraising representative 
committee under 11 CFR 9034.8 on the candidate's statement of net 
outstanding campaign obligations under 11 CFR 9034.5; and
    (v) Payments or portions of payments made to the candidate on the 
basis of the debts reflected in the candidate's statement of net 
outstanding campaign obligations, which debts are later settled for an 
amount less than that stated in the statement of net outstanding 
campaign obligations.
    (2) Use of funds for non-qualified campaign expenses. (i) The 
Commission may determine that amount(s) of any payments made to a 
candidate from the matching payment account were used for purposes other 
than those set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A)-(C) of this section:
    (A) Defrayal of qualified campaign expenses;
    (B) Repayment of loans which were used to defray qualified campaign 
expenses; and
    (C) Restoration of funds (other than contributions which were 
received and expended to defray qualified campaign expenses) which were 
used to defray qualified campaign expenses.
    (ii) Examples of Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 
9038.2(b)(2) include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (A) Determinations that a candidate, a candidate's authorized 
committee(s) or agents have made expenditures in excess of the 
limitations set forth in 11 CFR part 9035;
    (B) Determinations that funds described in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(i) 
were expended in violation of State or Federal law;
    (C) Determinations that funds described in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(i) 
were expended for expenses resulting from a violation of State or 
Federal law, such as the payment of fines or penalties; and
    (D) Determinations that funds described in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(i) 
were expended for costs associated with continuing to campaign after the 
candidate's date of ineligibility.
    (iii) The amount of any repayment sought under this section shall 
bear the same ratio to the total amount determined to have been used for 
non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of matching funds 
certified to the candidate bears to the candidate's total deposits, as 
of 90 days after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For the purposes 
of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)--
    (A) Total deposits is defined in accordance with 11 CFR 
9038.3(c)(2); and
    (B) In seeking repayment for non-qualified campaign expenses from 
committees that have received matching fund payments after the 
candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review committee 
expenditures to determine at what point committee accounts no longer 
contain matching funds. In doing this, the Commission will review 
committee expenditures

[[Page 282]]

from the date of the last matching fund payment to which the candidate 
was entitled, using the assumption that the last payment has been 
expended on a last-in, first-out basis.
    (iv) Repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2) will include 
all non-qualified campaign expenses paid before the point when committee 
accounts no longer contain matching funds, including non-qualified 
campaign expenses listed on the candidate's statement of net outstanding 
campaign obligations that may result in a separate repayment 
determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(1).
    (v) If a candidate or a candidate's authorized committee(s) exceeds 
both the overall expenditure limitation and one or more State 
expenditure limitations, as set forth at 11 CFR 9035.1(a), the repayment 
determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(ii)(A) shall be based on only 
the larger of either the amount exceeding the State expenditure 
limitation(s) or the amount exceeding the overall expenditure 
limitation.
    (3) Failure to provide adequate documentation. The Commission may 
determine that amount(s) spent by the candidate, the candidate's 
authorized committee(s), or agents were not documented in accordance 
with 11 CFR 9033.11. The amount of any repayment sought under this 
section shall be determined by using the formula set forth in 11 CFR 
9038.2(b)(2)(iii).
    (4) Surplus; income derived from the use of surplus public funds. 
The Commission may determine that the candidate's net outstanding 
campaign obligations, as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5, reflect a surplus. 
The Commission may determine that the net income derived from an 
investment or other use of surplus public funds after the candidates's 
date of ineligibility, less Federal, State and local paid on such 
income, shall be paid to the Treasury.
    (c) Repayment determination procedures. The Commission's repayment 
determination will be made in accordance with the procedures set forth 
at paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.
    (1) Repayment determination. The Commission will provide the 
candidate with a written notice of its repayment determination(s). This 
notice will be included in the Commission's audit report prepared 
pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1(d), or inquiry report pursuant to 11 CFR 
9039.3, and will set forth the legal and factual reasons for such 
determination(s), as well as the evidence upon which any such 
determination is based. The candidate shall repay to the United States 
Treasury in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the amount 
which the Commission has determined to be repayable.
    (2) Administrative review of repayment determination. If a candidate 
disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s), he or she may 
request an administrative review of the determination(s) as set forth in 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
    (i) Submission of written materials. A candidate who disputes the 
Commission's repayment determination(s) shall submit in writing, within 
60 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, legal and 
factual materials demonstrating that no repayment, or a lesser 
repayment, is required. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if 
the candidate so desires. The candidate's failure to timely raise an 
issue in written materials presented pursuant to this paragraph will be 
deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to raise the issue at any 
future stage of proceedings including any petition for review filed 
under 26 U.S.C. 9041(a).
    (ii) Oral hearing. A candidate who submits written materials 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section may at the same time 
request in writing that the Commission provide such candidate with an 
opportunity to address the Commission in open session to demonstrate 
that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. The candidate 
should identify in this request the repayment issues he or she wants to 
address at the oral hearing. If the Commission decides by an affirmative 
vote of four (4) of its members to grant the candidate's request, it 
will inform the candidate of the date and time set for the oral hearing. 
At the date and time set by the Commission, the candidate or candidate's 
designated representative will be allotted an amount of time in which to 
make an oral presentation to the Commission based upon

[[Page 283]]

the legal and factual materials submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of 
this section. The candidate or representative will also have the 
opportunity to answer any questions from individual members of the 
Commission.
    (3) Repayment determination upon review. In deciding whether to 
revise any repayment determination(s) following an administrative review 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Commission will 
consider any submission made under paragraph (c)(2)(i) and any oral 
hearing conducted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii), and may also consider any 
new or additional information from other sources. A determination 
following an administrative review that a candidate must repay a certain 
amount will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons supporting 
the Commission's determination(s). This statement will explain the legal 
and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination(s) and 
will summarize the results of any investigation(s) upon which the 
determination(s) are based.
    (d) Repayment period. (1) Within 90 calendar days of service of the 
notice of the Commission's repayment determination(s), the candidate 
shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the 
Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the 
candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 calendar 
days in which to make repayment.
    (2) If the candidate requests an administrative review of the 
Commission's repayment determination(s) under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the time for repayment will be suspended until the Commission 
has concluded its administrative review of the repayment 
determination(s). Within 30 calendar days after service of the notice of 
the Commission's post-administrative review repayment determination(s), 
the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts 
which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by 
the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 
calendar days in which to make repayment.
    (3) Interest shall be assessed on all repayments made after the 
initial 90-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section or the 30-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section. The amount of interest due shall be the greater of:
    (i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and 
(b); or
    (ii) The amount actually earned on the funds set aside under this 
section.
    (e) Computation of time. The time periods established by this 
section shall be computed in accordance with 11 CFR 111.2.
    (f) Additional repayments. Nothing in this section will prevent the 
Commission from making additional repayment determinations on one or 
more of the bases set forth at 11 CFR 9038.2(b) after it has made a 
repayment determination on any such basis. The Commission may make 
additional repayment determinations where there exist facts not used as 
the basis for any previous determination. Any such additional repayment 
determination will be made in accordance with the provisions of this 
section.
    (g) Newly-discovered assets. If, after any repayment determination 
made under this section, a candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) receives or becomes aware of assets not previously included 
in any statement of net outstanding campaign obligations submitted 
pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.5, the candidate or his or her authorized 
committee(s) shall promptly notify the Commission of such newly-
discovered assets. Newly-discovered assets may include refunds, rebates, 
late-arriving receivables, and actual receipts for capital assets in 
excess of the value specified in any previously-submitted statement of 
net outstanding campaign obligations. Newly-discovered assets may serve 
as a basis for additional repayment determinations under 11 CFR 
9038.2(f).
    (h) Petitions for rehearing; stays pending appeal. The candidate may 
file a petition for rehearing of a repayment determination in accordance 
with 11 CFR 9038.5(a). The candidate may request a stay of a repayment 
determination in

[[Page 284]]

accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(c) pending the candidate's appeal of that 
repayment determination.

<R05>
Sec. 9038.3  Liquidation of obligations; repayment.

    (a) The candidate may retain amounts received from the matching 
payment account for a period not exceeding 6 months after the matching 
payment period to pay qualified campaign expenses incurred by the 
candidate.
    (b) After all obligations have been liquidated, the candidate shall 
so inform the Commission in writing.
    (c)(1) If on the last day of candidate eligibility the candidate's 
net outstanding campaign obligations, as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5, 
reflect a surplus, the candidate shall within 30 calendar days of the 
ineligibility date repay to the Secretary an amount which represents the 
amount of matching funds contained in the candidate's surplus. The 
amount shall be an amount equal to that portion of the surplus which 
bears the same ratio to the total surplus that the total amount received 
by the candidate from the matching payment account bears to the total 
deposits made to the candidate's accounts.
    (2) For purposes of this subsection, total deposits means all 
deposits to all candidate accounts minus transfers between accounts, 
refunds, rebates, reimbursements, checks returned for insufficient 
funds, proceeds of loans and other similar amounts.
    (3) Notwithstanding the payment of any amounts to the United States 
Treasury under this section, the Commission may make surplus repayment 
determination(s) which require repayment in accordance with 11 CFR 
9038.2.


<R05>
Sec. 9038.4  Extensions of time.

    (a) It is the policy of the Commission that extensions of time under 
11 CFR part 9038 shall not be routinely granted.
    (b) Whenever a candidate has a right or is required to take action 
within a period of time prescribed by 11 CFR part 9038 or by notice 
given thereunder, the candidate may apply in writing to the Commission 
for an extension of time in which to exercise such right or take such 
action. The candidate shall demonstrate in the application for extension 
that good cause exists for his or her request.
    (c) An application for extension of time shall be made at least 7 
calendar days prior to the expiration of the time period for which the 
extension is sought. The Commission may, upon a showing of good cause, 
grant an extension of time to a candidate who has applied for such 
extension in a timely manner. The length of time of any extension 
granted hereunder will be decided by the Commission and may be less than 
the amount of time sought by the candidate in his or her application. If 
a candidate seeks an extension of any 60-day response period under 11 
CFR part 9038, the Commission may grant no more than one extension to 
that candidate, which extension shall not exceed 15 days.
    (d) If a candidate fails to seek an extension of time, exercise a 
right or take a required action prior to the expiration of a time period 
prescribed by 11 CFR part 9038 the Commission may, on the candidate's 
showing of excusable neglect:
    (1) Permit such candidate to exercise his or her right(s), or take 
such required action(s) after the expiration of the prescribed time 
period; and
    (2) Take into consideration any information obtained in connection 
with the exercise of any such right or taking of any such action before 
making decisions or determinations under 11 CFR part 9038.

<R05>
Sec. 9038.5  Petitions for rehearing; stays of repayment determinations.

    (a) Petitions for rehearing. (1) Following the Commission's final 
determination under 11 CFR 9033.10 or 9034.5(g) or the Commission's 
repayment determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(c), the candidate may file a 
petition for rehearing setting forth the relief desired and the legal 
and factual basis in support. To be considered by the Commission, 
petitions for rehearing must:

[[Page 285]]

    (i) Be filed within 20 calendar days after service of the 
Commission's final determination or repayment determination;
    (ii) Raise new questions of law or fact that would materially alter 
the Commission's final determination or repayment determination; and
    (iii) Set forth clear and convincing grounds why such questions were 
not and could not have been presented during the original determination 
process.
    (2) If a candidate files a timely petition under this section 
challenging a Commission repayment determination, the time for repayment 
of the amount at issue will be suspended until the Commission serves 
notice on the candidate of its determination on the petition. The time 
periods for making repayment under 11 CFR 9038.2(d) shall apply to any 
amounts determined to be repayable following the Commission's 
consideration of a petition for rehearing under this section.
    (b) Effect of failure to raise issues. The candidate's failure to 
raise an argument in a timely fashion during the original determination 
process or in a petition for rehearing under this section, as 
appropriate, shall be deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to 
present such arguments in any future stage of proceedings including any 
petition for review filed under 26 U.S.C. 9041(a). An issue is not 
timely raised in a petition for rehearing if it could have been raised 
earlier in response to the Commission's original determination.
    (c) Stay of repayment determination pending appeal. (1)(i) The 
candidate may apply to the Commission for a stay of all or a portion of 
the amount determined to be repayable under this section or under 11 CFR 
9038.2 pending the candidate's appeal of that repayment determination 
pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 9041(a). The repayment amount requested to be 
stayed shall not exceed the amount at issue on appeal.
    (ii) A request for a stay shall be made in writing and shall be 
filed within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's decision 
on a petition for rehearing under paragraph (a) of this section, or, if 
no petition for rehearing is filed, within 30 calendar days after 
service of the Commission's repayment determination under 11 CFR 
9038.2(c).
    (2) The Commission's approval of a stay request will be conditioned 
upon the candidate's presentation of evidence in the stay request that 
he or she:
    (i) Has placed the entire amount at issue in a separate interest-
bearing account pending the outcome of the appeal and that withdrawals 
from the account may only be made with the joint signatures of the 
candidate or his or her agent and a Commission representative; or
    (ii) Has posted a surety bond guaranteeing payment of the entire 
amount at issue plus interest; or
    (iii) Has met the following criteria:
    (A) He or she will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a 
stay; and, if so, that
    (B) He or she has made a strong showing of the likelihood of success 
on the merits of the judicial action.
    (C) Such relief is consistent with the public interest; and
    (D) No other party interested in the proceedings would be 
substantially harmed by the stay.
    (3) In determining whether the candidate has made a strong showing 
of the likelihood of success on the merits under paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the Commission may consider whether the 
issue on appeal presents a novel or admittedly difficult legal question 
and whether the equities of the case suggest that the status quo should 
be maintained.
    (4) All stays shall require the payment of interest on the amount at 
issue. The amount of interest due shall be calculated from the date 30 
days after service of the Commission's repayment determination under 11 
CFR 9038.2(c) and shall be the greater of:
    (i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and 
(b); or
    (ii) The amount actually earned on the funds set aside under this 
section.

Sec. 9038.6  Stale-dated committee checks.

    If the committee has checks outstanding to creditors or contributors 
that have not been cashed, the committee shall notify the Commission.

[[Page 286]]

The committee shall inform the Commission of its efforts to locate the 
payees, if such efforts have been necessary, and its efforts to 
encourage the payees to cash the outstanding checks. The committee shall 
also submit a check for the total amount of such outstanding checks, 
payable to the United States Treasury.


<R05>
Sec. 9038.7  Administrative record.

    (a) The Commission's administrative record for final determinations 
under 11 CFR part 9033, sections 9034.5, 9036.5 and part 9039, and for 
repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2, consists of all documents 
or materials submitted to the Commission for its consideration in making 
those determinations. The administrative record will include the 
certification of the Commission's vote(s), the audit report that is sent 
to the committee (for repayment determinations), the statement(s) of 
reasons, and the candidate agreement. The committee may include 
documents or materials in the administrative record by submitting them 
within the time periods set forth at 11 CFR 9033.3(b), 9033.4(a)(2), 
9033.6(c), 9033.7(b), 9033.9(b), 9034.5(g)(2), 9036.5(e), 9038.1(c) and 
9038.2(c)(2), as appropriate.
    (b) The Commission's administrative record for determinations under 
11 CFR part 9033, sections 9034.5, 9036.5 and 9038.2 and part 9039 does 
not include:
    (1) Documents and materials in the files of individual Commissioners 
or employees of the Commission that do not constitute a basis for the 
Commission's decisions because they were not circulated to the 
Commission and were not referenced in documents that were circulated to 
the Commission;
    (2) Transcripts or audio tapes of Commission discussions other than 
transcripts or audio tapes of oral hearings pursuant to 11 CFR 
9038.2(c)(2), although such transcripts or tapes may be made available 
under 11 CFR parts 4 or 5; or
    (3) Documents properly subject to privileges such as an attorney-
client privilege, or items constituting attorney work product.
    (c) The administrative record identified in paragraph (a) of this 
section is the exclusive record for the Commission's determinations 
under 11 CFR part 9033, Secs. 9034.5, 9036.5 and 9038.2 and part 9039.

and in otherwise carrying out its responsibilities under this 
subchapter, the Commission may routinely consider information from the 
following sources:
    (1) Any and all materials and communications which the candidate and 
his or her authorized committee(s) submit or provide under 11 CFR part 
9036 and in response to inquiries or requests of the Commission and its 
staff;
    (2) Disclosure reports on file with the Commission; and
    (3) Other publicly available documents.

<R05>
Sec. 9039.3  Examination and audits; investigations.

    (a) General. (1) The Commission will consider information obtained 
in its continuing review under 11 CFR 9039.2 in making any 
certification, determination or finding under this subchapter. If the 
Commission decides by an affirmative vote of four of its members that 
additional information must be obtained in connection with any such 
certification, determination or finding, it will conduct a further 
inquiry. A decision to conduct an inquiry under this section may be 
based on information that is obtained under 11 CFR 9039.2, received by 
the Commission from outside sources, or otherwise ascertained by the 
Commission in carrying out its supervisory responsibilities under the 
Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act and the Federal 
Election Campaign Act.
    (2) An inquiry conducted under this section may be used to obtain 
information relevant to candidate eligibility, matchability of 
contributions and repayments to the United States Treasury. Information 
obtained during such an inquiry may be used as the basis, or partial 
basis, for Commission certifications, determinations and findings under 
11 CFR parts 9033, 9034, 9036 and 9038. Information thus obtained may 
also be the basis of, or be considered in connection with, an 
investigation under 2 U.S.C. 437g and 11 CFR part 111.
    (3) Before conducting an inquiry under this section, the Commission 
will attempt to obtain relevant information under the continuing review 
provisions of 11 CFR 9039.2. Matching payments will not be withheld 
pending the results of an inquiry under this section unless the 
Commission finds patent irregularities suggesting the possibility of 
fraud in materials submitted by, or in the activities of, the candidate 
or his or her authorized committee(s).
    (b) Procedures. (1) The Commission will notify the candidate of its 
decision to conduct an inquiry under this section. The notice will 
summarize the legal and factual basis for the Commission's decision.
    (2) The Commission's inquiry may include, but is not limited to, the 
following:
    (i) A field audit of the candidate's books and records;
    (ii) Field interviews of agents and representatives of the candidate 
and his or her authorized committee(s);
    (iii) Verification of reported contributions by contacting reported 
contributors;
    (iv) Verification of disbursement information by contacting reported 
vendors;
    (v) Written questions under order;
    (vi) Production of documents under subpoena;
    (vii) Depositions.
    (3) The provisions of 2 U.S.C. 437g and 11 CFR part 111 will not 
apply to inquiries conducted under this section except that the 
provisions of 11 CFR 111.12 through 111.15 shall apply to any orders or 
subpoenas issued by the Commission.
    (4) If, at the close of the inquiry, the Commission determines that 
no action or no further action is warranted, the Commission shall so 
notify the candidate. If the inquiry results in an adjustment to the 
amount of certified matching funds, the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 
9036.5 or 9038.1 shall be followed, as appropriate. If the inquiry 
coincides with an audit undertaken pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1, the 
information obtained in the inquiry will be utilized in making the 
repayment determination. If the inquiry results in an initial or 
additional repayment determination, the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 
9038.2, 9038.4, and 9038.5 shall be followed.
